https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-quidsi-idUSKBN1702TJ,Amazon plans layoffs at Quidsi unit after losses,,"March 29, 2017 /  6:58 PM / 4 months ago",,"(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) plans to cut 263 jobs at its money-losing parenting products unit Quidsi this summer as part of a business restructuring, it said in a notice filed with New Jersey on Wednesday. The New Jersey-based subsidiary operates Diapers.com, Soap.com and other websites. We have worked extremely hard for the past seven years to get Quidsi to be profitable and unfortunately we have not been able to do so, an Amazon spokeswoman said in a statement. Quidsi's software development team will focus on building technology for the grocery delivery service AmazonFresh, the statement said. The move underscores a shift in Amazon's focus to groceries and other areas since it closed its $500 million cash acquisition of Quidsi in 2011. Fresh food represents a large and fledgling market for online retailers, in contrast to goods such diapers that have been the subject of price wars in recent years. Consumables like soap and pet food are often priced very competitively by retailers in order to drive price perception and ultimately drive online and in-store traffic, said Guru Hariharan, chief executive of retail technology company Boomerang Commerce. While unfortunate, the shutting down of the Quidsi sites isn't completely surprising. The market appeared to welcome Amazon's attention to losses at the subsidiary, unusual for a company that has prioritized long-term investments over profit. Amazon's stock briefly hit a record high of $876.44 before closing at $874.32. Its chief executive and largest shareholder, Jeff Bezos, gained nearly $1.5 billion from the 2.1 percent stock rise. Shot at Rival? Quidsi was co-founded by Marc Lore, who sold the company during heated competition from Amazon Mom subscriptions that offered free shipping and perks on baby items. Amazon has been keen to attract subscribers, who order more goods more often, and now is estimated to have more than 50 million U.S. members in its fast-shipping club Prime. Lore went on to found e-commerce startup Jet.com, which was acquired by Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) last year in an attempt to rival Amazon online. Lore now is CEO of Wal-Mart's U.S. e-commerce division. It is likely that Prime has grown to the point where members no longer separately shop on Diapers.com or Soap.com so maintenance of separate product-specific sites makes less sense, Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter said. It is possible that they are taking a shot at Mark Lore for competition at Wal-Mart. Amazon on Tuesday announced a test phase of AmazonFresh Pickup, similar to a program offered by Wal-Mart and other grocers. Customers order online and schedule a pickup at stores.

https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gm-jobs-idUSKBN16M1SA,GM will rehire 500 Michigan workers slated for layoffs,,"March 15, 2017 /  12:58 PM / 4 months ago",,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - General Motors Co plans next year to rehire 500 Michigan assembly plant workers who are to be laid off in May, citing increased demand for larger vehicles, the company said on Wednesday. GM said last week it planned to lay off 1,100 workers in May at its Lansing Delta Township assembly plant in Michigan. The company is moving production of the GMC Acadia mid-size SUV to Spring Hill, Tennessee, from the factory, which will build just two models, the Chevrolet Traverse and Buick Enclave SUVs.  The company said that when it begins full production of the new versions of the two models in 2018, it would bring back approximately 500 jobs to give the company flexibility to meet market demand. Last year, pickups and SUVs accounted for 59.5 percent of  U.S. auto sales, up from 55.8 percent in 2015. GM also said it would add 220 jobs at a plant in Romulus, Michigan, that is building 10-speed automatic transmissions, and it would retain 180 jobs by shifting Lansing workers to a Flint assembly plant to support pickup truck production. The announcement came as U.S. President Donald Trump visited Michigan to announce his administration will review fuel efficiency standards, a move that could help automakers sell more larger models.         Trump praised recent job announcements by Ford Motor Co, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV and GM.  That's just the beginning, he said in a speech to autoworkers in Ypsilanti, Michigan, on Wednesday. I told (the auto executives) that's peanuts, that's peanuts. We're going to have a lot more. They're going to be building new plants, expanding their plants. Trump has discouraged the industry from investing in Mexico and urged foreign automakers on Wednesday to add U.S. production at a roundtable that included executives from Toyota Motor Corp, Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) and others.    GM did not credit Trump with the decision to add jobs. We haven’t fundamentally changed any of our plans, but we continue to look for ways to improve our operations and find ways to help the country, grow jobs and support economic growth, GM spokesman Pat Morrissey said. With analysts forecasting U.S. auto sales are at or near their peak, no automaker has announced plans to build a new plant despite pressure from Trump. The Detroit automaker in recent months has announced other U.S. job cuts and new investments. GM said in January it would invest another $1 billion in its U.S. factories. GM said in November it would cut about 2,000 jobs when it ended the third shift at its Lordstown, Ohio, and Lansing Grand River, Michigan, plants in January. In December, it said it planned to cancel the second shift and cut nearly 1,300 jobs from its Detroit-Hamtramck assembly plant in March.

Gildan won the rights to American Apparel's brand with an $88 million bid in a bankruptcy auction last week. It had previously indicated it would assume some of its manufacturing operations, which had made the brand synonymous with Made in the U.S.A. American Apparel spokeswoman Arielle Patrick said the company was laying off about 2,400 workers in Southern California. The company had 2,166 employees at its headquarters in Los Angeles, and 959 employees at the nearby South Gate manufacturing facility. Francisco Morales, 56, who made clothes for seven years at the Los Angeles plant, was one of the American Apparel workers to be handed his employment termination notice and his last paycheck on Monday. It's really bad what happened here, really bad, Morales said in Spanish, according to a co-worker who translated into English. He said he had three children and was worried about finding another job with the same benefits, because of his age. The company issued a WARN Act notice several months ago, letting employees know that depending on the buyer of the business, a sale could result in eventual shrinkage of some business areas, American Apparel said in an emailed statement. Last week, American Apparel reached a preliminary deal to sell its Garden Grove manufacturing site to textile manufacturer Broncs Inc, re-launching it as a knitting and dyeing facility.  The company is pleased that it was able to secure a second agreement with Broncs, which plans to save over 300 jobs when they take over the Garden Grove facility, the statement added. Gildan had already indicated it would not take on any of American Apparel's 110 stores. Without another buyer for these stores, American Apparel has started to shut them down. American Apparel filed for a second time for bankruptcy protection, known as a Chapter 11 filing, in November with about $177 million in debt after the failure of a turnaround plan. It had filed for its first Chapter 11 in October 2015 and emerged from bankruptcy early last year. Close to 90 percent of Gildan's 42,000 employees are in Caribbean and Central American countries where costs are lower, and the company does not manufacture clothes other than socks in the United States. Gildan had previously said it would take into account that American Apparel's U.S. manufacturing heritage is a component of the brand but had noted that its manufacturing plan would also consider factors like transportation and energy costs. Gildan is in the process of developing its go-forward plans for the brand, including decisions regarding manufacturing, distribution and go-to-market strategies, company spokesman Garry Bell said in an email.  He said the company would provide more details on its plan in a Feb. 23 conference call.

Boeing's machinists union, the touch labor that builds airplanes near Seattle, said about 1,575 workers had taken voluntary layoffs by the deadline in February.  Boeing's white-collar union said Boeing accepted 305 members for voluntary layoffs in January. Last year, Boeing cut about 1,200 white-collar union jobs - 850 through voluntary layoffs and 350 through involuntary reductions, said Bill Dugovich, spokesman for the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace.  Boeing has told us to expect about the same number of total layoffs in 2017 as 2016, he said.      The job reductions had been announced last year and workers had until Feb. 1 to apply.  These are all voluntary, where people planned to retire or had other plans, said Connie Kelliher, a spokeswoman for the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District 751.  Cost-Cutting Drive Boeing said it did not have a specific target number for its job reductions at the commercial airplane unit but was sticking with the broad plan of reducing jobs it outlined in December. We are reducing costs and aligning employment levels to business and market requirements, spokesman Paul Bergman  said. Employment reductions will come through a combination of attrition, leaving open positions unfilled, voluntary layoff program and in some cases, involuntary layoffs. Boeing offered the buyouts to workers last year as part of an 8 percent workforce reduction at its commercial airplane business. The unit had about 74,600 workers at the end of February.

The reductions, disclosed in an internal memo seen by Reuters, also include dozens of job categories eligible for voluntary layoffs in Washington state, southern California and South Carolina. Boeing did not indicate the number of reductions the company planned. Vice Chairman Ray Conner and Commercial Airplanes Chief Executive Officer Kevin McAllister said last month that Boeing would continue job cuts in 2017. The company slashed employment by 10,828 jobs last year. About two-thirds of those reductions were in Washington state. While we have made good progress, more changes are needed to ensure our long-term future, John Hamilton, vice president of engineering at Boeing Commercial Airplanes, wrote in the memo. We continue to operate in an environment characterized by fewer sales opportunities and tough competition. The announcement came as Boeing teamed up with a new lobbying group on Tuesday to defend $8.7 billion of tax breaks in Washington state granted to the aerospace industry in 2013. The new group opposes efforts to tie the incentives to Boeing employment. The engineering layoffs are part of a larger reduction at the company's airplane unit.  Once plans are finalized across other functions, that information will‎ be shared with employees, Boeing spokesman  Doug Alder said in an email. Each function will determine its own plan. The engineering reductions will take place in stages. Voluntary layoff invitations are being sent Jan. 13 and will take effect April 21. Notices for involuntary reductions will be sent Jan. 20, with layoffs planned for March 24.   Boeing plans two more rounds of engineering layoffs later in the year driven by our business environment and the amount of voluntary attrition, Hamilton said in the memo.

Earlier on Thursday, two of Israel's leading financial news websites carried separate reports that Teva, the world's biggest generic drug maker and Israel's largest company, planned to fire between 2,000 and 6,000 workers - or as much as 11 percent of the workforce. A Teva spokesperson had initially declined to comment on the report, but the company later put out a statement saying the figures the media gave were inaccurate. The efficiency program is an integral part of Teva's business reality. The program includes, among other things, ending unprofitable activities and consolidating functions, in addition to freezing recruitment and natural employee turnover, the company said. These processes are conducted through a continuous open dialogue with the employees. This will be the practice, including in Israel, as necessary. We would like to stress that the numbers which were published in the media are incorrect, it said. Teva (TEVA.N) employs around 57,000 people globally. It has had a rough year, though, with a series of costly acquisitions, along with delayed drug launches, sending its stock plummeting 72 percent to $32.61 the past 12 months. That forced former chief executive Erez Vigodman to step down in February, with Chairman Yitzhak Peterburg replacing him on a temporary basis. One of the websites, Calcalist, said Teva has already reduced its workforce in Israel by around 100 people as part of the efficiency plan.

JBS is among dozens of firms targeted in an investigation by the Brazilian federal police on alleged bribery of government health inspectors and politicians. The company suspended beef production at 33 of its 36 plants in Brazil last week after some of the country's biggest export markets banned imports of Brazilian meats. It will restart production this week at about two thirds of capacity. On Saturday, China, Egypt and Chile lifted the suspensions, bringing hope of an end to a crisis that wiped off about one-fifth of the value of Brazilian pork and poultry exports last week. Folha cited an unidentified JBS senior executive who said that the worst of the crisis has passed. JBS expects to resume exports to the three countries soon, though sales are likely to recover slowly. Press representatives for JBS were not immediately available to comment on the report. Common shares in JBS touched a 15-week low last Monday before recovering part of the scandal-driven losses, ending the week 2.1 percent higher. They are still down 8.7 percent since police unveiled the probe on March 17. According to the Folha report, JBS will decide in coming days whether to suspend plans to list the JBS Foods International overseas unit. A person involved in the deal told Reuters last week JBS had no intention to delay the $1 billion IPO of JBS Foods in New York, which it hopes to finalize in May or June.

They signed an agreement with Argentina's largest umbrella union after a meeting that was mediated by the federal government, which has been betting on the arrival of foreign investment to jump-start economic growth. The agreement, seen by Reuters, said the measure was meant to provide workers with job security. The first official unemployment data under center-right President Mauricio Macri showed unemployment in Argentina was 9.3 percent in the second quarter of 2016.  Macri's leftist predecessor was widely accused of manipulating data and the new government said it did not trust prior unemployment numbers. Third-quarter labor market data is expected on Friday.  Since taking office in December, Macri has been pushing market-friendly reforms after more than a decade of interventionist policy had caused investors to flee from Latin America's No. 3 economy. But investment has not arrived as fast as expected and Argentina's economy is expected to contract 1.5 percent this year. Workers have also suffered from high inflation, seen around 40 percent. Tens of thousands of protesters marched in the Argentine capital on Friday to pressure the government into increasing subsidies to the poor.

https://www.reuters.com/article/soundcloud-cash-idUSL8N1K469Q,Music streamer SoundCloud has cash until fourth quarter after layoffs,,"July 13, 2017 /  7:55 PM / 14 days ago",,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - SoundCloud, the world's biggest music-streaming service, is still struggling to find a business model - it now has enough cash to last until fourth quarter, after laying off 40 percent of its staff, a representative said on Thursday. The Berlin-based start-up is different from rivals Apple, Spotify and Amazon in that it relies more on amateur musicians, for whom it provides a rare platform, and less on major commercial artists. But like them, it has yet to turn a profit. The big music labels on which most of the services depend - themselves under pressure from the shift to digital music - strike hard bargains. And SoundCloud - which said three years ago it had an audience of 175 million, a figure it has not updated - lacks either Spotify's large base of paying subscribers or the deep pockets of Apple and Amazon that can subsidize their music services.   Last week, SoundCloud said it was firing 173 staffers and closing its London and San Francisco offices to focus on Berlin and New York. We're on our path to profitability and in control of SoundCloud's independent future, co-founder Alex Ljung wrote in a blog post. Technology website TechCrunch reported, however, that staff were told at a meeting this week that the layoffs only saved the company enough cash to hold out until the fourth quarter. A spokeswoman the SoundCloud declined to comment on the TechCrunch article in depth. She did say, SoundCloud is fully funded into the fourth quarter. We continue to be confident the changes made last week put us on our path to profitability and ensure SoundCloud’s long-term viability.  She declined to comment on funding beyond the end of the year.  The news has reignited speculation that SoundCloud will be acquired by a rival. It was targeted by Spotify last year in a bid that was later aborted. Spotify, recently valued at $13 billion, is now planning a direct listing on the New York Stock Exchange later this year or in early 2018, sources told Reuters in May. The biggest problem I see is that the financial problems will absorb much of management's time in trying to raise more money, meaning that the real problems of the business go unaddressed, independent technology analyst Richard Windsor wrote in a note. Of all the potential suitors, I think Google makes the most sense, he said, noting SoundCloud's similarity to Google's YouTube in its focus on user-generated content. Google will probably be most able to monetize what SoundCloud cannot. SoundCloud, which was launched in 2008 and has never said how many paying subscribers it has, last month launched a budget subscription package in the hope of persuading more listeners to convert from the free service. SoundCloud raised $100 million last June from a group of investors including Twitter, valuing the company at roughly $700 million, according to Re/code. In March, it raised a further $70 million in debt from Ares Capital, Kreos Capital and Davidson Technology to meet its expected 2.5 times year-on-year revenue growth in 2017, a company spokeswoman said. Co-founder Alex Ljung said in a public interview at the Tech Open Air conference in Berlin this week that the company was fundraising, although he declined to comment on a rumor it was trying to raise $250 million.

In July, it struck a $4.8 billion deal to sell its core internet businesses to Verizon Communications Inc. The number of women in Yahoo leadership roles in the United States slipped to 21 percent as of June 30, down from 23 percent the year before, the report showed.

The latest cutbacks could increase the total number of jobs shed by the Switzerland-based company to more than 500 since May, a trade union leader said. Richemont is aiming to trim between 200 and 250 additional positions from its Swiss manufacturing units under an agreement between the company and unions that runs to February 2017, the source told Reuters. The planned latest round of cuts would come on top of roughly 300 positions that Richemont eliminated in May, a move that included about 100 layoffs along with measures such as early retirements meant to keep the impact on active workers to a minimum, a spokesman for Swiss trade union Unia said. Lucas DuBuis said the labour organisation would meet with workers at Richemont facilities throughout Switzerland on Tuesday in a bid to again keep actual layoffs to a minimum. Richemont is closing 50 shops by the end of the year and trimming its Swiss workforce after more than two years of declining sales, the company said earlier this month. The maker of Cartier branded jewellery and IWC watches has also been repurchasing stock from retailers, particularly in hard-hit cities such as Hong Kong, to eliminate an excess of inventory that has languished in display cases.

The cuts revive an uncomfortable question for the remaining refineries along the U.S. and Canadian Atlantic Coast: will they all survive the current market downturn? They remain the most vulnerable, said Sarah Emerson, a managing principal at ESAI Energy LLC. The real question is who closes first and why? The  bulk of the job cuts at the Canadian refinery, about 100, will come from union ranks, according to two sources familiar with the plant's operations. The losses represent about one-third of the plant's union labor. This decision was very difficult but necessary to secure the refinery's future, the company said in a statement. We understand the impact this will have on people and their families and we have put a number of resources in place to provide support during this time. The company blamed the layoffs on weak margins and high regulatory costs, the sources said. Philadelphia Energy Solutions (PES), the largest U.S. East Coast refiner, also blamed margins and regulatory costs for layoffs and benefit cuts in September. U.S. independent refiners such as Valero Energy Corp  and Phillips 66 are on track for their worst year since the U.S. shale boom began in 2011. Even in high times, refiners along the Atlantic typically operate under slimmer margins versus the industry. Since the beginning of the century, three refineries on the U.S. East Coast have shuttered, while others, including PES, went to the verge of closure. The region's refineries were among the biggest beneficiaries of the U.S. shale boom in North Dakota, which offered them discounted crude. But the discount has vanished, along with booming profits. The operators of the Come By Chance refinery are SilverPeak Financial Partners, a group of Wall Street veterans, including Neal Shear, who helped build Morgan Stanley's oil trading division; Kaushik Amin, former chief executive officer of RBS Sempra Commodities and global head of liquid markets for Lehman Brothers; and Harsh Rameshwar from Merrill Lynch Commodities. They purchased the plant in 2014 from South Korea's national oil company. The team of former Wall Street oil traders remain in a legal dispute with BP PLC, the refinery's crude supplier The legal fight stems from, among other things, what represents the best crude diet for the plant. The BP contract expires at the end of the year.   (Reporting By Jarrett Renshaw; Editing by Bill Trott)"

https://www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-coffee-warehouses-idUSKCN11X219,"Drought drains Brazil's robusta warehouses of coffee, forces layoffs",,"September 27, 2016 /  5:20 PM / in 10 months",,"SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazil's robusta coffee industry is laying off workers who transport, process and store the commodity in warehouses that are nearly idle two years into the worst drought in eight decades, according to traders and industry executives.  Though prices have never been higher at 427 to 434 reais (US$132-$134) per bag for conilon, the variety of robusta grown in Brazil, producers expect another bad crop in 2017 as they tear up trees ruined by drought. At current prices, Brazil's 2016 robusta crop is worth $1.2 billion. Exports of conilon are down 90 percent over the past 12 months versus the previous year, the coffee exporters association Cecafe said. Despite a major recovery in arabica production in the surrounding regions due to the return of rains, the 2016 conilon crop in the main producer state, Espirito Santo, has fallen 40 percent to 5.95 million bags since peaking in 2014. Warehouses and segments of the coffee industry here are putting employees on leave and transferring some to other areas, said Luis Polese, president of coffee trade association Sindicafe. Unfortunately, less skilled workers are being let go. He could not say how many workers have been laid off. Conilon makes up about a quarter of Brazil's coffee crop but is the staple coffee consumed on the domestic market, second only in size to the United States. Brazil's exports of conilon pale in comparison to arabica shipments. However, after the robusta crop in top supplier Vietnam declined over the past year, Brazil's exports of conilon have become more important for global supply.  November robusta futures are at their highest in a year and a half. The drought was throwing all infrastructure linked to the coffee production into crisis, including transporters, exporters and roasters, officials said. We're having a hard time securing raw material to supply the local roasting industry, said Egidio Malanquini, president of the roasting industry association Sincafe. Brazil is in its worst economic recession since the 1930s. Last week, the Labor Ministry said the economy was contracting for the second straight year and had shed a net 33,953 jobs in August. Brazil's economy is expected to shrink more than 3 percent for a second straight year in 2016, with over 11 million workers officially considered unemployed. 2017 Prospects Dim Damage from the drought appears to be worsening.  Although Espirito Santo forced irrigated coffee farms to ration water early in 2016, the state capital of Vitoria began restricting water supplies in 58 neighborhoods last week for the first time in its history. Two main rivers, the Santa Maria and Jacu, are below critical levels and 20 other municipalities are in a state of emergency due to the water crisis, Eduardo Carvalhaes at trader Escritorio Carvalhaes in Santos said. Octaciano Neto, the farm secretary in Espirito Santo, said some regions have seen less than half their normal rainfall for the third year running. Polese said multinationals like Louis Dreyfus [LOUDR.UL], Olam and Volcafe are experiencing drastic declines in the flow of coffee through their warehouses versus recent years, little more than a couple of months after harvest was completed.  Olam's warehouse in Nova Venecia is running at a fraction of capacity. Volcafe, a leader in coffee, leased two warehouses in Colatina, which are moving coffee at 20 percent capacity, Polese said. Another trader in the state, who asked not to be named, said a Louis Dreyfus Company was holding 60,000 to 80,000 bags of coffee in its 250,000-bag warehouse in Nova Venecia. The company did not respond to a request for comment.  Volcafe said it continued to invest and hire in the region despite drought damage to the crop. An Olam executive in Brazil said its warehouse was running at 25 percent capacity. President of the Vitoria Coffee Exchange CCCV Jorge Luiz Nicchio said he expected some warehouses would close soon given poor prospects for next year's crop. Producers are tearing up trees that are so badly damaged they don't expect them to recover, he told Reuters.  Crop analysts INTL FCStone said last week that prospects for conilon in Espirito Santo in 2017 were extremely worrisome and expected to be worse than this year.

https://www.reuters.com/article/tech-layoffs-idUSL1N1AY1L8,As technology shifts more layoffs loom at tech companies,,"August 18, 2016 /  12:45 AM / a year ago",,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc's announcement on Wednesday that it plans to lay off 5,500 employees is unlikely to be the last round of Silicon Valley pink slips as hardware companies struggle to keep up with rapid technology shifts, analysts and recruiters said. Companies that traditionally have made most of their money selling computers, chips, servers, routers and other equipment are especially vulnerable, analysts say, as mobile applications and cloud computing become increasingly important. The Cisco layoffs come in the wake of Intel's announcement in April that it was laying off 12,000 workers. Dell Incsaid in January it had shed 10,000 jobs and is expected to make further cuts after it closes a $67 billion deal to acquire data storage company EMC Corp.  So far this year, technology companies in the United States  have shed about 63,000 jobs, according to outplacement consultancy Challenger, Gray & Christmas, Inc. The hi-tech industry is going through a serious deconstruction, said Trip Chowdhry, an analyst at Global Equities Research. There is more pain to come.  Chowdhry said he expects job cuts to rise drastically as  more companies subscribe to super cloud services from the likes of Amazon.com Inc and Microsoft Corp. These services manage hardware, software, networks and databases and eliminate the need for workers to manage various technology layers, Chowdhry said. In January, Chowdhry estimated that layoffs in the tech industry would hit 330,000 this year. On Wednesday, he said he had raised his estimate to 370,000. Some other analysts said that forecast was too bleak.  IBM Corp, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co, Oracle Corp and Dell Inc could be the next to shed workers, analysts said. The logo of Intel is seen during the annual Computex computer exhibition in Taipei, Taiwan June 1, 2016.Tyrone Siu/FilesHewlett Packard Enterprise, Dell and Oracle declined comment and IBM could not be immediately reached for comment. 'Tremors of Change' Tech incumbents are all bracing for the tremors of change. said Glenn O'Donnell, an analyst at Forrester Research. We fully expect a lot of collateral damage as this plays out - not just with Cisco. Cisco and other old-guard technology companies have been pursuing a challenging shift to software-oriented services. Margins in software services are higher than hardware because they bring recurring revenue and there are fewer people involved on the cost side, said Roger Kay, an analyst at Endpoint Technologies Associates. That could mean more job cuts. Silicon Valley job recruiters offered mixed views about the fate of hardware engineers laid off at Cisco and other tech firms. “Nobody wants to be laid off but if job elimination is going to happen, 2016 is not a bad time for it to happen,” said John Reed, Senior Executive Director of the tech recruitment firm Robert Half Technologies. Still, recruiters said, hardware engineers may need to be flexible and willing to retrain if they want to find work. Nobody wants hardware designers and engineers,” said Andy Price of executive search firm SPMB. “There was a moment in time when devices were hot and (action-camera maker) GoPro made everyone excited about devices, but a lot of those types of companies died on the vine.” Currently, he said, “hardware engineers are probably the least attractive skill set imaginable in the Valley.” Reporting by Malathi Nayak in New York and Deborah Todd in San Francisco; Editing by Eric Effron and Bernard Orr"

https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-economy-idUSL1N1BD0JE,U.S. factory activity contracts in August; layoffs remain low,,"September 1, 2016 /  12:40 PM / a year ago",,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. factory activity contracted in August for the first time in six months as new orders and production tumbled, but a low level of layoffs continued to point to a pickup in economic growth in the third quarter. While manufacturing remains constrained by the lingering effects of a strong dollar and lower oil prices, sustained labor market strength could push the Federal Reserve closer to raising interest rates later this year. Today's disappointing (manufacturing) number further weakens the case for a rate hike later this month, but we currently see no reason to change our Fed call and continue to anticipate a rate hike at the December meeting, said Harm Bandholz, chief U.S. economist at UniCredit in New York. The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its index of national factory activity fell 3.2 percentage points to a reading of 49.4 last month. That was the first contraction since February. The index remains above the 43.2 threshold that is associated with a recession. A reading below 50 indicates a contraction in manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy. The dollar's surge between June 2014 and December 2015 as well as weak global demand have crimped export growth.  A collapse in oil drilling activity following a plunge in oil prices has also squeezed manufacturing by undermining business spending, leading to weak demand for heavy machinery. In addition, a U.S. inventory correction has resulted in factories receiving fewer orders. While sentiment surveys including the ISM and several regional reports have pointed to manufacturing weakness, so-called hard data on oil drilling rigs, durable goods orders and industrial production have offered tentative signs of stability in the sector.  Manufacturing is lagging data on consumer spending and housing that have suggested the economy has regained speed after growing only 1.0 percent in first half of the year.  Last month, the ISM's new orders subindex plunged 7.8 points to a reading of 49.1. Production also slipped into contractionary territory and factory employment shrunk further. But the manufacturing employment downturn has yet to spread to other sectors of the economy.  In a separate report, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 2,000 to a seasonally adjusted 263,000 for the week ended Aug. 27.    It was the 78th consecutive week that claims remained below the 300,000 threshold, which is associated with a robust labor market. That is the longest stretch since 1970, when the labor market was much smaller.  The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 1,000 to 263,000 last week. Despite some seeming trouble in the manufacturing sector, the overall outlook for employment is positive, said Michael Gapen, chief economist at Barclays in New York.  The downbeat factory data pushed the dollar .DXY lower against a basket of currencies. U.S. stocks were generally weaker, while prices for U.S. Treasuries rose. August Payrolls The data came ahead of the release on Friday of the government's closely watched employment report for August, which economists say could determine whether the Fed raises interest rates again later this month or in December. According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 180,000 jobs in August after rising by 255,000 in July. The unemployment rate is seen falling one-tenth of a percentage point to 4.8 percent.  August's anticipated step-down in job gains would follow two straight months of payroll increases above 250,000. The U.S. central bank increased its benchmark overnight interest rate last December for the first time in nearly a decade. In a third report on Thursday, global outplacement consultancy Challenger, Gray & Christmas said employers in the United States announced plans to shed 32,188 workers from their payrolls in August, down from 45,346 in July. The computer sector dominated the job cuts last month, with  Cisco Systems (CSCO.O) announcing plans to reduce its workforce by 5,500 jobs. There were also layoffs in the energy, industrial goods and entertainment and leisure sectors. In a fourth report, the Labor Department said unit labor costs, the price of labor per single unit of output, increased at a sharper 4.3 percent rate in the second quarter as opposed to the 2.0 percent pace reported last month.  The spike was due to a change in how the data is calculated and probably will not be sustained. Unit labor costs rose 2.6 percent from a year ago.

https://www.reuters.com/article/us-fireeye-results-idUSKCN10F2HD,"FireEye plans layoffs, cuts forecasts; shares plunge",,"August 4, 2016 /  8:20 PM / a year ago",,"(Reuters) - Cyber security firm FireEye Inc said on Thursday it planned to lay off 300 to 400 of its 3,400 workers as it announced quarterly sales below its own forecast, due to a slowdown in demand for its services helping businesses respond to hacking attacks. FireEye's shares were down 16.2 percent at $14.02 in extended trading. The Milpitas, California-based company also cut its full-year sales outlook.  Chief Financial Officer Michael Berry told Reuters that the job cuts were part of a restructuring effort that will reduce annual costs by about $80 million. Chief Executive Kevin Mandia said the company is now responding more frequently to financially driven cyber criminals, who engage in crimes such as ransomware, which are relatively simple to clean up.  The size and scope have changed. The whole remediation was more complex when the company was responding to large numbers of state-sponsored hacks from China, he said.  FireEye cut its full-year revenue forecast to $716 million-$728 million from $780 million-$810 million.  The company is still targeting non-GAAP profitability by the end of 2017 and expect to generate positive free-cash flow in 2017, Berry said on a conference call.  It reported second-quarter revenue of $175 million, missing its own projection of $178 million to $185 million.  Executives blamed much of the trouble on a slowdown in its services business, including its high-profile Mandiant forensics unit that helps organizations respond to cyber attacks.  That division's revenue rose just 2 percent in the second quarter, compared to a 40 percent increase in the first quarter. Its total number of engagements rose, but average revenue from each one fell dramatically because work performed was less extensive.  Mandia said that was due to a shift away from previous years where there were large numbers of state-sponsored espionage hackers from China attacking customers in the United States.  FireEye and other cyber security firms said in June that cyber espionage attacks from China appeared to have dropped this year as the Chinese government made good on a pledge with the United States to stop supporting the digital theft of U.S. trade secrets.  The company reported lower-than-expected billings, a closely watched indicator of future business.  FireEye posted second-quarter billings of 196.4 million, below its forecast of $200 million to $215 million. It also cut its full-year billings forecast to a range of $835 million to $855 million, from its previous range of $975 million to $1.055 billion. In contrast, peer Symantec Corp reported second-quarter revenue and adjusted profit above the average analyst estimates, helped by strong enterprise demand for its security products. Up to Thursday's close, FireEye shares had fallen more than 62 percent in the last 12 months. Reporting by Alan John Koshy in Bengaluru; Editing by Bill Rigby"
https://www.reuters.com/article/tech-layoffs-idUSL1N1AZ012,RPT-As technology shifts more layoffs loom at tech companies,,"August 18, 2016 /  11:00 AM / a year ago",,"(Repeats for wider distribution) By Malathi Nayak and Deborah M. Todd NEW YORK, Aug 17 (Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc's  announcement on Wednesday that it plans to lay off 5,500 employees is unlikely to be the last round of Silicon Valley pink slips as hardware companies struggle to keep up with rapid technology shifts, analysts and recruiters said. Companies that traditionally have made most of their money selling computers, chips, servers, routers and other equipment are especially vulnerable, analysts say, as mobile applications and cloud computing become increasingly important. The Cisco layoffs come in the wake of Intel's announcement in April that it was laying off 12,000 workers. Dell Inc  said in January it had shed 10,000 jobs and is expected to make further cuts after it closes a $67 billion deal to acquire data storage company EMC Corp. So far this year, technology companies in the United States  have shed about 63,000 jobs, according to outplacement consultancy Challenger, Gray & Christmas, Inc. The hi-tech industry is going through a serious deconstruction, said Trip Chowdhry, an analyst at Global Equities Research. There is more pain to come. Chowdhry said he expects job cuts to rise drastically as  more companies subscribe to super cloud services from the likes of Amazon.com Inc and Microsoft Corp. These services manage hardware, software, networks and databases and eliminate the need for workers to manage various technology layers, Chowdhry said. In January, Chowdhry estimated that layoffs in the tech industry would hit 330,000 this year. On Wednesday, he said he had raised his estimate to 370,000. Some other analysts said that forecast was too bleak. IBM Corp, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co, Oracle Corp and Dell Inc could be the next to shed workers, analysts said. Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Dell and Oracle declined comment and IBM could not be immediately reached for comment. 'Tremors of Change' Tech incumbents are all bracing for the tremors of change. said Glenn O'Donnell, an analyst at Forrester Research. We fully expect a lot of collateral damage as this plays out - not just with Cisco. Cisco and other old-guard technology companies have been pursuing a challenging shift to software-oriented services. Margins in software services are higher than hardware because they bring recurring revenue and there are fewer people involved on the cost side, said Roger Kay, an analyst at Endpoint Technologies Associates. That could mean more job cuts. Silicon Valley job recruiters offered mixed views about the fate of hardware engineers laid off at Cisco and other tech firms. Nobody wants to be laid off but if job elimination is going to happen, 2016 is not a bad time for it to happen, said John Reed, Senior Executive Director of the tech recruitment firm Robert Half Technologies. Still, recruiters said, hardware engineers may need to be flexible and willing to retrain if they want to find work. Nobody wants hardware designers and engineers, said Andy Price of executive search firm SPMB. There was a moment in time when devices were hot and (action-camera maker) GoPro made everyone excited about devices, but a lot of those types of companies died on the vine. Currently, he said, hardware engineers are probably the least attractive skill set imaginable in the Valley.

https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy-idUSKCN10L1UK,"U.S. jobs openings increase in June, layoffs near two-year low",,"August 10, 2016 /  4:05 PM / in a year",,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job openings increased in June and layoffs dropped to their lowest in nearly two years as labor market conditions tightened further, according a government report on Wednesday. The Labor Department's monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) report also suggested a growing skill shortage, which has been highlighted by independent surveys. This report continues to point to a tight labor market. It is clear that demand for labor is not the problem and there is nothing monetary policy can do to address a mismatch between the needs of employers and the skills of job seekers, said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York. Job openings, a measure of labor demand, rose 110,000 to a seasonally adjusted 5.6 million, the JOLTS report showed. That raised the jobs openings rate one-tenth of a percentage point to 3.8 percent. The JOLTS report is one of the job market metrics on Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen's so-called dashboard. Fed officials view the labor market as being at or near full employment. Concerns about persistently low inflation and an uncertain global economic outlook have left the U.S. central bank cautious about raising interest rates in the near term. The economy created 547,000 jobs in June and July. The pace of job growth is, however, expected to slow as the economy's recovery from the 2007-2009 recession shows signs of aging. Layoffs fell to 1.6 million in June, the lowest level since September 2014, from 1.7 million in May, the JOLTS report showed. The decline pushed the layoffs rate to 1.1 percent, the lowest since November 2013. Hiring increased after three straight months of declines, suggesting employers are probably not finding qualified workers for the open positions. Hiring rose to 5.1 million from 5.0 million in May. The hiring rate climbed to 3.6 percent in June from 3.5 percent the prior month. Job openings rose across nearly all sectors of the economy, with strong gains in manufacturing and construction, pointing to some stabilization in labor demand.  The industrial sector has been hurt by the combination of a strong dollar and lower oil prices, which have weighed on manufacturing and mining activities.  Other details of the JOLTS report showed Americans content to stay in their current jobs, with the quits rate, which the Fed looks at as a measure of confidence in the jobs market, holding at 2.0 percent for a third straight month in June. With labor market turnover stable and demand rising, further gains in employment should drive a modest improvement in wage growth and better rates of household income growth, said Jesse Hurwitz, an economist at Barclays in New York.

The partial termination means the company will be required to vest at 100 percent all terminated participants, Chesapeake said Tuesday in the 401(k) plan's annual report. It was unclear how much the vesting would cost the company. Chesapeake was not immediately available for comment.  Nearly 8,000 participants in Chesapeake's 401(k) are exposed to the company's reversal of fortune. They held 35 percent of the plan’s $615 million in assets in company stock at the end of 2014. While that exposure has declined, it has been a painful unwinding as employees sells Chesapeake shares in a falling market.  The retirement plan had a total investment loss of $170.3 million in 2015, as net assets fell 23 percent to $483 million, according to the annual report. The plan's performance was hurt by heavy exposure to Chesapeake's stock, a top investment holding by participants. The stock is down 78 percent since the end of 2014 as the second-largest natural gas producer in the United States grapples with low energy prices and a heavy debt load. At the end of 2015, the Chesapeake retirement plan had $50 million, or 11 percent, of its total investments in shares of Chesapeake. The plan held $388 million in Chesapeake stock at the beginning of 2014. Participants in the plan bought $28 million in Chesapeake shares during 2015.

John Reseburg, a company spokesman, acknowledged that E.A. is reshuffling its 9,000-strong worldwide work force, but dismissed Internet reports of the layoffs. I don't think there is a factual basis for the reports, Reseburg said. He added the company is expecting its headcount to be higher at the end of 2012 compared with last year. We're growing and we're looking to hire hundreds of people for our digital, console, mobile and social games, Reseburg said. Like all game companies, we make occasional adjustments to resize our teams as projects are completed and new priorities are established. We expect that our headcount will be up at the end of the year. Citing multiple unnamed sources, the website StartupGrind reported on Sunday that the Redwood City, California-based game publisher will lay off 500 to 1,000 employees as early as this week as it struggles with poor reception for 'Star Wars: The Old Republic,' a major online title released in December. Reseburg declined to confirm the specific number of people who will leave the company as it reshuffles. The embattled game publisher's stock has shed close to 40 percent of its value since November.

China will focus on mergers and restructuring, not bankruptcies, Xiao Yaqing, the head of the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC), told a news conference. As it tries to rejuvenate its economy, China aims to reduce the number of central government-managed enterprises and launch pilot programs that will allow more private investment in state-dominated sectors. It is also trying to slash overcapacity in the labor-intensive coal and steel sectors. Reform plans have prompted fears that the country would face its fiercest unemployment pressures since the late 1990s, when about 28 million people were made redundant. The situation in the 1990s was completely different, Xiao told reporters. The foundations we have now are much stronger than before. Protecting the interests of workers is an important aspect of the next stage of reforms, and there will be more mergers and restructurings, and as few bankruptcies as possible. Sources have told Reuters that China is expecting to lay off 5 million to 6 million state workers over the next two to three years as part of efforts to curb industrial overcapacity and pollution. According to official estimates, layoffs from the coal and steel sectors alone are expected to reach 1.8 million as the country works to tackle price-sapping overcapacity and shut down so-called zombie enterprises - loss-making firms that cannot afford to continue operating but are propped up by local authorities. Xiao said 12 central government-run firms had been merged, bringing the total number of enterprises controlled by SASAC to 106. Profits at the firms fell 6.7 percent last year to 2.3 trillion yuan. Xiao said the main reason for the decline was the collapse in the prices of oil and steel.     China has about 150,000 state-owned enterprises that manage more than 100 trillion yuan ($15.40 trillion) in assets and employ more than 30 million people, according to the official Xinhua news agency.

https://www.reuters.com/article/us-fisker-idUSTRE8161BE20120207,"Fisker announces layoffs, renegotiates loan",,"February 7, 2012 /  2:36 PM / in 5 years",,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Electric car startup Fisker Automotive Inc said on Monday it has suspended work at its U.S. manufacturing plant and laid off 26 workers there while it renegotiates the terms of its $529 million loan from the U.S. Department of Energy. The company has also let go about 40 workers, mostly engineering contractors, at its Anaheim, California headquarters, a spokesman said. The company has received $193 million of the federal loan so far, it said in a statement. Most of those funds have supported the rollout of its first vehicle, a $102,000 plug-in hybrid sportscar called the Karma that was plagued with production delays and a recent recall. Fisker's Wilmington, Delaware plant, a former General Motors Co (GM.N) factory, is expected to manufacture the company's second vehicle, a sedan known as the Nina. The $336 million balance of its DOE loan is intended to fund that car, Fisker said. Fisker spokesman Roger Ormisher would not elaborate on the reasons it was seeking revised terms for its government loan, but a DOE spokesman cited delays in getting the Karma to market. Our loan guarantees have strict conditions in place to protect taxpayers. The Department only allows the loan to be disbursed as the company meets certain milestones and demonstrates results, DOE spokesman Damien LaVera said. The Department is working with Fisker to review a revised business plan and determine the best path forward so the company can meet its benchmarks, produce cars and employ workers here in America. Energy Department loans and loan guarantees have been under heightened scrutiny from lawmakers since solar panel company Solyndra filed for bankruptcy in September after receiving a $535 million government loan in 2009. Last month, Fisker ratcheted down its sales projections for 2012, saying it expected to sell about 10,000 Karmas. It had originally hoped to sell 15,000 vehicles. Fisker is still aiming to begin production of the Nina in 2013, Ormisher said, though he said the company would give an exact timeline once it restarts work at the Delaware plant. In addition to the federal loan, Fisker has raised more than $850 million from private investors including Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Advanced Equities and Qatar Investment Authority. That includes $260 million raised late last year, Fisker said. The fledgling automaker was founded in 2007 by Henrik Fisker, a onetime Aston Martin designer. The company is one of a slew of automakers betting heavily on hybrids and pure electric vehicles. Major carmakers including GM and Nissan Motor Co Ltd (7201.T) already have electric cars on the road, though the push for greener cars has also ushered in a host of venture-backed startups like Fisker and Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA.O).

You ask every worker coming off a shift change if they've heard rumors of layoffs, and they'll tell you they have, said Herbert Claros, vice president of the Metalworkers Union of Sao Jose dos Campos, in a telephone interview. We just want Embraer to clear the air. Claros said concerns began a month ago with talk of a management shakeup to be followed by wider layoffs. Anticipation mounted last week when two top executives left the company. A human resources executive denied the rumors last week, Claros said, but the union has sent the company a letter asking for a public statement from management. An Embraer press officer told Reuters there is no substance to the talk of mass layoffs. Factory workers across Brazil are on edge as flagging industrial output has failed to keep pace with rising wages. While unemployment remains near record lows, some economists have expressed fears that layoffs may be around the corner if slipping productivity keeps eroding the foundations of Brazil's labor market. Embraer, the world's largest maker of regional jets, has also felt the drag of the global economic crisis. Cancelled orders for private jets and slower demand for regional jets eroded Embraer's order backlog to $14.7 billion in March, the lowest since 2006, representing less than three years of revenue. The slowing orders led some analysts to suggest Embraer could throttle back production. Chief Executive Frederico Curado said in an interview with Reuters last week that regional jet orders should rebound from a weak first quarter. He said the company is counting on a recovery in the United States to offset a declining market in Europe and keep Embraer's backlog stable this year.  	   Claros said union members have heard talk of layoffs on the scale of 1,000 to 1,300 workers, well short of the 4,273 workers cut in February 2009, at the height of the global credit crisis."

Industrial goods manufacturers saw the biggest layoffs, cutting 22,162 employees, the largest total for the sector since January 2009. Heavy job cuts in the industrial goods sector are never a good thing, as they can be indicative of widening cracks in the economy's foundation, said John A. Challenger, chief executive officer of Challenger, Gray & Christmas. However, the August surge in industrial goods job cuts was driven largely by falling global demand for mining equipment, he said. The computer sector came in second, letting 4,663 workers go.

The company had planned to invest about one billion euros in re-vamping the ageing factory. But Fiat's future investments have been put on hold until it gets a clearer idea of the impact of a court ruling that a portion of Italy's labour rules are unconstitutional, the company said in July.

Some 73 percent of those surveyed said the public perception of government workers is a top concern, more those who listed staff retention, healthcare costs and workload sizes. When revenue collapsed during the recession, state and local governments slashed spending, often laying off workers and freezing job openings. Even though the downturn officially ended in 2009, revenue is only now inching higher in some places. The pace of public job cuts is slowing, with 28 percent of those surveyed reporting layoffs this year compared to 40 percent last year. But more than a fifth - 22 percent - said employees had accelerated their retirements.

The bankruptcy of Twinkies maker Hostess in November accounted for 18,500 of the jobs lost. The computer industry, which has led layoffs for the year, cut 3,313 jobs last month.

General Dynamics issued notices to the workers under the federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining (WARN) Act, notifying them that the expected layoffs will kick in from March through April, said company spokesman Peter Keating. The company already laid off 98 people at the facility last year. The latest layoff notices will reduce the number of General Dynamics workers to around 260 from just over 400 now, Keating said. He said additional layoffs may be announced later, depending on the level of work to be done at the facility. Many of the workers are represented by the United Steelworkers of America union. General Dynamics says it could have staved off those layoffs if the Army had placed additional orders valued at around $170 million to retrofit existing Stryker vehicles with a tougher hull designed to survive roadside bombs, but those orders did not come through in time. The Army and other military services are unsure about future budget levels given mounting pressures on the overall defense budget, and the failure so far of lawmakers to avert $500 billion in additional spending reductions due to kick in on March 1. Over 300 workers at the General Dynamics plant wrote to Alabama lawmakers in December, urging them to continue their efforts to avoid what they called unnecessary layoffs, especially since Army officials have already said that more double V-hulled Strykers will likely be needed in the future. The Army has a total of 3,300 Strykers, including about 600 built with the double-V hulls, and nearly 50 that were retrofitted with the stronger hulls. General Dynamics says it can exchange the hulls on the wheeled military vehicles for about half the cost of building new ones. It says the new hulls protect soldiers about as well as Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles built specifically to reduce injuries and deaths caused by roadside bombs. It has urged the Army to place orders for additional upgrades now, arguing that interrupting production and restarting it later will be more expensive and will trigger layoffs at its own facility and those of key suppliers. Some of those workers could be rehired later, depending on when additional orders are placed. Senator Richard Shelby, an Alabama Republican and member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, warned the chief of staff of the Army, General Raymond Odierno, in a letter in December that delays in placing orders for a third brigade of Strykers with the double-v hull could jeopardize good jobs at the plant and would put U.S. soldiers' lives at risk. In the letter, Shelby said Army officials had told him they planned to buy a third brigade of the upgraded vehicles, which he said offered an exponential increase in soldier safety, but could not give him a timeline for signing a contract with General Dynamics and starting production. I ask that you personally engage on this issue to ensure our bureaucracy does not unnecessarily limit the rapid production and fielding of this needed capability, he wrote. No comment was immediately available from the Army. Of the 406 General Dynamics workers now at the plant, about 350 currently work on the Stryker program, a company spokesman said. If no contract is signed with the Army for additional hull exchanges the total number of workers is likely to be reduced to around 159, the spokesman said.

President Francois Hollande rode to power in a presidential runoff last month on a promise to tackle soaring unemployment, which has reached the highest level in nearly 13 years. With the economy stalling, Labor Minister Michel Sapin said urgent measures were needed against unemployment and that he aimed to put forward legislation after the summer break. The main idea is to make layoffs so expensive for companies that it's not worth it, Sapin said in an interview with France Info radio. It's not a question of sanctions, but workers have to have compensation at the right level, he said. The push to make firing more difficult in France, where making layoffs is already tightly regulated and often costly for employers, contrasts with moves under way in other euro zone countries such as Italy and Spain to make job cuts easier. Sapin, a former finance minister and long-time friend of Hollande, said the government could not stand by idly as some companies cut workers just to improve profitability and boost their dividends to shareholders. Industry Minister Arnaud Montebourg is also planning legislation that would force companies to sell plants they want to get rid off at market prices to avoid closures and job losses. The government and unions are bracing for a wave of layoffs after a June 10 and 17 legislative election, fearing companies have put off job cuts until after the election period. Data from the INSEE statistics institute showed on Thursday that France's jobless rate hit the psychologically important threshold of 10 percent in the first quarter of the year. Unemployment in France has now risen even higher than in the wake of the 2008-2009 financial crisis, rising from 9.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2011 to the highest level since the third quarter of 1999. The rate for mainland France rose to 9.6 percent from 9.3 percent in the final three months of 2011 also to hit its highest level since the third quarter of 1999.

The trimming is part of a plan announced last year by Switzerland's second largest bank company to cut about 3,500 jobs worldwide and eliminate $2.1 billion of annual costs by the end of 2013.

Credit Suisse employed about 11,700 in the United States, Canada and other parts of the Americas as of year-end 2011. Like other investment banks, Credit Suisse has been trimming jobs and businesses in the face of higher regulatory capital requirements, depressed interest-related profits and reduced risk-taking.

The sector has seen the deepest downsizing so far this year, with 57,591 cuts announced since January. The banking sector is cutting workforce levels as a direct result of an improving economy.

Penney last week reported sales had fallen 25 percent in the first year of Chief Executive Ron Johnson's strategy of refashioning Penney stores into collections of branded boutiques and getting rid of hundreds of sales events and coupons. Johnson, who has started reversing that strategy, told a New York court last week that the retailer had laid off 19,000 workers up that point. The latest job cuts were concentrated in about 100 stores where sales fell the most, and the eliminations hit back office positions. A Penney spokeswoman said none of the cuts affected staff who deal with customers. We wanted to ensure that these reductions do not compromise the level of customer service provided in stores, spokeswoman Daphne Avila said in an email. The company is bringing back some sales events as it seeks to win back shoppers who balked at Penney's promotional strategy.

Italy's often divided union confederations united to call on Mario Monti's caretaker government to find around 1.5 billion euros to guarantee payments due to some 700,000 workers sent home on reduced pay under the cassa integrazione scheme. The scheme is paid for jointly by the state and companies and allows firms in crisis to stand down workers for a limited period on a reduced salary in the hope of better times. But it is struggling to meet those commitments due to the huge numbers of workers thrown onto the programme by an economy deep in recession. Some 520,000 have already been sent home this year and the fund for 2013 is almost empty. With Italy striving to reduce its 2 trillion euro public debt, that raises the risk that the workers will soon have no income at all, like most of the country's 3 million of officially unemployed. If we go on like this then crime will rise, said Salvatore Gazzolino, a worker from the poor, mafia-infested southern region of Calabria. If you have no money and no work what can you do? You can only go out and steal. The protesters carried union flags and banners attacking welfare minister Elsa Fornero, a frequent target of workers' anger following her unpopular reforms last year of the pension system and labour rules. Fornero said she would meet worker representatives later on Tuesday but gave no guarantees that all the money could be found, a position the unions say is unacceptable. The government has no more alibis, said Susanna Camusso, leader of the 6-million strong, left-wing CGIL union. If we don't get assurances then there will be more protests, we will continue to occupy the squares of this country. The union leaders told the demonstrators the money could be found by reducing military spending, cutting waste or hiking taxes on financial assets. Recession With Italy mired in its longest recession for 20 years and thousands of companies going to the wall every month, the cassa integrazione scheme has been inundated this year, according to CGIL data. At the same time, Italy has promised to keep its budget deficit below the European Union's limit of 3 percent of output and with an official target of 2.9 percent for this year has little room for manoeuvre. But the unions said there could be no compromise. This is not a dispute that can end in a tie, said union chief Luigi Angeletti of the UIL confederation. If the government does not find the money we will bring hundreds of thousands of workers onto the streets of Rome. Monti's outgoing cabinet is officially only empowered for ordinary administration, having remained in office after February's inconclusive election which left no party with enough votes to form a new government. Yet since the vote Monti has already hiked Italy's fiscal deficit and debt targets and passed a decree to begin settling billions of euros of unpaid bills owed by the state to private companies. New Chamber of Deputies Speaker Laura Boldrini said if Monti produced an emergency decree to top up the cassa integrazione, then parliament would be able to begin examining it immediately to turn it into law."
https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-defense-budget-idUSBRE96F12820130716,Hagel says more budget cuts will force Pentagon layoffs,,"July 16, 2013 /  6:39 PM / 4 years ago",,"JACKSONVILLE, Florida (Reuters) - Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said on Tuesday that a new round of automatic spending cuts next year would force the department to cut personnel and that he already has decided to reduce jobs in the offices of the Pentagon's top leadership by 20 percent. Hagel, speaking to aircraft maintenance workers at Naval Air Station Jacksonville, defended his decision to put civilian workers on unpaid leave for 11 days through the end of the fiscal year on September 30, saying further cuts in other areas could have jeopardized military readiness. Some 6,900 civilians at the base had their first day of unpaid leave last week, including 2,700 at the maintenance facility, officials said. That amounts to an effective 20 percent pay cut through the end of the fiscal year. The defense secretary, who is on a three-day listening tour to talk to personnel at bases across the southern United States, painted a sobering picture of the uncertainty hanging over the department as a result of automatic budget cuts known as sequestration. The cuts, ordered by the White House and the Congress, reduced Pentagon spending by $37 billion this fiscal year, prompting the unpaid leave and other cuts. They are likely to cut $52 billion from defense spending in fiscal 2014. Responding to questions from the workers, Hagel said an additional $52 billion in cuts in fiscal 2014 would inevitably require a reduction in the Defense Department's workforce. This is not a good way to do it, he said. You don't save any money at the front end when you RIF (reduction in force) people. In fact it costs you more money. It's just a dumb way to do things. Sequestration is an irresponsible deferral of policymaking. But we are where we are. Hagel said he and Army General Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, had decided to implement a 20 percent across-the-top cut in our offices. He said later the 20 percent cut would also affect the staffs of the combatant commanders and would be implemented in the 2015-2019 time frame. That isn't going to fix the problem, he said. But ... everyone's got to do their part. The secretary said cuts could eventually affect compensation packages, such as retirement benefits, healthcare and pay, which combined represent about half of the Defense Department's budget. That's not going to go untouched, he said. You don't get the money in the overhead of the office of the secretary of the Defense Department. You need billions and billions of dollars. Speaking later at a luncheon with members of the Jacksonville Chamber of Commerce, Hagel said he was not optimistic about Congress and the White House reaching an agreement to avert the next round of budget cuts. I don't see a lot of hopeful signs that this is going to be resolved, he said. Editing by Mohammad Zargham"

The ruling African National Congress (ANC) has made job creation a priority, but the rate has been stuck above 20 percent for more than a decade despite periods of strong economic growth, fuelling social unrest. Joblessness increased to 25.5 percent of the labor force, Statistics South Africa said on Thursday, putting 197,000 more workers on the streets during the quarter. The agency said 4.667 million people were registered as unemployed, the highest figure since current records began four years ago. It's amongst the highest unemployment rates globally and highlights quite strongly that we need to be taking some corrective action, said Colen Garrow, an economist at Johannesburg-based consultancy Meganomics. By sector, mining was the second biggest contributor to the losses, shedding 8,000 jobs in a quarter that witnessed the most serious labor-related violence since apartheid's end in 1994. In the worst incident, police shot dead 34 striking miners at platinum miner Lonmin's Marikana complex. Related CoverageSouth Africa mine unrest to lead to job losses: AmplatsA hefty wage settlement brought an end to the six-week walkout. But Lonmin, which employs 25,000 people, told unions this week an unspecified number of workers would be laid off as part of restructuring to get the firm out of a financial hole. That alone suggests the jobless rate is likely to rise further in the final three months of the year. It is expected that we will see more job losses in mining, said Kefiloe Masiteng, Stats SA's head of population and social statistics. Anglo American Platinum chief executive Chris Griffith said the industry was in severe financial distress and elevated wage settlements to get wild-cat strikers back to work would lead to job cuts. The world's top platinum producer has lost 141,640 ounces of platinum to date from a seven-week strike. This is completely the wrong time to be offering unsustainable wage increases that the moment people are back at work you just have to (lay off) a whole lot of people, Griffith told Talk Radio 702. There will be implications for jobs. Stuck in a Rut South Africa's jobless rate has been stuck between 21 and 29 percent since current records began in 2000, and it did not dip appreciably even when the economy was growing strongly in the years leading up to a 2008/09 recession. The ANC has unveiled a big infrastructure development plan in February that it says should create millions of jobs in Africa's biggest economy. But Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan has said the economy needs sustained growth of 7 percent a year - nearly three times the 2.5 percent forecast for 2012 - to make a dent in unemployment. South Africa's relatively rigid labor laws are part of the problem, making it difficult and costly for employers to fire workers, although the powerful unions have rejected any notion of reform, saying it would lead to exploitation. Youngsters -- defined as 15 to 34-year-olds -- accounted for 71 percent of all jobless people, compounding the fears of ANC leaders that they are sitting on a ticking time-bomb of youth unemployment that could ultimately trigger major social unrest. The expanded definition of unemployment, which includes people who have stopped looking for work, increased to 36.3 percent from 36.2 percent previously. Private households got rid of 29,000 workers during the quarter in a sector that mostly makes use of temporary workers. Additional reporting by Olivia Kumwenda; Editing by Ed Cropley/Jeremy Gaunt"
https://www.reuters.com/article/us-airshow-dubai-generalatomics-idUSBRE9AL0GK20131122,Drone maker General Atomics may face layoffs: executive,,"November 22, 2013 /  12:02 PM / 4 years ago",,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Privately-held drone maker General Atomics Aeronautical Systems Inc may have to lay off about one quarter of its production staff if it does not receive further U.S. or foreign orders, a senior company executive said this week. Frank Pace, president of the company's aircraft systems group, said the Pentagon's current plan to halve its purchases of Predator B drones to around 24 a year, coupled with continued restrictions on foreign sales, were putting pressure on the San Diego-based company, a unit of General Atomics. Unless additional orders come in, the company may have to lay off about 25 percent of its current production staff of about 1,400 people, Pace told Reuters at the Dubai Airshow. It's significant. We're still working off the fiscal 2012 buy, but eventually if we can't make some more overseas sales or sell to the Marines or something like that, we'll have to cut back staff, Pace said. Company officials said the U.S. Marine Corps is looking at buying Predator B drones in fiscal 2018, but funding is being cut across the military given $500 billion in mandatory budget reductions that took effect earlier this year and are due to continue for a decade. When the budgets are going down in the U.S., you would like to be able to export more, Pace told Reuters, adding that U.S. restrictions on foreign sales slowed the company's ability to respond to strong foreign demand which could offset the slump in U.S. military spending. Foreign sales of larger unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that can carry 500 kilograms or more of sensors and payloads are banned under the Missile Technology Control Regime, and require special waivers from the U.S. government, in addition to the already lengthy regular process for approving weapons sales. Pace said there was widespread frustration about the restrictions in the unmanned systems industry, but it was unclear if any changes in the statute were forthcoming. Some efforts are under way in the U.S. government, but the process has been moving very slowly. Wes Bush, the chief executive of Northrop Grumman Corp (NOC.N) has warned that failure to adjust the rules could result in a competitive advantage for manufacturers outside the United States. General Atomics' new larger Predator C drone - which can go three times as fast as the Predator B and carries 10 times as many sensors - would be subject to the restrictions, Pace said. It's one of those things where all of industry is frustrated with the government, so there's a chance that they might do something, he said when asked if the U.S. government was making any moves to loosen the current rules. Pace said unmanned plane sales had probably peaked in the United States, but there was still strong demand from Europe. General Atomics has built nearly 200 Predator B drones, and has sold the airplanes to Italy and France. Germany, the Netherlands, Canada and Australia have also expressed interest, but that may not translate into firm orders until 2015 or 2016, Pace said. In the Gulf region, General Atomics has sold five of the XP or export version of the unmanned plane to the United Arab Emirates, which is looking at additional purchases, Pace said. Other Gulf countries including Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and Oman had also expressed interest, he added. Editing by Mark Potter"

The Calgary-based oil and gas producer, whose share price has fallen about 56 percent over the last two years, said late on Tuesday that it had appointed former Marathon Chief Operating Officer David Roberts as president and chief executive officer, effective June 19. He replaces Murray Nunns, who will retire from the company on July 1. Penn West said it planned to focus on increasing efficiency, starting with a 10 percent workforce reduction over the next few weeks. The company had about 2,130 employees at the end of 2012. For the third quarter, the company is cutting its quarterly payout to 14 Canadian cents a share from 27 Canadian cents to increase its financial flexibility, it said. Shares of Penn West were unchanged at C$10.90 in early trading in Toronto. Penn West also said its board would form a special committee to explore such options as strategic financing alternatives, asset divestments, joint ventures and other business combinations. The changes come barely a month after the company named two respected industry leaders to its board - former Suncor Energy Inc head Rick George as chairman and former Canadian Natural Resources head Allan Markin as vice chairman. We believe the announced CEO change signals a step forward in the ongoing reorganization and restructuring of Penn West, said BMO Capital Markets analyst Gordon Tait in a research note. We are encouraged that the company appears to be making the difficult organizational and financial changes needed. Tait and other analysts said, however, that Penn West was not out of the woods and still needed to improve operational efficiency, shed assets and strengthen its balance sheet. The company's base operations are unsustainable today, said Barclays analyst Grant Hofer. This makes Penn West a unattractive as a takeover target and joint venture partner, he said. The company said its outlook on full-year production and capital spending remained unchanged. Penn West has many high-quality assets, but the company has yet to unlock their complete value, Chairman George said in a release. The company will maintain the second-quarter dividend at 27 Canadian cents a share and pay it to shareholders of record on June 28. Roberts, who has more than three decades of operational expertise in the oil and gas business, will join Penn West's board after he assumes the CEO position."

Some investors had been bracing for weak readings after the central bank unexpectedly eased policy late on Monday, injecting an estimated $100 billion worth of cash into the banking system to cushion the pain of upcoming reforms such as restructuring bloated state enterprises. The official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 49.0 in February from January's reading of 49.4 and below the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction. Economists polled by Reuters had expected only a slight dip to 49.3. It was the lowest reading since November 2011. The PMI came in much weaker than markets expected, hinting that recent easing measures have had limited impact in turning around the weakening manufacturing sector, wrote senior emerging markets economist Zhou Hao at Commerzbank in Singapore. We think PBoC will cut policy rates by 25 basis points in the first quarter and lower RRR (banks' reserve requirement ratio) by another 100-150 basis points this year.  The private Caixin/Markit China Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), which focuses more on small to medium- sized, private firms, showed activity contracted for a 12th straight month. It fell to 48.0, below market expectations of 48.3 and January's reading of 48.4. Both surveys showed conditions in China's job market were continuing to deteriorate, challenging policymakers who are finalising Beijing's next five-year development plan ahead of the annual parliament meeting starting on March 5. The Caixin report showed companies shed jobs at the fastest pace since January 2009, when China and other trade-reliant economies were reeling from a near-collapse in global trade following the financial crisis. Related CoverageChina Feb factory PMI falls to 48.0, contracts 12th month, layoffs rise: Caixin PMIChina state planner says will keep prices stable in 2016China's home price gains quicken in February: surveysFirms that reported lower headcounts cited company downsizing and cost-cutting, and said more workers who were leaving voluntarily were not being replaced. The employment sub-component of the index fell to 46.0 from January's 47.0. The official PMI survey, which tends to focus on larger, state firms, has shown persistent declines in employment for the last 3-1/2 years.     To be sure, although Markit adjusts figures for seasonal effects, the timing of the long Lunar New Year holiday can make Chinese data in January and February difficult to interpret. Economic activity slows dramatically around the holiday, which falls on a different date in late winter every year. Still, the findings in the latest surveys have dashed hopes that a year-long blitz of stimulus measures would start to produce signs of economic stabilization early in 2016.     China's factory sector has been under pressure from weak demand at home and abroad and massive overcapacity in key industries such as steel and coal, diluting the impact of six central bank interest rate cuts and a spate of other support measures since November 2014. Industrial profits fell 2.3 percent in 2015 after rising 3.3 percent in 2014. Both surveys on Tuesday showed further contractions in domestic and export orders, suggesting industrial output will remain sluggish in coming months.     In addition, some manufacturers in capital-intensive sectors are struggling with heavy debt loads, which are becoming increasingly difficult to repay as they have to constantly cut  prices to win sales. Last year witnessed a rash of bond defaults by steel, cement and chemical firms. Chinese factory gate prices fell for the 47th straight month in January. The government has made cutting overcapacity in steel and other old economy sectors a priority this year, though previous efforts have run into strong resistance locally as big  firms are often a key source of tax revenue and employment. China said on Monday it expects to lay off 1.8 million workers in the coal and steel industries, or about 15 percent of the workforce, but no timeframe was given. Recent tax changes have also raised concerns that China hopes to export more of its excess industrial capacity abroad, further worsening global gluts of chemical and steel products and effectively exporting deflation abroad. China's economic growth cooled to 6.9 percent in 2015, the slowest pace in 25 years, and economists see it slowing further to around 6.5 percent this year. Some market watchers believe it is already much weaker than official data suggests. Services Softening? A growth slowdown in China's services sector last month was also singled out by analysts as a cause for concern. The official non-manufacturing PMI fell from 53.5 in January to 52.7 in February, still in expansion territory but the weakest reading since late 2008. The services sector has been taking up an increasing amount of economic slack as manufacturing cools, but analysts have wondered how long it can remain resilient in the face of the prolonged factory slump and increasing unemployment. With manufacturing in both a cyclical and structural funk, Beijing has been keen to grow the services sector and make consumption a stronger driver of the economy.  Today’s data suggest that policy makers will take further measures in the upcoming National People’s Congress in order to achieve a GDP growth target of 6.5 to 7 percent in 2016, ANZ economists said in a note. A proactive fiscal policy will be needed to support investments and we expect the fiscal deficit could be increased to a range of 3-4 percent in 2016, from 2.3 percent in 2015 in order to boost government spending.

The unemployment rate was 8.4 percent in March, slightly down from months earlier, but still at a level not seen in more than 20 years. The government of Alberta has been publicly firm that the asset sales are good news as buyers have been domestic companies eyeing expansion. But privately, in written advice to Energy Minister Marg McCuaig-Boyd days after the Cenovus deal, a senior civil servant conceded one negative aspect in the financial and labour impact of the exodus. Some energy jobs may be at risk because such mergers and acquisitions yield duplications and redundancies, according to the government briefing note, seen by Reuters under freedom-of-information laws. Asked about the note, Alberta Premier Rachel Notley said job losses are a cost of consolidation, although she does not necessarily anticipate more layoffs. The province is working hard to seek export markets for its landlocked energy products to ensure the sector's long-term stability, she said. ConocoPhillips spokesman Rob Evans said the layoffs will be mostly in the Canada's oil capital of Calgary, Alberta, and will occur by mid-May. The company had more than 2,000 staff in Canada as of late 2015. Global energy majors have sold off more than $22.5 billion worth of Canadian oil sands assets so far this year to domestic companies. Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L), which in March agreed to sell most oil sands assets for $8.5 billion to Canadian Natural Resources (CNQ.TO), said at the time that layoffs among head office employees and technical staff were possible. Shell spokeswoman Tara Lemay on Thursday declined to provide a precise figure, saying most workers will be kept on and those laid off are eligible to apply for positions within Shell globally.

Wall Street's reaction was lukewarm, after two previous Yahoo CEOs failed to find an answer to rivals like Web-search leader Google and the Facebook social-networking site. Sunnyvale, California-based Yahoo, which ended 2011 with some 14,000 employees, said it would save $375 million annually from the cuts and incur a pre-tax cash charge in the second quarter of $125 million to $145 million. The company declined to comment on severance details. Some analysts were skeptical about the widely expected layoffs, which weren't accompanied by details of Yahoo's broader plan to revamp its business. You can't cut your way to revenue growth, said Colin Gillis of BGC Partners. What people want to see out of Yahoo is ... a plan and provision for revenue growth. Third Point, an activist hedge fund that is waging a proxy fight to install a slate of handpicked directors on Yahoo's board, described the layoffs as necessary. But the hedge fund, Yahoo's largest shareholder with a 5.8 percent stake, said in a statement that it was disappointed that this round of cuts occurred before CEO Scott Thompson has articulated his strategic plan for the company. Thompson, in all-staff memo obtained by Reuters, said the changes would transform Yahoo into a leaner outfit that focuses on its main businesses, which he identified as core media and communications, platforms and data. The changes we're announcing today will put our customers first, allow us to move fast, and to get stuff done, Thompson said in the memo, adding that the changes would result in a smaller, nimbler, more profitable company. We are intensifying our efforts on our core businesses and redeploying resources to our most urgent priorities, Thompson wrote in the memo. Macquarie Research's Ben Schachter saw the layoffs as a start in determining the new direction of the company. Scott Thompson is not there to tweak the business, Schachter said. He saw something in the assets to make him think there was potential. A Yahoo spokeswoman said that every organization within the company was affected by the layoffs but that some groups were affected more than others. She declined to specify the groups most affected. Yahoo said it would provide more details of its plans when it releases first-quarter results on April 17. The layoffs come as Yahoo's revenue declines due to competition from Google and Facebook. Last year, Yahoo's revenue totaled $4.98 billion, compared with Facebook's $3.71 billion, accomplished with just 3,200 employees. Yahoo is also fighting a battle with hedge fund manager Daniel Loeb. Loeb, who runs Third Point, is seeking to appoint four new directors to Yahoo's board. Third Point, with a 5.8 percent stake in Yahoo, is the company's largest shareholder. Yahoo's shares ended down 0.6 percent $15.27 on the Nasdaq. The Nasdaq market dropped nearly 1.5 percent. Editing by John Wallace, Maureen Bavdek, Tim Dobbyn and Steve Orlofsky"

Athanasia said Bank of America will open 50 to 60 new branches over the next year, though Pace said the bank will also be closing branches in certain markets, so the 50 to 60 branches do not represent a net increase. Bank of America opened 31 new branches in 2016.   Bank of America had 4,579 financial centers at the end of the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to 4,726 in the fourth quarter of 2015 and 5,900 at the end of 2010.

Union National has got approval from China's central bank to convert its representative office into a branch in Shanghai, Mohammed Nasr Abdeen told reporters late on Wednesday after the bank's annual general meeting, making it among the first Gulf banks to have a bank branch on the mainland. The formality will be completed in one month, he said. Union National, the fifth largest lender by assets in the emirate, may also consider expanding in China, subject to central bank regulations, Abdeen said. Union National opened its representative office in China in 2008, the first bank from the United Arab Emirates to do so. National Bank of Abu Dhabi and Emirates NBD  have also set up representative offices in China. The lender also plans to expand aggressively in Egypt by opening more branches this year, Abdeen said, without specifying how many. Egypt is a good market for us and the bank has gained confidence of the market, he said, adding it has 42 branches in the country. The bank has no plans to enter any new markets. It has one branch in Qatar and another in Kuwait. Abdeen said the bank was unlikely to be impacted this year by high cost of funding, like it faced last year. Union National's full-year 2016 profit attributable to equity holders fell 15.1 percent. The main factor for reduction of profit, in addition to provisions was the cost of funds. I don't expect that this year, because the high cost of the previous year will be shifted to the loans, he said. The AGM approved a 20 percent cash dividend (2016) for shareholders.

https://www.reuters.com/article/morocco-banks-idUSL8N1IP6CO,Morocco opens first Islamic bank branch months after approval,,"May 23, 2017 /  6:15 PM / in 2 months",,"RABAT, May 23 (Reuters) - The first Islamic bank in Morocco, Umnia Bank, has opened its doors five months after the country's central bank approved requests to open Islamic financial institutions. Islamic banks and insurers are setting up in Morocco after new legislation allowed them into the market, and the central bank has set up a central sharia board, a body of Islamic scholars, to oversee the sector. The North African country long rejected Islamic banking because of concern about Islamist movements, but its financial markets lack liquidity and foreign investors, and Islamic finance could attract both of those. Umnia Bank, a joint venture of Qatar International Islamic Bank (QIIB) and Moroccan lender Credit Immobilier et Hotelier S.A. (CIH Bank), opened a total of three agencies in the country on Monday, including two in Casablanca and one in Rabat. The bank plans to open more branches throughout the country, it said in a statement. On Tuesday afternoon, Umnia Bank's branch in Rabat attracted a significant amount of clients, including people simply curious about Islamic financing. I have an account with CIH Bank and I just came by here to learn more about what the difference is, said one client. Umnia Bank, attached next to a CIH Bank branch, is just a few blocks away from the forthcoming Dar Assafaa, Attijariwafa Bank's Islamic finance subsidiary. As a Muslim, I'm happy we finally have Islamic banks in the country, said Ritaj, a mother of three, who drove three hours from Tangiers to open an account. The branch was still ironing out technical problems. The director still had not received details for a prospective client about margins for a murabaha transaction -- one of the Islamic instruments that is compliant to sharia law. Morocco is the most advanced of North African neighbours in developing Islamic finance. Tunisia and Algeria are also starting to explore the banking based on religious principles which avoid interest and pure monetary speculation. Islamic finance has been growing over the past decade as it broadens its investor base across the Middle East, North Africa, Africa and southeast Asia, tapping into conservative religious clients.

The bank, part of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, has played a central role in the Saudi government's recent financing activity, in April helping to arrange a $10 billion loan, while Mitsubishi UFJ in October helped with its $17.5 billion international bond sale. The bank also signed an agreement in September with Saudi Aramco IPO-ARMO.SE to assist and collaborate in the company's future development. The oil giant is targeting 2018 for what is expected to be the world's biggest initial public offering. Saudi state news agency SPA said the cabinet licenced the bank to open a branch in the kingdom and authorised the Minister of Finance to decide on any subsequent request to open other branches. Saudi Arabia and Japan have strong trading ties, with Japan's oil and gas procurement from Saudi Aramco accounting for more than 30 percent of Japan's total imports for the sector, according to a release from the bank in September. Banking licences in the kingdom are granted relatively infrequently. Qatar National Bank was the last foreign bank to be permitted to open a branch in September 2015.

https://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-election-putin-idUSKBN1840Q8,Putin holds out olive branch to France's Macron,,"May 8, 2017 /  8:32 AM / 3 months ago",,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin told France's President-elect Emmanuel Macron on Monday he wanted to put mistrust aside and work with him, in a change of tack after the Kremlin expressed support for Macron's rivals in the presidential race.  The citizens of France have trusted you with leading the country at a difficult time for Europe and the whole world community, Putin told Macron, whose staff had accused Russia during the campaign of trying to damage their candidate. The Kremlin said Putin told Macron in a congratulatory telegram: The growth in threats of terrorism and militant extremism is accompanied by an escalation of local conflicts and the destabilization of whole regions. In these conditions it is especially important to overcome mutual mistrust and unite efforts to ensure international stability and security. Late on Friday, 1-1/2 days before polls opened, Macron's campaign said it had been the target of a massive computer hack that dumped internal campaign emails online. A New York-based cyber intelligence consultancy, Flashpoint, said there were indications a hacker group with ties to Russian military intelligence was behind the attack.  Putin has repeatedly denied interfering in the elections of any foreign countries, and rejected previous allegations about Kremlin-backed hacking operations. Earlier in the campaign, a Macron aide had said Russia was mounting a campaign to disseminate fake news via cable television and social media to discredit Macron and help his rivals. Putin had spoken favorably about Macron's conservative rival Francois Fillon, who had said he wanted a reset of frayed relations with Russia. Later, after Fillon's prospects faded under the weight of a nepotism scandal, Putin took the unusual step of granting a Kremlin audience to far-right candidate Marine Le Pen, who was Macron's opponent in Sunday's run-off. She told reporters after meeting Putin that if victorious, her first act would be to think about lifting the sanctions that the European Union imposed on Russia after it annexed Ukraine's Crimea peninsula three years ago. Macron's victory extends a losing run for Putin, who had banked on political upheaval in Western capitals bringing in new leaders better disposed toward Russia. He is expected to run for re-election next year, and a lifting or easing of Western sanctions would help him secure a strong mandate from Russian voters, who are feeling the pain from an economic slowdown made worse by the sanctions. During the U.S. presidential campaign, Putin spoke in glowing terms about Donald Trump. U.S. intelligence officials alleged Russia actively tried to help Trump's campaign by hacking his opponents' emails. Russia has denied that. But since Trump took office, he has not delivered the promised rapprochement with Russia, instead sticking closely to the Russia policy espoused by his predecessor as president, Barack Obama.

https://www.reuters.com/article/hsbc-china-idUSL4N1HZ49J,"Customers in short supply at HSBC's Pearl River Delta branches, core of China plan",,"April 27, 2017 /  8:04 AM / 3 months ago",,"DONGGUAN, China/LONDON/HONG KONG (Reuters) - In the digital age, footfall in bricks-and-mortar outlets is an incomplete measure of business activity, but HSBC's (HSBA.L) sparsely attended branches in the Pearl River Delta suggest it's not all plain sailing for the bank's expansion in mainland China. HSBC, the world's sixth-largest bank by assets, announced in 2015 that it would hire 4,000 new staff and invest billions to make the Pearl River Delta (PRD) its gateway to China, a retail and corporate banking push that bet on a tech boom, infrastructure spending and a growing middle class. It is, as Chief Executive Stuart Gulliver reminded shareholders in Hong Kong on Monday, a key plank of the bank's global strategy to improve profits by focusing on markets with stronger economic growth. PRD already generates more than 10 percent of China's GDP and over a quarter of its exports. On the ground, HSBC still has a mountain to climb. In a rundown mall in Houjie, a factory town in the urban sprawl of Dongguan, the HSBC branch stands out with its bright posters, colorful pamphlets for credit cards and smiling receptionist, but only a handful of customers an hour crossed the threshold during a Reuters visit last week. At the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (601398.SS) (ICBC) branch in nearby Changan, dozens rolled up in a similar period. At a branch in a leafy district of Shenzhen, again HSBC was far quieter than rivals China Merchants Bank (600036.SS) and China Construction Bank (601939.SS). Some customers, like Way Zhi, a 28-year-old who helps run a family trading business, welcome the peace -- you don't have to waste a few hours each time like in local banks, he said -- but it is a reminder that HSBC has some way to go to scale up. Large local rivals in the PRD, most state-backed, each have more than 1,000 branches to HSBC's 114 including Guangdong, and they don't have the headache of the tough compliance rules that HSBC has to follow to safeguard its international business. It's a headache the bank has to pass on to prospective customers. A factory owner who gave his surname as Luo said he opened an HSBC account last year to facilitate his business making wooden floorboards and panels for clients in Hong Kong, where HSBC was founded in 1865. Luo, who spoke to Reuters as he was leaving the Houjie branch, represents the kind of affluent Chinese customer with business in Hong Kong that the bank is keen to snag. But opening a bank account was quite a lot of trouble, he said, and took nearly two weeks. HSBC's customer-checking procedures have got tighter in recent years after it was hit with billions of dollars in fines in the U.S. for lapses in anti-money laundering controls. A HSBC staff member at the branch, who declined to be named, confirmed that customer background checks can take longer than at local banks that have no or negligible U.S. business at risk and are not subject to global regulatory scrutiny. FILE PHOTO: HSBC headquarters building is seen in Pudong financial district in Shanghai December 8, 2010.Carlos Barria/File PhotoMaking Progress HSBC says it is pleased with its progress in China. At the start of April it had 150,000 credit cards in circulation, having begun to issue them in December, mostly after digital applications. It has also launched online trading and banking over social media platform WeChat. We do not intend to compete on a traditional basis in PRD. Absolute branch numbers and footfall will not be our measure, said Kevin Martin, HSBC's Asia Pacific head of retail banking and wealth management. But that's a game its big rivals are also playing; ICBC, for example, has offered WeChat banking since 2013. Since HSBC announced its strategy in June 2015, China's slowing growth and a stock market crash have prompted a rethink on the pace of expansion. CEO Gulliver said last year it would take on the 4,000 new regional hires over five years, not three, as initially planned. Quite rightly, management felt at that time they didn't want to achieve the strategy by taking on more risk, Sam Laidlaw, an independent board member at HSBC, told Reuters. Investors remain broadly positive. It's not an overnight thing, and of course everyone wants it to be faster. The (China) strategy should be pursued – but it is only one of many strategies for HSBC, said Hugh Young, Singapore-based fund manager at Aberdeen Asset Management, HSBC's 6th-largest shareholder. And what figures the bank has disclosed for 2016 are encouraging, albeit from a low base; it said in its annual report that its number of retail banking and wealth management clients and its mortgage loan book in the area had both increased by 51 percent during the year. But it also has some battles with red tape to win. The lender is still waiting for approval for its securities business venture with a state-owned fund in the PRD, more than a year after it announced the partnership. And some say the bank remains something of an outsider. At the Ling Jia Property Agency, a few meters from HSBC's Houjie branch, realtor Yi Linfeng said most of his customers use ICBC for mortgages. None, he says, have ever used HSBC. I think they mostly have foreign customers from Taiwan and Hong Kong. Additional reporting by Carolyn Cohn in London; Editing by Will Waterman"

The China Foreign Exchange Trade System (CFETS), a subsidiary of China's central bank, said in a statement that by expanding its network offshore, it aims to serve more overseas institutions and become a main trading platform and pricing center for the yuan globally. China has been gradually loosening its capital controls to allow more foreign participation in its onshore yuan market. Beijing is also fostering offshore yuan centers to promote international use of the Chinese currency. CFETS provides an electronic bidding system for the yuan against foreign currencies. It also offers cross-rate trading, as well as RMB interbank lending and bond trading. Yuan-based trading on CFETS totaled 618.12 trillion yuan ($94.24 trillion)in 2015, according to official Xinhua News Agency.  The CFETS said that it would further strengthen cooperation with overseas trading platforms, and aim to eventually provide trading services 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The market platform extended its trading hours for China's onshore yuan this year to end trading at 11:30 p.m. local time from 4:30 p.m. previously.  CFETS is willing to provide comprehensive service and support to British institutions who participate in China's inter-bank market, and strengthen cooperation with them as Chinese companies go offshore, Sun Jie, executive vice president of CFETS, told an event in Shanghai. The event, focused on the topic of yuan's internationalization, was attended by Chinese and British regulators, as well as financial institutions.

The 40-year-old father of one was among millions of east Europeans who moved to wealthier western Europe in search of better-paid jobs after their countries joined the EU from 2004, leaving huge labor market gaps behind. With economic prospects improving across eastern Europe and wages rising due partly to a shortage of workers, official data show tens of thousands of people returning to the region, where the cost of living remains well below western levels. Those numbers will not cure chronic labor shortages overnight. Thousands of people are still planning to leave, and latest data show emigrants from both Hungary and Bulgaria still outnumber returnees. But the first waves of returnees still signal something of a turning point for a region where migration has hitherto worked largely as a one-way street. Kiss left home in 2010 to take up a job in a hotel kitchen in northern Italy after his video rental and massage businesses crashed during the global crisis, which hit Hungary hard. I had to find something to be able to maintain the same standard of living, said Kiss, whose son, now eight, was just 10 months old when he started working abroad. Kiss, who has recently acquired a barista certification, plans to use his savings to launch a cafe in Budapest with a fellow Hungarian with whom he worked while abroad. Distance and this way of life take a very hard toll on your relationships, he said. For me, too, not coming home now would have probably meant the end of my family. Official statistics show 17,000 Hungarians returned last year, up from below 15,000 a year earlier. More than 9,000 Bulgarians have been returning home every year since 2014, double the numbers of earlier years. Many are young people returning to start their own business, mainly in the IT sector, or to join growing outsourcing business opportunities. In Poland, the region's biggest economy, net international migration turned positive last year for the first time since World War Two, official statistics show. Meanwhile, net migration of EU citizens to Britain, a top target for east Europeans along with Germany or Italy, fell last year as new arrivals from eastern European countries sank to the lowest level since they joined the EU in 2004. Britain's looming exit from the EU is deterring some migrants.  Bosch employee Mate Muskat talks with Reuters in Budapest, Hungary, June 8, 2017. Picture taken June 8, 2017.Laszlo BaloghImre Molnar and his fiancee returned to Hungary after two years spent in Switzerland as they could not feel settled abroad. They have opened a wine bar in Budapest that serves only local wines and food. We realized that Switzerland is a very different country, Molnar said. It is very beautiful, but society is quite closed, people are not very open and in reality we did not feel at home as we do here in Budapest. Like Hot Cakes Judit Kovacs, a branch manager at the Hungarian unit of Dutch staffing agency Randstad, said blue-collar workers were more likely to return as they usually cannot afford to take their entire family abroad. There is demand for returning workers, especially those who have learned a new technology, she said, citing auto sector suppliers as an example. Slideshow (2 Images)Machine operators, for example, who have learned to run machinery that is not yet in use in Hungary but the investment is already in the pipeline, Kovacs said. Workers with such experience are being snapped up like hot cakes. Technological advances, such as the advent of self-driving cars, or the entry of service sector companies like BlackRock Inc into the Hungarian market, are also creating opportunities for white-collar workers. German technology supplier Robert Bosch hired 2,000 workers in Hungary last year alone and plans to add hundreds more engineering jobs to keep up with buoyant demand. BlackRock, which announced plans in January to open a service hub in Budapest, said it had received a large number of applications from prospective returnees after a scouting event hosted by the Hungarian embassy in London. About a third of applicants ... were Hungarians working in London who are planning to return to Hungary, corporate communications director Marc Bubeck said. Economists are generally upbeat about prospects for the eastern European region, which is expected to outpace its richer western peers in economic growth in the years ahead despite concerns over its continued reliance on EU development funds. But money isn't everything. In purely financial terms, it is definitely worth working abroad, Kiss said. But if you look at the other side of the equation, that I have yet to ride a sled with my son even though he is already eight, the two are not necessarily in balance. For now, I am full of hopes and dreams, he said. Additional reporting by Tsvetelia Tsolova in SOFIA and Marcin Goettig in WARSAW; Editing by Gareth Jones"

France in April threatened to put Panama on its tax haven blacklist, just two months after the isthmus nation was removed from the gray list of the Paris-based Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an international anti-money laundering body. Since Panama came onto the FATF list in 2014, at least 21 correspondent accounts for Panamanian banks have been canceled, according to the Panamanian finance ministry. The Panama Papers revelations have increased risks for U.S.-based banks providing services to Panamanian counterparts needing to transact in dollars, said Alma Angotti, a director at Navigant Consulting and anti-money laundering expert. Risk factors on the minds of U.S. banks could include exposure to money laundering and corruption, Angotti said. Federal law requires U.S.-based correspondent banks to know what kind of customers the foreign bank is servicing.

https://www.reuters.com/article/deutschebank-china-idUSL6N0S92Y820141014,Deutsche Bank looks to open new branches in China,,"October 14, 2014 /  12:25 PM / 3 years ago",,"FRANKFURT, Oct 14 (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank hopes to open new branches in China at a rate of about one per year as it positions itself to benefit from expanding trade and investment between Asia's largest economy and Europe. Werner Steinmueller, head of transaction banking at Deutsche, said the expansion was part of the bank's wider efforts to profit from China's economic rise. We will steadily open branches, Steinmueller told journalists on Tuesday. The exact pace and path of expansion depends on Chinese regulators who must approve or even guide each opening, he said. Germany's flagship bank, which has six branches in China now, aims to become the leading European player in the offshore renminbi market, offering importers and exporters trade financing, settlements and debt issuance in the Chinese currency. Steinmueller said the bank was betting on long-term reforms in Chinese financial regulations to open markets and make renminbi, which is controlled, freely convertible by 2020. Germany is China's biggest European trading partner with a shared export-import volume of 140 billion euros ($177 billion) in 2013. Renminbi, meanwhile, is expected to grow in importance and become a reserve currency in the coming years, Steinmueller said. The renminbi is becoming more and more mainstream, he said. Deutsche Bank already offers corporate banking and securities services, wealth management, and transaction banking in China. It offers investment banking services domestically through Zhong De Securities Company, a joint venture with Shanxi  Securities Co. Ltd. China and Germany signed agreements this year to launch clearing and settlement mechanisms in Frankfurt in a move to elevate the role of Germany's financial capital in Chinese finance. Deutsche said it could divert some of its own renminbi clearing volumes from Shanghai to Frankfurt to support the facility. If you launch a clearing centre then you also have to put some volumes in it, Steinmueller said. $1 = 0.7902 euro

Shawn Rose, Scotiabank's executive vice president of digital banking, said the move would support the bank's aim of becoming a leader in financial technology and was, in part, a response to growing competition from both mainstream banks and fintech startups. Canada's largest banks are investing hundreds of millions of dollars in new technology as they adapt to a transformational increase in customers banking online rather than branches where transactions have significantly declined. It's accelerating, that competitive fear, said Rose, who joined the bank six months ago to help develop its digital operations. We don't want to lose a day. It's critical. The people we hire, they need a place to establish these routines. Scotiabank has opened similar hubs in Mexico, Peru, Chile and Columbia (Pacific Alliance), which it has identified as key markets as it looks to diversify from Canada, where growth has been held back by a sluggish economy. It's potentially more important for us to do this at the Pacific Alliance ... These Pacific Alliance countries are outpacing the mothership. The bank demonstrated projects including a payment system that combines blockchain, which underpins digital currencies like bitcoin, with biometric scanning to recognize an employee. A quick hand swipe through a scanner allows staff within the new facility to pay for food and beverages in the cafeteria without using a bank card, cash or a device. Rose said the bank is the process of filing a patent for that particular technology.

The bank is one of a small number of foreign lenders with operations in Iraq, which is experiencing rapid oil-fuelled economic growth, but also its worst upsurge in violence in at least five years. Standard Chartered opened its country head office and first branch last November in Baghdad's banking district, on a street lined with blast walls and patrolled by guards with Kalashnikov rifles. Kurdistan is relatively peaceful by contrast, and the autonomous region's main cities are full of cranes and construction sites. The bank also plans to open another branch in the southern oil hub of Basra later in 2014. Chief Executive Officer of Standard Chartered Iraq Gavin Wishart told Reuters that the business environment in Kurdistan was progressive and described the pace of development as encouraging. Security concerns and a complex regulatory and political environment have put some international firms off doing business there. HSBC is trying to exit Iraq by selling its stake in Dar Es Salaam Investment Bank.

Economic growth in Africa's second most populous country is running at more than 9 percent and the government could open up the state-dominated banking sector to new entrants before too long. Ecobank CEO Thierry Tanoh said that the new branch will give the lender a head start in marketing its pan-African services to overseas businesses and other banks in the region before possible banking deregulation. Ethiopia has emerged as one of Africa's most exciting new markets and is forecast to be the world's third-fastest-growing economy between 2011 and 2015, behind only China and India, Tanoh said, adding that Ecobank aims to profit from increasing trade across different African nations as the continent steps up its development and infrastructure. Tanoh said that such trade had grown to 12 percent of total trade on the continent last year, from less than 10 percent five years ago. Shares in the bank slipped 1.36 percent to 13.85 naira on Friday, but the stock has gained 24 percent since the start of the year.

https://www.reuters.com/article/us-rbs-branches-idUSBRE97I11F20130819,"RBS branch bidders push for speedy deal, promise growth",,"August 19, 2013 /  11:18 PM / in 4 years",,"LONDON (Reuters) - Two of the three bidders short-listed to buy 315 bank branches from Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L) have called for the long-running sale process to be completed as quickly as possible, with one describing the outlets as slightly neglected under their current ownership. RBS was ordered to sell the UK branches as a condition of its 2008 taxpayer bailout, which left the bank 81 percent state-owned. A 1.65-billion-pound ($2.59 billion) sale of the branches to Spain's Santander (SAN.MC) collapsed in October 2012, triggering a fresh sale process that has been plagued by delays. In separate interviews with Reuters, senior figures from short-listed bidders W&G; Investments and Corsair said a deal needed to be agreed quickly so that the branch business, which has assets of about 20.5 billion pounds, can begin operating as a separate entity ahead of its change in ownership. Both laid out plans to expand the business by focusing on small business lending and said they were committed long-term investors who wanted to create a challenger bank in the UK. Headed by former Tesco Finance chief Andy Higginson, W&G; Investments is a UK-based group of institutional investors which will list on London's Alternative Investment Market (AIM) on Tuesday. It wants to pay between 1.1 and 1.5 billion pounds for the branches. U.S.-based private equity firm Corsair is bidding along with fellow private equity house Centre Point, and other investors including the Church of England's investment fund and Standard Life Investments. It wants to install former Lloyds Banking Group (LLOY.L) executive John Maltby as chief executive and pay between 600 million and 800 million pounds to become a cornerstone investor ahead of a stock market flotation that would value the new bank at more than 1.5 billion pounds. The third bid is headed by British private equity house AnaCap, with U.S. investor Blackstone. In a statement, they said they would work with RBS to achieve a premium valuation for the business through a stock market offering, but would give no detail on the value of their proposed deal. RBS declined to comment on the process. 'Slightly Neglected' Asked about the biggest challenge to their bid, W&G;'s Higginson said the most important thing was for the branches to get separate management as soon as possible so that value is preserved. Having been a division within RBS with a for-sale sign above it for five years, inevitably it's been slightly neglected, said Higginson. The staff have done a fantastic job in holding the customers, but you know this business needs separate focus, the management vigor that a for-sale sign doesn't allow you to have. Under the W&G; plan, RBS would ready the business for sale over about two years by giving it more autonomy, getting a banking license and making other necessary changes, before passing it over to the investors. Corsair would install Maltby as chief executive as soon as a deal was done, and he and RBS would work together to prepare the business for independence, a similar model to the one proposed by AnaCap/Blackstone. Maltby said both staff and customers had been living through a period of uncertainty. The quicker the process can come to a successful conclusion and we can get on and build this new bank the better it is for all parties, he said. Under the terms of its bailout, RBS must sell the branches by the end of 2013. Chief Financial Officer Bruce Van Saun said in February the bank had already told the European Commission it was likely to need an extension but would not apply formally until a preferred bidder was picked. In It for the Long Haul Higginson said his grouping had a very big group of powerful institutional investors that would create a business that would still be around in twenty years' time. The investors would be legally allowed to sell their equity once W&G;'s AIM trading goes 'live', he said, but stressed that they were long-term holders by nature. W&G;'s stock market listing begins on Tuesday based on the 15 million pounds that was raised to fund the bid's costs, but the shares are suspended until the bid is accepted and 1.1 billion pounds is raised from investors. Corsair and its fellow investors do not currently have any obligation to stay on after a flotation. The IPO (stock market sale) is the beginning of the process, not the end, said Maltby. Each of the investors is very long term and expect to continue to be investors long after the IPO. Both bidders see room for significant growth in the small business market, where the branches have a 5 percent market share, but neither would give details of their target market share. AnaCap/Blackstone said it has experience in SME lending through AnaCap's investment in UK SME lender Aldermore. The grouping's proposed management team, former Lloyds executive Mike Fairey and former First Direct boss Alan Hughes, have track records running major UK retail and SME banks, the statement added. Both Higginson and Maltby said jobs would increase under their plans and that they had no plan to follow a Europe-wide branch cutting trend that saw 5,500 outlets eliminated last year. We have no plans to slash the branch network, said Higginson, adding that they would institute longer, Tesco-style opening hours if that's what customers want.

Officials from Richard Stockton College in nearby Galloway Township, said in a statement they plan to convert some of the 1.4 million square foot building into dormitory space. The Showboat has 1,329 hotel rooms and sits on 28 beachfront acres. Four Atlantic City casinos have closed this year, and city officials have struggled find uses for the shuttered buildings. The former casino floor would be converted to administrative offices. Theaters at the building would, under the college's plans, house facilities for dance, music and drama programs, the school said. One of the three towers will remain a hotel holding some 479 rooms opening sometime in the spring of 2015. The college said dorm rooms could be used as hotel rooms during summer months, when demand is high and most students are away from campus. The college said the purchase price is far less expensive than new construction. The purchase was announced in November. Gaming companies, fearing new competition, have typically inserted deed restrictions prohibiting new owners from re-opening the properties as casinos. The diversification of activities available in AC stands to benefit all of the city's stakeholders, said Caesars Entertainment CEO Gary Loveman in a statement. Caesars Entertainment closed Showboat in August, even though it was profitable, to try to consolidate Atlantic City's deteriorating gaming market. Stockton College purchased the Seaview Resort in Galloway Township in 2010 for $20 million. It uses part of the property to train students in hospitality and generate revenue for the college, and to house students.

I am more than confident - 100 percent confident, we're 1,000 percent confident that my colleagues here in the States will achieve that goal within a couple of years, Masaaki Tanaka, deputy president of MUFG, told Reuters in an interview. Tanaka, a key architect of the Japanese lender's expansion strategy, said MUFG does not have a particular target and did not say how big a deal it was prepared to fund. However, he said it is open to buying a bank on the West Coast, where its retail arm is based, or in other parts of the United States, to reach its top-10 target. MUFG management will provide capital if they need it, we will provide very strong support to the people who are running the show, said Tanaka. MUFG has been trying to grow its footprint outside of Japan for several years because the country's aging population offers dimmer growth prospects than countries abroad. Tanaka and Kyota Omori, who was then head of MUFG's U.S. operations, first set a goal of becoming a top-10 U.S. bank in 2007. MUFG has since made a series of acquisitions and developed strategic partnerships with Morgan Stanley (MS.N) in pursuit of that goal, which is internally dubbed Project Leones. Bankers and analysts have been predicting further consolidation in the U.S. banking sector for years, arguing that revenue pressure and new regulatory expenses will force smaller banks to merge or be acquired by larger rivals. However, few major deals have been struck since the 2007-2009 crisis, either because parties are wide apart on pricing, or because of regulatory scrutiny. Beyond acquisitions, MUFG is looking to expand its corporate lending through a partnership with Morgan Stanley, and its middle-market lending through its San Francisco-based retail banking arm, called UnionBanCal Corp. MUFG is in the process of integrating UnionBanCal with its MUFG Americas division, which is based in New York. Combined, the two entities would rank as No. 12 among the country's largest banks, behind large regional lenders like SunTrust Banks Inc (STI.N) and BB&T; Corp (BBT.N), according to data provided by MUFG. The UnionBanCal franchise alone had 420 U.S. branches, $80 billion worth of deposits and $106 billion in assets as of December 31, according to its web site. Editing by David Gregorio"

The investment will help Bank of Ayudhya, controlled by Japan's Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), to maintain its leading position in consumer finance and gain more share in mortgage lending, President and Chief Executive Officer, Noriaki Goto, told reporters. Bank of Ayudhya is one of the few Thai banks that have announced aggressive expansion plans as lenders are more cautious about investment due to weak domestic consumption and slower-than-expected economic growth. The bank would invest 2-3 billion baht per year on information technology upgrades and open 100 new branches, spending 8-10 million baht per new branch, Goto said. That will take its total number of branches to 755, closer to the top four Thai banks' average of 1,200 branches, he said. We have aspiration to be a top tier financial group in Thailand, Goto said during his first press conference after the integration with MUFG was completed in January. Its closest rival, fourth-ranked Kasikornbank, had 1,124 branches at end-2014. With assets of 1.6 trillion baht, Bank of Ayudhya is the market leader in the personal loan and credit card businesses with a share of 27 percent and 15 percent, respectively. Retail loans account for 40 percent of its total assets, with 60 percent from corporates and small and medium-sized business. Bank of Ayudhya, 76.88 percent owned by MUFG, is also looking for opportunities to expand into auto and consumer lending businesses in Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam as part of its three-year business expansion, he said.

Officials gave no details on when specific initiatives will be implemented but the government has said most will be introduced in the next three years. The Shanghai FTZ, which covers an area of nearly 29 sq km on the eastern outskirts of the commercial hub, was approved by China's State Council, or cabinet, in July. State-run Xinhua news agency quoted Commerce Minister Gao Hucheng as saying that the creation of the FTZ was a crucial decision for China's next wave of reform and opening-up. It follows the trend of global economic developments and reflects a more active strategy of opening-up, Gao said at the launch ceremony. The State Council said on Friday it would open up its largely sheltered services sector to foreign competition in the zone and use it as a test bed for bold financial reforms, including a convertible yuan and liberalized interest rates. Economists consider both areas key levers for restructuring the world's second-largest economy and putting it on a more sustainable growth path. Some Chinese and foreign firms are already setting up subsidiaries in the zone. A total of 25 companies so far have been approved to start operations in a variety of sectors, alongside 11 financial institutions, most of which are domestic banks but including the mainland subsidiaries of Citibank and DBS. Ralph Haupter, corporate vice president of Microsoft Corp, speaking on the sidelines of the opening ceremony, said Microsoft was excited about the zone's potential. Details and sizes of business are hard to predict at this stage. But business is continuously growing and the entertainment business is very important for us at Microsoft. A Xinhua report quoted a document from China's Ministry of Culture saying the ministry would remove a 13-year old ban on video game console manufacture and sale for companies registered in the zone, provided the products were approved. Foreign game machine manufacturers will be eligible to sell their products in China, merely via their entities registered in the zone, the report said. High Hopes, or Not? Some have compared the FTZ, which integrates three existing zones, to Deng Xiaoping's creation of a similar zone in Shenzhen in 1978 which was crucial to China's economy opening up to foreign trade and investment. Optimism among mainland investors that the zone will trigger fresh investment and infrastructure spending has sent property prices and FTZ-related stocks soaring in recent weeks. Skeptics point to a similar scheme launched last year near Shenzhen, in Qianhai, that so far has failed to meet expectations. But analysts and economists say that the Shanghai plan is more ambitious and specific, such as in regulations on how foreign and Chinese individuals can invest across borders. Foreign and Chinese investors have only been allowed to invest cross-border by buying into funds regulated through either the Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (QFII) program or the Qualified Domestic Institutional Investor (QDII) program, both of which are restricted by quotas. But Dai Haibo, deputy director of the zone administrative committee, said on Sunday foreigners and Chinese in the zone would be allowed to invest funds directly for the first time. He did not say whether they would also be subject to a quota. Shanghai Municipality Communist Party Secretary Han Zheng inaugurates the Shanghai Free Trade Zone during a ceremony in Pudong district, Shanghai September 29, 2013.Carlos BarriaHe also said that foreign banks in the zone would be allowed to issue bonds in the domestic market. Officials said China would develop an international oil futures trading platform in the zone and encourage foreign participation, part of attempts to upgrade commodities markets and hedge risk in the world's largest energy consumer. The insurance regulator added on Sunday that it would support allowing foreign health insurance providers to operate in the zone and would also back the development of yuan-denominated cross-border reinsurance, among other reforms. Regulatory Requirements for Foreign Banks Regulations of Chinese and foreign banks will also be eased, said Liao Min, head of the Shanghai branch of the China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC), adding the CBRC will adjust loan-to-deposit ratios and other regulatory requirements related to cross-border financing for banks in the zone. Cross-border financing could potentially drastically reduce funding costs for Chinese firms and expose domestic banks to more foreign competition, but would also provide Chinese banks an outlet to find new clients overseas. Slideshow (5 Images)Liao said that the government would consider easing regulatory requirements for foreign banks when they apply to upgrade representative offices to full-fledged branches in the zone, and it would accelerate the application process for foreign banks applying for yuan settlement licenses. Both functions are key for foreign banks seeking to do business in China, and the slow pace of approval has been a subject of frequent complaints from foreign bankers. Given the mixed history of other capital account reform projects and the current speculative environment, regulators have been signaling caution in recent weeks. The project is widely considered to be a pet program of Premier Li Keqiang but he did not attend the opening ceremony. The heads of the central bank and the foreign exchange regulator were also absent. The highest ranking official from the central government was Commerce Minister Gao. State media have run commentaries warning against undue property speculation, and have said that the most dramatic reforms were unlikely to be enacted this year. All reforms to interest rate and exchange rate systems will be based on the premise of risk control, Zhang Xin, head of the Shanghai branch of the People's Bank of China, told a press conference on Sunday. Experts also doubt Beijing will be able to implement major changes in the zone without them spilling over into the rest of the country. Numerous high profile academics and officials have argued publicly against introducing them in this way. There have also been reports of bureaucratic turf wars over which agency will drive financial reform. Liao Qun, China chief economist at Citic Bank International, said the tone of the master planning document remains cautious given the challenges. Liberalization may not be realized all at once. Foreign investors continue to await the publication of a negative list of banned investment targets and industries. In the past foreign investors were put off by vague explanations of what industries could be invested in and what remained off limits. The negative list concept would allow free foreign investment in any industry not specifically on the list. Shanghai government officials told Reuters the list would be published at some point on Sunday. Reuters was unable to find such a list on any major government website at time of reporting.

The largest Islamic bank in the United Arab Emirates will start operating at a time when Kenyan banks have come under closer scrutiny from the regulator because of increasing bad debts, prompting officials and analysts to conclude the sector is ripe for consolidation. Three medium-sized and small banks have been taken over by the regulator since August last year, with the latest, Chase Bank Kenya, taken over earlier this month after a run on deposits. In November the central bank placed a moratorium on the licensing of new commercial banks in an attempt to bring stability to an industry that has more than 40 banks. But DIB had been in talks with the regulator before then, meaning a decision on its licence would not be affected by the moratorium, the sources said. DIB is now awaiting the final go-ahead from Kenya's central bank, said the sources, as it has already been granted outline approval for a commercial banking licence having planned to open in Kenya last year, only to find the process had taken longer than expected. In a statement the central bank said on Monday it was processing an application for a banking licence from DIB Bank Kenya, without elaborating. A separate source at the central bank said DIB was one of a couple of banks expected to start operations in the country this year. No one at DIB responded to a request for comment. DIB has already recruited staff for its Kenyan operation, which will initially comprise three branches offering consumer, corporate and treasury services, the sources said. Kenya will not be DIB's first foray overseas. It holds stakes in banks in Pakistan, Sudan, Jordan, Bosnia and late last year raised its stake in Bank Panin Syariah, the Indonesian sharia-compliant lender, to 39.6 percent, according to a presentation on the bank's website. It would become the third Islamic lender to operate in Kenya, where Muslims account for about 10 percent of the population of some 44 million.   (Editing by Greg Mahlich)"

The digital factory will have more than 350 employees, including existing staff and new hires. It will open its doors in the middle of next year. The hub is expected to use technology to simplify banking and will be predominantly focused on products for Scotiabank. The center also looks to partner with fintech companies and startups. The move comes amid increasing competition from technology startups and online lenders who have started to cut into segments that have been historically dominated by the big banks. Several of Canada's major lenders have been trimming costs and pulling back in traditional areas such as retail branches while beefing up their efforts on technology. It's critical that we bring new skills into the organization. Clearly, we see the factory as a way to attract new talent, Michael Zerbs, co-head of information technology at Scotiabank, said in an interview. It's really one part of a much larger technology initiative. Zerbs declined to say how much Scotiabank plans to spend on the initiative. While this is the company's first major digital hub, there might be an opportunity to export the technology to the bank's international locations, which include Mexico, Chile, Colombia and Peru, he said. Earlier this year, Chief Financial Officer Sean McGuckin told Reuters that Scotiabank was planning to step up investments in technology over the next three years.

Having your own software is a key driver of efficiency, Amundi's chief executive officer Yves Perrier was quoted as saying by Financal News on Wednesday. BlackRock's Aladdin operating system is used by asset managers to help manage the risk in their portfolios and assist them in trading, data management and other operations. BlackRock is the world's largest asset manager. An Amundi spokeswoman confirmed the change and said that migration of Pioneer to Amundi's system was expected to be completed by the beginning of the first quarter of 2019. Amundi bought Pioneer Investments from Italian lender Unicredit for 3.54 billion euros ($4.1 billion) this year. The French group expects the acquisition to deliver 150 million euros in cost synergies and 30 million euros in revenue synergies over a full year, starting from completion of the integration process, which will take two years. More than 200 institutions, including BlackRock, use Aladdin and its risk analytics, the world's largest asset manager with $5.7 trillion says. Growing Aladdin is a key priority for Blackrock's CEO Larry Fink, who has placed an emphasis on technology as the broader stockpicking business has come under pressure from lower cost index funds.

News of Daimler's (DAIGn.DE) strategic review spurred speculation on Wednesday about a break-up of the maker of Mercedes-Benz cars, trucks, buses and vans as it seeks to fund multi-billion euro autonomous and electric car investments.  We recommend taking this communication very seriously, analysts at Evercore ISI said in a note.  Separating Daimler's divisions could unlock value, with trucks and buses on their own worth 31 billion euros ($36 billion), analysts at Evercore ISI said in a note. The German company's total market capitalization is around 65.25 billion euros, according to Thomson Reuters data. Chief Financial Officer Bodo Uebber said Daimler does not intend to divest business divisions, but left open the question about a partial listing of some businesses. We have not decided to set up new legal structures within our group. We have decided to analyze this possibility. We had a small group in our company which was weighing this idea, Zetsche said in a call on second-quarter results. Internal deliberations within Daimler had now reached a stage where markets needed to be informed, he added. News of the strategy review comes as the auto industry faces a barrage of criticism over diesel pollution and allegations about anti-competitive behavior. The automotive industry is currently making headlines, and not good ones, Zetsche conceded. German magazine Der Spiegel reported on Friday that German carmakers Daimler, BMW (BMWG.DE), VW (VOWG_p.DE), Porsche and Audi (NSUG.DE) held meetings to discuss suppliers, prices and standards to the disadvantage of foreign carmakers. FILE PHOTO: The Mercedes-Benz logo is seen before the company's annual news conference in Stuttgart, Germany, February 4, 2016.Michaela Rehle/File PhotoThe European Commission said it was investigating the matter, although Daimler pointed out it was not subject to a formal probe. Companies found guilty of breaching EU cartel rules face fines of as much as 10 percent of their global turnover unless they gain whistle-blower immunity. In a call with journalists Zetsche declined to comment on whether German carmakers had colluded. We are well advised not to participate in speculation, Zetsche said, refusing to comment further. Asked whether such allegations could result in consequences for cooperation deals, such as a procurement agreement with BMW (BMWG.DE), Zetsche said: Since we obviously operated within the law, none.  Daimler's and Volkswagen's (VOWG_p.DE) supervisory boards met on Wednesday to discuss the allegations. Luxury Stars  Second-quarter results showed Daimler's star performer remained its luxury cars division which helped push up quarterly operating profit by 15 percent, slightly below consensus. Mercedes-Benz sold 595,200 cars thanks to a 28 percent rise in Chinese demand. Margins improved to 10.2 percent from 6.4 percent in the year-earlier period, mainly due to sales of a new E-Class limousine. Daimler said it expects strong sales in China in the second half, after its overall earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) rose to 3.74 billion euros in the second quarter, below the average forecast of 3.81 billion euros in a Reuters poll. The Stuttgart-based company also lifted the outlook for its trucks and vans divisions, saying it now expected EBIT to reach prior-year levels for both.

It did not disclose the amount it intends to pay, but said the purchase price would be funded with cash on hand.   Nasdaq Chief Executive Officer Adena Friedman has been vocal about investing more in innovative technologies such as cognitive computing. This deal is Nasdaq's first acquisition since her appointment in January. Other than running stock exchanges, Nasdaq has a large division that sells market technology to trading firms, exchanges and clearing houses around the world.  It runs a leading market surveillance software businesses, which includes a product called Smarts that helps brokers, exchanges and regulators identify potentially abusive trading across a range of markets. More than 45 marketplaces, 17 regulators and 140 market participants use its surveillance tools. Our primary goal with this is our entry into the buy-side market with a compliance solution, Valerie Bannert-Thurner, senior vice president and head of risk & surveillance solutions at Nasdaq, said in an interview. We talk to firms globally who are looking at how they can beef up their surveillance and improve their compliance. The acquisition will also enable Nasdaq to develop solutions that analyze data beyond trading records to better spot conduct risk, Bannert-Thurner said.  Sybenetix was founded in 2011. Its technology uses advanced analytics and behavioral science to help buy-side firms such as hedge funds spot patterns for compliance purposes, but can also be used to enhance their performance.  Investors have been growing more interested in the sector known as regtech: companies offering technology that helps banks and investors cope with an array of post-financial crisis regulations in order to avoid hefty fines.

The Japanese drugmaker said on Monday it was particularly attracted by Neuroderm's Parkinson's disease drug that is in advanced clinical trials in the United States and Europe and is expected to go on sale in the 2019 financial year. It said the deal was intended to help it achieve its U.S. sales target of 80 billion yen ($722 million) by its 2020 financial year.  The deal will be the largest ever purchase of an Israeli firm by a Japanese company, surpassing internet retailer Rakuten Inc's (4755.T) $900 million acquisition of chat app Viber in 2014. It will also be the largest acquisition of an Israeli pharmaceutical company. Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma will pay $39 for each Neuroderm share, a premium of about 17 percent to its Friday close. The deal has the backing of Neuroderm's board and is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2017 following shareholder and regulatory approvals. The price is also a 79 percent premium to Neuroderm's share price on June 9, before the stock began climbing on media reports the company was considering a sale. Neuroderm's Nasdaq-listed shares were up 15.2 percent at $38.25 in pre-market trade. Given the significant premium offered and existing shareholder agreements, we regard a counter bid to perhaps be unlikely, Jefferies analyst Peter Welford said in a note to clients.

Alexey Reznikovich, VEON's long-serving chairman, will remain on the board as a representative of LetterOne Investment, the company formerly known as VimpelCom said. Burns and Guy Laurence, a British telecoms veteran who was chief executive of Canadian telecoms firm Rogers until last year were elected to VEON's new 11-seat board of directors. VEON has expanded the board to make a majority of directors independent of its two main investors, LetterOne Investment, controlled by Russian billionaire Mikhail Fridman and his partners, and Norwegian mobile operator Telenor. Last week VEON said it was making progress in a strategy to reinvent itself as an online player by introducing its messaging and mobile services app in four new markets, including its largest, in Russia and Pakistan.  It first introduced the service, designed to compete with the likes of WhatsApp or Viber, in Italy, where it has a joint venture with CK Hutchison to run the country's biggest mobile network operator. LetterOne Investment, which holds a 48 percent stake in VEON, is retaining three seats on VEON's board, while Norwegian government-controlled mobile operator Telenor holds just under 20 percent of shares and two seats.  Telenor, which has been in open conflict with Fridman for control of VEON, has previously said it plans to sell all its stake that once stood at 33 percent.  Departing chairman Reznikovich, who is managing partner of L1 Technology, an arm of LettterOne Investment, said he plans to leave L1 in September to pursue his own investments but will remain on VEON's board. Burns, the first African American woman to service as the chief executive of a Fortune 500 company, was chairman and CEO of Xerox Corp from 2009 until last year, overseeing the company's digital evolution and its split into two.

The Paris-based carmaker struck a framework deal with Iranian counterpart SAIPA to invest 300 million euros ($330 million) in the development and production of three Citroen models through a new joint venture. PSA, which pulled out in 2011 under U.S. pressure, now faces stiffer competition from Chinese rivals that have grabbed more business in the intervening years - as well as western peers such as Renault flocking back with newer models. This agreement opens up a new chapter in our history of cooperation with SAIPA, PSA Chief Executive Carlos Tavares said. Our aim is to provide our Iranian customers with modern vehicles that meet the highest comfort, safety and technology standards. Iranian car registrations approached 1.6 million cars at their 2011 peak, with PSA claiming almost 30 percent of the market, before collapsing under the weight of sanctions.     The deal with SAIPA, Citroen's partner since 1966, follows a joint venture deal inked last month between stablemate Peugeot and state-owned Iran Khodro. PSA's smaller DS premium badge has also clinched a distribution agreement in the country. Under the agreement, to be finalised by the end of 2016, Citroen and its Iranian partner will introduce the first of three planned new models for the French brand in 2018.

Luxury sedans and small sport utility vehicles jostled for the spotlight along with electric cars and diesel-powered pickup trucks. When it came to industry profits, the trucks and SUVs were at center-stage. Here are some of the notable vehicle debuts at the Detroit show, which opens to the public on Saturday, January 14. * Nissan Rogue Sport. A 5-passenger SUV that will be slightly smaller than the Nissan (7201.T) Rogue, which has become the top-selling model in the company's U.S. lineup. Rogue was the top-selling non-pickup truck in the U.S. in December. It will go on sale in the spring. This is part of Nissan's response to U.S. consumers' growing preference for SUVs of all sizes. * Kia Motors Co (000270.KS) Stinger. The Stinger is a new 5-passenger fastback sport sedan. Kia said it would produce the Stinger after showing a concept version of it earlier. The car was designed in Frankfurt. It will go on sale in the U.S. market in late 2017. * Lexus LS. Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T) debuted the first Lexus LS 400 sedan in Detroit at the 1989 auto show. On Monday, the brand unveiled the fifth generation of its big sedan to a market that is turning away from the traditional concept that a luxury brand's flagship model must be a sedan, instead of a sport utility vehicle. The brand also is showing a compact crossover concept called UX. * BMW 5-series. BMW AG (BMWG.DE) has already taken the wraps off the look of the new 5-series, which competes with the Mercedes E-class and Audi A6. The German luxury automaker displayed a plug-in hybrid version of the car for the first time in Detroit. Like its competitors, the 5-series is losing ground to SUVs - and the Tesla Model S electric sedan - among affluent U.S. buyers. BMW also is showing a compact X2 crossover concept. * Honda Odyssey. Just in time for millennials starting to have the baby boom generation's grandchildren, Honda Motor Co (7267.T) debuted a new generation of its Odyssey minivan. The minivan segment has shrunk since the former Chrysler Corp pioneered the concept of a boxy family hauler in the 1980s, but sales in the segment rose 8 percent last year. * Ford F-150. Ford Motor Co (F.N) will give the 2018 model of the best-selling vehicle in the United States some modest appearance changes, and more significantly, new technology to reduce fuel consumption. For the first time, Ford will offer a diesel engine option in the F-150. The company is not releasing fuel economy estimates for that engine. A new 3.3-liter six-cylinder engine will also be offered and fuel-saving technology that shuts down the engine at a stop light will be available. * Chevrolet Traverse. General Motors Co (GM.N) highlighted two redesigned sport utility vehicles in Detroit, including a new generation of the Chevrolet Traverse, a family hauling SUV that will compete with the likes of the Ford Explorer, Honda Pilot, Toyota Highlander and Jeep Grand Cherokee.   * Toyota Camry. The best-selling passenger car in the United States for the past 15 years got a major makeover. Camry sales fell 9.5 percent in 2016 from the year before, reflecting pressure from the shift to SUVs. Overall, mid-sized sedan sales in the United States fell 10 percent. Toyota (7203.T) has been giving its mainstream models more expressive styling and advanced technology, to counter a long-held image for dull reliability. The 2018 Camry is expected to reflect that direction. * Mercedes-Benz E Class Coupe. Daimler AG's (DAIGn.DE) mainstream brand has redesigned its mid-size E Class Coupe. It also showed a facelifted version of the GLA compact crossover, as well as a redesigned Smart Electric Drive. * Audi Q8. Audi, the high-volume luxury brand of Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) showed a concept of a new, large sport utility vehicle in Detroit. It is also unveiling a facelifted version of its SQ5 mid-size SUV and redesigned A5 cabriolet. * Volkswagen Tiguan. The mid-size Tiguan crossover utility vehicle has been redesigned. VW is also displaying yet another revival of its classic Microbus, this time as a battery-powered electric concept called I.D. Buzz. * Infiniti QX50. Nissan's luxury brand is showing a concept version of its redesigned QX50 mid-size SUV. * GMC Terrain. The brand's compact SUV gets its first major redesign, sharing major components with the redesigned Chevrolet Equinox.

VW Group of America Chief Executive Officer Hinrich Woebcken told reporters at the New York auto show that the automaker planned to build a five-seat SUV in Tennessee, but he declined to say when production would begin. The news follows VW's 2014 announcement that the company would spent $900 million to build a new SUV in Tennessee. VW, the largest automaker worldwide by sales, will start selling its new seven-seat VW Atlas SUV next month. Woebcken said VW was shifting focus in the United States from a mainly car brand to a family friendly automaker offering larger, U.S.-built SUVs. At the show, major automakers said they expected the popularity of SUVs to increase in the United States. SUVs' share of U.S. vehicle sales rose to nearly 40 percent in 2016 from 32.6 percent in 2014.  Woebcken would not say whether VW would add additional workers in Tennessee to build the new SUV. VW will sell four separate SUVs in the United States later this year, a figure that does not include the new one.

Steyaert, a 54-year-old French national who joined Adidas in 1999, will replace Glenn Bennett, who had been on the executive board for 20 years and was responsible for sourcing. Adidas said the move, which takes effect by Oct. 1, had come because Bennett had informed the supervisory board he would not extend his contract when it expires in March 2018.

Autodesk agreed last March to appoint three new directors to its board, including Scott Ferguson, managing partner of Sachem Head Capital Management. Sachem Head and fellow activist investor Eminence Capital each held nearly 6 percent of the stock as of Sept. 30, making them two of the company's largest top five holders.  The agreement last March included a so-called standstill agreement between the company and Sachem Head, which required the activist to support the board and company for a set period of time. Autodesk said on Tuesday that Sachem Head has agreed to continue the earlier standstill and voting agreement provisions until June 2018. Autodesk also said that Ferguson and one of its appointees, Jeff Clarke, will resign from the board. The board will begin a search for a new independent director candidate who will join when Ferguson and Clarke step down, which will occur at the 2017 annual meeting or when a new CEO is named, the company said. Shares of the AutoCAD design software maker were flat at $83 on Tuesday, nearly double where they traded a year ago. Bass, who held the top job for more than a decade, will continue to sit on the board and will be nominated for re-election, the company said. Bass's departure is effective on Feb. 8, Autodesk said, adding that the company is forming a CEO search committee and an interim CEO office to oversee day-to-day operations. Crawford Beveridge remains chairman of the board.       Additional reporting by Rishika Sadam in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila and Meredith Mazzilli"

https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ge-ceo-breakingviews-idUSKBN1931UH,GE's CEO choice pushes the boundaries,,"June 12, 2017 /  4:03 PM / in 2 months",,"NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - General Electric has seen the future: it is both stateless and globalist. With the anointment of John Flannery to succeed Jeffrey Immelt as chief executive, the $255 billion industrial titan appears to be doubling down on a strategy that transcends its American roots. Flannery has spent much of his career engineering growth abroad. He's also no stranger to restructuring. Despite the worldwide upheaval confronting chieftains of multinational companies, Flannery has been dealt a better hand. Immelt took over a GE addicted to finance, willing to prostitute the stellar credit ratings of its world-class manufacturing and engineering capabilities for a quick buck. Over his tenure, which started ominously on Sept. 11, 2001, Immelt did wean the company off $260 billion of financial assets, but only after the crisis forced his hand. He also divested appliances, plastics and media. For all this reimagining of GE, which included moving the headquarters to Boston and a plunge into the industrial internet, Immelt has been dogged by a poorly performing stock. GE returned $143 billion in dividends to shareholders under his stewardship, but the shares also have tumbled by some 30 percent. Although Flannery most recently has been running the company's subscale healthcare division, he has pranced across GE's landscape. His corporate bio begins in evaluating risk for leveraged buyouts. Since then, it has been a global grand tour, running businesses across Asia and in India and Argentina. This is evidence of how GE's growth resides in places where thirst for power, transportation, energy and healthcare – all of which GE's products aim to sate – will be in greater demand, even as Immelt professed last year that protectionist tendencies worldwide means companies must navigate the world on their own. The Allman Brothers fan will have the difficult task of reassuring executives running GE's divisions, many of whom probably fancied themselves Immelt's rightful successor, that their future is peachy. Immelt's ascension to replace Jack Welch led to defections. Flannery also will need to reassure shareholders, including Nelson Peltz's Trian, whose arrival probably greased the skids for his appointment. To satisfy these and other constituents, Flannery may have to mine the more radical elements of Immelt's strategy. A merger and spinoff of the oil and gas division with Baker Hughes, for example, creates a separate and listed enterprise where GE calls the shots. That blueprint could have wider application. As the company embarks on localizing geographically, it also could become more of a federation operationally. In that sense, Immelt's murky legacy may be dependent on Flannery.BreakingviewsReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

Blackstone agreed to pay Aon $4.3 billion initially, upping the deal by $500 million based on the business’ future performance. Reuters says London-based Aon expects to earn $3 billion in after-tax revenue from the deal, which is subject to financial adjustments. Aon plans to use part of the proceeds to buy back some of its shares and raise its repurchase option to $7.7 million. If the agreement falls through, Blackstone will pay Aon a $215 million termination fee, according to Aon’s filings, says Reuters.For weeks there had been reports of a potential multi-billion dollar sale of Aon Hewitt. Near the end of last month, Clayton Dubilier & Rice LLC, a buyout company, seemed to have the edge over Blackstone in pre-sale discussions.As HR Dive reported, Aon’s divestiture of the benefits outsourcing side of the business allows it to focus on both insurance and cybersecurity, the latter being a major growth area. Divestitures, like acquisitions, provide companies with opportunities to focus on their core business and grow in other areas.In May, Hewitt added Univers, a benefits enrollment and communication firm, to its portfolio. It could prove to be a wise move as companies expand their benefits offerings to attract and retain hires. Blackstone may hold on to Hewitt — which processes workplace benefits for 15% of the U.S. population — or sell it for a substantial profit, as investment firms often do.​"

The acquisition is scheduled to be completed during the second quarter. Workforce says the deal could be the next phase in small companies like Saba building bigger HR technology suites by purchasing firms like Halogen.Saba specializes in learning and development, while Halogen’s focus is performance management, says Workforce. The merger reportedly will boost Saba as a leading SaaS talent management provider. The combined companies are expected to serve 4,000 customers worldwide. Saba’s acquisition of Halogen is like many technology mergers in which the buyer selects companies that complement their core business. In Saba’s case, Halogen expertise in performance management balance’s Saba’s learning platform to advance HR technology. In fact, Forrester Research named Saba among the top three cloud-based HR performance management and learning software providers.Acquisitions in the space last year were largely dominated by recruiting firms, including the acquisition of LinkedIn by Microsoft and the various acquisitions made by Randstad Holdings, like Monster. Such moves are likely to continue in the new year, particularly in the learning field, which is seeing strong innovation."

The future is uncertain for Monster.com at the moment, as it faces the dilemma of either delaying the Randstad purchase and making a concerted effort to increase the market value of its stock, or getting out now. There’s no doubt that the brand will live on in some form or another. Matt Charney at Recruiting Daily said of the acquisition, Randstad isn’t necessarily just buying some tech partner — they’re doing a fairly traditional professional services acquisition and getting an existing book of business with recurring revenues to boot. Monster holds a lot of value not only as a job board, but as an entire suite of business tools and resources that Randstad can leverage to complete its mission. "
http://www.hrdive.com/news/37b-aetna-humana-merger-blocked-by-federal-judge/434641/,$37B Aetna-Humana merger blocked by federal judge,,"PostedJan. 24, 2017",,"A judge in the U.S. District Court for District of Columbia struck down a proposed $37 billion merger between healthcare insurance providers Aetna and Humana on Monday, the New York Times reports. Judge John D. Bates' ruling cited potential antitrust law violations, siding with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ). According to the Times, Bates argued the deal would have decreased competition for both Medicare Advantage plans and plans on public exchanges. He disagreed with the companies' assertion that regulation would prevent the Aetna-Humana combined firm form raising prices or reducing benefits. An Aetna spokesperson told the Times that the company is considering an appeal. The ruling comes just six months after the DOJ sued over a similar, but separate, merger between industry competitors Cigna and Anthem. Healthcare industry observers weren't immediately surprised by the ruling; federal agencies had been exchanging 'pleasantries' with Aetna officials for months, fanning the flames over an already hot-button issue given the Obama administration's commitment to regulation of the health insurance sector. HR professionals, on the other hand, might wonder what such legal troubles mean for their employees. Previously, it was speculated by some parties that employees would save as a result of the merger due to increased efficiency and the growth of public health exchanges. Of course, this point has become a bit muddied given that we still don't know what will happen to the ACA. GOP members in Congress have not agreed to a set of proposals at the time of this writing, so the fates of current healthcare exchanges are not yet known."
http://www.hrdive.com/news/after-amazon-buys-whole-foods-will-automation-sweep-grocery/445258/,"After Amazon buys Whole Foods, will automation sweep grocery?",,"PostedJune 19, 2017",,"Mashable reports that Amazon's recent $13.7 billion purchase of Whole Foods Markets could make the grocery industry more digital and customer-central. Before the Whole Foods acquisition, Amazon was entering the grocery market with Amazon Fresh, an online food-buying experience, and Amazon Go, a prototype cashier-less grocer based in Seattle. Mashable says Amazon's purchase of Whole Foods will force other grocery chains, such as Safeway and Kroger, to make steep staff cuts and digitize grocery-buying. Amazon also will have other grocers developing employees to be more knowledgeable about the merchandise and therefore more helpful to customers in the Whole Foods model.   Whole Foods is an upscale retail chain catering to affluent consumers whose business model Amazon might not want to change. Average grocery chains like Safeway and Kroger have a broader consumer base that they don't want to lose to a Whole Foods model.  One concern shared among experts is that the acquisition could signal a sudden, intense desire for automation in the industry, as Amazon is well-known for its willingness to digitally innovate on the fly.  Low-wage earners could be automated away with digital kiosks and the like. But like most industries facing this dilemma right now, that shift means the focus may be placed on hiring for customer service skills, so not all jobs would disappear overnight. Like any buyer, Amazon stands to inherit its acquired company's problems. Whole Foods was cited last December for denying workers bonuses they earned. In early June, an appeals court overturned the store's ban on employees' recording communication in the workplace. The bonus case, in which Whole Foods allegedly shifted labor costs to avoid paying bonuses, hasn't been settled. But the charge could cost the retailer — and ultimately Amazon — $200 million in damages, back pay and other penalties if it loses the case.  "
http://www.hrdive.com/news/uber-ceo-kalanick-officially-resigns/445506/,Uber CEO Kalanick officially resigns,,"PostedJune 21, 2017",,"Travis Kalanick, Uber CEO, is officially out, according to The New York Times. He earlier announced that he was taking an indefinite leave of absence, but shareholders didn't think that was enough, the Times said. Kalanick is the 15th executive to leave the company since February of this year, creating a massive leadership hole and questions over who will take over in his stead. Kalanick will remain on the company's board, however. Uber is in the midst of an existential crisis, with both its internal culture, its attempts at innovation and its business model relying on independent drivers coming under fire in recent months.  This move wasn't entirely unexpected since Kalanick announced he was stepping away early last week. But it does shine a spotlight on the mess Uber has found itself in, with problems plaguing the company on several fronts. Internally, the company has struggled to overcome its bro culture after Susan Fowler, a former Uber engineer, exposed the company's issues in a blog post earlier this year. Uber brought in external investigators to examine the issue and provide solutions. At least 20 employees have been fired because of the investigation so far, not including executives who stepped down in response.  Externally, Uber is at the center of the debate over independent contractor classification and exactly how far the classification can extend. The company has so far racked up a combination of wins and losses, but most recently, courts in New York slammed Uber with millions in commission payments and a ruling that claimed three drivers qualified for unemployment benefits — hinting that they could be classified as full-time employees. Naturally, these cases have raised questions about the company's future profitability. Uber is an example of a high growth company that introduced disruptive innovation internationally with its business model, but likely at the cost of its HR department. Companies that don't prioritize responsible HR practices (especially when dealing with touchy employee classification issues) risk sowing problems that simmer just under the surface until they suddenly and dramatically explode."
