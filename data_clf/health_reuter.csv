The focus at a hearing, held by members of the House Judiciary Committee's antitrust subcommittee, was on the use by some brand name drug companies of a Food and Drug Administration program, called Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies or REMS, to protect their pharmaceuticals from generic competition. Under the FDA program, generic companies often must buy samples of a drug they want to copy from the brand name company that makes the drug, rather than a wholesaler. Drugmakers have been accused of refusing to make such sales, and the House and Senate are both considering legislation that would allow generic drug companies to sue to demand samples. The legislation under consideration would also provide for damages for generic companies denied access to brand name drugs. Lawmakers from both parties expressed discomfort with the practice of blocking cheaper drugs from getting to market. Representative John Conyers, the Judiciary Committee's top Democrat, asked how he could help to stop it.      High and rising drug prices have proved a pain point for many voters, particularly those without insurance or on tight budgets. Drug companies argue that they need the high prices to fund multibillion-dollar research to discover the next life-saving medicine. Republican Bob Goodlatte, the Judiciary Committee's chairman, noted voter concerns about the high price of some medicines. While it is imperative that the U.S. continue to remain the world leader and innovator in the pharmaceutical market, it is important that ... antitrust concerns be given significant deliberation, he said. Scott Gottlieb, an FDA commissioner, testified that drug companies sometimes game the government system. Markus Meier, acting head of competition for the Federal Trade Commission, said any delay in the rollout of generic drugs has clear consequences. When drug companies can succeed in delaying generic entry, American consumers will pay higher prices for prescription drugs, he said. Under the FDA's REMS program, 71 drugs are covered by varying levels of protection. In some of the most strict cases, the drugs can only be given to a patient on a registry or dispensed in a particular healthcare setting, like a clinic. Drugs with REMS include Indivior's Suboxone, Sanofi Genzyme's Lemtrada and Danco Laboratories' Mifeprex. Reporting by Diane Bartz; Editing by Tom Brown"

The FDA will decide by Dec. 2 whether to allow Amgen to include data from a major clinical trial that showed Repatha significantly cut the risk of heart attack, stroke and death in addition to dramatically lowering bad LDL cholesterol, the company said. Amgen, which cannot promote the heart safety data until it is officially included in the prescribing information, sees the label update as critical to unlocking the value of a medicine seen as having multibillion-dollar sales potential. We look forward to working with the FDA to update the label for Repatha, enabling us to more broadly educate physicians and patients of the proven impact of Repatha to reduce cardiovascular events, Amgen research and development chief Sean Harper said in a statement. Repatha has had improving but anemic sales since its approval nearly two years ago on the basis of its LDL-lowering prowess, with second-quarter sales of just $83 million. Insurers and pharmacy benefit managers have put up onerous roadblocks to patient access for the drug, with some 75 percent of prescriptions written being denied. Amgen has said after discounts and rebates Repatha's net price falls between $7,700 and $11,200 a year. Clinical evidence that the injectable biotech drug does more than just lower LDL was considered necessary for payers to open their pocket books and start authorizing wider use. In the study of more than 27,000 patients called Fourier that was released in March, Repatha cut the combined risk of heart attacks, strokes and heart-related death by 20 percent compared with a placebo in high-risk patients already on high doses of cholesterol-lowering statins, such as Pfizer Inc's Lipitor. In the second year of the study, the benefits were more pronounced, with a combined heart attack and stroke risk reduction of 33 percent. Repatha and Praluent, sold by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc  and Sanofi, belong to a new class of medicines called PCSK9 inhibitors that block a protein that stops LDL from being removed from the blood.

Compared to their classmates, transgender and gender nonconforming teens were more likely to engage in risky behavior and less likely to have traits that would protect them from poor health outcomes, researchers found. One of our most surprising findings was that the prevalence of a trans identity was almost identical in the metropolitan area and the non-metro parts of the state, showing that support for these teens is needed in all areas, said lead author Marla Eisenberg, of the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. People who are transgender or gender nonconforming have a gender and sex that do not align at birth. People are called cisgender if their sex and gender do align at birth. As reported in the Journal of Adolescent Health, Eisenberg and colleagues analyzed data that had been collected regularly through a survey of high school students in Minnesota. In 2016, the survey started asking about gender identities. Overall, of the 81,885 students in grades 9 and 11 who responded to the survey in 2016, 2.7 percent identified as transgender or gender nonconforming.  Students were more likely to identify with that group if they were assigned female at birth, faced severe economic hardship or were American Indian, Pacific Islander or multiracial. About 61 percent of transgender and gender nonconforming students reported suicidal thoughts, compared to 20 percent their cisgender peers, researchers found. Similarly, 31 percent of transgender and gender nonconforming students reported attempting suicide, compared to about 7 percent of their classmates. Transgender and gender nonconforming students were also less likely to report traits that may protect against poor outcomes. Cisgender students reported higher levels of family connectedness than transgender and gender non-conforming students, for example. The study's findings regarding suicidal thoughts and attempts are similar to what's been found in other research, Eisenberg told Reuters Health by email. Other findings, however, did not show the substantial differences we have seen elsewhere, she added. For example, we did find significant disparities in substance use, but not as great as in prior studies with adults. The researchers conclude that people who work with and on behalf of youth should recognize the special needs of this population and work as their allies. They need and deserve support, respect, safety and love just like all other young people, said Eisenberg. SOURCE: bit.ly/2u34xVf Journal of Adolescent Health, online July 20, 2017."

Long-term follow-up of 1.79 million Israeli men and women examined for military service as teenagers showed that overweight and obese teens were over 50 percent more likely to develop colon or rectal cancer by middle age, compared to normal-weight peers. “The findings from the study show evidence that being overweight and obese in adolescence are associated with an increased risk of subsequent colon cancer in both men and woman,” said Dr. Avni Desai, an oncologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York who wasn’t involved in the study “Obesity was also noted to have an association with an increased risk of rectal cancer in men,” she told Reuters Health by email.  “Other smaller studies have shown a possible association with obesity and adolescence and future risk of colorectal cancer, but this is the largest study to show the association,” Desai said, adding that in past research the association has been stronger for men.  For the study, published in the journal Cancer, Dr. Zohar Levi, a researcher at Rabin Medical Center and Tel Aviv University and his team analyzed data from millions of Israeli adolescents who underwent compulsory examinations to determine their fitness for military service from 1967 to 2010.  The young men and women were between the ages of 16 and 19 at the time of the examinations, and Levi’s team used a national cancer registry to track who was diagnosed with colon or rectal cancer through December 2012.  The average follow-up was 23 years and the researchers identified almost 2,967 new cases of colorectal cancer in the study group. Among men, there were 1,403 cases of colon cancer and 574 cases of rectal cancer, and among women, 764 colon cancers and 226 rectal cancers. Being overweight or obese at the initial military examination was associated with 53 percent and 54 percent higher risks of colon cancer for men and women, respectively, compared to normal-weight peers. In men, obesity was associated with a 71 percent increased risk of rectal cancer, and in women, being obese more than doubled that risk.  Levi did not respond to a request for comments. This study does have some limitations, said Desai. “It is looking at a specific group, Israeli Jewish men and women, the studied group included predominantly men.  As such it is unclear if the results would be similar in the general U.S. population,” she said. Additionally, the researchers didn’t have information about adult body weights, so it is unclear whether obese or overweight teens stayed heavy or slim teens gained weight in adulthood. “The study could not assess whether risk of colorectal cancer was related to adult obesity independent of adolescent obesity,” Desai said. “Also, other risk factors that may affect risk of colorectal cancer such as family history, level of physical activity, diet, and smoking were not reported in the study. Family history is a risk factor for diagnosis of colorectal cancer, especially at a young age.”  Desai noted that although the participants were followed for at least 10 years, they were still fairly young at the end of the study. “The median age of colorectal cancer diagnosis in the study was 49.4 years, which is younger than the average age of diagnosis of colorectal cancer,” she said, adding that 90 percent of colorectal cancers are diagnosed after the age of 50.   The average age of diagnosis of colorectal cancer in the United States is age 72, she added. “Again, it is hard to pinpoint the exact causes of colorectal cancer in young patients, what we do know is a healthy lifestyle can reduce the risk of developing cancer.  This includes regular exercise, and a healthy diet, low in fat, high in fiber, with less red meats and processed meats,” she said. SOURCE: bit.ly/2tDgJgk Cancer, online July 24, 2017. "
"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-pertussis-severity-vaccine-idUSKBN1AC34Q","Vaccine lessens severity of whooping cough infections","","Jul 27 2017","(Reuters Health) - Even though vaccinations don’t always prevent whooping cough, people have milder symptoms of the respiratory illness and lower odds of serious complications with the vaccine than without it, a U.S. study suggests.","(Reuters Health) - Even though vaccinations don’t always prevent whooping cough, people have milder symptoms of the respiratory illness and lower odds of serious complications with the vaccine than without it, a U.S. study suggests.  More than three in four cases of whooping cough, or pertussis, occurred in people who were up to date on their vaccinations, the analysis of multistate disease surveillance data found.  Babies and young children had 60 percent lower odds of severe infections, however, when they had received all recommended childhood pertussis vaccinations. And, with up-to-date vaccinations, most infected children and adults had 30 percent lower odds of severe vomiting, a hallmark of more serious infections.  “These findings are very important because they show that even though pertussis vaccines do not prevent all cases of pertussis, breakthrough cases that occur in vaccinated people are less likely to be severe,” said lead study author Lucy McNamara, of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta.  “That means fewer hospitalizations and serious complications for patients,” McNamara said by email.  The bacterium Bordetella pertussis causes whooping cough, which gets its nickname from the sounds patients make as they gasp for air during intense coughing fits. Pertussis is highly contagious and easily spread when an infected individual coughs or sneezes. Many babies less than 1 year old who catch pertussis require hospitalization for serious complications like pneumonia or brain disorders. The CDC recommends that children get five doses of the DTaP vaccine for tetnanus, diphtheria and acellular pertussis at ages 2, 4 and 6 months, between ages 15 and 18 months, and between ages 4 and 6 years.  A single dose of a different version of the vaccine, called Tdap, is recommended for people 11 through 64 years old.  For the current study, researchers examined data on 9,801 pertussis cases from 2010 to 2012 in U.S. patients at least 3 months old. Cases came from statewide infection registries in Connecticut, Minnesota and New Mexico as well as from select counties in Colorado, New York and Oregon.  Almost four in five cases occurred in patients under 20 years old, and more than half of infections happened in children 12 or younger.  The study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove that vaccination reduces the severity of the infections that shots don’t prevent.  One limitation of the study is that it’s possible people who get all recommended vaccinations on time also have other healthy behaviors that make them less likely to catch pertussis or to suffer from severe symptoms, the authors note.  Even so, the findings offer fresh evidence that the current version of the vaccine is working, said Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.  The CDC changed the vaccine in the 1990s from a version using whole cells known as DTP to the current version, known as DTap, which has fewer side effects such as fevers, Hotez, said by email.  Even though the total number of pertussis cases has crept up a little bit with DTaP, the findings suggest it’s doing a good job at protecting infants against severe cases, added Hotez, who wasn’t involved in the study.  “This is good news since it provides further evidence that the U.S. pertussis vaccine program can continue to work with DTaP,” Hotez said.  While much of the previous research has focused on childhood vaccination, the current study shows that adults, too, can benefit from the pertussis vaccine even if they still get whooping cough, said Dr. Kevin Schwartz, a public health researcher at the University of Toronto who wasn’t involved in the study “The biggest danger of adults getting pertussis is they can spread the infection to those who are at the highest risk of pertussis-related complications and death, including young children who haven’t received any or all of their vaccinations yet,” Schwartz said by email.  “Even though vaccine protection decreases over time, the best way to protect babies from severe pertussis is to make sure everyone is up-to-date with their recommended pertussis vaccines,” Schwartz added.

While previous research has linked frequent naps to better memory in babies as young as 6 months, the current study examined the impact of a single 1.5- to 2-hour nap for infants half that age.  The experiment tested memory by counting on babies to quickly tire of looking at faces they remember. Researchers showed infants one of two cartoon characters with distinctive facial features, let some of the babies nap, then showed all of the babies both characters to see which one captured their attention longer.  More than half of the babies who napped turned their gaze to the unfamiliar cartoon face, indicating they remembered what they saw before they slept, the study found. But without a nap, babies appeared to randomly choose which face they looked at, suggesting they forgot what they had seen before and found both cartoons new and interesting.  “Three month-old babies could only remember the newly shown face if they had a nap right after seeing the new cartoon face,” said lead study author Dr. Klara Horvath, who conducted the study at the University of Oxford in the UK. “It seems for them having a short period of sleep is necessary to be able to consolidate memories, otherwise they just forget the newly learned information,” Horvath, now a pediatrics researcher at Semmelweis University in Budapest, said by email.  For the study, researchers also looked at something known as sleep spindles, or spikes of brain activity thought to be involved in consolidation of memories. Sleep spindles show up on electroencephalogram (EEG) tests that examine brain wave patterns.  Among babies who napped, infants who also had more sleep spindles appeared to become familiar with the faces more quickly, suggesting that the brief periods of rest might influence how fast the brain processes information, researchers report in Developmental Science. One limitation of the study is its small size - only 45 infants altogether. There were just 28 babies in the nap group, and only 15 had EEG data. Another drawback is that all the babies in the nap group saw the cartoon faces right before they went to sleep, making it impossible to rule out the potential for that learning experience to influence the number of sleep spindles, the researchers note.  The study also didn’t find a difference in memory based on the duration of babies’ naps, which suggests that more sleep may not always be best when it comes to learning, said Sabine Seehagen, a psychology researcher at the University of Waikato in New Zealand who wasn’t involved in the study.  “It is possible that some undetermined minimum duration of sleep was all that was needed for infants to ‘succeed’ in the task,” Seehagen said by email. “We also don’t know how effective the nap was compared to, say, a full night’s sleep and we don’t know if several naps might have added benefits.” Still, the findings offer fresh evidence that sleep is critical to normal development even at a very young age, said Gina Poe, a researcher in physiology and psychiatry at the University of California, Los Angeles, who wasn’t involved in the study.  “We neuroscientists and biopsychologists have a long way to go before we understand how long different types of memory consolidation tasks take and why,” Poe said. “But once the job is done, more sleep may be akin to the builders hammering more nails into a structure that is already securely connected.” That doesn’t mean that parents should cut short naps to help babies’ development, however.  “Even if the job that you are tracking is done with a short nap, there may be other brain tasks that the brain is attending to during a longer nap that we don’t know about,” Poe added. “So never wake a sleeping baby.” SOURCE: bit.ly/2eRfhnV Developmental Science, online July 18, 2017."

The top-ranking Democrat on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee is focusing on the distribution of opioids and the efforts companies made to report and investigate the diversion of drugs for illicit use. The investigation comes at a time when lawmakers and regulators take steps to combat the epidemic of opioid addiction, with 91 Americans dying everyday as a result of overdose, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.      McCaskill requested for documents and information from opioid manufacturers Mallinckrodt Plc, Endo International Plc, Teva Pharmaceutical and Allergan Plc. In March, McCaskill asked Johnson & Johnson, Mylan NV, Purdue Pharma, Insys Therapeutics Inc and Depomed Inc for internal estimates of the risk of abuse, addiction and overdose of opioids. The senator also sent a request to McKesson Corp, AmerisourceBergen Corp and Cardinal Health Inc, focusing on their distribution of opioid products.  McCaskill also requested for information on compensation provided that is in any way derived from revenue or profitability targets for sales of opioid products. We appreciate Senator McCaskill's inquiry and look forward to thoughtfully answering her questions, a McKesson spokeswoman said in an email, adding that there was no link between the sale of controlled substances and incentive compensation for the company's executives.      AmerisourceBergen said it would respond to the letter from the Senator, adding it provides daily reports to the regulators about the quantity, type and receiving pharmacy of every single order of controlled substances it distributes. Endo said it received the letter and would provide the Senator with the requested information. Allergan said it is working with the Senator's office to provide the requested information. The company also said its two branded opioid products – Norco and Kadian – account for 0.1 percent or less of all opioids prescribed in the United States. Israel-based Teva in an email said it is committed to the appropriate use of opioids and responsible pain management. Mallinckrodt confirmed receipt of Senator McCaskill's request for information, adding it has previously met with and provided information to her staff and would continue working with her office.

The study of data on nearly 90,000 men found those with diabetes are three and a half times more likely than men without the disease to have difficulty maintaining an erection, according to the report in Diabetic Medicine. Because erectile dysfunction can be a sign of the often silent cardiovascular issues that go along with diabetes, doctors should take the sexual complaint as a cue to screen for both diabetes and heart disease, the study team writes.  “Erectile dysfunction, due to its evident presentation, can play a crucial role in early diabetes mellitus diagnosis and acts as an alarm bell for other silent complications,” said study coauthor Dr. Damiano Pizzol, coordinator of the Operational Research Unit of Doctors with Africa Cuamm in Beira, Mozambique.  Since 1980, the number of people with diabetes worldwide has soared from 108 million to 422 million, the study team writes, and the prevalence among adults has increased from 4.7 percent to 8.5 percent.  Although erectile dysfunction is most common in men over age 40, it can occur at any age alongside diabetes and heart disease, they note. “Too often, the lack of prevention, an unhealthy diet and lack of physical exercise leads to a late diagnosis of diabetes,” Pizzol told Reuters Health by email. Many times, he added, complications like erectile dysfunction lead to the initial diabetes diagnosis.  The researchers analyzed 145 studies that included 88,577 men to understand how common erectile dysfunction is with diabetes. Most of the studies were conducted in Asia and Europe, and half focused only on men with type 2 diabetes, the more common form of the disease that’s associated with age and obesity.  The research team found that overall, 37.5 percent of men with type 1 diabetes and 66.3 percent of those with type 2 diabetes had erectile dysfunction. Rates varied significantly across countries and were highest in South America and lowest in North America.  Erectile dysfunction also developed about 10 to 15 years earlier in men with diabetes compared to men without the disease. “Raising awareness of erectile dysfunction and other related men’s health issues would encourage a much-needed discussion, which is often overlooked or even avoided by patients and health care professionals,” said Dr. Laith Alzweri, a urology fellow at Tulane University School of Medicine in New Orleans who wasn’t involved in the study.  “Erectile function could be viewed as an indirect parameter of a man’s general well-being, both mental and physical,” Alzweri told Reuters Health by email.  In addition to screening for diabetes when men complain of erectile dysfunction as the study authors recommend, screening for erectile dysfunction by health care professionals should be part of the routine assessment of diabetic men, he said. A major limitation of the analysis is that only a quarter of the studies included information about complications associated with diabetes. Also, studies included in the analysis could vary in the diagnosis of erectile dysfunction, the type of diabetes, diagnosis of complications, diabetes health care offerings and insurance coverage, especially across countries, said Dr. Zdravko Kamenov of Alexandrovska University Hospital in Sofia, Bulgaria, who wasn’t involved in the study. “The large regional variations are intriguing,” he told Reuters Health by email. “Cultural, psychological and other factors could affect the reported rates of erectile dysfunction.” Diabetes is estimated to reach 322 million cases worldwide by 2025, and erectile dysfunction is cited as the third most frequent complication of diabetes, he noted. Future studies should focus on other long-term diabetes risk factors associated with erectile dysfunction, such as smoking and length of diagnosis. The exact hormonal, physical and psychological connections between diabetes and erectile dysfunction could also point researchers toward new treatment options, Kamenov said. “Erectile function is a window to men’s health,” he added. “In most cases, one question is enough to open the window.” SOURCE: bit.ly/2h6uZfu Diabetic Medicine, online July 18, 2017."

While some medical glues already exist, they often adhere weakly, are not particularly flexible and frequently cannot be used in very wet conditions. To get around those problems, a group of scientists from Harvard and other research centers decided to learn from slugs, which - as well as making slime to glide on - can produce extremely adhesive mucus as a defense mechanism.  The slugs' trick is to generate a substance that not only forms strong bonds on wet surfaces but also has a matrix that dissipates energy at the point of adhesion, making it highly flexible. The man-made version of this tough adhesive is based on the same principles and in a series of experiments reported in the journal Science on Thursday it was shown to adhere strongly to pig skin, cartilage, tissue and organs. It also proved non-toxic to human cells. In one test the new glue was used to close a wound in a blood-covered pig's heart and successfully maintained a leak-free seal after the heart was inflated and deflated tens of thousands of times. FILE PHOTO: A slug hangs from the finger of a gardener in a park in London, Britain April 29, 2016.Peter Nicholls/File PhotoIn another case it was applied to a laceration in a rat's liver and performed just as well as a haemostat, a surgical tool often used in operations to control bleeding. There are a variety of potential uses and in some settings this could replace sutures and staples, which can cause damage and be difficult to place in certain situations, said researcher David Mooney, professor of bioengineering at Harvard.  Mooney and colleagues envisage the new adhesive will be made in sheets and cut to size, although they have also developed an injected version for closing deep wounds. The injection would be hardened using ultraviolet light, like dental fillings. It is not the first time that scientists have taken inspiration from nature to devise a better medical adhesive. Four years ago, another research group developed a glue inspired by the underwater sticking properties of mussels, but Mooney thinks slugs win hands-down in terms of stickiness and flexibility. The scientists are applying for patents, although it will require a commercial company to then license the technology and take it into the next phase of human clinical trials.

AstraZeneca's Mystic study, released Thursday, looked at a combination of immune system-boosting drugs to treat non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The trial found it was no more effective than chemotherapy in improving the amount of time patients lived without their disease getting worse. Bristol-Myers is studying a similar combination of its two top drugs in the same therapy class, Opdivo and Yervoy. Its shares were down 4 percent at $53.71 in midday trading. So far, Merck & Co Inc's Keytruda is the only immunotherapy that has been approved as an initial treatment for NSCLC, the most common form of the disease. Merck shares were up 4 percent on Thursday. Asked about the implications of AstraZeneca's results during a conference call with analysts and investors, Bristol-Myers Chief Executive Officer Giovanni Caforio said: It is difficult to speculate on a comparison.  He said the trials involved different drugs, dosing schedules, enrollment sizes and other factors. Caforio said Bristol-Myers expects to see some results of its trial in the first quarter of 2018, noting an opportunity for interim results in overall survival by the end of this year. Also on Thursday, Bristol-Myers reported second-quarter results that largely met analyst expectations.

But the solid results failed to impress investors and Celgene shares, which are up about 17 percent for the year, slipped 1 percent to $136.40 after touching a two-year high of $139. Analysts said the results may have come up short of investors' lofty expectations for Celgene. Revlimid sales rose 19.6 percent to $2.03 billion on increases in duration of use and new reimbursement agreements in Europe. Celgene said duration of Revlimid use was now well beyond 20 months in the United States and expects duration in Europe to become similar. It added that it has not yet seen the full sales impact of longer Revlimid use by patients. Revlimid looks to have a bright future, including much remaining patent exclusivity and the opportunity to grow penetration in U.S. and ex-U.S. markets based upon recent label expansions, Cowen and Co analyst Eric Schmidt said. Sales of Otezla, which had investors nervous after a surprisingly weak first quarter, bounced back, rising 48.5 percent to $358 million, exceeding Wall Street estimates of $345 million. However Celgene head of inflammation and immunology, Terrie Curran, cautioned that full-year Otezla sales would likely come in at the low end of its $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion forecast. Celgene provided updates on its large portfolio of pipeline opportunities it believes can drive growth through 2030. The company expects U.S. approval of the leukemia drug Idhifa, developed with Agios Pharmaceuticals, by late August, and plans to file for approval of ozanimod for multiple sclerosis by year end. Celgene forecast eventual ozanimod annual sales for MS and ulcerative colitis to climb as high as $6 billion. It is also developing a wide variety of treatments for blood cancers and solid tumor cancers. Excluding items, Celgene earned $1.82 per share in the quarter, beating average analysts' expectations by 4 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Celgene raised its 2017 adjusted earnings forecast and now expects $7.25 to $7.35 per share, up from its prior view of $7.15 to $7.30 per share. Analysts were estimating $7.28 per share. Revenue rose 18.7 percent to $3.27 billion, above average analysts estimate of $3.23 billion The company said volume was the prime driver of product sales growth with a modest contribution from price increases.

A generic antiviral drug for hepatitis C, which can be cured in three months, was placed this week on WHO's list of pre-qualified medicines. That means it can be used safely by aid agencies and countries for bulk purchasing. Indeed, the first drug sofosbuvir has now been pre-qualified, that means it is quality-assured through the WHO prequalified mechanism, which is very good news, Dr. Gottfried Hirnschall, director of the WHO department of HIV and global hepatitis program, told a Geneva news briefing.  The drug is made by Mylan NV. It joins Daclatasvir, made by Bristol-Myers Squibb , on the list. Sofosbuvir started out costing $84,000 for a three-month curative treatment. And the prices have come down even in high- income countries to lower levels. But in low- and middle-income countries the prices are now down to $250 and less. And that is exactly what is needed, Hirnschall said. We hope that many more will follow, he said. Hirnschall, who declined to name companies that have applied for drugs to be prequalified, later said by email: Four more products from other manufacturers are in the pipeline and we expect two of these to be prequalified very soon. Tenofovir, an HIV drug that is also the most effective treatment for hepatitis B, is available for just $48 per year in many low-income countries including South Africa, he said. In all, 257 million have hepatitis B which requires life-long treatment and 71 million have hepatitis C. Viral hepatitis, which can cause cirrhosis or liver cancer, affects 325 million people worldwide - a figure which includes three million suffering from both killer forms, according to WHO.  About 1.34 million people die annually from viral hepatitis, almost the same toll as from tuberculosis and more than from HIV. Hepatitis is spread through injecting drug use and unsafe use of syringes in hospitals, as well as sexually. Reporting by Stephanie Nebehay, editing  by Pritha Sarkar"

The so-called Mystic study was the industry's most anticipated clinical experiment this year and the news saw the shares fall 16 percent, wiping some $14 billion off AstraZeneca's value. The study was viewed as key to proving the value of the group's new drug pipeline and its future as an independent company, after it spurned a $118 billion takeover attempt by Pfizer in 2014. Some analysts said investors would now focus on whether AstraZeneca will become a target again, although banking sources said Pfizer was unlikely to return and others, including Novartis, might be deterred by the weak growth outlook. AstraZeneca Chief Executive Pascal Soriot told reporters he did not believe the group was now more vulnerable, noting that positive data could have actually made it more desirable. Initial results from Mystic found the combination of durvalumab and tremelimumab was no more effective at stopping disease progression than chemotherapy in patients with a protein called PD-L1 on 25 percent or more of their cancer cells. Immunotherapy drugs are designed to help the body's immune cells kill cancer and PD-L1 levels are used as a benchmark to determine if they are likely to work for individual patients. As a secondary endpoint, although not formally tested, durvalumab monotherapy also would not have met a pre-specified threshold of progression-free survival benefit, the company added. Durvalumab is already on the market for bladder cancer, under the brand name Imfinzi. Despite the negative initial results on disease progression,  Soriot said there was still a chance the treatment might show a benefit in improving life expectancy when more data is available in 2018. We must be patient as the Mystic trial continues as planned to evaluate overall survival. Uncertainty about Mystic had been heightened by speculation that Soriot might be considering a highly paid new job as head of Israel-based Teva Pharmaceutical Industries. Soriot declined to comment directly on what he described as rumors on Thursday, although company insiders said he would have had to make a statement if he had firm plans to leave. I'm not a quitter, Soriot said. I’m proud to be the CEO of this company and I look forward to continuing on our journey ahead and continuing to lead the incredible team ... the only thing I can tell you is I am here today.  Good for Merck, Bad for Bristol Immunotherapies promise to revolutionize cancer care, prompting a race to develop treatments in a market expected to be worth tens of billions of dollars in annual sales.  Lung cancer is the single biggest opportunity and Jefferies analyst Jeffrey Holford said the Mystic setback had removed around 10 to 15 percent of AstraZeneca's mid-term earnings potential. AstraZeneca's pain is good news for Merck & Co, the only manufacturer on the market with an immunotherapy treatment for previously untreated lung cancer and its shares rose 3 percent. But Bristol-Myers Squibb fell 5 percent, as investors worried about its experimental immunotherapy treatment that is similar to AstraZeneca's combination.  AstraZeneca - a relative latecomer in immunotherapy - has been pinning its hopes on a combination approach for advanced lung cancer, after already showing that durvalumab alone can help in earlier-stage disease. Durvalumab, which AstraZeneca flagged in 2014 as having annual sales potential of $6.5 billion, is central to its drive into oncology - but it is not the only asset. Offsetting the Mystic hit, the company also reported that its Tagrisso lung cancer pill improved progression-free survival in another trial called Flaura, which Soriot said put it on track for eventual sales of more than $4 billion a year. AstraZeneca has also established a strategic oncology collaboration with Merck to study cancer drug combinations using its drug Lynparza, which is already approved for ovarian cancer but could have much wider uses when combined with immunotherapy. Merck will pay AstraZeneca up to $8.5 billion under the deal, in exchange for half of future Lynparza sales, including $1 billion this year. AstraZeneca is currently at a crossroads, said Joe Walters, senior fund manager at Royal London Asset Management, a top-30 shareholder, according to Thomson Reuters data. In our view, the group should make every effort to capitalize on their strategic tie-up with Merck announced today and strong progress in the trials for Tagrisso. The latest news came as AstraZeneca reported another fall in quarterly drug sales, hit by loss of patents on blockbusters like cholesterol pill Crestor. Overall first-quarter revenue fell 10 percent in dollar terms to $5.05 billion, although core earnings per share (EPS) rose 5 percent to $87 cents. Industry analysts, on average, had forecast revenue of $5.0 billion and earnings of 80 cents, according to Thomson Reuters data. Asked about the fall in the share price to 43 pounds from the 55 offered by Pfizer, Soriot insisted the drug pipeline was delivering and the company's dividend was not at risk. There’s a lot more in our pipeline than Mystic.  Additional reporting by Pamela Barbaglia and Simon Jessop; Editing by Keith Weir and Alexander Smith"

The issue has become pressing for central and eastern European Union members who already fear losing influence within the EU as Germany, France and other western states consider closer integration. Several studies have shown that many of the foods sold by multinational producers in eastern Europe contain cheaper, lower-quality ingredients than the identically branded versions sold in the west. Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico met with Juncker on Thursday on behalf of the Visegrad countries, which also include the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland. I don't like the idea that there would be some kind of second category in Europe, Juncker told a joint news conference. We'll pursue our common intention to put an end to this discriminatory way of providing Slovak people with food products and other goods of lesser quality. Juncker said he would issue guidelines on how to interpret the existing food safety directive in September, but did not rule out new legislation. Food companies have defended their practice, saying different markets have different tastes and that ingredients are listed accurately. They also note that consumers are for the most part less wealthy in the east than the west. Food is about 25 percent cheaper in the Czech Republic than in Germany. However, many consumers in central Europe have become used to shopping across the border in Germany or Austria, and have come to expect identical products back home. Countries from the Czech Republic and Slovakia to Bulgaria and Romania have found many products differ widely from those sold in western markets. In Czech tests published this month, only three out of 21 products surveyed had identical ingredient lists to the version sold in Germany. In some cases, meat products had less meat or cheaper kinds of meat, and fish sticks had less fish. In some cases, butter in biscuits is replaced with palm oil. The Czech agriculture minister has said his country is tired of being Europe's garbage can. Fico said he strictly refused double standards on food quality and appreciated that Juncker saw the issue as a European one, not merely a regional one.

Cholera, a diarrheal disease spread by ingestion of food or water tainted with human faeces, can kill within hours if untreated. It has been largely eradicated in developed countries equipped with sanitation systems and water treatment. But Yemen's devastating civil war, pitting a Saudi-led military coalition against the armed Houthi group, and economic collapse has made it extremely difficult to deal with catastrophes such as cholera and mass hunger. With stinking green watery filth mingled with trash being a common sight in the capital Sanaa, the government is struggling to control the spread of the disease.

Impax Laboratories Inc (IPXL.O), Perrigo Company Plc (PRGO.N) and Alvogen Inc have been talking to advisers about strategic options for their generics businesses, ranging from acquisitions to increase scale to an outright sale of the units, people familiar with the matter said this week. The persons declined to speak for attribution because the discussions are private. Meanwhile, Mallinckrodt Plc (MNK.N), one of the largest producers of the generic opioid painkiller oxycodone, has been exploring a sale of its specialty generics unit, Reuters has previously reported. On an earnings call in May, the chief executive of Impax, which makes a generic version of the EpiPen allergy injection, said it was looking at deals. “We will look, of course, look for asset acquisitions on the generic side,” Paul Bisaro told analysts. “Given our size, we’re going to have to be creative.” Impax, Alvogen and Vertice did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Mallinckrodt and Perrigo declined to comment. Generic drugs, which are less expensive versions of brand-name pharmaceuticals, have become a key front in U.S. officials’ efforts to cut the cost of prescription drugs. U.S. consumers spend more than twice as much on drugs per capita compared with other industrialized countries, according to a 2016 report by the Journal of the American Medical Association.  To bring down prices, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has committed to eliminating the backlog of drug applications awaiting its approval. This could mean nearly 4,000 new medicines will come onto the market over the next several years, based on FDA estimates of drugs awaiting approval.  Even before a potential flood of new products, small and mid-sized drug makers were under pressure as consolidation among generic drug distributors has made it less profitable for them to sell their drugs. Sales of generics by Impax and Perrigo dropped by 21 percent and 12 percent, respectively, in the first quarter of 2017 compared with a year earlier. Analysts expect continued sales declines for the rest of the year.  A merger or a sale to a rival could alleviate some of the pressure through cost-cutting, reduced competition and new markets and products. It could also help companies negotiate better terms with drug distributors, such as Cardinal Health Inc (CAH.N), McKesson Corp (MCK.N) and Amerisource Bergen, which control about 90 percent of all revenue from drug distribution. Getting Creative Mylan and Teva, the two largest players in the generics market by revenue, helped slow the pace of decline in their generics business last year via acquisitions. Prices dropped in the mid-single digits for both companies in 2016, according to their results, compared to over 20 percent for smaller peers such as Impax.  But that scale has come at a cost. Teva’s $40 billion acquisition of Allergan Plc's (AGN.N) generic drug unit in 2016, the biggest generics deal so far, has left it with a debt load of around $35 billion. Mylan NV's (MYL.O) $7.2 billion purchase of Meda Pharmaceuticals has put its ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization around 3.7, well above its target of 3. Mylan and Teva did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Meanwhile, private equity firms are generally hesitant to place a big bet on a sector where sales are dropping so sharply, the people familiar with the matter said.  That means the companies most intent on M&A; need to get creative. “The problem is the obvious consolidators are too levered to do anything,” said Randall Stanicky, an analyst at RBC. “What we could see instead are some mergers of equals or other transactions that could be a little bit less typical in their structure.”  Perrigo, for example, has considered spinning off its generics business and merging into another generic drug maker, such as Impax Labs, the sources said, adding that it is not currently holding any talks with potential deal partners. Alvogen has assessed similar strategies, the people said, including a reverse merger for its U.S. generics business. A reverse merger involves a private company buying a public group to bypass the need to list on an exchange. Another option is to seek out less obvious buyers, particularly from overseas. Indian drug makers, such as Lupin Ltd (LUPN.NS) and Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (SUN.NS), could be among the biggest beneficiaries of the U.S. generic drug makers shakeup. Their extensive pipelines of new drugs awaiting FDA approval and  healthy balance sheets could position them to comfortably acquire struggling U.S. peers, one of the people said. He declined to be named because he is not authorized to talk to the media. Lupin and Sun Pharma did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Other potential buyers are Chinese firms looking for ways to move capital outside of the country, the people added. Chinese conglomerate Sanpower Group Co Ltd [SPGCL.UL] recently acquired Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc’s Dendreon business for around $819.9 million, far more than the $300 million Valeant paid when it bought it out of bankruptcy in 2015.

Vaccination rules are being tightened across Europe, where a decline in immunization has caused a spike in diseases such as measles, chicken pox and mumps, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). In European Union state Romania, the ministry said 224,202 children aged 9 months to 9 years had yet to be vaccinated against measles, a highly contagious virus that spreads through direct contact and through the air and that remains one of the biggest killers of children worldwide. Since a measles outbreak started in Feb. 2016, Romania has reported 8,246 cases of both children and adults, including 32 deaths across the country but especially in some western counties where the vaccination rate was below 50 percent. The decline in immunization rates accelerated over the last two years as parents failed to register with family physicians, refused vaccination for their children but also because of regular shortages of the vaccine.  The lack of a clear nationwide record of children eligible for vaccines was a problem, as thousands of villages in Romania did not have access to basic healthcare and family doctors. The country's Roma minority was especially at risk. On Wednesday, the health minister fired the county managers in areas with low vaccination rates and said a draft of a vaccination law would soon be discussed by the government. Interrupting transmission of measles requires at least 95 percent vaccination coverage with two doses.

None of the embryos were allowed to develop for more than a few days, according to the report. Some countries have signed a convention prohibiting the practice on concerns it could be used to create so-called designer babies.

The research, led by Shoukhrat Mitalipov, head of OHSU's  Center for Embryonic Cell and Gene Therapy, involves a technology known as CRISPR that has opened up new frontiers in genetic medicine because of its ability to modify genes quickly and efficiently. CRISPR works as a type of molecular scissors that can selectively trim away unwanted parts of the genome, and replace it with new stretches of DNA. Scientists in China have published similar studies with mixed results.  In December 2015, scientists and ethicists at an international meeting held at the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) in Washington said it would be irresponsible to use gene editing technology in human embryos for therapeutic purposes, such as to correct genetic diseases, until safety and efficacy issues are resolved.

The firm's China unit posted a statement late on Wednesday on its Chinese microblog reassuring customers about the safety and cleanliness of its ice cream machines and other food-making tools, responding to reports and pictures swirling online. The statement, which also appeared at the top of the burger chain's China website, underlines the sensitivity to potential food safety concerns in China, one of the most important markets for McDonald's and rival Yum China Holdings. We're paying attention to the information being reposted today online about U.S. ice cream machines, McDonald's China said in the statement, adding the firm was investigating the case in the United States.  In China, ice cream machines used at McDonald's restaurants are automatically disinfected every day at a set time to ensure food safety. There was no similar statement posted prominently on McDonald's U.S. website on Thursday. McDonald's and Yum Brands Inc, the global owner of KFC and Pizza Hut, have been hit before in the country by food safety scares, which can spread rapidly online in China and have an outsized impact on sales. Media outlets including BuzzFeed, the Huffington Post and Mashable ran reports on Wednesday with photos showing a tray from an ice cream machine full of mold and dirt. The photos had earlier been posted online by a person who said he was an employee at a McDonald's outlet in Louisiana. On Thursday, Chinese media outlets picked up on the reports too. Some netizens posted it would put them off eating at the chain, though others defended the firm and pointed to how sensitive foreign brands were to any potential food scares. I think (Yum's) KFC and McDonald's are scared witless in China, posted one user on microblog Weibo under the handle 'Fei Na Xiong An'.

The last-ditch effort came after senators voted 55-45 against a straight repeal of Obamacare, which would have provided for a two-year delay in implementation to give Congress time to work out a replacement. Seven Republicans opposed the measure. It was the Senate's second failure in 24 hours to repeal the 2010 Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare, which expanded health insurance to about 20 million people, many of them low-income. On Tuesday, senators rejected the repeal-and-replace plan Republicans had worked on since May. The failures underscored the party's deep divisions on the role of government in helping provide access to healthcare as the Senate conducted its second day of a freewheeling debate that could stretch through the week. Republicans said they were still working out what would be in a skinny repeal, which could simply eliminate mandates requiring individuals and employers to obtain or provide health insurance, and abolish a tax on medical device manufacturers. Senator John Thune, the No. 3 Senate Republican, said the party was trying to figure out what the traffic will bear, in terms of getting 50 of our members to vote for things that will repeal as much of Obamacare as possible. Republicans hold a 52-48 majority in the Senate. Any Senate legislation would be enough to kick the issue to a special negotiating committee with the House, which passed its own version in May. If that panel can agree on a new bill, the full House and Senate, both controlled by Republicans, would again have to approve the legislation - a process that could last months. I think people would look at it not necessarily based on its content, but as a forcing mechanism to cause the two sides of the building to try to solve it together, Republican Senator Bob Corker said. That’s going to be the last chance. Senator John Cornyn, the No. 2 Senate Republican, told reporters there was growing support for a slimmed-down approach that would kick the can to negotiators. I think there is plenty of agreement, he said. President Donald Trump meets with Senate Republicans about healthcare in the East Room of the White House in Washington, June 27, 2017. Trump is flanked by Senators Susan Collins, L, (R-ME) and Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R, (R-AK).Kevin LamarqueSeeking 'More Organized Process' President Donald Trump has come down hard on his fellow Republicans for failing to act on Obamacare, something he promised repeatedly to repeal and replace in his election campaign last year. Some Senate Republicans were growing uncomfortable with the chaotic debate. We've got to have a more organized process, Republican Senator Ron Johnson said, noting the skinny repeal would simply delay acting on the core issue. We just don't have the courage and really the intestinal fortitude to suck it up and ... do this right. Late on Wednesday, only 10 senators voted for a largely symbolic amendment stating lawmakers' commitment to preserve a part of Obamacare that helped states expand the government's Medicaid insurance program for the poor to cover a wider net of people.  Slideshow (10 Images)Democrats refused to approve any amendment to a bill they dislike and the vote primarily highlighted deep divisions among Republicans. The amendment was introduced by Senator Dean Heller, who faces a tough re-election fight in Nevada next year, and supported by Senators Susan Collins, John McCain and other party moderates who have expressed skepticism about the repeal-and-replace process. Trump attacked one of those senators, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, by name in an early morning tweet on Wednesday. Murkowski, one of two party members who voted on Tuesday against opening debate on a bill to end Obamacare, told MSNBC she was not worried about the political fallout. Every day shouldn't be about winning elections. How about just doing a little bit of governing around here? she said. Healthcare industry organizations are similarly troubled and have urged a more bipartisan effort. The Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, which represents health insurers across the country, said that if the individual mandate is repealed, it must be replaced with incentives for people to buy health insurance and keep it year-round. The mandate is considered critical to helping hold down the cost of premiums, because it means that healthy people as well as the sick, who incur high medical costs, buy insurance. The group also said the government needed to fund subsidies for medical expenses and provide funds to cover high-cost patients. Anthem Inc (ANTM.N), a health insurer with more than 1 million customers in Obamacare individual insurance plans, threatened to further shrink its 2018 market participation because of uncertainty about the government paying for the subsidies that make the plans affordable for millions of Americans.

Long-acting opioids contain high doses of narcotics designed to be released over time. If crushed pills are snorted or injected, they release their full dose all at once, making them dangerous and valuable for addicts. Toronto-based Intellipharma's painkiller, Rexista, is designed as a unique abuse-deterrent version of Purdue Pharma's oft-abused blockbuster OxyContin, which already has tamper-resistant properties. Most notably, the drug contains a blue dye that is emitted if the tablet is manipulated, which could help identify abusers, and a nasal irritant aimed at discouraging misuse. The company is seeking a label that shows its version reduces the likelihood of intravenous abuse, which is most popular with addicts. But it is also designed to better deter oral and intranasal abuse. While Intellipharma conducted lab tests to evaluate the abuse potential of its formulation, most panelists took issue with the fact that the company had not conducted any human studies to prove its product works as intended. Since Rexista was shown to be bioequivalent and therefore interchangeable with OxyContin in lab studies, Intellipharma believed that conducting human studies prior to applying for approval was not imperative. However, panelists voted 22-1 against approving the drug, largely echoing the analysis of FDA scientists who raised concerns about the lack of abuse-liability data in a preliminary review on Monday. Intellipharma also did not conduct any safety studies on the blue dye in its product, and panelists raised questions about the ingredient's potential toxicity and whether the bright color would attract addicts instead of deterring them. The discussion also highlighted the inherent weakness in developing abuse-deterrant opioids. Even if Rexista were to be approved, addicts could just as easily move on to another opioid, panelists said.   The FDA usually follows the recommendations of its panel, but is not obligated to do so. The regulator is expected to decide on Rexista's approval by Sept. 25. Opioids are considered the gold standard in treating pain that persists despite other forms of therapy, but the rising wave of abuse is taking a toll on the U.S. healthcare system. Health regulators have implemented a slew of measures to limit their supply, in particular requiring drugmakers to prove their painkillers deter abuse.

In a study published in the BMJ British medical journal, scientists from California said their findings were based on the largest representative sample of e-cigarette users to date and provided a strong case that e-cigarettes have helped to increase rates of smoking cessation. These findings need to be weighed carefully in regulatory policy making and in the planning of tobacco control interventions, the researchers, led by Shu-Hong Zhu at the University of California, said in their study. The global scientific community is divided over e-cigarettes and whether they are a useful public health tool as a nicotine replacement therapy or a potential gateway for young people to move on to start smoking tobacco. Many specialists, including health experts at Public Health England, think e-cigarettes, which contain nicotine but no tobacco, are a lower-risk alternative to smoking. But the U.S. surgeon general last year urged lawmakers to impose price and tax policies that would discourage their use. Zhu's study used five U.S. population surveys dating from 2001 to 2015. E-cigarette users were identified from the most recent survey in 2014/15, and smoking quit rates were obtained from those who had reported smoking cigarettes 12 months before the survey. Rates were then compared to four earlier surveys. FILE PHOTO: An exhibitor staff member uses an electronic cigarette at Beijing International Vapor Distribution Alliance Expo (VAPE CHINA EXPO) in Beijing, July 24, 2015.Jason Lee/File PhotoThe results showed that e-cigarette users were more likely than non-users to make a quit attempt (65 percent versus 40 percent) and more likely to succeed in quitting smoking tobacco for at least three months.    The overall population quit rate for 2014/15 was 5.6 percent, up from 4.5 percent in 2010/11, and higher than the rates in all other survey years. The researchers said that while the 1.1 percentage point rise in the smoking cessation seemed small, it represented around 350,000 additional U.S. smokers who quit in 2014/15. Other interventions that occurred concurrently, such as a national campaign showing evocative ads that highlight the serious health consequences of tobacco use, most likely played a role in increasing the cessation rate, Zhu said.  But this analysis presents a strong case that e-cigarette use also played an important role. Jamie Hartmann-Boyce, an expert at Britain's Oxford University and at the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group who was not involved in the BMJ research, said the findings suggested e-cigarettes may prove a useful tool in bringing tobacco use down. Findings from this study are promising and are consistent with a growing body of evidence ... that electronic cigarettes with nicotine may help people stop smoking, she said.

Survivors treated in 1997 were found to have better lung function at age 8 than those treated in 2005, the most recent year analyzed. It's an incredibly thought-provoking study, said Dr. Leif Nelin, chief of neonatology at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio, who was not involved in the research. It's going to cause all of us to take a step back and think about what' we're doing. At issue is the best way to use oxygen therapy, steroids, extra air pressure in a technique known as CPAP, and other treatments to help children with dangerously-underdeveloped lungs breathe better. The findings suggest that we should not rush to embrace newer, noninvasive approaches to respiratory support in the belief that less is always more, Drs. Michael Schreiber and Jeremy Marks of the University of Chicago write in an editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine, where the study appears. The assessment looked at 546 infants born prior to 28 weeks gestation in Victoria, Australia, at three points in time.  A team led by Dr. Lex Doyle of the Royal Women's Hospital and the University of Melbourne found the rate of lung damage known as bronchopulmonary dysplasia was higher among the 8-year-olds treated in 2005 than those treated in the early 1990s and in 1997. Since 1991, steroid use to help the lungs mature has waxed and waned, and doctors have used a detergent-like drug called a surfactant to help keep immature lungs open and working properly. We would like to think everything gets better all the time, but that doesn't always translate, Doyle told Reuters Health in a telephone interview. We find we're working harder and babies aren't any better when we test their lungs at age 8. By age 8, the amount of air the children could exhale averaged 85.4 percent of its predicted value in the group born in 2005. It was 87.9 percent in the group born in 1991 and 1992 and 92.0 percent in the preemies born in 1997. Lower lung capacity is a harbinger of problems later in life, said Doyle, because lung performance peaks when a person is in their 20s. Then it's all downhill from there. Because these children are not getting to the peak, they may end up getting lung problems earlier than others when they get old.  This will prompt neonatologists to wonder if they are over-treating their patients, Nelin said. But how doctors may be overtreating remains a mystery. One possibility is that, unlike past eras, the oxygen content of a baby's blood is continually monitored and you wonder if that's causing us to perhaps use oxygen more, Nelin said. In the past, you might have a baby who looked pink and good and didn't have a monitor on, so you would say the baby's fine. Now you have the same baby with a monitor that says its oxygen saturation is borderline so you might be quicker to put on oxygen or go to respiratory support (when it might not be necessary),” he explained. It's not clear what needs to change, but some things need to be examined, he said. Doyle said his study is not going to change practice and shouldn't change practice. It should lead to people say, 'Can we observe something similar in our part of the world.' We may prove not to be correct. The study needs to be duplicated. It shouldn't change practice because we don't know which bit of practice might be better and what might be worse. The study also shows the importance of investing in testing new treatments to make sure they are really as beneficial as doctors believe. It's really the whole basis for quality control, Doyle said. You can't assume that they're better. You have to check. The consequences can be lifelong so you really have to make sure what you're doing is correct.

Clusters do occur, and if there is a suicide attempt in an Army unit there is likely to be another attempt in the unit, said lead author Dr. Robert Ursano, of the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences in Bethesda, Maryland. Suicide attempts in the U.S. Army increased dramatically during the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, and the risk might have been influenced by events within a soldier's unit, Ursano and colleagues write in JAMA Psychiatry. To see if factors within a unit predict the risk of future suicide attempts, the researchers analyzed data from soldiers on active duty from 2004 through 2009.  They identified 9,512 soldiers who attempted suicide during that time. Most were men, under age 29, white, educated, married and had entered the Army before age 21.  The risk that soldiers would attempt suicide increased with the number of suicide attempts in the same unit over the past year. Compared to soldiers in units with no suicide attempts over the previous year, soldiers in units with a recent suicide attempt were 40 percent more likely to attempt suicide themselves, for example. In units with five or more suicide attempts during the past year, the risk of another attempt was more than twice as high as in units with no attempts during the past year. The increased risk was seen regardless of whether the soldiers had combat experience and regardless of the size of the unit. Smaller units had a greater risk, however. The study can't say why the risk of suicide attempts in a unit increases with the number of past suicide attempts. Ursano told Reuters Health that it could be related to a phenomenon known as contagion, but it could also be due to stresses on the unit such as a change in leadership or whether the unit is preparing for or returning from deployment. While the study took place among a relatively consistent group of people with jobs, health insurance and a steady income, Ursano said the findings may be true for civilians, too. These days, it should not be forgotten that people live in groups, communities and families, he said. The Israeli Defense Force tackled the issue of suicide attempts by making sure there was a culture of help-seeking, said Dr. John Mann, of the Columbia University Medical Center and the New York State Psychiatric Institute in New York City. We have seen in militaries - like the Israeli Defense Force - a substantial decrease in suicide rates, said Mann, who was not involved in the new study. We’ve seen that at a time when the suicide rates went up in the U.S. military. We can try to learn from other places about things that affect suicide rates. People should encourage those at risk to seek help, he said. Ursano said one avenue for future research is to look at ways to address the risk of suicide attempts at a group level - instead of focusing on individuals. Think about the stresses on the community the person belongs to as well as the individual, he said. SOURCE: bit.ly/2uDbJJN and bit.ly/2uD47XF JAMA Psychiatry, online July 26, 2017."

Medication mistakes outside of hospitals and other healthcare facilities - mostly at home - led to the deaths of 414 people during the 13 years studied, the study found.  More than one-third of the fatal mistakes were related to prescription and over-the-counter painkillers, according to the report in the Journal of Clinical Toxicology. Another 30 percent resulted from cardiovascular drugs, primarily beta-blockers such as metoprolol and atenolol, for example. The errors involved a wide variety of drugs and people of all ages. Most could have been prevented, said lead author Nichole Hodges, a research scientist at the Center for Injury Research and Policy at Nationwide Children’s Hospital in Columbus, Ohio. “These errors are a significant public health burden with one-third of the cases resulting in hospital admission,” she said in a phone interview.  Most of the errors resulted from patients taking - or caregivers giving - a double dose, patients forgetting that they took the first pill and taking a second, or taking a pill from the wrong bottle, Hodges said. Drug manufacturers and pharmacists have a role to play when it comes to reducing medication errors, said co-author Henry Spiller, director of the Central Ohio Poison Center at Nationwide Children's.  There is room for improvement in product packaging and labeling. Dosing instructions could be made clearer, especially for patients and caregivers with limited literacy or numeracy,” he said in a statement. Researchers analyzed calls to poison control centers across the nation that resulted in the need for medical treatment. On average, poison control centers get calls about more than 5,200 medication errors a year resulting in serious medical outcomes outside of healthcare facilities. The number of calls about drug mistakes rose 100 percent, from 1.09 per 100,000 people in 2000 to 2.28 per 100,000 in 2012. But that doesn’t reflect the true number of out-of-hospital medication errors, Hodges said, because her team counted only mistakes called into poison control centers. Jody Green, director of research administration at the Rocky Mountain Poison and Drug Center in Denver, said many mistakes could be avoided if consumers read drug labels, and if the labels were easier to read. “Patients don’t often read the label, even when safety information is present,” she said in a phone interview. “The package inserts that come with prescriptions are often very lengthy. A lot of the time the font is so small that people, especially elderly, can’t read it.” One in five of the medication errors in the study involved cardiovascular drugs. Cardiovascular drugs accounted for nearly twice as many mistakes as any other category of drugs, and the number of errors increased over the study period by 177 percent.  Hodges attributed the increase in cardiovascular drug mistakes at least in part to an increase in the number of people prescribed beta-blockers and other drugs to control heart disease and blood pressure. Green, who was not involved with the study, believes a number of private and public initiatives likely have slowed the rate of drug errors since the study ended. She is a member of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s PROTECT Initiative, a task force to advance children’s medication safety.  PROTECT has worked with industry to unify units of measurement on drug containers and instructions, for example, so parents no longer have to try to convert directions given in ounces to drug cups measured in milliliters, or vice-versa, she said.  Nonetheless, more remains to be done, especially to consistently label prescription drugs so consumers know what they’re taking and which other drugs to avoid, she said. “We need to get away from lengthy pamphlets and think about something that’s more translatable to the general public,” she said. Hodges advises parents and caregivers to keep a record each time they give a dose of a drug to a child.  “We really recommend that people write it down,” she said. “We recommend keeping a notebook right there with the medication.” Everyone needs a system to ensure they are taking the right dose of the right medicine at the right time, Hodges said, and added: “Counseling on prescriptions is really important, both by physicians and by pharmacists.” SOURCE: bit.ly/2tX3yry Journal of Clinical Toxicology, online July 10, 2017."

Heavy rainfall across southern England in the winter of 2013-2014 washed away railroad tracks, wiped out power in many areas and forced thousands out of their homes, Bone and her colleagues write in Lancet Planetary Health. The episode was just one of eight major flooding events in England since 2000, they note in their report. Seven studies done after 2005’s Hurricane Katrina showed severe mental health effects in people displaced by flooding, the researchers point out. To better understand flooding’s long-term effects on mental health and wellbeing, PHE established the National Study of Flooding and Health.  The study previously showed that people living in areas flooded during 2013-2014 were six to seven times more likely to have depression, anxiety or PTSD one year later than those in non-flooded areas. In the new study, Bone’s team looked at whether being evacuated from home during the 2013-2014 flooding  influenced the risk of subsequent mental health problems. Displacement nearly doubled depression risk, they found, while anxiety and PTSD were about 1.7 times as common among those who left their homes. Among those who were displaced, people who had received more than 12 hours warning before flooding were less likely to have depression or PTSD one year later than those given no warning. In the United States, the National Weather Service of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration issues flood watches and warnings. “As climate change progresses, flooding events are expected to increase in frequency and intensity due to rising sea levels and more frequent and extreme precipitation events. Increased urbanization will expose more people to flooding events and impacts of flooding will likely increase over the coming decades,” Shilu Tong of Shanghai Jiao Tong University in China and Queensland University in Brisbane, Australia, said by email.  Tong, who wrote an editorial accompanying the study, noted that the Australian government is taking steps to put early flood warnings in place. “Enhanced early warning systems for floods are urgently needed because climate change will probably cause more frequent and severe flooding events,” he told Reuters Health. “Affordable, good quality accommodations are necessary for individuals displaced after flooding; local authorities should identify people who are displaced after flooding who are susceptible to mental health problems, and resources directed to those people as needed; and flooded residents should be encouraged to remain at home where possible and basic services (including mental health clinics) should be put in place to enable them to do so.” SOURCE: bit.ly/2uCf2AY and bit.ly/2v01GRn Lancet Planetary Health, online June 19, 2017."

This type of support can include things like talking to women in labor to provide praise and reassurance, offering massage or warm baths or assistance walking to help them stay comfortable, or advocating for them. “Supportive care during labor may enhance physiological labor processes, as well as women’s feelings of control and confidence in their own strength and ability to give birth,” said lead study author Meghan Bohren, a researcher with the World Health Organization in Geneva, Switzerland.  “This may reduce the need for obstetric intervention and also improve women’s experiences,” Bohren said by email.  For the review of existing evidence, Bohren and colleagues examined data from 26 previously published studies with data on more than 15,000 women who labored in a variety of circumstances in 17 countries.  Some women in the studies received continuous labor support from partners, mothers, friends or other family members, while others got this support from nurses, midwives, doulas or other women who weren’t hospital employees.  With continuous support, women were more likely to have vaginal deliveries than when they didn’t have this constant help, the review found.  In addition, women with continuous support were less likely to use pain medications and appeared more likely to have shorter labors and be satisfied with the delivery experience.  Babies born to mothers with continuous support were less likely to have low Apgar scores, an assessment of wellbeing that examines things like breathing and pulse shortly after birth.  Researchers did not, however, find a difference in the odds of babies being admitted to intensive care or being breastfed after two months based on whether or not mothers received continuous birth support.  Benefits of constant support appeared more pronounced in high-income countries than in less affluent nations, and there wasn’t enough evidence to determine how much this helped mothers and babies in low-income countries.  The main limitation of the review was the quality of evidence in the smaller studies was generally low, making it hard to draw broad conclusions from an analysis of multiple research efforts, the authors note.  Even so, the results underscore the potential for mothers and babies alike to benefit from continuous labor support, said Erin M Wright, a researcher at Johns Hopkins University School of Nursing in Baltimore, Maryland, and a practicing midwife at Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center. “This kind of support can help reduce interventions in labor such as medication use for pain relief, which can have a variety of side effects resulting in the need for further interventions,” Wright, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.  “These can end up resulting in the need for a cesarean delivery or use of forceps or vacuum,” Wright added. “Continuous labor support, however, is the only intervention repeatedly demonstrated to have no adverse effects.” SOURCE: bit.ly/2uZmI2w Cochrane Library, online July 6, 2017."

Successful medicines for rare conditions are potentially very lucrative, since prices frequently run into hundreds of thousands of dollars, but patient numbers can be extremely low. New GSK Chief Executive Emma Walmsley announced the strategic review and potential divestment of rare diseases on Wednesday as part of a wide-ranging drive to streamline pharmaceutical operations. It follows a less than impressive experience for GSK in the field, including the fact that its pioneering gene therapy Strimvelis only secured its first commercial patient in March, 10 months after it was approved for sale in Europe in May 2016. Since then a second patient has also been treated and two more are lined up to receive the therapy commercially, a spokesman said. Strimvelis, which GSK developed with Italian scientists, is designed for a tiny number of children with ADA Severe Combined Immune Deficiency (ADA-SCID). SCID is sometimes known as bubble baby disease, since those born with it have immune systems so weak they must live in germ-free environments. The new treatment became the first life-saving gene therapy for children when it was approved last year, marking a step forward for the emerging technology to fix faulty genes. Walmsley said GSK was not giving up on gene and cell therapy entirely. Research will be focused in future in areas with larger potential patient numbers, including oncology.

Eczema, also known as atopic dermatitis, usually develops in early childhood and often runs in families. Scaly, itchy rashes are the main symptoms. The condition can be treated using moisturizers, avoiding certain soaps and other irritants and with prescription creams and ointments containing corticosteroids to relieve itching.  For the study, researchers examined results from 16 previously published studies and found as many as four in five people were afraid to use corticosteroids for eczema. Between one third and one half of people who were prescribed steroid creams but also expressed concerns about them did not adhere to the treatment - meaning they didn’t use the creams and missed out on their benefits.  “Steroids have developed a bad reputation because of the potential side effects that come with improper or chronic use of high-potency steroids,” said senior study author Dr. Richard Antaya, director of pediatric dermatology at Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut.  Common side effects of corticosteroids can include stretch marks as well as thinning, thickening or darkening of the skin. Less often, these steroids can cause acne or infected hair follicles or more serious side effects in the eyes like glaucoma and cataracts.  “The resistance to using topical corticosteroids is definitely partly driven by the confusion over the adverse effects of long term use of high potency steroids versus those of short term use of low potency steroids,” Antaya said by email. “The risks from using short-term low potency steroids are vastly lower.” For the study, Antaya and colleagues examined studies published from 1946 to 2016 that surveyed patients and caregivers about their opinions of topical corticosteroids. The studies included in the analysis were done in Australia, Canada, Croatia, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, Mexico, the Netherlands, Poland, Singapore and the U.S. Two studies compared how often patients used these medicines based on whether or not they had phobias.  In one of these studies, 49 percent of people with phobias didn’t adhere to a prescribed steroid cream, compared with 14 percent of patients without concerns. In the second study, 29 percent of people with phobias didn’t use their steroid cream, compared with 10 percent of patients who weren’t worried. Five of the studies in the analysis looked at why people had phobias and found skin thinning was the most frequent concern, followed by fear that steroids might affect growth and development. Some previous research has found long-term use at high doses may impact growth and development in children.  Limitations of the study include the wide variety of phobia definitions used across the 16 smaller studies in the analysis, the authors note in JAMA Dermatology.  Even so, the findings add to evidence that phobias keep many parents in many parts of the world from using corticosteroids to treat their children with eczema, said Dr. Saxon Smith, a dermatologist at the School of Medicine at the University of Sydney in Australia.  “It is critical to recognize the high frequency of fears patients and parents have about using topical corticosteroids,” Smith, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.  Left untreated, eczema doesn’t just leave kids itchy, Smith said. Itchy and discomfort can be so severe that kids don’t sleep at night, impacting normal development and socialization.  “Too often we see infants who suffer and have not slept for months and parents exhausted just because they have wrong fear or beliefs about the treatment or the disease and don’t treat their child,” Dr. Helene Aubert-Wastiaux, a dermatologist at Nantes University Hospital in France who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.

Three U.S. state treasurers and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters campaigned against McKesson's pay practices and urged it to appoint an independent chairman. The Compensation Committee will conduct a thorough review of the current executive compensation plan and consider implementing changes that further drive alignment between incentives and shareholder value, McKesson said on Wednesday. The company also said it would split the role of chairman and CEO in the future, commencing with its next CEO. Shareholders Teamsters and state treasurers from Illinois, Pennsylvania and West Virginia urged McKesson to take stringent efforts to combat the opioid epidemic plaguing the country. Opioid drugs, including prescription painkillers and heroin, killed more than 33,000 people in 2015, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and have led to widespread regulatory and federal response. Another bone of contention for shareholders was McKesson Chief Executive John Hammergren's compensation. Hammergren was paid more than $20 million for the year ended March 31, despite a record $150 million settlement that McKesson paid to resolve a U.S. probe into whether it failed to report suspicious orders of addictive painkillers. Teamsters said on Wednesday the change in policy would hopefully provide greater oversight and accountability for how prescription drugs are distributed in the United States. This shareholder vote should serve as a wake-up call to AmerisourceBergen, Cardinal Health and other companies involved in the manufacturing or distribution of prescription opioids. McKesson and rivals AmerisourceBergen Corp and Cardinal Health have been sued by several West Virginia counties for failing to report suspicious orders of opioids. Shares of McKesson, which is due to report its quarterly results on Thursday, were down 1 percent at $165.80 in afternoon trading on Wednesday.

However, overall numbers and rates of such cardiac events were low, the review concluded, and there were limitations in the evaluation of cardiac events that limits the causal interpretation of these observations. The review, posted on the FDA's website, comes two days ahead of a meeting of outside advisors who will discuss the vaccine, Heplisav-B, and recommend whether it should be approved. The FDA is not bound to follow the advice of its advisory panels but typically does so. The FDA has twice rejected the product citing unresolved safety concerns. The second rejection, in November, sent Dynavax's shares plunging roughly 70 percent to a year low of $3.20. They have since bounced back and were trading down 0.8 percent at $9.83 on Wednesday. Anupam Rama, an analyst at J.P. Morgan, currently estimates the likelihood of approval at 40 percent given the mixed opinions in the FDA's briefing documents and previous rejections, a position that may change following the advisory committee meeting, he said in a research note on Wednesday. If the vaccine is approved, Dynavax's shares could rise into the mid-to-high teens, he added. Dynavax argues that the higher number of heart problems, including heart attack, recorded with Heplisav-B is due to fewer than expected instances occurring in the group of patients who took GlaxoSmithKline Plc's Engerix-B. One cardiologist consulted by the FDA said the argument appears plausible and suggested the imbalance should be noted on the product's label and safety monitoring should continue after it reaches the market. Two other cardiologists were less sure. While the finding could be attributable to chance, I cannot confidently say that there is no increased cardiovascular risk with Heplisav, said one. The other stated that Dynavax cannot/does not fully eliminate the notion that this is a real observation worth further investigation. I agree. Heplisav-B is designed to enhance the body's immune response to the hepatitis B virus, which can lead to cirrhosis of the liver, cancer and death. The virus is spread through sexual contact, sharing of needles and from mother to child during pregnancy. Reporting by Toni Clarke in Washington; Editing by Frances Kerry"

The bill, introduced by Senator Tom Udall of New Mexico, would outlaw chlorpyrifos, an agricultural insect-killer that has been found to cause brain damage in children. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency denied a petition to ban the chemical on March 29, and a federal appeals court on July 18 denied a petition by green groups to force the agency to reverse its decision and enact the ban. The bill is called the Protect Children, Farmers and Farmworkers from Nerve Agent Pesticides Act of 2017. Seven other senators are co-sponsoring it: Ben Cardin of Maryland, Kamala Harris of California, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, Cory Booker of New Jersey, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Richard Durbin of Illinois and Ed Markey of Massachusetts.  Chlorpyrifos, produced by a variety of manufacturers, including a subsidiary of Dow Chemical, is listed as a neurotoxin by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry. Current regulatory safety standard for chlorpyrifos rests on five decades of experience in use, health surveillance of manufacturing workers and applicators, and more than 4,000 studies and reports examining the product in terms of health, safety and the environment, a Dow spokesman said on Tuesday. Authorized uses of chlorpyrifos products, when used as directed, offer wide margins of protection for human health and safety.   The EPA considered whether to ban it for roughly a decade before Trump appointed EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, a Republican from Oklahoma, to lead the agency. In denying the petition to ban chlorpyrifos, Pruitt said the EPA had previously relied on novel and uncertain scientific study methods to conclude the substance was dangerous. The agency said it was still reviewing the chemical's registration.  EPA will continue to evaluate the potential risks posed by chlorpyrifos as part of the ongoing registration review, said EPA spokeswoman Amy Graham. Trump and Pruitt have vowed to roll back environmental regulations they say are harming business growth in the United States.  Philip Landrigan, a pediatrician who is dean for global health at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, said three long-term, independently funded studies showed the substance was toxic. Chlorpyrifos has been shown beyond any shadow of a doubt to damage the brains of children, especially those of fetuses in the womb, he said. Udall's bill also calls for the EPA to conduct a broad review of the use of other pesticides similar to chlorpyrifos to determine which groups are most vulnerable to their harmful effects. If the review shows any people are being exposed to harmful levels of the chemicals, called organophosphates, the EPA administrator must take appropriate regulatory action within three months by either suspending or revoking the their registration or lowering the amount that can legally be used.  Congress must act because Administrator Pruitt has shown that he won't, Udall said in a statement on Monday. Editing by Andrew Hay and David Gregorio"

They also said the rate of decline is not slowing. Both findings -- in a meta-analysis bringing together various studies -- pointed to a potential decline in male health and fertility. This study is an urgent wake-up call for researchers and health authorities around the world to investigate the causes of the sharp ongoing drop in sperm count, said Hagai Levine, who co-led the work at the Hebrew University-Hadassah Braun School of Public Health and Community Medicine in Jerusalem. The analysis did not explore reasons for the decline, but researchers said falling sperm counts have previously been linked to various factors such as exposure to certain chemicals and pesticides, smoking, stress and obesity.  This suggests measures of sperm quality may reflect the impact of modern living on male health and act as a canary in the coal mine signaling broader health risks, they said. Studies have reported declines in sperm count since the early 1990s, but many of those have been questioned because they did not account for potentially major confounding factors such as age, sexual activity and the types of men involved. Working with a team of researchers in the United States, Brazil, Denmark, Israel and Spain, Levine screened and brought together the findings of 185 sperm count studies from 1973 to 2011 and then conducted a so-called meta-regression analysis.  The results, published in the journal Human Reproduction Update, showed a 52.4 percent decline in sperm concentration and a 59.3 percent decline in total sperm count among North American, European, Australian and New Zealand men.  The former measures the concentration of semen in a man's ejaculation, while the latter is semen concentration multiplied by volume. In contrast, no significant decline was seen in South America, Asia and Africa. The researches noted, however, that far fewer studies have been conducted in these regions. Experts asked to comment on the work said it was a comprehensive and well-conducted analysis and did a good job of adjusting for confounders that could have skewed its findings. Daniel Brison, a specialist in embryology and stem cell biology at Britain's Manchester University, said the findings had major implications not just for fertility but for male health and wider public health. An unanswered question is whether the impact of whatever is causing declining sperm counts will be seen in future generations of children via epigenetic (gene modifications) or  other mechanisms operating in sperm, he said in an emailed comment. Richard Sharpe at Edinburgh University added: Given that we still do not know what lifestyle, dietary or chemical exposures might have caused this decrease, research efforts to identify (them) need to be redoubled and to be non-presumptive as to cause.

It's largely the consequence of warfare and destruction of public services,   said Maurer, after visits to Taiz and Aden.   He called for finding solutions to pay workers' salaries and allowing aid supplies including medicines into the port of Hodeidah and Sanaa airport, both controlled by the Houthi rebels, to ease massive suffering.

Republican lawmakers are in the midst of a freewheeling debate to craft a bill that would end Obamacare, but the effort to roll back Democratic President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law faces significant hurdles. The No. 2 U.S. health insurer and other healthcare companies have pressed lawmakers and government officials to continue funding the Obamacare program during a transition period and pay billions of dollars in medical care subsidies. U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to cut off these payments. Anthem, which sells Blue Cross Blue Shield plans in 14 states, has mostly pulled out of three states, including Indiana, where it had planned to sell 2018 plans in the individual market.  It has until Sept. 27 to pull out of the government-run marketplace for individual insurance. The insurer has more than a million customers in Obamacare individual plans. In many states, Anthem has asked for rate increases in 2018 of more than 20 percent to cover the high medical costs of members. Without the government subsidies, it said it would need to raise rates another 20 percent, making the plans so pricey that they would only attract sick people. That would make profits elusive and further raise premium prices. There's a cascading effect, Chief Executive Joe Swedish said during a conference call to discuss the company's second-quarter earnings. Anthem has advocated for continued government subsidies to make insurance affordable, rules that keep a balanced pool of healthy and sick customers and discourage enrollment abuse as well as the elimination of insurance taxes. We do believe that we have been heard, Swedish said.  NET INCOME RISESAnthem, which scrapped its $54 billion deal to buy Cigna Corp in May, said net income rose to $855.3 million, or $3.16 per share in the second quarter, from $780.6 million, or $2.91 per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, the company earned $3.37 per share, beating analysts' average estimate of $3.23 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Anthem, which sells plans to employers as well as government-sponsored health insurance, said it now expects full-year adjusted profit to be greater than $11.70 per share, up from a previous forecast of at least $11.60. That improved outlook was still below analysts' expectations of 2017 earnings of $11.78 per share.  Anthem shares fell $3.95, or 2.1 percent, to $186.63. Leerink Partners analyst Ana Gupte said the shares were likely down because of investor disappointment over the conservative outlook for full-year 2017.

Emma Walmsley, who leads Britain's largest drugmaker and employs 17,000 UK staff, said she was encouraged by the more pragmatic approach from ministers, but warned the industry needed time to adjust to the coming disruption. Our main focus is to make sure that we are given a sufficiently long transition period, that is really the thing that matters in our sector, she told reporters after quarterly results. The absolute minimum for us - minimum - is two years. Britain is scheduled to exit the EU in March 2019. Although the impact of Brexit on GSK's overall business is likely to be limited as Britain accounts for only 4 percent of sales, the UK pharma trade association has warned being outside the EU could undermine future investment, research and jobs. Drugmakers, which account for a quarter of all UK business research spending, are particularly affected by Brexit because of the highly regulated nature of their business and the fact that drugs are currently overseen centrally by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Companies want to remain within the European regulatory system as far as possible, even as the London-based EMA prepares to relocate to another city inside the EU as a result of Brexit. We would like it to be as much mutual recognition as possible to minimize any duplication, Walmsley said. Earlier this month, health minister Jeremy Hunt and business minister Greg Clark offered some comfort to pharmaceutical companies by stating they wanted to continue to work closely with the EMA after Brexit. Whether that is a practical proposition remains to be seen. EMA Executive Director Guido Rasi told Reuters in April that while a working relationship between Britain and the EMA was theoretically possible, it would be up to EU governments to decide whether to offer such a deal. Being isolated from the EU system could put British patients at the back of the queue for new drugs if companies decide to prioritize Europe, a market of hundreds of millions of people, over Britain, where the commercial opportunity is far smaller.

Previously, Cochlear's sound processors worked with mobile phones, but implant wearers had to connect the sound processor to an intermediate Bluetooth device - usually worn around the neck like a pendant - that would then pair with a phone.  It's the first time people with an iPhone will be able to pick up the phone normally, or just listen to music, without any additional devices, said Jan Janssen, senior vice president of research and development at Cochlear, in an interview. The iPhone capabilities will come in Cochlear's newest sound processor that sits outside the ear, the Nucleus 7, expected to be released in September. Users can upgrade the processor without a new implant. Colorado-based Cochlear's processors gather sound from the environment, turning it into an electrical signal and send it to an electrode implanted in the ears of people with hearing loss. The improvement will help Russ Levanway, the founder of a small IT business called TekTegrity. Levanway lost most of his hearing when was 4 years old because of an illness, but cochlear implants let him hear close to normally in face-to-face conversations. Levanway ran his business for a decade mostly through emails and in-person meetings until Cochlear's Bluetooth models came out a few years ago. It works pretty well, but it's not seamless. I have to join conference calls early and work out the glitches before the call starts, Levanway said. To hear Apple is doing something that connects directly with the implant, that's tremendous. Apple has also worked with hearing aide firms such as GN ReSound and Starkey, which can also connect directly to the iPhone. Apple developed the protocols with the firms and licenses it to them for free. Sarah Herrlinger, director of global accessibility policy for Apple, said a key challenge with implants was fact that audiologists do not always prescribe a matched set of Cochlear implants.

The issue of chlorine-washed chicken, which is produced in the United States but not allowed in the European Union, is high-profile in Britain where many fear that a U.S. trade deal could lead to imports of food with lower safety standards. With talks to leave the EU at a very early stage, it is a also a rare example of a tangible product that could be affected by Brexit being discussed by top ministers, who have given dissonant signals about the issue. Michael Gove, the minister for the environment, food and rural affairs, was asked in a BBC radio interview whether U.S. chlorinated chicken would be allowed in Britain as part of a future U.S. trade deal after Britain leaves the EU. No, he said. I've made it perfectly clear, and indeed this is something on which all members of the government are agreed, that we are not going to dilute our high animal welfare standards or our high environmental standards in pursuit of any trade deal. Speaking later on Wednesday, finance minister Philip Hammond said Britain would not relax food safety or animal welfare standards. But decisions on specific products would need to wait until actual trade talks, he added. As a European Union member, Britain is not free to agree trade deals with any third parties, but a deal with the United States will be a top priority after Britain leaves the EU in March 2019. Trade Secretary Liam Fox has been criticized in recent days for dismissing the issue of chlorinated chicken as a detail at the very end-stage of one sector of a potential free trade agreement with the United States. In his interview, Gove sought to defend Fox's comments. The trade secretary quite rightly pointed out that of course this issue is important but we mustn't concentrate just on this one issue when we look at the huge potential that a trade deal can bring, he said. U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday praised ongoing work on a post-Brexit trade deal with Britain and criticized the EU's trade relationship with the United States.

The Senate narrowly passed a bill on Wednesday that would legalize abortion when a woman's life is in danger, when a fetus is unviable or when a pregnancy results from rape. On Thursday, the lower chamber - which passed an earlier version of the bill over a year ago - was expected to approve the modifications made by the Senate.  That effort failed when one of the more conservative lawmakers in Bachelet's center-left coalition abstained. Other lawmakers were on vacation, leaving the government one vote short of the 67 needed for passage.

The ban was put in place during the closing days of Augusto Pinochet's 1973-1990 dictatorship. Bachelet pledged reform when she took office for a second time in 2014. Although Chile is one of Latin America's more socially conservative countries and the Roman Catholic Church retains significant influence, opinion polls show about 70 percent of Chileans favor easing the abortion ban.

The findings were based on the broadest review yet of the brains of former football players for signs of chronic traumatic encephalopathy. The condition, also known as CTE, is linked to the sort of head-to-head hits that were long a part of the sport, although the NFL and school leagues have been tweaking the game in recent years to limit blows to the head. The data suggest that there is very likely a relationship between exposure to football and risk of developing the disease, said Jesse Mez, a Boston University School of Medicine assistant professor of neurology, who was lead author of the study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. The researchers studied the brains of 202 former athletes who had played football in the NFL, the Canadian Football League or at the college or high school level and found signs of CTE in the brains of 110 of the former 111 NFL players. The condition, which currently can be diagnosed only by taking brain tissue from a dead subject, has been diagnosed in former players including Hall of Fame linebacker Junior Seau and Pro Bowl safety Dave Duerson, who both committed suicide.

The NFL is committed to supporting scientific research into CTE and advancing progress in the prevention and treatment of head injuries, said NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy, in an email.

Dr. Michael Blum examined the runner’s heart rate readings. The cardiologist could see when his patient was pushing to climb a hill or to increase his speed, and when he was slowing down. “I could tell how hard he was working,” said Blum, a professor at the University of California, San Francisco. “I had this amazing data.” Ultimately, though, he had to inform his worried patient: “This is all really interesting, but I can’t tell you what it means.” Blum joined three other doctors who spoke last week on the promise – and the reality – of technology in a San Francisco panel discussion sponsored by Medscape and titled “Technology, Patients and the Art of Medicine.”  Technology in the form of diagnostic software helped one of the panelists, Dr. Abraham Verghese, conclude that a patient was suffering from neurosarcoidosis – a diagnosis the Stanford University professor didn’t initially consider but one a software program immediately recognized given the patient’s symptoms. Technology offers doctors a view inside patients’ hearts, brains and bowels. And technology may speed the diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy, the leading cause of blindness, said panelist Dr. Jessica Mega, who leads the healthcare team at Verily, formerly Google Life. Nonetheless, 69 percent of the 100 doctors in the audience said increased reliance on technology and electronic health records only served to separate them from their patients. As evidence of the problem, the panelists cited apps that claim to do things they don’t really do, like accurately measure blood pressure. But the biggest problem stemming from technology for the doctors, and the bane of many doctors’ existence, is the electronic health record, also known as an EHR.  The U.S. government has touted electronic records, initially designed for billing, as a way to dramatically improve patient care and has used financial incentives to speed their adoption. The hope was that the widespread use of EHRs would reduce medical errors, inefficiencies and inappropriate care.  The effort has failed, according to Dr. Eric Topol, editor-in-chief of Medscape and the panel moderator. American doctors continue to make 12 million diagnosis errors a year; one in four patients in U.S. hospitals continue to be harmed; and healthcare costs continue to soar, he said. Topol called electronic health records “a complete mess.”  “Why do we just put up with pathetic technology?” he asked. The panelists, as well as the doctors in attendance, bemoaned the time it took them to complete electronic records, time they longed to spend with patients. Verghese credited electronic records with billing well, with reducing medical errors and with keeping him out of dusty basements in search of patient files. At the same time, he blamed EHRs for tying doctors to their computers and at least partially for his colleagues’ unprecedented suicide rates, depression, burnout and disillusionment. “I find it pretty incredible,” he said, that with “all the wonderful, sophisticated imaging technology, we still have this dinosaur of an electronic medical record.” Verghese, a best-selling author, is vice chair for the theory and practice of medicine at Stanford University and has championed the return of what he considers the lost art of the physical exam. He questioned how physicians allowed EHRs to take over medical practices without physician input on how to make them work.  “We allowed this to happen on our watch,” he said. “How did we let this happen?” “My sense is that the current dysphoria in medicine revolves to a great degree around the electronic medical record but not solely. I think the other piece of it is everything moving much faster, so many more patients, so much more information per patient,” he said. Blum had nothing good to say about electronic health records. But he refused to blame them for all medicine’s ills.  High rates of physician burnout, depression and suicide predate the government’s relatively recent push for electronic records, he said. He traced the problem back at least 10 years to increased government regulations that turned doctors’ notes into billing documents.  “Then you throw the electronic health record on top of that,” Blum said. “That just took a bad situation and made it horribly worse.” Blum, who leads the Center for Digital Health Innovation at the University of California, San Francisco, considers electronic health records separate from technology. He believes technology has transformed medicine in a positive way and will continue to do so. “The office visit and the experience of the bonding has clearly been disrupted” by doctors having to type into electronic records, Blum said. On the other hand, he said, “patients can send me a note whenever they want, and within a day, I’ll get back to them.” As further evidence of technology’s benefits, he cited a study showing that patients expressed more satisfaction following a video visit with their doctors than visits to the office.  “It’s going to explode,” he said, “when we see the next generation of technology.”"

For the study, researchers examined data on 26,366 adults in the province of Ontario who had a stroke or a mini-stroke and didn’t experience any complications for three months. Over the next five years, they compared how many of these patients died, had a heart attack or another stroke, or were admitted to a long-term care facility to a control group of 263,660 people who never had a stroke but were otherwise similar in characteristics like age, gender and income.  After one year, 9.5 percent of the survivors died or had serious complications, compared with 5.4 percent of people in the control group, researchers report in the Canadian Medical Association Journal. After five years, 36 percent of stroke survivors died or had these complications, compared to 21 percent in the control group.  “The current study focused specifically on determining long-term risk for survivors who were ‘stable’ with no complications during the early highest-risk period right after a stroke,” said senior study author Dr. Richard Swartz, a neurologist at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre in Toronto. “What was surprising was that, even those with no early complications after stroke were at twice the risk of adverse complications, with a 7-fold increased risk of recurrent stroke at one year, a risk that remained high for up to five years,” Swartz said by email.  The findings suggest that just like survivors of more serious strokes, these “low-risk” patients need ongoing screening and treatment to minimize the odds of problems down the line, Swartz said.  This might include taking blood thinners or medication to lower blood pressure or keep cholesterol levels in a healthy range, as well as lifestyle changes focused on a healthier diet, more exercise, less alcohol consumption and quitting smoking. All of the stroke patients in the study were treated in between 2003 and 2013, and the control group was drawn from people living in the general population during that decade.  The study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or to what extent low-risk stroke survivors will experience repeat strokes or other complications over the long term. Another limitation of the study is that researchers lacked data on the causes of stroke for patients in the study, which might influence their odds of death or a heart attack or repeat stroke in the future, the authors note.  “Stroke is caused by a multiplicity of underlying conditions,” said Dr. Michael Hill, author of an editorial accompanying the study and a neurology researcher at the University of Calgary. “These conditions can and do predispose people to other illnesses.” “For example, a person might be a smoker and have concurrent lung disease and therefore have a greater tendency to pneumonia,” Hill said by email.  Even slight complications after a stroke can, over time, contribute to disability or a repeat stroke, heart attack or other serious complications, Hill added.  “It begins insidiously with each minor deficit or disability,” Hill said.

Researchers found that patients who received chemo alongside others who survived for five years or longer were more likely to survive for at least five years themselves, while patients surrounded by peers who survived for less than five years were also more likely to die within five years of their diagnosis.  “Social influence in the chemotherapy ward matters, and specifically it has both positive and negative effects,” lead author Jeff Lienert, a fellow at the U.S. National Human Genome Research Institute’s Social and Behavioral and Research Branch, told Reuters Health in a telephone interview. “It’s a stronger effect if the time is concentrated among a few people, rather than spread out over a lot of people.” Cancer patients who receive chemotherapy intravenously typically spend hours in an outpatient clinic or ward as the drug is infused, over the course of several weeks. These wards often have an open design, so patients see others receiving treatment and may interact with them. Studies have found that cancer patients with stronger social networks may live longer, particularly female patients, Lienert and his team write in the journal Network Science. In the new study, they investigated whether social encounters in the chemotherapy ward might have also an impact on patients’ survival. They studied patients treated at one UK hospital’s chemo ward, which consisted of two treatment rooms with 10 beds and six chairs arranged in a circle, along with privacy screens. Lienert and his team used statistical techniques to build a network showing how much time 4,691 patients treated from January 1, 2000 to January 1, 2009 spent in one another’s company while receiving treatment. Among the patients who were in the ward with others who died within five years of chemo, 72 percent also died within five years. But among patients who encountered another patient who survived for five years or longer, 68 percent died within five years.  The researchers estimate that patients who were isolated from others while receiving chemo would have had a 69.5 percent chance of surviving for five years. Thus the effect of spending time with people who survived longer is approximately an extra 2 percent improvement in survival odds. For comparison, choice of chemotherapy drug is estimated to have about an 8 percent effect on survival, the study team notes. While an extra 2 percent chance of survival compared to isolation may not seem like much, Lienert pointed out, in the current study that added up to about 100 additional survivors. The researchers tried to account for other factors that might explain this survival difference, including the fact that some patients might have known each other already, so their friendship outside the chemo ward would likely be the source of any positive effects.  Another possibility is that differences in nurses working in the chemo ward at different times have an effect, but if that’s true, then the study detected a “meaningful nurse effect” that hasn’t been previously reported and should be studied further, the authors write. Most likely, Lienert and his colleagues suggest, the differences they observed are due to stress. It is likely to be stressful to see other cancer patients who are not faring well, while it may ease stress to see others whose treatment seems to be more successful, they explain. Trying to reorganize chemotherapy wards and patient scheduling in order to take advantage of the findings would be a complex proposition with the potential for unintended consequences, the researcher note. But there are simple ways to take advantage of the social survival boost seen in the study, Lienert said.  For example, cancer survivors could volunteer to spend time with people receiving chemotherapy, and cancer patients can ask a supportive friend or family member to accompany them. “That’s something that patients can control on their own that would take advantage of these results,” Lienert said.

Strong sales for its spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) drug, Spinraza, also spurred the U.S. drugmaker to raise its 2017 profit and revenue forecasts.  Spinraza could become one of the company's largest commercial assets, shifting the center of gravity for Biogen beyond MS, CEO Michel Vounatsos said in a post-earnings conference call.  The treatment generated a whopping $203 million in the quarter, compared with the consensus estimate of $70 million, compiled by Evercore ISI. The company said on Tuesday it may have slightly underestimated the number of patients with SMA, which could partly explain the surprisingly strong Spinraza demand. The injection is priced at $750,000 for the first year of its use but drops to $375,000 a year after that.  Vounatsos said strong U.S. growth for Spinraza would continue as more patients opt for the treatment and expected growth to slow once they shift to maintenance therapy.  The bulk of Biogen's revenue, however, still comes from its roster of MS drugs.  Despite rising competition, the company has maintained its global market share in the segment in the second-quarter.  Sales of Tecfidera, Biogen's leading MS drug, came in at $1.11 billion, just ahead of consensus estimates.  Biogen said it expected the MS business to be the primary driver of future cash flow.   The company said it is also planning to develop more neuroscience treatments, including for dementia and movement-related disorders, as the U.S. population ages.  Biogen said it will also focus on developing rare disorder drugs and acquiring late-stage assets.  The company would explore deals of all sizes, and the largest transaction could be in $10 billion to $12 billion range, Vounatsos said.  Excluding items, Biogen earned $5.04 per share, handsomely beating estimates of $4.41 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S estimates.  The company raised its full-year adjusted profit forecast to a range of $20.80 per share to $21.40 per share, and revenue between $11.5 billion to $11.8 billion. It had forecast earnings of $20.45 per share to $21.25 per share and revenue of $11.1 billion to $11.4 billion in January.

Hospital operators' stocks have been volatile as Republicans march on with their attempt to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare, raising concerns that a healthcare overhaul will curtail the benefits hospitals have gained from expanded insurance coverage. President Donald Trump made a last-ditch plea on Monday to U.S. Senate Republicans to do the right thing and fulfill campaign promises to repeal and replace Obamacare. The Senate will vote on Tuesday on whether to open debate on an overhaul of the law. Results have been challenged by a softer managed care and exchange volume growth, with the London market affected by a strong dollar and lower admissions, HCA noted on a conference call.  KeyBanc Capital Markets analysts view the softer volume growth as slightly negative for other hospital companies.   Smaller rivals Community Health Systems Inc and Tenet Healthcare Corp were down about 8 percent, while Lifepoint Health Inc fell 2 percent.   Same-facility managed care and exchange admissions were 27.7 percent of total domestic admissions, down from 28.3 percent a year earlier, HCA said.  Its equivalent admissions, which include patients who stay in the hospital overnight and those who are treated on an outpatient basis, rose 1.3 percent in the quarter. Mizuho Securities USA analyst Sheryl Skolnick said it was now clear that HCA needed external growth to augment slowing organic growth. And that doesn't make us comfortable given pressures on same-store utilization rates. HCA has been scooping up hospitals from rivals including Community Health and Tenet Healthcare as it looks to bulk up. Net income attributable was largely flat at $657 million, or $1.75 per share, in the second quarter ended June 30, lower than analysts' estimate of $1.80, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  HCA, which operates 172 hospitals and 119 freestanding surgery centers, reported a 4 percent growth in revenue at $10.73 billion, but it was below analysts' estimate of $10.85 billion.

In a surprise move, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in April declined to approve the drug, baricitinib, calling for an additional clinical study. Lilly said on Tuesday the FDA was concerned about a small, but increased number of potentially dangerous blood clots seen in baricitinib patients in clinical trials. The company and partner Incyte Corp said compiling fresh data to address FDA safety concerns would delay its resubmission by a minimum of 18 months, followed by a fresh review of the new data by FDA prior to a final decision. Leerink Partners analyst Seamus Fernandez said he does not expect a U.S. launch of baricitinib until 2021. Lilly said it disagrees with the FDA assessment of the drug that won approval in Europe and Japan, and remained confident in its clinical benefit and multibillion-dollar sales potential. EU and Japanese regulators updated the product's label to include the increased safety risk. Eli Lilly shares were down 3.8 percent at $81.54. Incyte was down 3.3 percent at $133.75. The company said it was delaying a Phase III trial of baricitinib in psoriatic arthritis until next year, pending discussions with FDA, but was moving ahead with trials of the medicine in atopic dermatitis and lupus. Lilly said it believes it has patent protection through the end of the next decade. On a call with analysts, Lilly also outlined a renewed focus in oncology and said it would set a very high bar for moving medicines into late state development. Lilly said it wants to build an oncology portfolio of medicines capable of changing the standard or care or able to become the foundation of multiple combination therapies. It also said it was actively looking for early phase and preclinical oncology assets that can be combined with existing products.

With insulin resistance, the body is less effective at using the hormone to get blood sugar into cells for energy, which leads to rising insulin levels.   About 40 percent of bone mass is developed by the late teens, 90 percent by age 18 and peak lifetime bone mass is reached by the late 20s, the study team notes in the journal PLoS One.  Based on a large national survey and physical exams of thousands of men and women aged 25 to 35 years old, Dr. Min Soo Choo of the Mallum University Medical Center in Seoul and colleagues found that the people with the highest levels of insulin resistance had lower bone density than those with healthier insulin processing. In order for the body to be able to handle the sugar, we need to produce more and more insulin,” said Dr. Vafa Tabatabaie who wasn’t involved in the study. “As time goes by, insulin resistance can get worse and it can lead to prediabetes and then type 2 diabetes. That happens when essentially the body fails to keep up with increasing need for insulin,” said Tabatabaie, an endocrinologist at Montefiore Health System in New York. The new study is interesting, Tabatabaie said in a phone interview, because it suggests that the effect of obesity and insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome on bone health might not just be limited to later life, “which is usually when we start worrying about bone health in older people, but that it actually might start much earlier when people are expected to gain bone during their growth and maturation.” Information from interviews, physical examinations and nutritional surveys was available for a total of 2,750 young adults who participated in national health surveys between 2008 and 2010. The exams included data on height, weight, waist circumference and body mass index (BMI), a measure of weight relative to height. Lab tests to determine blood sugar, insulin and blood fat levels were also performed, as well as bone scans at several body points to measure bone density. The researchers divided people into four groups based on their degree of insulin resistance, and found that on average, both men and women in the upper fourth group, with the highest insulin resistance, had lower bone density of the hip, femur and lumbar spine than those in groups one and two.  Because being obese means the body is carrying around extra weight, which strengthens bones, the researchers adjusted for obesity and a variety of diet and lifestyle factors and the link between insulin resistance and less-dense bones remained. Insulin resistance can be prevented or even treated, Tabatabaie said,“essentially by having a healthy body weight, which means eating a healthy diet with an increase in physical activity, avoiding smoking, and in some patients, medication might also be needed in order to treat insulin resistance and prediabetes.” Sandra Arevalo, who wasn’t involved in the study, said that to increase bone density it is important to pay attention to your intake of calcium and Vitamin D, among other nutrients, and maintain a healthy weight. “Dairy products, such as milk, yogurt, cottage cheese and cheese are great sources of calcium. However, you will want to look for reduced-fat versions of these foods to avoid weight gain,” Arevalo, the director of nutrition services and community outreach at Community Pediatrics, a program of Montefiore and The Children’s Health Fund in New York, said in an email.  Beans, almonds, green leafy vegetables (such as kale, collards, spinach and Swiss chard), oatmeal, tofu, sardines and canned salmon with bones are all good sources of calcium, as well, she noted. Vitamin D can be found in oily fish, egg yolks and fortified foods. SOURCE: bit.ly/2gOfUiz PLoS One, online July 13, 2017."

A dramatic fall over the past month in the number of people dying from the disease each day -- from about 30 to single figures -- suggests the WHO's strategy of setting up a network of rehydration points to catch patients early is working. Cholera, which is spread by ingestion of food or water contaminated by the Vibrio cholerae bacterium, can kill within hours if untreated. The deaths figures indicate that 99.5 percent of patients now survive in Yemen, where a devastating civil war and economic collapse has left millions on the brink of starvation.  We are confronted with the vicious circle where war destroys (the) water distribution system, water is not available or contaminated and people are infecting themselves, ICRC President Peter Maurer said during a visit to Taiz governorate on Tuesday.  To cope with the crisis we need a fundamental change in attitude and behavior of the belligerents, an ICRC statement quoted Maurer as saying. The latest WHO situation report showed 396,086 Yemenis were thought to have caught the diarrhoeal disease by July 24, about 1 in 50 of the population. There were 1,869 associated deaths. New cases are continuing at between 5,000 and 6,000 per day, but the epidemic curve shows that the outbreak peaked about three weeks ago, according to the WHO.  Such epidemics normally see as many cases after the peak as before, however, and the International Committee of the Red Cross has predicted that the number of people affected will have hit 600,000 people by the end of 2017. The cholera outbreak has prompted the U.N. to revise its humanitarian assessment and it now calculates 20.7 million Yemenis are in need of assistance, up from the previous figure of 18.8 million.  Cholera is also spreading in Somalia, Kenya, Congo, Nigeria, Tanzania and South Sudan, where the WHO is about to start a vaccination campaign with 500,000 doses of oral cholera vaccine.  Despite Yemen's huge outbreak, the biggest in any country in the space of a year, it has put off a vaccination campaign until 2018, the WHO said. A cholera vaccination campaign originally planned for July 2017 has been postponed at the request of the health authorities, in favor of a much larger preventive campaign next year targeting millions of Yemenis at risk of the disease, a WHO statement said.

The Senate will vote on Tuesday on whether to open debate on an overhaul of the law, with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell promising an open amendment process and a robust debate. To every member of the Senate I say this: The American people have waited long enough. There's been enough talk, and no action. Now is the time for action, Trump said on Monday at the White House. Standing in front of families who he said had been hurt by the law popularly known as Obamacare, Trump said, So far, Senate Republicans have not done their job in ending the Obamacare nightmare. Even as it remained unclear on Monday whether McConnell had enough votes in the Senate to open debate, he said the vote would take place regardless. I know many of us have waited years for this moment to finally arrive. And, at long last, it finally has. I would urge every colleague to join me, McConnell said. Senator John McCain, who has been battling brain cancer in his home state of Arizona, is expected to return to the Senate to cast a vote, his office said on Monday.

Republicans have been under heavy political pressure to make good on their longstanding campaign promises to gut the 2010 law, which they view as a government intrusion in the healthcare market. But the party is deeply divided between moderates concerned the Senate bill would eliminate insurance for millions of low-income Americans and conservatives who want to see even deeper cuts to the Obamacare legislation. Senate Republicans have been unable to reach consensus on an approach, with McConnell failing to secure enough votes for either a repeal and replacement of Obamacare or a straight repeal. U.S. President Donald Trump calls on Republican Senators to move forward and vote on a healthcare bill to replace the Affordable Care Act, as people negatively affected by the law stand behind him, in the Blue Room of the White House in Washington, U.S., July 24, 2017.Joshua RobertsRepublicans hold a 52-48 majority in the 100-member Senate. With Democrats united in opposition, McConnell can only afford to lose two Republican votes.  'Forgotten Victims' The question for every senator, Democrat or Republican, is whether they will side with Obamacare’s architects, which have been so destructive to our country, or its forgotten victims? Trump said. Slideshow (5 Images)While Trump has repeatedly called on Republicans to repeal and replace Obamacare, he has shown little interest in the policy specifics. Trump last week initially suggested he was fine with letting Obamacare collapse, then urged Republican senators to hash out a deal. His remarks on Monday were among the lengthiest statements he has made regarding healthcare. Obamacare is death. That's the one that's death, Trump said. And besides that, it's failing so you won't have it anyway. McConnell will ask senators whether to begin debate on the healthcare bill passed in May by the House of Representatives. If that procedural vote succeeds, the House bill would then be open for amendment on the Senate floor. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has estimated the Senate's replacement bill could lead to as many as 22 million fewer Americans being insured. A plan to repeal Obamacare without replacing it could cost 32 million Americans their health insurance by 2026, CBO estimated. At the same time, premiums on individual insurance plans would rise 25 percent next year and double by 2026 if Obamacare is repealed, CBO said. Uncertainty over the future of healthcare has left health insurance companies and U.S. states as well as hospitals and doctors unclear about future funding and coverage. Public opinion polls also show Americans worried about potential changes to the healthcare system.

The drug, which blocks a mechanism tumors use to hide from the immune system allowing it to recognize and attack the cancer, won accelerated U.S. approval last August for these patients based on its ability to shrink tumors. As a condition of the accelerated approval, Merck was required to conduct a trial to demonstrate superiority over standard treatment and verify the clinical benefit of Keytruda in this patient population. Despite the failure to improve survival, Merck said the current approval still stands. The U.S. drugmaker said it will continue a Phase III trial of Keytruda as an initial treatment  for patients with advanced head and neck cancers. It is a second rare setback for the medicine seen as the leading treatment among immunotherapies from the same class, known as PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors. Earlier this month, Keytruda trials in the blood cancer multiple myeloma were stopped due to more deaths among those who received Keytruda along with standard combination therapy than those on standard treatment alone. Keytruda is also approved for advanced melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, advanced bladder cancer and classical Hodgkin lymphoma. In May, Keytruda became the first drug to win U.S. approval based on a patient's specific genetic traits, regardless of where in the body the cancer originated, known as microsatellite instability-high cancer.

Researchers found that people who stopped taking statins after reporting a side effect were 13 percent more likely to die or have a heart attack or stroke over the next four years than people who kept taking the drugs. Statins include the drugs atorvastatin, known commercially as Lipitor; rosuvastatin, also known as Crestor, and simvastatin, or Zocor. They work by inhibiting the liver's ability to produce cholesterol while also helping the organ remove existing fats in the blood, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The drugs are almost universally prescribed to people with heart disease. Additionally, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends the drugs to people ages 40 to 75 years without a history of heart disease who have one or more risk factors and a 10-year risk of a heart attack or stroke of at least 10 percent. Despite the overwhelming evidence in favor of statins, a quarter to a half of patients stop taking the drugs within six months to a year, Dr. Alexander Turchin, of Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston and colleagues write in Annals of Internal Medicine. To see whether people who continue taking statins - including those who switch to a different type or a lower dose - end up with better outcomes than people who stop taking the drugs, the researchers analyzed data drawn from two Boston hospitals between 2000 and 2011. During that period, more than 200,000 adults were treated with statins. Nearly 45,000 of them reported a side effect they thought might be related to the medication - usually muscle or stomach aches. From those 45,000 with possible side effects, the research team focused on 28,266 people. Most of them - 19,989 individuals - kept taking statins anyway, with nearly half continuing to take the same drug. Roughly four years after the side effects were reported, 3,677 patients had died or suffered a heart attack or stroke. Among those who continued to take their statins, 12.2 percent fell into that group, compared to 13.9 percent of those who stopped statins after a possible side effect. Overall, the researchers found that people who stopped taking statins after a possible side effect were 13 percent more likely to die or have heart attack or stroke during the study period than people who kept taking their medicine. The new findings expand on previous studies showing people benefit when they continue to take their statins, said Dr. Robert Rosenson, a professor of cardiology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. Rosenson, who was not involved with the new study, said it's important for patients to tell their doctors about any possible side effects from statins, because there may be other options. There are many different generic statins that can be tried, he told Reuters Health. Alternatively, he said, doctors may try giving a smaller dose of the drug. Turchin told Reuters Health that doctors do sometimes take people off statins, depending on the severity of the side effects, the person's risk of cardiovascular disease, and other factors. All of these different aspects should be taken into account in the discussion between patients and their physicians, he said. In an editorial accompanying the new study, Dr. Steven Nissen of the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio writes that some people may steer clear of statins due to misinformation published online or promoted in fad diets. We must work together to educate the public and enlist media support, and we must take the time to explain to our patients that discontinuing statin treatment may be a life-threatening mistake, he writes.

The verdict, which came in response to a lawsuit Jesse Mitchell and his wife filed in 2014, is the first in response to over 6,000 pending lawsuits that have been consolidated in federal court in Chicago. The decision in the Mitchell case is the first in a series of test trials aimed at helping plaintiffs and manufacturers of AndroGel gauge the range of damages and define a legal strategy and settlement options. These so-called bellwether trials are often used in product liability where hundreds of people have similar claims.    The jury said AbbVie was not negligent or strictly liable for a heart attack Mitchell suffered after taking AndroGel, but said the company falsely marketed the drug. It did not award Mitchell compensatory damages for his injuries and losses. The jury found that AndroGel did not cause any damage, AbbVie said in a statement. The company said that it did not expect the punitive damage award to stand, without providing further details. Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond, said the jury's decision to award punitive damages without granting compensatory damages was extremely unusual. Usually you can't recover punitive damages without having any compensatory damages, Tobias said. Tobias, who focuses on mass torts and product liability, said the drugmaker is certain to appeal the verdict. But he said that the verdict did not bode well for AbbVie's remaining trials.  The fact that a jury awarded punitive damages may encourage plaintiffs and their lawyers to bring on more cases and pursue them even more aggressively.          The company's stock was at $73.9, down 0.96 percent or 72 cents.

The change is under consideration after a group of veterinary products manufacturers made a formal request to the ministry to reduce dosages to 2 ml from 5 ml, and remove a compound known as saponin from the vaccine, it told Reuters in a statement. The government said changes will require tests to certify the quality of vaccines, adding the matter remains under analysis. Foot-and-mouth disease is an infectious disease that affects cattle. The United States imposed a ban on fresh Brazilian beef imports in June, saying it had found abscesses in the meat and signs of systemic failure of sanitary inspections. Brazilian ranchers believe the abscesses were linked to foot-and-mouth vaccines and blame the way the government mandates they inject cattle with them and certain substances in them. The manufacturers' group, known as Sindan, said in a statement on Monday the government had agreed to remove saponin from the vaccines applied on the herd of the world's top beef exporter.  The planned changes were announced during the sixth extraordinary meeting of the South American Commission for the Fight Against Foot-and-Mouth Disease (Cosalfa) in Brasília in July 20-21, Sindan said. Sindan said the new vaccines would be available in time for the vaccination campaign starting in November 2018. Nationwide vaccinations occur every May and November, a ministry spokesperson said. After meeting last week with U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, Brazil's Agriculture Minister Blairo Maggi said the country could lift the beef ban in 30 to 60 days pending an analysis of information presented by his team. Perdue's press office said the two discussed the technical difficulties Brazilian beef products had encountered, which led to the ban. In a statement, the United States mentioned corrective actions Brazil has taken and continues to take, without elaborating. Secretary Perdue expressed a desire to harmonize and equalize the inspection process to give each country confidence in the safety of food products, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said.

Researchers found 61 centers offering stem cell therapies for heart failure as of last year in the U.S. alone, including five that claimed to have performed more than 100 procedures. Only nine centers required copies of patients’ medical records and just one facility said it had a board certified cardiologist on staff.  “We simply do not know anything about the quality of the treatment delivered at these centers,” said senior study author Dr. Paul Hauptman director of heart failure at Saint Louis University Hospital. “These centers are not regulated in any way,” Hauptman said by email.  Almost 6 million Americans have heart failure, and it’s one of the most common reasons older adults go to the hospital, according to the American Heart Association. It happens when the heart muscle is too weak to effectively pump enough blood through the body. Symptoms can include fatigue, weight gain from fluid retention, shortness of breath and coughing or wheezing. Medications can help strengthen the heart and minimize fluid buildup in the body.  While some experimental stem cell therapies for heart failure are currently being tested in late-stage human trials, none have won approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. In theory, after a transplant, stem cells could permanently become part of the diseased heart and either help grow new healthy heart tissue or tell existing cells to work better, said Paul Knoepfler, a cell biology researcher at the University of California Davis School of Medicine in Sacramento who wasn’t involved in the study.  It’s also possible stem cells could temporarily visit the heart and stimulate a positive response in cells already there, he said. Even though there’s no conclusive proof yet that any stem cell treatments are safe and effective for heart failure, centers contacted for the study charge an average of $7,694 for each treatment using patient’s own stem cells and $6,038 for each procedure with donor stem cells.  In one instance, though, a clinic staff member said, “If you have a million dollars to spend we will set you up with weekly infusions.” Hauptman’s team had used a standard script when contacting each center, asking about the stem cell treatment itself, medical exams before and afterward and pricing.  Among the other responses they received from clinic staff were remarks such as, “If you know anyone that can start an IV, a neighbor that is a nurse for example, we can send you the stem cells and that person can administer them to you” and “We hope you don't believe your doctor when they tell you there is nothing they can do, you were smart to call us.”  None of the sites in the study discussed what methods they used to isolate or identify stem cells, though most claimed to use patients’ cells and 24 said they got cells from fat tissue.  Most centers claimed to deliver cells intravenously, researchers report in JAMA Internal Medicine.  “This approach has been associated with complications such as stroke, in which infused cells block blood vessels in the brain,” said Douglas Sipp, a researcher at RIKEN Center for Developmental Biology in Kobe, Japan, who wasn’t involved in the study.  “The biggest risk is that patients will waste their money, time and hopes on an unnecessary and useless invasive procedure,” Sipp said by email.  If any stem cell treatment did ultimately prove safe and effective enough to win FDA approval, it would likely offer a significant improvement over the limited treatment options currently available, said Leigh Turner, a researcher at the University of Minnesota Center for Bioethics who wasn’t involved in the study.  But it’s impossible to say what patients would get at unregulated clinics offering unapproved stem cell therapies, Turner said by email. In at least two cases unrelated to the current study, patients died after getting stem cell procedures at a clinic in Florida, and in another case at a different Florida clinic, a woman went blind, Turner noted.  “Clinics marketing stem cell treatments to patients suffering from heart failure might be administering anything from slurries of mixed cells, some of which might be stem cells, to nothing more than cellular debris,” Turner said. “Often one can only speculate.” SOURCE: bit.ly/2uQve40 JAMA Internal Medicine, online July 24, 2017.

Nationwide, about 93 percent of children aged 2 to 11 years old get the measles vaccine, researchers note in JAMA Pediatrics. If this vaccination rate dropped to 88 percent, it could result in 150 additional measles cases a year and cost government health programs $2.1 million, not counting hospital bills, researchers estimate.  “Given increasing parental decisions to not vaccinate their children, we wanted to understand the effect of small reductions in vaccine coverage on overall measles cases,” said study co-author Nathan Lo of Stanford University School of Medicine in California. “We found that small declines in vaccine coverage can really reduce the ‘herd immunity’ effect and result in more frequent and larger outbreaks of measles,” Lo said by email.  Measles is a highly contagious virus that can be serious or even fatal. It starts with a fever that can last a couple of days, followed by a cough, runny nose and pink eye. A rash develops on the face and neck then spreads to the rest of the body. In severe cases, pneumonia and encephalitis can develop. People with measles can be spreading the virus for four days before and after the rash appears, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The virus can live for up to two hours on surfaces where an infected person coughs or sneezes. People can become infected by breathing in droplets or touching a contaminated surface and then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. Because measles spreads so easily, about 95 percent of people need to be vaccinated against the virus to achieve so-called herd immunity, when outbreaks can be prevented, Lo said. Already, the nation is dotted with “hot spots” where vaccination rates are below this level and widespread outbreaks are possible, he added.  “Outbreaks happen in communities, so we need to zoom in further than just national or statewide statistics when it comes to vaccination rates,” said Maimuna Majumder, a researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge who wasn’t involved in the study.  For example, one recent study in California found county-level measles vaccination rates as low as 70 percent even though the statewide average was 90 percent, Majumder said by email.  For the current study, Lo and co-author Dr. Peter Hotez of Baylor College of Medicine in Houston only examined data on measles vaccination and infection rates for children aged 2 to 11. The estimated number of measles cases and associated costs would be much higher if the study also included infants, teens and adults, the authors note. Babies can’t be vaccinated, and would be particularly vulnerable to infection if an older sibling caught the virus. Very few people need to skip the measles vaccine for medical reasons, said Dr. George Rutherford, head of the division of infectious disease epidemiology at the University of California, San Francisco.  This includes pregnant women, patients with compromised immune systems related to conditions like cancer or AIDS and people who have had severe allergic reactions to vaccines in the past.  Even a small drop in vaccination rates can make it more likely that people who can’t get the vaccine for medical reasons will catch measles, Rutherford, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.  “When immunization levels go low enough, there can be massive outbreaks of measles,” Rutherford said.

(Reuters) - Merck and Co Inc said on Thursday the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) tentatively approved its follow-on biologic version of French drugmaker Sanofi SA's blockbuster diabetes treatment, Lantus. Merck's copycat, if launched, would challenge Lantus as a cheaper alternative that could chip away at the drug's sales, which reached 5.71 billion euros ($6.6 billion) last year and represented over a sixth of Sanofi's total sales. Though the FDA said Merck's product was similar enough to Lantus to justify approval, the agency's final greenlight is subject to the resolution of a patent infringement suit brought by Sanofi against the U.S. drugmaker. The litigation, filed in September, triggered a stay on final FDA approval for up to 30 months, unless a court rules in favor of Merck earlier. After Lantus's U.S. patent expired in 2015, Sanofi had hoped to revive diabetes drug revenue that had declined due to pricing pressure and competition, by launching a follow-on product called Toujeo in March that year. Toujeo raked in 649 million euros in sales last year. Eli Lilly & Co's Lantus follow-on biologic, Basaglar, won tentative FDA approval in August 2014 but litigation brought by Sanofi delayed final approval to December 2016. Lilly agreed to pay Sanofi royalties as part of the settlement. Basaglar generated $86.1 million in sales last year. U.S. pharmacy benefit manager CVS in August said it would drop Lantus from the list of medicines it reimburses on behalf of health insurers, dealing a blow to the French drugmaker's diabetes business. Merck's Lantus follow-on biologic, called Lusduna Nexvue, is being developed with funding from South Korea's Samsung Bioepis, and delivers insulin in a pre-filled dosing device. Both Lantus and Lusduna Nexvue, administered via injection, are long-acting, man-made versions of human insulin. Shares of Merck were up 0.8 percent at $63.11 in afternoon trading, while Sanofi's New York-listed stock was up 3 percent. Reporting by Tamara Mathias in Bengaluru; Editing by Sai Sachin Ravikumar"

They blamed recent monsoon rains and floods that have left pools of stagnant water and rotting rain-soaked trash -- ideal breeding sites for mosquitoes that carry the virus. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies is scaling up emergency assistance to Sri Lanka with the Sri Lanka Red Cross to help contain the outbreak. Dengue patients are streaming into overcrowded hospitals that are stretched beyond capacity and struggling to cope, particularly in the country’s hardest hit western province, Red Cross/Red Crescent said in a statement. According to the World Health Organization, dengue is one of the world's fastest growing diseases, endemic in 100 countries, with as many as 390 million infections annually. Early detection and treatment save lives when infections are severe, particularly for young children. The Sri Lankan government is struggling to control the virus, which causes flu-like symptoms and can develop into the deadly hemorrhagic dengue fever.  The ministry of health said the number of dengue infections has climbed above 100,000 since the start of 2017, with 296 deaths.  Ongoing downpours and worsening sanitation conditions raise concerns the disease will continue to spread, Red Cross/Red Crescent said.  Its assistance comes a week after Australia announced programs to help control dengue fever in Sri Lanka. Dengue is endemic here, but one reason for the dramatic rise in cases is that the virus currently spreading has evolved and people lack the immunity to fight off the new strain, Novil Wijesekara, head of health at the Sri Lanka Red Cross said in a statement.

Researchers found that about 11 percent of homes had visible signs of dampness - and the more signs were present, the higher the likelihood of residents having nose, throat and lung-related health problems, according to the report in Clinical and Experimental Allergy. “A lot of papers show an association between asthma-related symptoms and building dampness. What’s new is the association between chronic inflammation and building dampness,” said senior study author Christer Janson of Uppsala University.  “This is an important finding as chronic inflammation is quite a common condition with a very negative side effect on quality of life,” he told Reuters Health by email. “We were surprised that the association with building dampness was so strong.” The researchers analyzed data from more than 26,000 adults in four Swedish cities who responded to a questionnaire about respiratory symptoms, smoking, education and environmental exposures. In particular, the study team was interested in chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), which includes symptoms of runny nose, itchy nose, facial pain, reduced sense of smell, nasal congestion and sneezing.  They identified dampness by asking about visible water damage, floor dampness or visible mold seen in the home during the last 12 months and gave participants a dampness exposure score based on how many of these signs were present. A total of 2,992 people, or 11.3 percent, reported any signs of dampness. For 8.3 percent of the study participants, one sign was present, for 2.3 percent there were two signs and for 0.7 percent all three signs were seen in the home. Reported dampness was more common in humid or mild climates, as compared to areas of the country with longer, colder winters. People reporting damp homes were more likely to be women, unemployed or full-time students, smokers and less likely to be retired. Compared to nonsmokers with no signs of dampness at home, nonsmokers with any dampness signs were 90 percent more likely to have nighttime shortness of breath, 77 percent more likely to have chronic rhinosinusitis and 67 percent more likely to have chronic bronchitis. They also had higher rates of wheeze, nighttime coughing, asthma and allergies.  For chronic rhinosinusitis, the authors note, the degree of increased risk from dampness for nonsmokers was about the same as the effect of smoking for people without dampness in the home. “I found it both interesting and alarming that the adverse effects were stronger among people with low socioeconomic status due to limited possibilities for moving to a better home or making needed renovations,” said Jouni Jaakkola of the University of Oulu in Finland, who wasn’t involved in the study.  Future studies should look at long-term results to better understand cause and effect with dampness at home, Jaakkola told Reuters Health by email.  “Cross-sectional studies (like this one) may underestimate the effects if people who get symptoms in damp homes change to better homes,” he said. “This probably explains the interaction between socioeconomic status and damp problems.” Janson and Jaakkola recommended several online resources to help people prevent dampness and mold problems. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, for example, has a mold-control primer on EPA.gov (bit.ly/29fxO4Y) and so does the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on the CDC.gov website (bit.ly/2lxArWu). The World Health Organization offers brochures in PDF format on its European website here: (bit.ly/10VfGJq) and here: (bit.ly/2nGrpH4). These resources recommend locating moisture problems, removing molds and controlling excessive water and condensation at home. Leaky pipes and roofs are often the biggest issues, the WHO notes. Professional help may be needed for leaks in building structure, sewage and air ducts, otherwise mold-removal can be done at home with a protective mask, goggles and rubber gloves, according to the EPA.  A mild detergent can remove the mold, followed by a full-room wet wiping or vacuuming after the spores are sealed in a plastic trash bag. “If there are signs of building dampness in your home or you have water damage, get professional help and try to fix it as soon as possible,” Janson said.

The U.S. and Korean drugmakers said they would sell their version, to be called Renflexis, at 35 percent discount to the list price of J&J;'s top-selling medicine, or about $735 for a 100 milligram dose.  J&J; shares were down 1.6 percent at $133.16. Renflexis is the second U.S. biosimilar version of Remicade to be sold after Pfizer Inc launched its Inflectra late last year at a 15 percent discount to J&J;'s list price, later dropped to a 19 percent discount. Remicade had U.S. sales of $4.8 billion last year. They fell 8.2 percent for the first half of 2017 to $2.2 billion with the  new competition. As with generic medicines, once multiple biosimilars of a drug become available prices are expected to drop more quickly. Many industry executives and analysts have expressed surprise at how fast prices have fallen in Europe, which led the way with biosimilars. Merck sells the branded version of Remicade outside the United States. In Europe, it is already facing competition from biosimilar Remicade and cheaper versions of other medicines in the class. Many companies are developing a wide range of biosimilar versions of top-selling biologic medicines, including major biotechs like Amgen Inc, which is working on cheaper versions of several of its rivals' blockbuster drugs.   J&J;, in a statement, said it offers a variety of discounts and rebates off the list price of Remicade, giving it an average sales price of $808.87 per 100mg vial.    J&J;'s Janssen unit sought a preliminary or permanent U.S. injunction to block the Bioepis version, arguing that it infringed three of its patents. A hearing for the lawsuit has yet to be scheduled.  We are confident we do not infringe on Janssen's patents, Samsung Bioepis spokesman Mingi Hyun said. Renflexis, which received U.S. approval in April, is the first medicine available in the United States under a global biosimilars agreement between Merck and Samsung Bioepis, a unit of Samsung BioLogics Co Ltd. Since it is not possible to make exact copies of complex biotech medicines, which are manufactured from living cells, they cannot be called true generics as with simple pills. Instead, companies must prove their versions are similar enough to the original medicine.

Opioids are considered the gold standard in treating pain that persists despite other forms of therapy, but the rising wave of abuse is taking a toll on the U.S. healthcare system. Health regulators have implemented a slew of measures of limit their supply, in particular requiring drugmakers such as Intellipharmaceutics to prove their painkillers discourage abuse. Toronto-based Intellipharma's painkiller, Rexista, has been developed as a unique abuse-deterrent version of Purdue Pharma's often-abused blockbuster OxyContin, which already has tamper-resistant properties. Most notably, Rexista contains a blue dye that is emitted if the tablet is manipulated, which could help identify abusers. The drug has also shown bioequivalence to OxyContin, which means that if approved, it could be used interchangeably with OxyContin. Long-acting opioids contain high doses of narcotics designed to be released over time. If crushed pills are snorted or injected, they release their full dose all at once, making them dangerous and valuable for addicts. In a preliminary review, FDA staffers said Intellipharma had not submitted abuse-liability study data as part of its application to market Rexista in the United States. bit.ly/2eHJpSH It basically comes down to a philosophical difference with the FDA, Intellipharma's finance chief Domenic Della Penna said in an interview. If you are bioequivalent to something, why do you need to do all these extra studies? Penna noted that Rexista was relatively harder to abuse via the popular method of injection, adding that other studies would follow. FDA staff noted that Rexista was easier to crush than OxyContin, but said it was similar to OxyContin or was less likely to be manipulated for abuse using a syringe. Agency scientists also concluded Rexista was less likely to vaporize if manipulated for abuse via inhalation, and that it was not easy to separate the blue dye and nasal irritant from the drug. The FDA's report comes two days ahead of a meeting of independent advisers who will make recommendations on Rexista. The regulator is expected to decide on Rexista's approval by Sept. 25. However, since Purdue has sued Intellipharma, claiming patent infringement, the drug's final approval is subject to the outcome of the lawsuit.

Getting instructions right is essential to avoid mistakes that can prolong children’s illnesses or make them sicker, sometimes so much worse that they need to return to the hospital for additional care, researchers note in Pediatrics.  In the review of 64 studies, medication errors were the most common problem researchers found. For example, up to 38 percent of parents and caregivers didn’t know the right medicine dose and up to 42 percent of them didn’t understand how often children needed to take prescribed drugs.  Dosing errors with prescriptions - when parents gave kids at least 20 percent more or less medication than they were supposed to - occurred 42 percent to 48 percent of the time. The majority of these errors happened with measuring liquid medications that are commonly used for children.  “Underdosing medications may lead to worsening of a child’s illness, while overdosing puts children at risk for dangerous side effects,” said lead study author Dr. Alexander Glick, of New York University School of Medicine and Bellevue Hospital Center in New York.  Parents also frequently misunderstood what follow-up appointments kids needed and what signs of worsening illness would require children to return to the hospital, the study found.  Up to 62 percent of families missed recommended follow-up appointments after kids were discharged from an inpatient hospital stay, as did up to 81 percent of families of children treated in emergency rooms.  Parents were more likely to miss these appointments or fail to schedule them when they had more than one child, lacked private health insurance, spoke little or no English or had difficulty missing work or taking kids out of school for doctor visits, researchers report in Pediatrics.  “When children miss follow-up appointments, they lose the opportunity for additional monitoring, and physicians also cannot ensure that parents are following instructions correctly,” Glick said by email. “Misunderstanding discharge instructions has the potential to lead to unnecessary and unanticipated readmissions and visits to the emergency department.” Kids were more likely to go to needed follow-up appointments when these visits were scheduled before they left the hospital, the study found.  Medication mistakes were less common when clinicians spent time in the hospital showing parents the correct way to fill medication cups or syringes to give children the right amount of liquid medicine.  Researchers got this snapshot of how well parents understand discharge instructions for their children by analyzing data from studies published between 1985 and 2016. Most were done in the U.S., but some also examined what happens in Canada, Chile, India, Israel, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Switzerland, Taiwan and Uganda. One limitation of the current review is that the studies analyzed tended to rely  heavily on research done during the day for convenience, which excludes kids sent home from hospitals on evenings and weekends, the authors note. This may have underestimated how often parents misunderstand instructions because they’re more likely to get help understanding needed follow-up care on weekdays.  Even so, the analysis offers fresh evidence of how often parents fail to follow doctors’ orders for medications and follow-up appointments their kids need, said Dr. Denise Klinkner, medical director of the pediatric trauma center at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. “This study highlights the overwhelming rate of non-compliance with medications and follow-up,” Klinkner, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. “Especially for the more complex children, failure to comply may lead to lifelong disability and chronic disease.” To avoid mistakes, parents should speak up when they don’t understand instructions or when factors like a lack of insurance or transportation might prevent them from getting children needed care, Klinkner added. Clinicians should also keep instructions simple and ask families questions to make sure they understood what they were told.  “A team approach is key,” Klinkner said.

Three cases of H1N1 had been confirmed in Myanmar's largest city, Yangon, on Friday, the Ministry of Health and Sport said in a statement on Monday after news of the infections had already spread. The ministry said another 10 people in Matupi - in the remote northwestern state of Chin that borders India - had caught the virus this month. A 6-year-old boy also died in Matupi with severe respiratory problems suspected to have been caused by H1N1, Dr. Win Lwin, director of the Yangon regional health department, told reporters. There is no need to panic because it usually happens every year, the ministry said, adding that those with symptoms should go to government clinics for treatment. News of the infections spread rapidly on social media, and many commuters in downtown Yangon had by Monday afternoon begun wearing face masks. Few people in Myanmar get annual vaccinations against any strain of flu.  In 2009, the virus - which affects young people more frequently than other types of flu - spread to most countries in the world. At least 66 people contracted it in Myanmar, according to official comments carried by media at the time. Influenza normally spreads in Myanmar during the annual monsoon season from May to October, but an outbreak of swine flu, formally known as A(H1N1), has not been reported in the country since 2009.

Patients with HIV would normally need to stay on antiretroviral (ART) drugs for the rest of their lives to keep AIDS at bay. But this child, still off treatment and now almost 10 years old, has no signs of the disease. This and other recent, isolated cases of remission have given additional hope to the 37 million people worldwide infected with the virus that causes AIDS.  Yet experts urged caution, saying the case is extremely rare and does not suggest a simple path to a cure. It's a case that raises more questions than it necessarily answers, said Linda-Gail Bekker, president of the International AIDS Society (IAS), which is holding a conference in Paris this week. It does raise the interesting notion that maybe treatment isn't for life. (But) it's clearly a rare phenomenon.    The child, whose name and gender were not disclosed, was part of a clinical trial in which researchers were investigating the effect of treating HIV-positive babies in the first few weeks of life, and then stopping and starting the ART medicines whilst checking whether their HIV was being controlled. The United Nations HIV/AIDS agency said last week that 19.5 million people - more than half of the 37 million patients with HIV - are now on treatment. The vast majority of patients with HIV suffer an increase in the amount of the virus circulating in the body if they stop treatment, but this child was different, the South African researchers said. To our knowledge, this is the first case of sustained virological control from a randomized trial of ART interruption following early treatment of infants, they said in a summary of findings presented at the IAS conference on Monday. The baby contracted HIV from its mother. Treatment with ART started when it was almost nine weeks old but was interrupted at 40 weeks when the virus had been suppressed, and the child was monitored regularly for any signs of relapse. At age 9.5 years, the child was clinically asymptomatic, the researchers said. Sharon Lewin, an HIV expert at the University of Melbourne and co-chair of the IAS's HIV Cure and Cancer forum, said the case threw up possible insights into how the human immune system can controls HIV replication when treatment is interrupted. Yet in terms of the scientific search for a cure for HIV and AIDS, she told Reuters, it appeared only to confirm previous reports of similarly rare cases.  We know that very rarely, people who have had treatment and stopped it are then able to control the virus.  The HIV/AIDS pandemic has killed around 35 million people worldwide since it began in the 1980s.

Adding to optimism is the success of antiretrovirals in preventing infection - an approach known as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) - as well as growing hopes for an eventual functional cure that may keep the virus at bay without drugs. Researchers believe such advances are necessary to stay ahead of a virus that can all too often develop resistance to medicines, despite the use since 1996 of three- or four-drug combinations that mean HIV/AIDS is no longer a death sentence. New products are needed. The Achilles heel for us is drug resistance because the virus is incredibly quick to mutate, Linda-Gail Bekker, deputy director of the Desmond Tutu HIV Centre in South Africa, said. Bekker is also president of the International AIDS Society, which organized the conference in Paris where the latest clinical results were presented. The race for better and more convenient medicines has made HIV a rich battleground for drug companies such as Gilead Sciences and GlaxoSmithKline, which generate billions of dollars from modern therapies. Both companies garnered fresh ammunition to boost their products in Paris. New clinical data confirmed Gilead's new drug bictegravir, given with older antiretrovirals, was as good as GSK's established dolutegravir and had a similar side effect profile. Gilead filed the new cocktail for regulatory approval in June. Both bictegravir and dolutegravir are so-called integrase inhibitors, a type of medicine that has proved extremely effective at blocking HIV. GSK, meanwhile, unveiled results of a 96-week study with a long-acting two-drug injection given every four or eight weeks using another integrase inhibitor, cabotegravir, that showed it worked as well - and perhaps better - than standard daily pills. For GSK, two-drug cocktails represent the future of HIV treatment, especially for the growing number of older patients who are more vulnerable to side effects from taking multiple medicines.  It hopes to win approval for its first dual therapy - a tablet containing dolutegravir - later this year.  GSK's long-acting injection is further off but it offers an option for people who don't want daily pills, which some experts think might be 10 to 20 percent of the market. GSK also faces a rival in Merck & Co, which is working on an even longer-lasting drug that could one day be used as an implant. David Redfern, chairman of GSK's majority-owned ViiV Healthcare HIV business, believes one thing is clear: competition is set to intensify. The battle will play through from next year, but we feel in a strong position to defend the franchise that we have built up, he told Reuters. Gilead's clinical research head Andrew Cheng said the rival combinations were very comparable and there would now be a shift in treatment to the newer, more effective therapies. Vaccine Needed Ultimately, many experts believe a vaccine will be needed to shut down the threat from HIV, although decades of efforts to develop one have so far ended in disappointment. Scientists are not giving up, however, and a new approach pioneered by Johnson & Johnson, working with U.S. government experts and others, is set to enter large Phase IIb trials later this year. The decision to push ahead with a so-called prime-boost vaccine in a trial involving thousands of patients in Africa comes after promising data presented in Paris on Monday, showing the two-component shot generated a good immune response. It also follows another large-scale trial already underway in Africa, which uses a modified version of a vaccine that showed a modest 31 percent reduction in infections in Thailand in 2009. In both cases, researchers are looking for reductions in infection rates of at least 50 percent, and hopefully more. With 36.7 million people around the world infected with HIV and more than half of them getting treatment that is expected to last for life, J&J; Chief Scientific Officer Paul Stoffels sees parallel advances in drugs and vaccines as essential. We should not claim victory yet in HIV, he said. The people who are infected today will need therapy for the next 30 to 50 years, so the science of treatment has to evolve - and the science of prevention has to evolve as well to stop the pool of patients growing.

President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans campaigned on a pledge to roll back former President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law, the 2010 Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Senator John Thune, a member of the Republican leadership, told Fox News Sunday the initial vote was simply a way to open debate on the bill so that senators from both parties could offer amendments. The first vote, which will occur sometime this week, will be to proceed to the consideration of that legislation and to at least have a debate where we can have an open amendment process, Thune said. The Republican-controlled House in May passed its version of a healthcare bill. Senate Republicans have considered two versions of related legislation but have been unable to reach consensus after estimates showed as many as 22 million fewer Americans would be insured if the proposals became law. A plan to repeal Obamacare without replacing it also ran aground.

Slideshow (3 Images)It appears we'll have a vote on Tuesday but we don't know whether we'll be voting on the House bill, the first version of the Senate bill, the second version of the Senate bill, Republican Senator Susan Collins told CBS' Face the Nation on Sunday. Collins is a moderate Republican who has objected to prior versions of the Senate bill and also to repealing Obamacare without replacing it.

But now, as abortion foes have succeeded in shrinking access, advocates are working harder to grow grassroots support and taking a more public stance.     The anti-abortion movement won a victory with the election of President Donald Trump, who has promised to appoint U.S. Supreme Court justices who would overturn the Roe v. Wade decision protecting a woman's right to abortion. Critics of the decision say states should decide.     That worries pro-choice advocates, including support groups in states where Republicans control legislatures.     There is a volume and aggressiveness of anti-choice legislation and legislators who feel empowered by the administration, said Yamani Hernandez, executive director of the National Network of Abortion Funds, which represents 70 funds in 38 states.     Kentucky is a flashpoint in the national debate. The state had 17 abortion providers in 1978 but one today. It could become the first U.S. state without any clinics this fall, when a court will determine whether its anti-abortion Republican governor wins a licensing fight.     Anti-abortion protesters will converge on Louisville starting Saturday ahead of a week of demonstrations. Some have vowed to broadcast footage of abortions on an 8-by-16-foot Pro-Life JumboTron screen.     In response, a judge has ordered a temporary buffer zone around the state's only abortion clinic.           New Restrictions Protesters and escorts who ensure women can reach the clinic face off outside the EMW WomenÕs Surgical Center in Louisville, Kentucky, U.S. January 27, 2017.Chris Kenning    Kentucky is not alone in making access to abortion tougher. There are six other U.S. states with only one clinic each.     The Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health think tank that supports abortion rights, said U.S. state legislatures enacted 41 new abortion restrictions in the first half of 2017, even after a 2016 U.S. Supreme Court decision struck down restrictive abortion laws in Texas.     Many more restrictions were proposed, ranging from waiting periods to 20-week abortion bans. The number of U.S. abortion providers dropped from 2,434 in 1991 to 1,671 in 2014, according to Guttmacher data. This year, Iowa blocked abortion providers from receiving public money for family planning services. Patricia Canon, who volunteers escorting women past protestors, stands outside the EMW WomenÕs Surgical Center in Louisville, Kentucky, U.S. July 8, 2017.Chris Kenning    Medicaid restrictions and a decline in the number of hospitals providing services have also curtailed access, the National Abortion Federation said.      Advocates say poor and rural women are hurt most by such laws. The biggest impact is in the South and Midwest, where the number of abortion providers has dwindled. Nearly half of the 40 clinics in Texas closed after laws enacted in 2013. Only a few have reopened since last year's court ruling.     The National Network of Abortion Funds met last month in Arizona to map a strategy that in part aims to open 10 new support fund programs across the country, expand its network of more than 2,000 volunteers and leverage rising donations to fill more than 100,000 annual requests for financial or travel aid, Hernandez said.     The groups spent roughly $3.5 million to aid abortion access in 2015, she said, the latest year for which data was available.     Kentucky Health Justice leaders hope to double volunteers and funding. Fund Texas Choice, an abortion travel aid group formed in 2014, and Arkansas Abortion Support Network, opened a year ago, are also among those working to expand.     The abortion support groups face fierce opposition, especially from religious groups. Joseph Spurgeon, an Indiana pastor and activist with the fundamentalist Christian group Operation Save America, called abortion access volunteers accomplices to murder.     Such rhetoric has not stopped some support groups from taking a more public stance resisting pressures to curtail abortion access.     When we started two years ago, a lawyer told us to make sure your mission is kind of vague, don't use the A-word, said Maia Elkana, who started Missouri's Gateway Women's Access Fund several years ago.

The two diseases, while very different in many ways, have some key crossover points when it comes to developing new treatments, specialists say - most notably the immune system, its crucial T-cells, and its ability to fight-off invaders. The parallels between HIV persistence and cancer are striking, said Francoise Barré-Sinoussi, former president of the International AIDS Society (IAS), which is hosting a week-long conference in Paris.  In both cases, the immune response is unable to target and clear HIV-infected cells and tumor cells.  Scientists working in both diseases also face similar challenges in tracking the size, number and spread of infected cells, she said, which can hide out in reservoirs in hard-to-reach tissues. HIV experts see this as one of the key links to cancer medicine, which in recent years has seen the development of a new generation of drugs that target and re-arm the immune system, rather that just poisoning tumor cells. Among the drugs in this new class are medicines known as PDL-1 or PD1 inhibitors that engage and revitalize the patient's own immune system to attack the cancer.           Sharon Lewin, an HIV expert at the University of Melbourne and co-chair of the IAS's HIV Cure and Cancer forum, describes this progress in oncology as a revolution which has led to some spectacular successes that are now being eyed by AIDS researchers. These treatments basically reinvigorate an exhausted immune system, exhausted T-cells. They reverse the dampening down of the immune system that happens in cancer, she told Reuters in a telephone interview. In HIV, exactly the same thing happens - the T-cells become exhausted and can no longer function as efficiently.  While HIV researchers are keen to see whether new-generation cancer drugs could show promise in HIV, there has also been a caution about conducting what might be risky trials in people whose illness is well managed with safe, effective AIDS drugs. Because of that, the first clinical data - some of it presented at the IAS on Saturday - is in patients with both cancer and HIV, Lewin explained. This is the first scientific meeting where we're getting a chance to see what these drugs look like in HIV, she said.  It's very early days, but basically what we are seeing is that they are just as safe (as when used in cancer), and in some cases they also seem to be disturbing the (HIV) virus (from its hiding places). The hope is they will also kick-start the immune system as well. Reporting by Kate Kelland; Editing by Andrew Bolton"

The Senate parliamentarian determined some provisions in the Better Care Reconciliation Act violate the Byrd Rule that requires backers to be able to muster 60 votes, according to a memo posted on the Senate Committee on the Budget website. Republicans, who control the Senate with a slim 52-seat majority, are unlikely to be able to round up that many votes for key provisions in the bill to repeal former President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act known as Obamacare.

Some provisions were not subject to the Byrd Rule, according to the parliamentarian, including a provision allowing states the option to impose work requirements on Medicaid enrollees who are not disabled, elderly or pregnant, and a proposal to repeal cost-sharing subsidies. Other provisions were still under review, including a proposal to allow insurers to charge older Americans more than younger people, a provision to allow small businesses to establish association health plans that could be sold across state lines and the option for states to receive Medicaid block grant lump sums instead of per capita cap payments.

Researchers found that around 4 percent of Ashkenazi Jewish women without three well-known mutations in their BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes have other mutations that may increase their risk for breast cancer. The well-known mutations are called founders since they've been inherited from the women's ancestors in Europe. Lead author Mary-Claire King and colleagues write in JAMA Oncology that those mutations are responsible for about 10 percent of invasive breast cancers among Ashkenazi Jewish women. According to the National Cancer Institute, between 1 in 400 and 1 in 800 people in the general U.S. population has one of these founders mutations - but that number increases to about 1 in 40 among Ashkenazi Jews. In women who don't carry one of those mutations, the risk of having another mutation that increases their risk of breast cancer is unknown, King's team writes. For the new study, the researchers analyzed blood samples collected between 1996 and 2000 from 1,007 Ashkenazi Jewish women who were diagnosed with invasive breast cancer and were being treated at one of 12 cancer centers near New York City. Genetic testing showed 903 women did not have those founder mutations in their BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes. But seven of these women - nearly 1 percent - had a different mutation in those genes and 31 women - nearly 3.5 percent - had mutations in other genes that might have increased their risk for breast cancer. The researchers point out that about half of the women with these genetic mutations did not have a family history of breast cancer. So, making genetic counseling available only to women with a family history of breast cancer might miss about half of the women with mutations. Ashkenazi Jewish women who have not been tested for genetic mutations tied to an increased risk of breast cancer should be offered testing for all mutations, they write. Given that complete sequencing of all breast cancer genes is now straightforward and inexpensive, its use as the primary testing tool offers a uniform approach for women of all ancestries and precludes the need to consider additional testing for Ashkenazi Jewish women with negative results for only BRCA1 and BRCA2 founder allies, they add. The hope is that such testing would allows healthcare providers to prevent cancer or find it early, said Leigha Senter, a licensed genetics counselor at The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center in Columbus. That is a clear pathway to action, said Senter, who wasn't involved in the new study. She said a positive finding could lead to women getting more screenings, for example. If we’re going to look for the founding mutations, it’s no more difficult to look for these other mutations, said Senter. She cautioned that some of these other mutations don't increase the risk of breast cancer to the same extent as the founder mutations, however. Senter said women should be proactive and tell their doctors about any history of breast cancer on either side of their family. Additionally, she said, it's important to keep checking on the current screening recommendations. Those screening recommendations as we know them now, might be very different a couple of years from now as we learn more, she said. SOURCE: bit.ly/2uQTcwu JAMA Oncology, online July 20, 2017."

Only 7 percent of smokers picked up a prescription for a smoking cessation drug during the 90 days following their heart attacks, researchers found. These medications are being underused, said lead author Dr. Neha Pagidipati, of Duke University in Durham, North Carolina. Now we need to understand why. About 735,000 people in the United States have heart attacks each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Smoking is a major cause of cardiovascular disease. The CDC says one in three deaths from cardiovascular disease can be blamed on smoking. Pagidipati and colleagues write in JAMA Cardiology that despite the increased risk, just over half of people stop smoking in the year after a heart attack. Along with nicotine replacement therapies like gum and patches, people trying to quit cigarettes can use medications such as bupropion and varenicline. What we didn’t know is how often are these medication being used in patients who recently had a heart attack, Pagidipati told Reuters Health. For the new study, researchers analyzed data on 9,193 smokers who had a heart attack between 2007 and 2013. All were at least 65 years old. Overall, 97 percent of patients were counseled during their hospital stay about smoking cessation, but only 7 percent ended up picking up medications to help achieve that goal within 90 days. It suggests somewhere in there is a break in the link, said Pagidipati. Now we need to go back and figure out where is the problem. Of those who did pick up a prescription, about 53 percent used varenicline and about 47 percent used bupropion. But only about 37 percent of those taking bupropion and only about 20 percent of those taking varenicline used them for the recommended 12 weeks. About half of the patients using bupropion took the drug for less than 6.2 weeks. Similarly, about half of the patients on varenicline used it for less than 4.3 weeks. Pagidipati said it's not clear whether doctors are not prescribing the medications or patients aren't filling their prescriptions due to fear of side effects or cost. The drugs are powerful tools, she said. She urges people to ask their healthcare providers as soon as possible about how to stop smoking. There are a lot of things that can be done, said Pagidipati. It’s absolutely imperative that they speak to their providers. SOURCE: bit.ly/2uHm1Lm JAMA Cardiology, online July 19, 2017."

Researchers examined data from 49 previously published studies with a total of 1,863 people who did muscle-building workouts like weightlifting. Participants who boosted their protein intake - whether from foods or from supplements like bars, powders and shakes - added more lean muscle mass and got stronger muscles than exercisers who didn’t add extra protein to their diets.  However, increasing daily protein consumption beyond more than 1.6 grams for every kilogram (2.2 pounds) of body weight didn’t appear to have any added benefit.  “Performing resistance exercise is an effective way to maintain or increase lean muscle mass,” said lead study author Robert Morton of McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario.  “Protein supplementation is sufficient and necessary to augment increases in muscle mass and strength during periods of resistance training,” Morton said by email.  Added protein didn’t help older adults as much as younger people, however.  Also, the benefits of extra protein were more pronounced for newer exercisers than for people with lots of previous experience with resistance training.  All of the studies included in the research review had healthy adults performing resistance exercises at least twice a week. For each study, participants were randomly selected to stick to their usual diets or add extra protein.  Across all these studies, people adding protein to their diets consumed an extra 4 grams to 106 grams daily. Overall, the most common source of added protein was whey protein supplements, followed by supplement blends.  Ten studies gave people added protein with milk, and another seven examined adding protein with whole foods like beef and yogurt.  One limitation of the study is that researchers didn’t have enough data on older adults to determine how much added protein might help these individuals build lean muscle mass, which typically declines with age. Researchers also didn’t look at what happens when dieters get added protein.  “It has been difficult to cultivate one simple message, quantifying how much protein, what types of protein and whether messages should differ among different populations of people,” said Kelsey Mangano, a nutrition researcher at the University of Massachusetts in Lowell who wasn’t involved in the study.  Still, the findings offer fresh insight into the amount of protein some people might add to their diets to get additional benefits from muscle-building workouts, Mangano said by email.  The results might not apply to people who don’t do resistance training at least twice a week, said Dr. Mingyang Song of Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston.  Adding protein also isn’t risk-free, Song said by email. It can lead to digestive problems and damage the kidneys, and there’s also some concern that it may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease.  “It may result in an imbalanced diet,” Song said. “Thus, a healthy, whole-food based diet should be consumed.” SOURCE: bit.ly/2uijHt7 British Journal of Sports Medicine, online July 11, 2017.

The verdict by the jury in Boston came in a lawsuit by Cambridge, Massachusetts-based biotechnology company Momenta and its partner, Novartis AG's Sandoz unit, that sought nearly $940 million in damages. The jury found that while Rancho Cucamonga, California-based Amphastar had infringed Momenta's patent, it was invalid and unenforceable. We're extremely pleased with the jury verdict and that Amphastar is finally out from under this baseless lawsuit, said Michael Sommer, a lawyer for Amphastar. Momenta Chief Executive Craig Wheeler in a statement said the company was disappointed and was considering its options, including a potential appeal. We continue to believe in the importance of investing in innovative techniques for bringing products to market and protecting those innovations from unauthorized use, he said. Following the verdict, Amphastar's stock price rose 2.29 percent to $18.33 while Momenta's fell 2.32 percent to $16.85 on the NASDAQ stock exchange. Sandoz did not respond to requests for comment. Momenta and Sandoz filed the lawsuit in 2011 after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Amphastar's generic version of Sanofi SA's blockbuster Lovenox, an anticoagulant used to treat and prevent blood clots. Momenta claimed Amphastar infringed its patent covering a method used to confirm the structural signature of Lovenox, known generically as enoxaparin. Momenta, whose generic version Lovenox was the first to receive FDA approval in 2010, claimed Amphastar's infringement and subsequent sales of its own generic caused it to suffer a significant loss of profits. Momenta and Sandoz sought damages of $938 million. Sommer, Amphastar's lawyer, told jurors on Thursday during closing arguments that such an award would wipe out Amphastar altogether.  Amphastar argued Momenta's goal was to avoid further competition for generic versions of Lovenox, which earned Sanofi $2.9 billion in sales in 2009, the year before Momenta's version was approved. Before the trial, the case reached the U.S. Federal Circuit Court of Appeals twice, leading to reversals of an injunction against Amphastar in 2012 and a later ruling granting judgment in Amphastar's favor in 2015. When they obtained the injunction, Momenta and Sandoz were required to post a $100.1 million bond, which Amphastar has said that it plans to try to collect should it prevail in the case. The case is Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. et al v. Amphastar Pharmaceuticals, Inc. et al, U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts, No. 11-cv-11681.

They found the increased risk of chronic hypertension after a high blood pressure disorder during pregnancy got larger for older first-time mothers.  For women who had first pregnancies in their 20s, 14 percent who developed high blood pressure while pregnant had chronic hypertension during the first decade after delivery, compared with 4 percent of their peers with normal blood pressure during pregnancy.  Among women who had first pregnancies in their 40s, 32 percent of those who had high blood pressure during pregnancy got hypertension over the next decade, compared with 11 percent of women who had normal blood pressure during pregnancy.  The study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove how or if pregnancy conditions like preeclampsia or gestational hypertension cause high blood pressure later in life.  Even so, the results suggest that even young women who develop high blood pressure during pregnancy should be monitored for symptoms of heart disease long before they reach middle age, when hypertension becomes more common, Boyd said.  A separate U.S. study in The BMJ examined data on more than 5,500 women with a history of high blood pressure during pregnancy and found that obesity may influence their odds of developing chronic high blood pressure after delivery.  “Women are generally advised to keep a healthy weight before and throughout pregnancy,” said lead study author Dr. Simon Timpka of Lund University Diabetes Center in Malmo, Sweden. “In order to reduce the risk of post-pregnancy hypertension, it appears especially important for women with a history of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy to keep a healthy weight,” Timpka said by email.  Avoiding chronic high blood pressure after preeclampsia or gestational hypertension, however, isn’t all about diet and exercise, said Dr. Leonie Callaway, author of an accompanying editorial and professor at the University of Queensland Centre for Clinical Research. “It is also about work-life balance, contentment, spirituality, engagement in nature, social connections, family connections, etc.,” Callaway said by email. “Take a diagnosis of hypertension in pregnancy as a special gift - a warning that you are a special person and you really need to take care of yourself.” SOURCE: bit.ly/2twXFUJ, bit.ly/2vrXmbp and bit.ly/2tO5NLV The BMJ, online July 12, 2017.

The European Medicines Agency said its Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) had recommended the product, Lutathera, setting the stage for full approval within a couple of months. Chief Executive Stefano Buono told Reuters the company was also ready to re-file its application for U.S. marketing approval with the Food and Drug Administration this month. The French biotech company has described the new drug as a multi-hundred million dollar opportunity, with the potential to transform its fortunes. AAA, which was spun off from Europe's physics research centre CERN 15 years ago and is listed on Nasdaq, had sales from existing diagnostic products of $34.9 million in the first quarter of 2017. Shares in the company reached an all-time high following news of the EU recommendation. Analysts at Jefferies said the positive decision had been expected but was reassuring ahead of a U.S. verdict on the medicine. Lutathera is unusual in harnessing the same molecule that is already used to diagnose cancer to also deliver treatment. The radiopharmaceutical works by hitting cancer cells with high energy electrons, just like radiotherapy, but the injection targets gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) that over-express a certain protein. It has shown impressive results in clinical tests against a disease associated with very poor survival, and one that killed Apple co-founder Jobs in 2011. The path to market, however, has not been easy for the drugmaker, due to technical problems with the drug's filing at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and a slower than initially hoped approval timetable in Europe. In a Phase III clinical trial, results of which were reported in the New England Journal of Medicine in January, Lutathera reduced the risk of disease progression compared to standard care by 80 percent. That compares favourably with existing NETs drugs such as Novartis' Afinitor and Pfizer's Sutent. Reporting by Ben Hirschler; Editing by Elaine Hardcastle"

The 37-year-old had been suffering from musician's dystonia, a neurological movement disorder which leads to involuntary muscle contractions.  Prasad had to be kept conscious during the surgery as the doctors needed continuous feedback to work out exactly which parts of the brain were to be targeted to stop the cramps affecting the three fingers on his left hand. So the obvious thing was to play his guitar. It is only the eighth time in the world that such a procedure has been undertaken with the patient being conscious, a statement by Bengaluru's Bhagwan Mahaveer Jain hospital said on Friday. A 14-mm hole was made in the skull and a specialized electrode was passed into the brain under local anesthesia, Sharan Srinivasan, a stereotactic and functional neurosurgeon at the hospital, said. Prasad was overwhelmed with the outcome after suffering since October 2015 with the disorder that could have ended his career.  He had tried several hospitals to find a cure, but most doctors could not diagnose the problem or had focused on the cramps rather than the neurological activity causing them. It was a very emotional moment for me and my family. This is what I have been waiting for, said Prasad, who had quit his IT job to pursue a career in music. It was very disheartening and depressing for me. I used to cry often due to that. Every morning I would wake up and try to play the guitar. But after 5 minutes, I gave up. The disorder is estimated to affect around 1-2 percent of all professional musicians. After the surgery on July 11, he will need a couple of weeks of physiotherapy to help his recovery and get back to performing pain-free.

Oxfam projected the number could rise to more than 600,000 cases, the largest ever recorded in any country in a single year since records began, exceeding Haiti in 2011.  Nigel Timmins, the charity's humanitarian director who has just returned from the country, said: Cholera has spread unchecked in a country already on its knees after two years of war and which is teetering on the brink of famine. For many people, weakened by war and hunger, cholera is the knockout blow. The WHO reported 368,207 suspected cases and 1,828 deaths  in the Arabian Peninsula country since late April. Every day we have 5,000 more Yemenis falling sick with symptoms of acute watery diarrhoea or cholera, WHO spokeswoman Fadela Chaib told a news briefing in Geneva. Yemen's cholera outbreak is far from being controlled, the rainy season has just started and may increase the paths of transmission. Sustained efforts are required to stop the spread of this disease, she said. Millions are malnourished in Yemen where famine looms, the United Nations says. A Saudi Arabia-led coalition intervened in Yemen's civil war in 2015, backing government forces fighting Iran-allied Houthi rebels and fighting limits access for aid workers. Surveillance data confirms a slight decline in suspected cases over the past two weeks in some of the most affected governorates - Amanat Al Asimah, Amran and Sana'a, Chaib said.  But great caution was called for as there is a backlog in reporting and data is still being analyzed, she said.  Oxfam, which is based in Britain, said Yemen's rainy season from July to September would increase the risk of the disease spreading further through water contaminated with faeces. It is feared that the total number of people infected could eventually rise to over 600,000, making it one of the largest outbreaks since records began in 1949, Oxfam said. The WHO did not provide its latest planning figure. The fighting is hugely exacerbating the ability to stop this epidemic of cholera. The kind of disintegration of the health system in Yemen as a result of the conflict at a time of cholera is an absolutely lethal combination, U.N. human rights spokesman Rupert Colville told Friday's briefing.

It is not illegal to be gay in China but LGBT activists say deeply conservative attitudes toward homosexuality in some sections of society have led to occasional government clamp-downs. In May, the lesbian dating app Rela was shut down, though it was not yet clear why. Many people were surprised by the cancellation. Many young Chinese people regard Chengdu as gaydu, or the city of the gays, due to its liberal LGBT views.

Trump on Wednesday told the Senate's fractured Republican majority to revive a bill to repeal and replace Obamacare that collapsed on Monday after Republicans from both moderate and conservative factions pulled their support. But after a late-night emergency meeting on how to win over holdouts appeared to yield no progress, senators expressed irritation.  It really is starting to feel like a bazaar, $50 billion here, $100 billion there, and I feel like it’s losing coherency, Senator Bob Corker said. Susan Collins, a moderate Republican who strongly objected to the revised bill, said she didn't even know what we are proceeding to next week and said Trump had contributed to the lack of clarity over the next steps.  I’m unclear, having heard the president and read his tweets, exactly which bill he wants to pass and whether he is for just repealing, or repealing and replacing - whether he’s for the Senate bill, Collins said. Trump, who had campaigned heavily on a promise to repeal and replace Obamacare, the signature legislative achievement of former Democratic President Barack Obama, took a hands-off approach to the healthcare debate last week.  On Tuesday he suggested that he was fine with letting Obamacare fail. But on Wednesday he switched course and demanded that senators stay in Washington through their planned August recess until they find common ground on healthcare. The repeal and replace bill crafted by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell would leave 22 million Americans without health insurance coverage by 2026, the nonpartisan U.S. Congressional Budget Office said on Thursday. Before Trump's Wednesday lunch with 49 Republican senators, McConnell had planned to hold a straight repeal vote next week, but that appeared doomed with several Republican senators having already said they oppose that approach. The CBO said on Wednesday that 32 million more Americans would lose their insurance coverage by 2026 under a bill that would repeal much of Obamacare without a replacement. That compares with the 20 million who have become insured under Obamacare, as the Affordable Care Act is known. The Senate's number two Republican, John Cornyn, said he expected a procedural vote on Tuesday to take up a healthcare bill, but said knowing what the healthcare bill will be before the procedural vote is a luxury we don't have. An aide to Cornyn said he was referring to the amendment process that could change the bill once it is on the Senate floor. It’s difficult to predict what the final product will look like, the aide said.  Mccain's Cancer Adds Pressure Adding to Republicans' woes was news late Wednesday that Senator John McCain has aggressive brain cancer. With a narrow 52-48 Republican majority, their fight for votes becomes even more difficult. McCain, a Republican known for his feisty independence, tweeted, ... unfortunately for my sparring partners in Congress, I'll be back soon, so stand-by! As they sought to break the impasse, senators were discussing changes to Medicaid, the government healthcare program for the poor that was expanded under Obamacare. One possibility would give states flexibility to use Medicaid funding to help cover healthcare expenses of people who would lose their Medicaid coverage under the Senate bill's sharp cuts to the program. Senator Rob Portman, one of the undecideds on the healthcare bill, called the proposal progress. But Collins said she had not heard a Medicaid proposal that would tempt her to vote yes. Republicans say Obamacare is a costly intrusion into the healthcare system, but the party is divided between moderates concerned the Senate bill would eliminate insurance for millions of low-income Americans and conservatives who want to see even deeper cuts. McConnell revealed little of his next steps but said Republicans were not giving up. The fight to move beyond the status quo of Obamacare was certainly never going to be easy, he told the Senate on Thursday. But we've come a long way, and I look forward to continuing our work together to finally bring relief. The dramatic week at Congress and in the White House was taking its toll.          I'm getting a little anxious, Corker said. He said the best approach would be a repeal, with a delayed effective date by which time lawmakers could develop a replacement. Democrats, who are united in their opposition to the Republican efforts and reveled in this week's deadlock, told Republicans to abandon their healthcare efforts as they appeared no closer to reconciling policy differences after Wednesday's meeting.   It's time for Congress to pivot away from the bills that are going nowhere, said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi.

Shares of the burrito chain, which has been under a microscope since it was linked to a string of food safety lapses in 2015, fell 4.5 percent to close at $356.05 on Thursday. Chipotle has worked to win back customers and rebuild the reputation of the once-high flying chain, whose stock traded well above $700 before it was connected to E. coli, Salmonella and Norovirus outbreaks in 2015. Testing confirmed Norovirus in one customer who ate at the Virginia Chipotle restaurant that was briefly closed this week following reports of diners falling ill, said Victor Avitto, environmental health supervisor for the Loudoun County Public Health Department, which has jurisdiction over the restaurant. Chipotle closed the restaurant on Monday and reopened it on Wednesday, following a deep cleaning. News of the outbreak came after more than 100 diners reported symptoms on iwaspoisoned.com, a crowd-sourced website.  Chipotle expected the confirmation, since the symptoms described by customers of the Sterling restaurant were consistent with Norovirus, spokesman Chris Arnold said.   Norovirus is the No. 1 cause of illness from contaminated food in the United States, resulting in an estimated 19 million to 21 million illnesses annually, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It is highly contagious and can spread from person to person, as well as through food prepared by an infected person. Symptoms include cramping, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Elsewhere, a customer video showing three rodents in a Chipotle restaurant in Dallas' West End neighborhood earlier this week was widely shared online. Other diners, who witnessed the lunchtime incident, told a local television station they saw rodents falling from the restaurant's ceiling. A few mice did get inside one restaurant from outside due to a small structural gap in the building, Chipotle's Arnold said on Thursday. Our management immediately removed them and the gap was quickly repaired, said Arnold, who added that the chain had contacted guests to apologize.

Even those who only gained 10 pounds faced a higher risk of major chronic diseases and aging poorly, the study authors report in JAMA. “In the past, most focus has been put on people who are already obese and how they should lose weight. The problem is that people don’t become obese overnight,” said senior study author Dr. Frank Hu of the Harvard T.H Chan School of Public Health in Boston.  “Americans start to gain weight in early adulthood and put on a small amount each year, such as a half pound or pound, which adds up in the long-term,” Hu told Reuters Health in a phone interview. “Then it’s difficult to lose weight and maintain that lost weight. That’s why prevention is extremely important.” The researchers analyzed data from two large studies that followed nearly 93,000 U.S. women and more than 25,000 U.S. men over decades. Participants reported what their weights had been in young adulthood - at age 18 for women and age 21 for men - and again at age 55.  The study team then tracked health changes after age 55, including the development of various diseases, cognitive decline and physical limitations associated with aging. Women gained an average of 28 pounds over 37 years, and men put on an average 21 pounds over 34 years. Consistently across both genders, those who gained more weight were more likely to be physically inactive, non-smokers, have unhealthy diets and have more chronic diseases by the time they were in their 50s.  About one in five women and one in three men were considered to be aging healthily in their 70s. Compared to people who stayed close to their youthful weight, those who gained just 5.5 to 22 pounds (2.5 kg to 10 kg) had nearly double the risk of type 2 diabetes, as well as 38 percent higher risk of gallstones and 9 percent to 25 percent increased risk for hypertension, heart disease and cancer. People who gained 22 to 44 pounds (10 kg to 20 kg) had a quadrupled risk of developing type 2 diabetes, doubled risk of developing gallstones and 30 percent to 60 percent increased risk of hypertension, heart disease and an obesity-related cancer.  Gaining more than 44 pounds (20 kg) was tied to 10 times the odds of hypertension, three times the odds of gallstones and twice the heart disease risk of people who had stayed at the same weight.   “The overall results were not surprising because we know that excess weight gain is associated with many consequences, but the moderate weight gain statistics were sobering,” Hu said. “Most people gain more than 20 pounds, so this is a wake-up call for people.” Each 10-pound increase in weight gain was associated with 17 percent reduction in the odds of aging healthily.  “The good news about the obesity battle is that we’re seeing plateaus and decreases in children, but the bad news is we’re still seeing increases in adulthood,” said Dr. William Dietz of George Washington University in Washington, D.C., who wrote a commentary accompanying the study. Dietz suggested turning toward workplaces to implement healthy living strategies and cut down on daytime snacking.

Researchers followed 43 new arrivals for two to three years and found that kids with at least four so-called protective factors, like a two-parent household, financial security and proximity to their own ethnic community, had better social and emotional wellbeing than refugee children with less support. Previous research has found refugee children can be highly resilient and adjust well to their new homes, the authors note in the Archives of Disease in Childhood. “This is very important for us to know as it enables host countries to actively address these factors in order to optimize health and wellbeing in refugee children,” said lead study author Dr. Karen Zwi of the University of New South Wales and Sydney Children’s Hospitals Network.  To foster a more supportive environment for child refugees, host countries might, for example, provide families with housing and financial assistance, help parents find jobs and assist schools in creating supportive environments with sports clubs, homework help and language assistance, Zwi said by email.  “For those more vulnerable children who have fewer protective factors, or are at higher risk for poor social-emotional outcomes, we can provide preventive and proactive support to try to buffer them or protect them to make their outcomes as good as they can be,” Zwi added.  “In the long run, better social-emotional wellbeing is likely to predict improved adult productivity, educational level and overall capacity to give back to the host country,” Zwi said.  For the study, researchers examined data collected on refugee children two and three years after their arrival in Australia between 2009 and 2011. At the start of the study, kids ranged in age from 4 to 17 years old.  After children had been in the country for two years, researchers asked their parents to complete questionnaires designed to assess social and emotional wellbeing and the risk of stress-related illness. Parents were asked to do the same questionnaires again a year later.  Among the children for whom there was data from both questionnaires, all of the kids with at least six protective factors had similar or better results in the second social and emotional wellbeing assessments compared to the first time around. In contrast, for roughly two-thirds of the kids with only one protective factor wellbeing had deteriorated by the time of the second assessment.  The protective factors that seemed to have the biggest impact on improved wellbeing scores were having a father present when kids arrived in the country, coming from Africa, having relatives in Australia prior to arrival and proximity to their own ethnic community, the study found.  One limitation of the study, however, is that only 39 kids had complete questionnaires at two years and just 38 kids had complete questionnaires after three years. In addition, researchers only had data on protective factors for 31 kids at year two and 33 children at year three.  Even so, the findings highlight the importance of post-immigration factors in shaping how well refugee children adjust to their new country, said Dr. Hamish Graham, a researcher at the Center for International Child Health at the University of Melbourne.  “Other studies have also found that parental psychological wellbeing and family functioning are among the most significant predictors of child health and wellbeing, and this has certainly been my experience working with refugee children and families,” Graham, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.  “Refugee families commonly experience ongoing stress due to financial hardship, housing, making social connections, and navigating new school, health and social service systems,” Graham added. “As a society, we should view support for families through these challenges as an important investment in their social and emotional wellbeing.” SOURCE: bit.ly/2tjDXb0 Archives of Disease in Childhood, online July 11, 2017.

The challenge, which came six weeks after the state's governor signed the law, was the latest salvo in a battle over state laws enacted by Republican-controlled state legislatures that advocates say limit access to abortion. The law we challenged today in Texas is part of a nationwide scheme to undermine these constitutional rights and ban abortion one restriction at a time, Nancy Northup, president of the Center for Reproductive Rights, said in a statement. The lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court in Austin by Texas abortion provider Whole Woman's Health, Planned Parenthood groups and others. The suit, which names Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and others as defendants, seeks an injunction and a ruling that the law is unconstitutional. Paxton declined to comment on the challenge. Anti-abortion group Texas Right to Life last month praised the legislation, calling it the most significant pro-life victory of the state's legislative session. The lawsuit targets a portion of the law - known as Senate Bill 8, which is set to go into effect on Sept. 1 - that bans dilation and evacuation abortion procedures. The Texas law refers to the procedure as dismemberment abortion, in which a combination of suction and forceps are used to bring tissue through the cervix. Opponents of the law say that after about 15 weeks of pregnancy it is the safest method of abortion. Seven other U.S. states have approved similar bans, prompting legal challenges that prevented the bans from taking effect in Louisiana, Kansas and Oklahoma, according to the Center for Reproductive Rights. Last year, Whole Woman's Health led a legal fight that ended in the U.S. Supreme Court striking down a Texas abortion law that had shuttered nearly half the state's clinics by imposing strict regulations on doctors and facilities. The latest Texas law, signed in June by the state's Republican Governor Greg Abbott, also requires abortion providers to dispose of aborted fetal tissue through burial or cremation. The plaintiffs in the lawsuit intend to challenge that provision as well. The state law was enacted despite the fact that U.S. District Judge Sam Sparks in Austin put a temporary halt on a similar state regulation on fetal tissue disposal in January.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a rare, disabling autoimmune disease that damages the central nervous system and predominantly develops in women of childbearing age. It can lead to fatigue, pain, vision loss and impaired coordination and motor skills.   For the current study, researchers examined data on total breastfeeding duration after all pregnancies for 397 mothers newly diagnosed with MS or a precursor condition and a control group of 433 mothers who were similar in age, race, income, education and smoking history who didn’t have MS.  Compared with women who breastfed for a total of no more than four months, mothers who nursed babies for at least 15 months were 53 percent less likely to develop MS, the study found.  “This study opens up the possibility that along with reducing the risk of heart disease, diabetes, ovarian and breast cancer, breastfeeding particularly for longer durations may also reduce the risk of multiple sclerosis and possibly other autoimmune diseases,” said lead study author Dr. Annette Langer-Gould, a neurology researcher with Kaiser Permanente in Pasadena, California.  Why breastfeeding might reduce the risk of MS is unclear.  One theory is that shifts in sex hormone levels with pregnancy and breastfeeding might play a role, and another possible explanation is that a lack of ovulation might play a role, researchers note in the journal Neurology.  To test these ideas, researchers looked at the total number of years women spent ovulating based on the age they began menstruating, the total time they spent pregnant or nursing, and in some cases their age at menopause.  They didn’t find an association between the duration of ovulation and the risk of developing MS, however. The number of pregnancies, use of hormonal contraceptives, and the age women gave birth for the first time also didn’t appear to influence the odds of getting MS.  Starting menstruation at a younger age did appear to raise risk. Women who were 15 or older when they got their first period were 44 percent less likely to develop MS as women who were 11 or younger when they began menstruating, the study found.  Overall, 85 women without MS breastfed for at least 15 months, compared to just 44 of the mothers with MS.  In contrast, 110 women without MS breastfed for no more than four months, compared to 118 women with MS.  The study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how breastfeeding might protect against MS. Other limitations include the lack of data on why some women didn’t breastfeed at all or did so only for a few months, the authors note.  Breastfeeding might curb the risk of MS by reducing pro-inflammatory activity, however, this area has not been carefully studied by basic scientists, Langer-Gould said by email.  Because very few women who choose to breastfeed are unable to do it for biological reasons, it’s unlikely that an inability to produce milk would explain the study findings, Langer-Gould added. “It is possible that women who choose to breastfeed, particularly for longer durations, lead an overall healthier lifestyle and that another aspect of a healthy lifestyle that we did not measure could explain these findings,” she said. “Even if the reasons aren’t yet clear, the study strengthens the body of evidence suggesting that breastfeeding influences MS, said Dr. Patricia Coyle, director of the MS Comprehensive Care Center Stony Brook University Medical Center in New York.  “This is further evidence of a potential benefit of breastfeeding: to avoid future immune mediated disease,” Coyle, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. “But most important is trying to understand why breastfeeding has this impact on MS risk.” SOURCE: bit.ly/2uNbfDS Neurology, online July 12, 2017."

Bossert noted that the Bush and Obama administrations took steps to address biological threats after letters containing anthrax spores were sent to two Democratic senators and several news organizations in the weeks following the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. The spores infected 22 people, five of whom died. But, he added, “There have been a lot of fits and starts in our investments.” “At this point, we need to look clear eyed at the fact that we may have a devastating pandemic influenza or an intentional anthrax attack,” said Bossert. He noted recent news reports that scientists in Canada used commercially available genetic material to construct the extinct horse pox virus, a relative of the small pox virus, which claimed tens of millions of lives before being wiped out. “That’s (horsepox) not going to kill any of us, but that suggests that somebody might now in the future possess the ability to produce synthetic small pox without a live virus and that scares me to death,” he said. The threat of disease pandemics demands global attention, he said. Some experts have criticized the Trump administration for seeking reductions in funding for global health programs that they contend would hurt the country’s ability to prevent and respond to biological threats like pandemics. Bossert, however, said that the administration plans to give “full-throated support” to the Global Health Security Agenda, a partnership of more than 50 nations and international organizations that works to build countries’ capacities to prevent and fight infectious diseases.

Earlier on Wednesday, Trump took Senate Republicans to task for failing to agree on how to dismantle Obamacare, as a new report showed 32 million Americans would lose health insurance if senators opt to repeal the law without a replacement. Trump gathered 49 Republican senators for a White House lunch after a bill to repeal and replace the 2010 Affordable Care Act collapsed on Monday amid dissent from a handful of the party's conservatives and moderates.  After Trump's exhortation to keep trying, party members met with Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price behind closed doors on Wednesday night to try to finally come together on a major Republican promise of the past seven years - undoing former Democratic President Barack Obama's signature legislation, popularly known as Obamacare. There was no immediate breakthrough. We still have some issues that divide us, said Senator Ted Cruz, a conservative who has proposed letting insurers offer cheaper bare-bones plans that do not comply with Obamacare regulations.  Republicans attending the late meeting sent their staff away in order to talk frankly and Senator John Kennedy said everyone was negotiating in good faith but he added he did not know if they would reach agreement.  Almost all the other senators rushed off after the meeting without comment. As it was getting underway, the nearly two dozen Republican senators were shaken by news that their colleague, veteran Senator John McCain, had been diagnosed with brain cancer. McCain's absence from the Senate makes the job of passing a healthcare bill more difficult because leaders need every Republican vote they can get. Related CoverageLatest Senate healthcare bill would leave 22 millio without insurance: CBOFactbox: Trump on Twitter (July 19) - Republican Senators, Healthcare bill, McCainSenator Corker backs Obamacare repeal with reasonable transition: statementObviously, I think more people are worried about his health than thinking about the math. You understand the math. Obviously it makes things difficult, Senator Bob Corker said as he left the meeting. Trump had taken a hands-off approach to the healthcare debate last week and suggested on Tuesday that he was fine with  letting Obamacare fail. Then on Wednesday he switched course and demanded senators stay in Washington through their planned August recess until they find common ground on healthcare. We can repeal, but we should repeal and replace, and we shouldn't leave town until this is complete, Trump said at the meeting. Trump made the repeal and replacement of Obamacare, which he has called a disaster, a central promise of his 2016 campaign. Even with Trump's new push, Republican leaders in the Senate face a difficult task getting moderates and conservatives to agree on an overhaul that can pass. U.S. President Donald trump speaks during a lunch meeting with Senate Republicans to discuss healthcare at the White House in Washington, U.S., July 19, 2017.Kevin LamarqueSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had planned to hold a straight repeal vote next week, but several Republican senators have already said they oppose that approach.  Thirty-two million Americans would lose their health insurance by 2026 if Obamacare is scrapped without an alternative in place, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office reported on Wednesday, while 17 million would become uninsured next year alone.  At the same time, premiums on individual insurance plans would rise 25 percent next year and double by 2026.  The CBO's estimates were unchanged from a previous report that assessed the impact of a 2015 bill to repeal Obamacare that passed the House of Representatives and Senate and was vetoed by Obama.  'True Death Spiral' Slideshow (15 Images)Democrats were swift to highlight the CBO's assessment, while Republicans remained silent. President Trump and Republicans have repeatedly promised to lower premiums and increase coverage, yet each proposal they offer would do the opposite, Senate Democratic leader Charles Schumer said in a statement.     Insurers and hospitals have lobbied against straight repeal, saying the limbo would increase uncertainty and their costs. CBO projects half the country would have no insurers in the individual market by 2020 under the new repeal bill. That's a true death spiral, tweeted Larry Levitt, vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a healthcare research group. Republicans say Obamacare is a costly intrusion into the healthcare system. But the party is divided between moderates concerned the Senate bill would eliminate insurance for millions of low-income Americans and conservatives who want to see even deeper cuts to Obamacare, which boosted the number of Americans with health insurance by 20 million through mandates on individuals and employers, and income-based subsidies. Moderate Republican Senators Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski and Shelley Moore Capito said they opposed McConnell's plan for a repeal that would take effect in two years. All three attended the lunch with Trump. With Democrats united in opposition to repeal, McConnell can only lose two votes from the Republicans' 52-48 majority in the 100-seat Senate to pass healthcare legislation. Opponents of repeal protested throughout Senate buildings on Wednesday afternoon, leading to 155 arrests, police said. Demonstrators returned in the evening to yell as senators arrived for the meeting. Party fractures also emerged in the House of Representatives. The chamber passed a plan to repeal and replace Obamacare in May. But on Wednesday, the House Freedom Caucus, the Republican Party's conservative wing, filed a petition to vote on a straight repeal. House Speaker Paul Ryan's spokeswoman, AshLee Strong, said: The House passed an Obamacare repeal-and-replace bill we are proud of and we hope the Senate will take similar action.

Recovery exercises involving running or using foam rollers for an intense muscle massage both cleared out much more of the lactic acid that collects in the blood after a burst of exertion than just resting, researchers found. Excess lactic acid in the bloodstream can limit muscle performance and hinder subsequent rescues, the study team writes in the American Journal of Emergency Medicine.  “Drowning continues to be one of the leading causes of death worldwide in the absence of disease,” said one of the authors, Roberto Barcala-Furelos of the Universidad de Vigo in Santiago de Compostela and the International Drowning Research Alliance in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.  More than 360,000 people drown every year, according to the World Health Organization.  “However, the prevalence of drowning deaths on supervised beaches is very low relative to beaches that are not monitored,” Barcala-Furelos told Reuters Health by email. “Lifeguards are a key to avoid drowning, thanks to their prevention and rescues.” To see what most helps lifeguards recover after a rescue, the researchers set up an experiment with 12 surf lifeguards on a beach near Marin, a coastal town in northwestern Spain. To recreate a typical rescue, each lifeguard ran 10 meters (about 11 yards) to the ocean, swam 100 meters with fins to an adult victim who was pretending to be unconscious, towed the victim 100 meters back to shore and pulled the victim onto dry sand.  All the lifeguards did this three times over three days, each time following the mock rescue with one of the recovery approaches. The lifeguards’ average age was 24 and they all wore wetsuits during the mock rescues. Immediately after each rescue, the lifeguards had their blood tested to measure lactate levels and reported on their perceived exhaustion. They then removed their wetsuits and began a 25-minute recovery period doing one of three activities.  The running recovery included 16 minutes of running at a moderate pace and five more minutes of walking. The foam rolling recovery included five exercises over 20 minutes that involved using body weight and foam rollers to deeply massage the muscles of each leg. The third recovery activity was simply sitting and resting for 20 minutes. After every recovery exercise, the lifeguards’ blood was tested again. Over a total of 36 water rescues by the 12 lifeguards, average blood lactate levels rose roughly three-fold immediately after the rescue. But after either the running or foam roller recovery exercises, the levels dropped by more than half. In contrast, just resting led to about a one-third decrease in lactate levels.  “Everyone engaged in activities requiring repeated and exhaustive physical effort could have interest in this,” said Damian Morgan of Federation University in Churchill, Australia, who studies drowning prevention but wasn’t involved in the current study. One limitation of the study is its small sample size, the authors note. In the future, the research team plans to test how the recovery methods influence the day-to-day work of a lifeguard, what happens with lactate levels when a second rescue is performed and how other recovery methods can help rescue teams. “The main question is . . . ‘Does it happen like this in the real world?’,” Morgan said  by email. “Lifesavers often work in teams. They commonly use rescue boards or water craft. It’s unknown how often they are ever subject to the conditions specified in this study.” “Of course, lifesavers in general benefit from recovering after a rescue,” Pertti Suominen of Helsinki University Hospital in Finland told Reuters Health by email. “In any location, we can help lifeguards by bathing in areas where we can be seen - and rescued promptly, if required. In drowning, every second counts.”"

While the typical athlete is not at a greater risk of knee osteoarthritis, it was interesting to see that certain athletes may be more likely to have knee osteoarthritis later in life, specifically, elite and non-elite soccer players and elite-level long-distance runners, elite-level weight lifters and elite-level wrestlers,” lead author Jeffrey B. Driban from Tufts Medical Center in Boston told Reuters Health by email. “It was reassuring that even in these high-risk sports less than 1 in 10 former athletes had knee osteoarthritis,” he added.  More than 40 percent of people will experience osteoarthritis of the knee at some point in their lives, especially if they have a history of knee injury or are obese. Whether sports participation increases this risk remains unclear, however, the authors note in the Journal of Athletic Training.  Driban’s team reviewed the medical literature and analyzed 17 past studies that examined links between participation in specific sports and the odds of developing osteoarthritis of the knee. Overall, the rates of knee arthritis did not differ meaningfully between sport participants and non-participants. Among the sport participants, 7.7 percent developed knee arthritis, and among those who didn't participate in sports, it was 7.3 percent.  But participation in certain sports was associated with a much higher risk. Elite-level long-distance running, soccer, weightlifting and wrestling were tied to knee osteoarthritis rates three to seven times higher than those of nonparticipants. “It is important to note that most of these sports involve a high risk of injury and have lots of loading on the knee joint,” Driban said. “For example, Olympic-level marathon runners expose their joints to many more miles per week than a typical runner. Or alternatively, elite-level weight-lifters expose their joints to much greater forces during each repetition than the typical person in a weight room. These elite athletes really are unique and they may also start competitive sports at a younger age, compete for more years, put in more hours per year, be more likely to play through pain, or rush back to competition too soon.”  Still, among some non-elite athletes, there was also some added risk. For example, the risk of knee arthritis was nine times higher in those who played high school football compared with those who didn't.  On the other hand, elite basketball, boxing, shooting and track and field did not appear to be associated with knee arthritis. “Physical activity is commonly recommended for children and adults,” Driban said. For people who want the health benefits of sport participation, but are worried about the risk of knee arthritis, they may want to choose non-contact and low-impact sports where the risk of injury is lower, such as swimming and cycling, he said. “For people playing sports like soccer, where injuries are common, it is important that they encourage their teams to adopt injury prevention programs into their warm-ups,” he added. “These 10-15 minute programs can prevent over 40 percent of injuries, which could help keep athletes active and reduce the risk of the long-term consequences of joint injuries.” In a setting where the athlete, coach and parents are “focused on today,” Driban said, “it is important that the certified athletic trainers and other sports medicine professionals be the ones thinking about the athlete's health tomorrow.”  Knee injuries are the greatest risk factor for developing osteoarthritis, whether you are an athlete or not,” said Dr. Robert Brophy from Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, Missouri, who has extensively studied knee osteoarthritis and various aspects of sports and recreation injuries. “This emphasizes the importance of injury prevention programs and optimal management of knee injuries once they occur,” said Brophy, who was not involved in the current study. “I do not think there is enough data supporting these findings to make any recommendations regarding participation of non-elite athletes in sports,” he said in an email. “The documented benefits of physical activity and participation in sports far outweigh the evidence presented by this study.”"

Already in six out of 11 countries surveyed in Africa, Asia and Latin America for a WHO-led report, researchers found that more than 10 percent of HIV patients starting antiretroviral drugs had a strain resistant to the most widely-used medicines.  Once a threshold of 10 percent is reached, the WHO recommends countries urgently review their HIV treatment programs and switch to different drug regimens to limit the spread of resistance. HIV drug resistance develops when patients do not stick to a prescribed treatment plan - often because they do not have consistent access to proper HIV treatment and care.  Patients with HIV drug resistance start to see their treatment failing, with levels of HIV in their blood rising, and they risk passing on drug-resistant strains to others.    The WHO's warning comes as the latest data from UNAIDS showed encouraging progress against the worldwide HIV/AIDS epidemic, with deaths rates falling and treatment rates rising.       Some 36.7 million people around the world are infected with HIV, but more than half of them - 19.5 million - are getting the  antiretroviral therapy medicines they need to suppress the HIV virus and keep their disease in check.   The WHO said, however, that rising HIV drug resistance trends could lead to more infections and deaths.  Mathematical modeling shows an additional 135,000 deaths and 105,000 new infections could follow in the next five years if no action is taken, and HIV treatment costs could increase by an extra $650 million during this time.      We need to ensure that people who start treatment can stay on effective treatment, to prevent the emergence of HIV drug resistance, said Gottfried Hirnschall, director of the WHO's HIV and hepatitis program.  When levels of HIV drug resistance become high we recommend that countries shift to an alternative first-line therapy for those... starting treatment. The WHO said it was issuing new guidance for countries on HIV drug resistance to help them act early against it. These included guidelines on how to improve the quality and consistency of treatment programs and how to transition to new HIV treatments, if and when they are needed.

In the eight-week, 282-patient trial the experimental drug, IW-3718, was given on top of widely used drugs for the painful condition, such as Prilosec or Nexium, and compared with those taking just the standard treatments, known as proton pump inhibitors (PPI). At the highest tested dose - 1,500 milligrams twice a day - IW-3718 plus a PPI led to a 58 percent decrease from baseline in weekly heartburn severity versus a 46 percent reduction for PPI alone, a difference deemed statistically significant and clinically meaningful, Ironwood reported. The Ironwood drug also led to a 55.4 percent mean decrease in weekly episodes of regurgitation in which acid rises into the throat, burning the esophagus. That compared with a decrease of 38 percent for PPI alone. There were no serious adverse side effects reported, with constipation the most common side effect.  Drugs like AstraZeneca Plc's Nexium are highly effective in neutralizing stomach acid, but millions of people are still not getting adequate relief. IW-3781 works on bile acid rising from the small intestines, intercepting and trapping it before it reaches the esophagus. There are currently no approved treatments that help patients still suffering from GERD despite taking PPIs. The data provide strong evidence that bile plays a key role in uncontrolled GERD and that IW-3718 may bring a much-needed new approach to treating these patients, Dr Michael Vaezi, one of the study's researchers from Vanderbilt University Medical Center, said in a statement. An estimated 10 million Americans and more than 60 million  globally suffer from uncontrolled GERD, the company said.  We expect this drug to be north of $2 billion in (annual) sales opportunity. It's a very big category, Chief Executive Peter Hecht told Reuters.

Initial payments are a lot less, with Ablynx receiving an upfront payment of 23 million euros and 8 million in research funding, but big milestones will kick in if any of the experimental projects achieve commercial success. The deal gives Sanofi access to a total of eight of Ablynx's so-called nanobody medicines, which are derived from camel and llama antibodies. The focus is on developing products to treat immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, the companies said. Shares in Ablynx rose more than 6 percent in early trading on news of the tie-up.

In its latest global report on the pandemic, which has killed around 35 million people worldwide since it began in the 1980s, the UNAIDS agency said there were particularly encouraging signs in Africa, a continent ravaged by the disease. Eastern and southern Africa are leading the way, reducing new HIV infections by nearly 30 percent since 2010, the report said. Malawi, Mozambique, Uganda and Zimbabwe have gone further, cutting new HIV infections by 40 percent or more since 2010.  And among the most significant impacts of a vast scale-up of HIV testing, treatment and prevention programs, has been in the reduction of AIDS-related deaths, which have dropped by almost half since 2005.  As a result, more people in what had been some of the worst affected countries, are now living longer. In eastern and southern Africa, for example, average life expectancy increased by nearly 10 years from 2006 to 2016. Communities and families are thriving as AIDS is being pushed back, said UNAIDS Executive Director Michel Sidibé. As we bring the epidemic under control, health outcomes are improving and nations are becoming stronger. The report warned, however, that not all regions are making progress. In the Middle East and North Africa, and in eastern Europe and central Asia, AIDS-related deaths have risen by 48 percent and 38 percent respectively, it said, mostly due to HIV-positive patients not getting access to treatment. Exceptions within these regions show that when concerted efforts are made, results happen, the report said, noting that in Algeria has increased HIV treatment access to 76 percent in 2016 from 24 percent in 2010, Morocco to 48 percent in 2016 from 16 percent in 2010 and Belarus to 45 percent from 29 percent. Globally in 2016, 19.5 million of the 36.7 million people with HIV had access to treatment, and AIDS-related deaths have fell to 1 million from 1.9 million in 2005.  Provided that scale-up continues, this puts the world on track to reach the global target of 30 million people on treatment by 2020, UNAIDS said. We met the 2015 target of 15 million people on treatment and we are on track to double that number to 30 million and meet the 2020 target, said Sidibé. We will continue to scale up to reach everyone in need ... leaving no one behind. Editing by Alison Williams"

In a wide-ranging analysis of the risk factors behind dementia, the researchers highlighted nine as particularly important.  These included staying in education beyond age 15, reducing high blood pressure, obesity and hearing loss in mid-life, and reducing smoking, depression, physical inactivity, social isolation and diabetes in later life. If all these risk factors were fully eliminated, the experts said, one in three cases of dementia worldwide could be prevented. Although dementia is diagnosed in later life, the brain changes usually begin to develop years before, said Gill Livingston, a professor at University College London and one of 24 international experts commissioned by The Lancet medical journal to conduct the analysis. A broader approach to prevention of dementia which reflects these changing risk factors will benefit our aging societies and help to prevent the rising number of dementia cases.     FILE PHOTO: Cigarettes are seen in this illustration photo taken May 24, 2017.Thomas White/Illustration/File PhotoLatest estimates from the Alzheimer's Association International show there are around 47 million people living with dementia globally and the cost of the brain-wasting diseases already $818 billion a year.  Dementia is caused by brain diseases, most commonly Alzheimer's disease, which result in the loss of brain cells and affect memory, thinking, behavior, navigational and spatial abilities and the ability to perform everyday activities.

The researchers found that among the 35 percent of all dementia cases that could be prevented, the three most important risk factors to target were increasing early life education, reducing mid-life hearing loss, and stopping smoking. Not completing secondary education while young can make people less resilient to cognitive decline when they get older, the experts said, while preserving hearing helps people experience a richer and more stimulating environment, building cognitive reserve. Stopping smoking reduces exposure to neurotoxins and improves heart health which, in turn, affects brain health, they said.  Reporting by Kate Kelland Editing by Jeremy Gaunt"

But publishing their findings on Wednesday, researchers said the results should not cause alarm, since the absolute risk of a child developing autism remains very small. Depression is common in women of childbearing age. In Europe, experts say that between 3 and 8 percent of pregnant women are prescribed antidepressants. Several previous studies have suggested associations between antidepressant use during pregnancy and autism in offspring, but researchers say it is not clear whether this is due to the illness itself, the antidepressants, or other unknown factors. A Canadian study published late in 2015 found that women who take antidepressants while pregnant may be more likely to have children with autism - but it also noted that the overall risk is very low. For this research, a team led by Dheeraj Rai at Britain's University of Bristol, analyzed data from more than 254,000 children living in Stockholm, Sweden, aged between 4 and 17.  Their mothers were either women with no mental illness who had not taken antidepressants, women who'd had a disorder and taken antidepressants while pregnant, or women with psychiatric disorders who had not taken antidepressants during pregnancy. Of the 3,342 children exposed to antidepressants during pregnancy, the study found that 4.1 percent were diagnosed with autism, compared with 2.9 percent of the 12,325 children not exposed to antidepressants whose mothers had a history of a mental illness. The researchers stressed, however, that the absolute risk was small: More than 95 percent of women in the study who took antidepressants during pregnancy did not have an autistic child. They estimated that, even if the association between antidepressant use and autism is causal, only 2 percent of cases would be prevented if in future no women with psychiatric disorders took antidepressants when pregnant. In a commentary on the findings, published in the BMJ British medical journal, Diana Schendel at Denmark's Aarhus University said the findings should be viewed through the kaleidoscope of possible causes of autism. She said the small apparent increased risk of a child developing autism must be carefully weighed against the substantial health consequences associated with untreated depression.

On average in the U.S., the length of time between a call for help and the arrival of emergency medical services is about eight minutes - but that rose to 14 minutes in rural areas (where about 10 percent of patients waited nearly 30 minutes), researchers found.  It’s long enough that if CPR isn’t done before the ambulance gets there, it’s not going to turn out well for the patient, said lead author Dr. Howard Mell, of CEP-America and Presence Mercy Medical Center in Aurora, Illinois. Mell and colleagues write in JAMA Surgery that having to wait for emergency responders to arrive is unavoidable, but few studies have looked at the length of the wait and whether it varied by setting. We really wanted to focus on providing the proof that active bystander training is necessary, Mell told Reuters Health. For the new study, the researchers analyzed emergency medical service data collected in 2015 from 486 U.S. agencies.  They had information on nearly 1.8 million emergency calls. About 4 percent were in rural areas, about 88 percent in suburban areas and about 8 percent in urban areas. On average, responders arrived 7.9 minutes after the call for help was placed. The average waiting time was 7 minutes in urban setting, 7.7 minutes in suburban areas, and 14.5 minutes in rural areas. The findings aren't meant to put rural emergency responders in a bad light, said Mell. Realistically, those units face greater barriers. They’re often volunteer units, he said. (They also need) additional time to get to the station and additional time to get to the location. Mell said the difference in response times between rural, urban and suburban settings was not as large as a person might expect. What this tells us is that all persons need to be trained to really assist – especially if you have family members at risk for these sudden life threatening events, he said. In an editorial published with the study, doctors say bystanders need to be prepared to deal with injuries that involve bleeding. First, we must empower citizens with legal protection similar to the good Samaritan coverage, which allows bystanders to engage in rescue from a cardiac event with CPR or the Heimlich maneuver for choking, they write. Bleeding/hemorrhage control should be included in these statutes.     How to stop bleeding should be taught alongside Basic Life Support and CPR training, Dr. Adil Haider of Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston and colleagues believe. A U.S. government program known as You Are the Help Until Help Arrives (here) helps teach people what to do while waiting for first responders, Mell said. Also, he said, local emergency personnel can be good resources. Those people either run those courses or know where to go to get those courses, he said.

For the study, researchers followed more than 85,000 working men and women without an atrial fibrillation diagnosis for a decade, starting when they were typically around 43 years old. During the study period, people who worked at least 55 hours a week were 40 percent more likely to develop atrial fibrillation than those who worked 35 to 40 hours.  “This study is important because it suggests a potential mechanism that could link long working hours to stroke,” said lead study author Dr. Mika Kivimaki of University College London in the UK. To assess the connection between work hours and atrial fibrillation, Kivimaki and colleagues examined data on workers in the UK, Denmark, Sweden and Finland.  When participants joined the study between 1991 and 2004, about 63 percent of them worked a standard 35 to 40 hour workweek, while just 5.2 percent worked 55 hours or more.  Long working hours were associated with slightly higher rates of obesity, inactivity, smoking and alcohol use.  During the study, 1,061 people were diagnosed with atrial fibrillation, researchers report in the European Heart Journal. Only 10 percent of them had already been diagnosed with heart disease by the time atrial fibrillation was found.  “For me, this was perhaps the most surprising finding,” Kivimaki said by email. “Initially, I thought people who work long hours may have a greater risk of coronary heart disease, which then elevates atrial fibrillation risk. Our findings show that the association from long working hours with atrial fibrillation was more direct.” In atrial fibrillation, electrical impulses in the upper chambers of the heart are chaotic, causing that part of the heart muscle to quiver rather than contracting normally. As a result, blood doesn’t move as well to the heart’s lower chambers. This can lead to the formation of blood clots, which can then travel through the arteries to the brain and cause a stroke. Among people working a standard week, 12.4 out of every 1,000 developed atrial fibrillation, the study found. But when people worked at least 55 hours, 17.6 out of every 1,000 got this diagnosis.  The study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove that working too much directly causes atrial fibrillation.  Other limitations include the lack of data on the type of job people worked or whether they typically worked day or night shifts, the authors note. In addition, researchers only had data on work hours and lifestyle behaviors like diet, exercise, smoking and alcohol use from a single assessment done at the start of the study period.  People might have changed jobs, working hours or shifts during the study, Drs. Lucas Boersma and Bakhtawar Mahmoodi, of St. Antonius Hospital in Nieuwegein, The Netherlands, write in an accompanying editorial. Shifts in things like diet and exercise might also explain some of the connection between long work hours and atrial fibrillation.  “It is probably not the direct effect of working longer hours that causes atrial fibrillation to develop. Most likely it is in the balance of amount of work load and how much work load each individual is able to endure over the long term,” Boersma told Reuters Health by email. “The type of work is also of great importance: stress level, physical labor, education and being equipped for the task at hand, working changing shifts, traveling through different time zones continuously, etc.,” Boersma added. “All of these may demand more than individual systems can take.” SOURCE: bit.ly/2vjEZVd and bit.ly/2vjAvyz European Heart Journal, online July 14, 2017."

Countries with partly state-owned tobacco companies, such as Japan which has a stake in Japan Tobacco Inc, should firewall their health policy-setting from their commercial interests, the United Nations agency said. A Reuters investigation published last week revealed that Philip Morris International Inc is waging a secret campaign to subvert the WHO's anti-smoking treaty. The 2005 pact calls for a ban on tobacco advertising and sponsorship, as well as taxes to discourage use.  What we have seen over time is that the industry tends to interfere in the policy-making process. So there are intimidating practices, they threaten, they use myths about the contribution to the economy, Dr. Vinayak Prasad, head of the WHO tobacco control program, told a news briefing. The industry's interests are in irreconcilable conflict with the interests of public health policy, said the WHO Report on the Global Tobacco Epidemic 2017.  Japan Tobacco is a former state monopoly still a third owned by the government. I think in this special situation there might be a conflict of interest in economic revenues from a partly state-owned industry and health of the population, said Dr. Kerstin Schotte, a WHO medical officer. Japan has described cancer as a growing problem at home, Prasad said, adding: But the disconnect is that even though the evidence exists on the linkage between cancer and tobacco use, it's not translating into stronger policy action. So obviously it requires more political will at the highest level. Japan Tobacco International spokesman Jonathan Duce said the company does not oppose tobacco regulation that works and meets legitimate public health objectives while a Philip Morris spokeswoman, Tiffany Steckler, said the company regularly engages with governments around the world on issues including taxation, international trade and product regulation. They know that input from a wide range of stakeholders is needed to assess policy proposals, and no amount of industry conversation stops a policy-maker from acting independently, Steckler said. Tobacco companies use domestic and international trade litigation in attempts to block progress on many control measures, such as smoke-free public places, pictorial health warnings, plain packaging and product regulation, the WHO said. A landmark Australian law on restrictive tobacco packaging was upheld at the World Trade Organization (WTO) in May after a five-year legal battle, seen as giving a green light for other countries to roll out similar laws. We have a number of developing countries which have now picked up warning labels, Prasad said. Nepal has the world's largest health warnings on tobacco packaging surfaces, WHO says. Tobacco, whose nature is addictive and harmful, kills more than 7 million people every year, roughly one in 10 deaths, according to the WHO. Victims include 890,000 people who die annually from second-hand smoke exposure. It's a slow-moving disaster, Prasad said.

Since 2000, the American Academy of Pediatrics has recommended that ATV use be restricted to youth aged 16 years and older who wear helmets, don’t take passengers and steer clear of roads. Despite these guidelines, the mortality rate from ATV crashes for kids under 18 doesn’t appear to have budged in recent years, researchers report in Pediatrics.  “Too many young children are driving these machines - equivalent to a motorcycle in many ways,” said senior study author Dr. William Hennrikus, medical director of the Pediatric Bone and Joint Clinic at Penn State College of Medicine in Hershey, Pennsylvania.  “Children should not drive an ATV until they’re over 16, just like driving a motorcycle,” Hennrikus said by email. “Helmets should always be worn, just like a motorcycle.” For the study, researchers examined data on 1,912 patients under age 18 who were injured while using an ATV and treated at trauma centers in Pennsylvania from 2004 to 2014.  During this period, 28 children died in ATV crashes, a mortality rate of roughly one per every 100,000 kids in the population, researchers calculated.  The injury rate dropped slightly during the study period, from 6.7 kids per 100,000 children in the population over the first five years to 5.8 kids per 100,000 over the second half of the decade. But the decline wasn’t large enough to rule out the possibility that it was due to chance.  Overall, less than half of the kids were wearing helmets and a street or roadway was the crash location in 15 percent of cases.  Being a passenger or being pulled by the ATV was a factor in almost one in four injuries, the study also found.  Half of the kids involved in ATV crashes were 14 or younger, and about 6 percent were no more than 5 years old.  Boys accounted for three in every four patients.  The majority of patients, 55 percent, sustained at least one bone fracture at or below the cervical spine, which is the upper part of the spinal column near the neck. Most often, fractures occurred in major bones in the thigh and shin.  Limitations of the study include the possibility that researchers underestimated injuries and deaths because they only looked at trauma center patients, not children who were treated elsewhere or died before they ever reached a trauma center.  But the findings still underscore the urgency of keeping young children off ATVs and making sure teen drivers follow safety recommendations, said David Schwebel, a sports injury researcher at the University of Alabama at Birmingham who wasn’t involved in the study.  “Helmets absolutely have to be used for any ride, even short, apparently safe ones,” Schwebel said by email. “Passengers should never ride on ATVs unless the ATV is designed for more than one person.” Previous research suggests that ATVs cause slightly more injuries than scooters, snow skiing and combative sports like karate, softball and hockey, Schwebel added. However, the vehicles are responsible for slightly fewer injuries than swimming, lacrosse and gymnastics, and they cause far fewer injuries than football or soccer. Schwebel recommends “ATVs and Youth: Matching Children and Vehicles,” a tip sheet from Penn State for information about ATV safety (here: bit.ly/2qdV9hf). Age isn’t all parents should consider when deciding whether to let kids get behind the wheel of an ATV, Schwebel added. “Parents need to think not just about their child’s size, but also their ability to think, to react to emergency situations and to maintain safe, cautious control of a very powerful vehicle,” Schwebel said.

Vertex's shares climbed 26 percent to $165.97, adding nearly $8 billion to its market valuation. They had earlier touched a life high of $167.00. Analysts said the data exceeded expectations, raised the bar for competitors and positioned the treatments to help up to 90 percent of patients with the life-shortening lung disease.  Vertex already sells two therapies that can treat up to 40 percent of CF patients. Kalydeco and Orkambi brought in sales of $481 million in the first quarter. Not only does this data set up well to reach a large majority of the CF patient population, it greatly increases the competitive hurdle while also enhancing the scarcity value of the company, J.P. Morgan analyst Cory Kasimov said in a note.      The data on Tuesday showed three different triple combinations of CF treatments significantly improving patient lung function in clinical trials. CF is a rare, life-shortening genetic disease affecting about 75,000 people in North America, Europe and Australia that causes progressive lung damage and loss of lung function.  The triple combo results came in an order of magnitude better than we, or really anyone, expected, Baird analyst Brian Skorney noted.  At least three brokerages raised their ratings on Vertex's stock: Barclays to overweight, Janney to buy and Raymond James to outperform. Analysts are bullish on the stock with 21 out of 25 covering Vertex rating it buy or higher and the rest hold.  Eight brokerages increased their price target on Vertex. The drugmaker's median price target is $180, up from $129.50 in June. Shares of Galapagos NV, which is developing a rival CF treatment with AbbVie Inc, slipped about 4.5 percent. Galapagos/AbbVie's planned path to the triple combo is not impossible, but faces a much higher hurdle as compared with Vertex's triple combo strategy, William Blair analyst Katherine Xu said in a note.  Including Wednesday's gain, Vertex shares have more than doubled this year. Reporting by Tamara Mathias in Bengaluru; Editing by Martina D'Couto"

If you zoom in on these two disorders, which are the most serious disorders, it actually cost more money than it saved, chief author Bastian Ravesteijn, a research fellow in the Department of Health Care Policy at Harvard Medical School in Boston, told Reuters Health in a telephone interview. The increase in patient cost-sharing led to fewer people seeking regular mental treatment and a simultaneous rise in acute care and involuntary commitments, according to the analysis in JAMA Psychiatry, July 19. The added copayment program, which only survived for a year because it was unpopular, increased each patient's share of adult mental health services by $226 per year for outpatient care and $169 per month for inpatient care.  The result: a 13.4 percent decline in the number of new mental health care records opened, particularly in low-income neighborhoods. Meanwhile, the rate of involuntary commitment nearly doubled, increasing by 97 percent, and cases of people seeking acute mental health care rose by 25 percent.  The findings are troubling, Dr. Benjamin Druss of Emory University in Atlanta writes in a commentary accompanying the study. The Dutch experience suggests that copayments can reduce access to mental health care and increase costs, particularly among vulnerable and high-need populations. Without careful planning and oversight, mental health care cost-sharing programs may exact a steep price. The work highlights the complexity of trying to save money by requiring patients to pay more for their health care. The debate is whether higher copays or deductibles will prompt patients to avoid short-term treatments that prevent more-expensive care further down the road. The Dutch case provided a natural experiment, with the extra costs applied only to adults and not children. The analysis included 1.4 million treatment records in the Netherlands. Children under 15 were excluded. Prior to 2012, patients only had to pay $192 per year for all types of specialist care. That amount was raised to $248 at the same time the additional mental health copays were implemented. While the demand for mental health services had been growing by 5.6 percent per year from 2004 to 2010, the demand dropped by 14.8 percent when the new payments were required. The rate of regular treatment among youths did not change. Requests for treatment among people diagnosed with psychotic disorder dropped by 10.6 percent. For depressive disorder, the decline was 13.8 percent. With anxiety disorder, it was 13.1 percent. Because of the copayment changes, the researchers estimate, regular care costs dropped by $79.4 million but the costs of acute care and commitment rose by $64.3 million for a net savings of $15.1 million. But costs for psychotic disorder and bipolar disorder - required because too many people stopped receiving regular care - skyrocketed, with acute and commitment costs increasing by $44.0 million on a savings of just $15.3 million. In short, with a system that discouraged regular treatment for these diagnoses, the system had to pay out an extra $28.7 million. The lesson here: Make sure that the people with serious mental illness are at least covered, Ravesteijn writes. The savings were biggest for people with depressive disorder ($17.3 million) and anxiety disorder ($11.1 million). In the poorest 10 percent of the population, the number of cases treated in 2012 declined by 16.3 percent. In the richest 10 percent, the decline was 11.3 percent. "

Although an unadjusted analysis found that blacks treated in the Veterans Affairs health system had a higher one-year mortality rate - along with higher rates of blood transfusion within 30 days or heart attack within a year of the procedure - those disparities dissolved once things like coexisting illnesses, characteristics of the procedure and severity of the blockage were factored in. The exception: The odds of acute kidney injury were 22 percent higher among blacks at the 30-day mark, even with the adjustments. Previous research has shown that race can have a major influence on the likelihood of being referred for artery imaging or for the artery-clearing procedure - known as percutaneous coronary intervention, or PCI. Black Medicare recipients also tend to have higher mortality rates after PCI, even after socioeconomic factors have been taken into account. This study represents the largest modern analysis to date of the influence of race on cardiovascular outcomes among U.S. veterans, the team, led by Dr. Taisei Kobayashi of the Cpl. Michael Crescenz Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Philadelphia, writes in JAMA Cardiology. All but one of the 17 authors list an affiliation with the VA health system. More than 42,000 patients treated at 63 VA hospitals were included in the analysis and the patients received their PCI anytime between October 2007 and September 2013. Patients who identified themselves as something other than black or white were not included in the calculations. Blacks made up 13.3 percent of the group and nearly all of the study subjects were men. Without adjustments for confounders, the one-year mortality rates were 7.1 percent for blacks and 5.9 percent for whites. Heart attack rates at one year were 3.3 percent for blacks and 2.7 percent for whites, and 30-day blood transfusion rates were 3.4 percent for blacks versus 2.7 percent for whites.  After adjustment, these differences were reduced to the point where they were no longer statistically significant, meaning they could have been due to chance. The most common complication studied was the 30-day rate for acute kidney injury. Unadjusted, it happened in 20.8 percent of blacks and 13.8 percent of whites. Although the rate of chronic kidney disease was much higher among black patients to begin with at 28.9 percent versus 17.4 percent among whites, the disparity in kidney injury rates persisted after adjustment for kidney disease and other factors. A patient was judged to have an acute kidney injury if at least one creatinine level in the first 30 days was at least 0.3mg/dL above baseline. Thirty-day all-cause readmission rates were comparable between the groups at 13.6 percent for blacks and 12.9 percent for whites. Black patients had a higher burden of several medical comorbidities, including heart failure, chronic kidney disease, hemodialysis, diabetes, peripheral artery disease, posttraumatic stress disorder and tobacco use, the Kobayashi team writes.  Black patients, for example, were more likely to be initially seen in the cardiac catheterization laboratory with acute coronary syndrome (chest pain) and were more likely to be undergoing PCI under emergency conditions, they note. The researchers did uncover some differences in care that were statistically significant even after adjustment. Blacks were 23 percent more likely to receive bare metal stents and 12 percent less likely to receive a blood pressure drug known as a beta-blocker following their procedures. The researchers characterized those treatment patterns as modestly different and, based on current research, not a major factor in outcomes. Past studies on veterans have found beta-blockers to be less effective at lowering blood pressure in black patients, the authors point out, and results of those studies might be influencing prescribing patterns after PCI. “Most important,” they add, while beta-blockade is important for patients having a heart attack, it doesn’t clearly improve survival in patients with stable coronary artery disease."

Shares of the restaurant chain tumbled more than 4 percent on Tuesday after Chipotle reported the closure. The former high-flying chain is still fighting to repair its reputation and resuscitate its sales after a string of high-profile food safety lapses in late 2015. Chipotle voluntarily closed the restaurant in Sterling, Virginia, on Monday, according to a health official for the Loudoun County Public Health Department, which has jurisdiction over the restaurant, about 30 miles (48 km) northwest of Washington. About 13 people became sick last week, according to a website that follows incidents of foodborne illness. Test results are still pending.  Chipotle stock, which traded well above $700 prior to 2015 reports linking the chain to outbreaks of E. coli, salmonella and norovirus, was off 1.4 percent at $369.56 on Wednesday.  It is unfortunate that anyone became ill after visiting our restaurant, and when we learned of this issue, we took aggressive action to correct the problem and protect our customers, Chipotle Chief Executive Officer Steve Ells said in a statement. While the restaurant was closed, multiple teams performed complete sanitization of all surfaces, Ells said. Norovirus, is the leading cause of illness and outbreaks from contaminated food in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It can spread from person to person, as well as through food prepared by an infected person. It often hits closed environments such as daycare centers, schools and cruise ships. Most outbreaks happen from November to April in the United States. Reporting by Lisa Baertlein in Boston; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe"
