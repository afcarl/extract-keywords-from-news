The Paris-based carmaker struck a framework deal with Iranian counterpart SAIPA to invest 300 million euros ($330 million) in the development and production of three Citroen models through a new joint venture. PSA, which pulled out in 2011 under U.S. pressure, now faces stiffer competition from Chinese rivals that have grabbed more business in the intervening years - as well as western peers such as Renault flocking back with newer models. This agreement opens up a new chapter in our history of cooperation with SAIPA, PSA Chief Executive Carlos Tavares said. Our aim is to provide our Iranian customers with modern vehicles that meet the highest comfort, safety and technology standards. Iranian car registrations approached 1.6 million cars at their 2011 peak, with PSA claiming almost 30 percent of the market, before collapsing under the weight of sanctions.     The deal with SAIPA, Citroen's partner since 1966, follows a joint venture deal inked last month between stablemate Peugeot and state-owned Iran Khodro. PSA's smaller DS premium badge has also clinched a distribution agreement in the country.

Muromachi stepped down after a $1.3 billion accounting scandal last year highlighted weaknesses in a number of Toshiba's varied operations, which include laptops, television sets, flash memory chips and nuclear reactors. The scandal prompted Toshiba to slash costs throughout its business and sell off its medical devices division.

The marketing messages of Tesla and SolarCity tell a different tale. Musk said he would be shocked if his customers did not all at least have an interest in solar, but he did not know how many Tesla owners also have solar panels. He lobbed a guess that it might be a quarter. His strategy to join Tesla Motors Inc and home solar leader SolarCity Corp may founder on that guess, as the two companies take different approaches to essentially separate groups of customers. SolarCity's value proposition is about saving money. It's not a premium thing like a Tesla is, said Shayle Kann, senior vice president at solar industry research firm GTM Research. I don't think most solar customers would buy a Tesla yet. Tesla and SolarCity became leaders in their respective markets with very different sales strategies. Tesla sells luxury cars to the wealthy, and SolarCity offers middle-income homeowners a way to save 15 percent on their energy bills. The electric vehicle company said its home battery offering is a good sign for solar. Spokeswoman Khobi Brooklyn said the company has received interest in its Powerwall batteries from tens of thousands of customers since they were introduced last year. We see that customers who are interested in driving Tesla vehicles or using Powerwalls are naturally interested in going solar, and vice versa, she said in a statement. But the overlap is not a tremendous amount, said Pavel Molchanov, who follows the energy business for Raymond James: Somebody shopping for a car is not necessarily in the market for a solar system. He pointed out, however, that companies like General Electric Co have been successful selling a range of very different products, and he argued the deal could lower SolarCity's financing costs - a critical piece of its capital-intensive business. And while analysts bemoaned the lack of specifics on the financial savings the deal might bring to both companies, many agreed that SolarCity would likely reap some benefits from rebranding under the Tesla name. There is nothing in the solar industry with brand awareness even approaching Tesla's, Barclays analysts said in a client note on Wednesday. And Tesla is working to expand the target audience of its brand by launching a $35,000 vehicle next year. Nearly 400,000 people have paid $1,000 to reserve the lower-priced Model 3 sedan. In Musk's vision of the world, customers will use their solar panels to power their homes and charge a home battery system when the sun is shining and then use that stored power to charge their electric vehicles overnight. Marketing solar systems through Tesla's network of retail stores and to its more than 100,000 vehicle owners is certainly a sales opportunity for SolarCity, but it is unlikely to make a meaningful dent in the company's longstanding struggle to reduce what it spends on winning new customers, Kann said. UBS analysts noted that reducing those costs would bode well for SolarCity, but pointed out that the solar company's marketing promised money savings rather than luxury. Musk's lack of awareness of how many Tesla customers have solar, they added, also raised questions about whether the deal's primary goal was in finding value in overlapping customers, or whether the financial benefits would be realized elsewhere, such as in general and administrative costs.

We see that customers who are interested in driving Tesla vehicles or using Powerwalls are naturally interested in going solar, and vice versa, she said in a statement. But the overlap is not a tremendous amount, said Pavel Molchanov, who follows the energy business for Raymond James: Somebody shopping for a car is not necessarily in the market for a solar system.  He pointed out, however, that companies like General Electric Co (GE.N) have been successful selling a range of very different products, and he argued the deal could lower SolarCity's financing costs - a critical piece of its capital-intensive business. And while analysts bemoaned the lack of specifics on the financial savings the deal might bring to both companies, many agreed that SolarCity would likely reap some benefits from rebranding under the Tesla name. There is nothing in the solar industry with brand awareness even approaching Tesla's, Barclays analysts said in a client note on Wednesday. And Tesla is working to expand the target audience of its brand by launching a $35,000 vehicle next year. Nearly 400,000 people have paid $1,000 to reserve the lower-priced Model 3 sedan. In Musk's vision of the world, customers will use their solar panels to power their homes and charge a home battery system when the sun is shining and then use that stored power to charge their electric vehicles overnight. Marketing solar systems through Tesla's network of retail stores and to its more than 100,000 vehicle owners is certainly a sales opportunity for SolarCity, but it is unlikely to make a meaningful dent in the company's longstanding struggle to reduce what it spends on winning new customers, Kann said. UBS analysts noted that reducing those costs would bode well for SolarCity, but pointed out that the solar company's marketing promised money savings rather than luxury.  Musk's lack of awareness of how many Tesla customers have solar, they added, also raised questions about whether the deal's primary goal was in finding value in overlapping customers, or whether the financial benefits would be realized elsewhere, such as in general and administrative costs.

It felt incredible, added the Briton, who finished runner-up last season behind now-retired team mate Nico Rosberg despite winning more of the 21 races. Yesterday was the first time seeing the car come together. It’s the most detailed piece of machinery I’ve seen so far in Formula One. The car feels wider, which it is obviously. The front tyres obviously feel huge, added the 32-year-old, who won 10 races in 2016 and starts the season with a new team mate in Finland's Valtteri Bottas. Formula One has undergone big rule changes over the winter, with wider front and rear tyres and different aerodynamics designed to make cars faster, more aggressive and harder to handle. Related CoverageHamilton says he is better prepared than everLap times should be several seconds quicker than 2016 with cornering speeds putting more G-forces on the drivers, who have had to bulk up and add muscle.        Bottas, who has joined from Williams following Rosberg's  decision to retire only days after taking the title, has yet to win a grand prix. Britain Formula One - F1 - 2017 Mercedes Formula One Car Launch - Silverstone - 23/2/17 General view of the new car during the launch Reuters / Eddie Keogh LivepicHe has already said that he is not intending to play second fiddle to his team mate, however, and the pairing start on equal terms. I think I have done the most amount of training of any winter so far. I have done some good training camps and feel in the best shape I've ever been, definitely ready for the season ahead, said the Finn. The new car was first presented to fans online, with the drivers pulling the covers off the W08 behind closed garage doors before it was wheeled out to the media shivering on the Silverstone straight. Slideshow (10 Images)The team were then set to complete a limited 100km filming day in the afternoon with both drivers taking a turn. The dominant feeling in the team right now is one of excitement - the factory is buzzing with anticipation, said team boss Toto Wolff, whose team have won the last three driver's and constructor's titles. It has been a really motivating challenge to develop a brand new car concept and I have never seen our determination to succeed higher than it is right now. Testing will start in Barcelona on Monday, with Bottas doing the first stint before handing over to Hamilton for the afternoon. The season starts in Australia on March 26.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/india-women-homeworkers-idUSL8N19F1V2","Indian women braid straps for big brands in conditions 'worse than sweatshops'","","August 4, 2016 /  1:31 PM / in a year","","MUMBAI (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Every day, after she finishes cooking, cleaning and fetching water for her tiny one-room home in India's financial capital Mumbai, Saubhagya Nadelkari picks up a stack of leather strips and makes her way to her neighbor's home. There, in a narrow alley that is covered with plastic, about half a dozen women sit or stand as they braid long strips for use in belts, sandals and bags. They talk and laugh as their fingers fly, knotting each strip at the end when it is done. I have been doing this for about 10 years. We used to get more work, now we get less, and get paid less, said Nadelkari, who makes about 100 pieces a day. She is paid about 24 rupees ($0.40) for a set of 12 finished pieces. We only get paid once in six months, and they don't keep proper accounts. But my husband doesn't let me go out and work, and we need the money, so I can't say 'no' to the work. Nadelkari and her friends are among nearly 38 million home-based workers in India, according to a 2012 survey by WIEGO, a global non-profit focused on informal workers. Restricted to their homes because of limited mobility and lack of childcare, they are engaged in providing low-paid manufacturing or services for local and global supply chains. The women stitch garments, embroider and attach sequins, make shoe uppers, handicrafts, as well as roll incense sticks and prepare food items such as pickles. Unlike self-employed home-based workers who sell their output directly, sub-contracted homeworkers are dependent on a middleman who drops off and picks up orders and keeps a part of the payment as commission.  They are affected by fluctuating demand, canceled orders, delayed payments and rejected goods. These are the most invisible of informal workers, said Indira Gartenberg, who has researched home based-workers with non-profit LEARN in Mumbai. Their situation is worse than a sweatshop, because at least in the sweatshop they don't have to pay for electricity and water and rent and they get paid regularly, she said. Economic Compulsion In India, the world's fastest growing major economy, more than 90 percent of workers - or about 400 million people - are in the informal economy, according to the Center for Equity Studies. Women and children in the informal economy are particularly vulnerable to exploitation.  The garment industry is particularly prone to abuse. Of the 38 million home-based workers in India, about 45 percent are involved in making garments or textiles, and half these workers are sub-contracted homeworkers, according to WIEGO. The piece-rate work that is common in the industry is low paid and seasonal. While the women do the bulk of the work, children pitch in during busy periods, even skipping school to work. Contract work for textiles has been growing exponentially because of the growing popularity of readymade garments and fast fashion, even in India, said Shalini Sinha, WIEGO's sector specialist for home-based workers. Many leading global brands are outsourcing to homeworkers, even if they are unaware of it. Homeworkers are the most vulnerable in the chain, yet they bear a lot of risks because the economic compulsion is so strong, she said. The supply chains of global fashion retailers have come under greater scrutiny since the Rana Plaza disaster in Bangladesh three years ago. Despite pressure from activists, India has not endorsed the International Labor Organization's convention 177, which requires member nations to adopt a national policy to improve the lives of homeworkers. That includes counting them as laborers, and providing social security protection and adequate remuneration. Activists including WIEGO are also campaigning for secure contracts, social protection, better remuneration and unions. For Nadelkari in Dharavi, a sprawling slum that is home to thousands of homeworkers, all of these would be welcome. Until then, at least I get to do the work with my friends. We talk, we laugh. We forget how hard it is, she said.

The Florence-based group has been going through a phase of transition since being bought in 2015 by Italian private equity Clessidra and is now undergoing a radical overhaul aimed at relaunching the brand, popular with celebrities.

Luxury sedans and small sport utility vehicles jostled for the spotlight along with electric cars and diesel-powered pickup trucks. When it came to industry profits, the trucks and SUVs were at center-stage. Here are some of the notable vehicle debuts at the Detroit show, which opens to the public on Saturday, January 14. * Nissan Rogue Sport. A 5-passenger SUV that will be slightly smaller than the Nissan (7201.T) Rogue, which has become the top-selling model in the company's U.S. lineup. Rogue was the top-selling non-pickup truck in the U.S. in December. It will go on sale in the spring. This is part of Nissan's response to U.S. consumers' growing preference for SUVs of all sizes. * Kia Motors Co (000270.KS) Stinger. The Stinger is a new 5-passenger fastback sport sedan. Kia said it would produce the Stinger after showing a concept version of it earlier. The car was designed in Frankfurt. It will go on sale in the U.S. market in late 2017. * Lexus LS. Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T) debuted the first Lexus LS 400 sedan in Detroit at the 1989 auto show. On Monday, the brand unveiled the fifth generation of its big sedan to a market that is turning away from the traditional concept that a luxury brand's flagship model must be a sedan, instead of a sport utility vehicle. The brand also is showing a compact crossover concept called UX. * BMW 5-series. BMW AG (BMWG.DE) has already taken the wraps off the look of the new 5-series, which competes with the Mercedes E-class and Audi A6. The German luxury automaker displayed a plug-in hybrid version of the car for the first time in Detroit. Like its competitors, the 5-series is losing ground to SUVs - and the Tesla Model S electric sedan - among affluent U.S. buyers. BMW also is showing a compact X2 crossover concept. * Honda Odyssey. Just in time for millennials starting to have the baby boom generation's grandchildren, Honda Motor Co (7267.T) debuted a new generation of its Odyssey minivan. The minivan segment has shrunk since the former Chrysler Corp pioneered the concept of a boxy family hauler in the 1980s, but sales in the segment rose 8 percent last year. * Ford F-150. Ford Motor Co (F.N) will give the 2018 model of the best-selling vehicle in the United States some modest appearance changes, and more significantly, new technology to reduce fuel consumption. For the first time, Ford will offer a diesel engine option in the F-150. The company is not releasing fuel economy estimates for that engine. A new 3.3-liter six-cylinder engine will also be offered and fuel-saving technology that shuts down the engine at a stop light will be available. * Chevrolet Traverse. General Motors Co (GM.N) highlighted two redesigned sport utility vehicles in Detroit, including a new generation of the Chevrolet Traverse, a family hauling SUV that will compete with the likes of the Ford Explorer, Honda Pilot, Toyota Highlander and Jeep Grand Cherokee.   * Toyota Camry. The best-selling passenger car in the United States for the past 15 years got a major makeover. Camry sales fell 9.5 percent in 2016 from the year before, reflecting pressure from the shift to SUVs. Overall, mid-sized sedan sales in the United States fell 10 percent. Toyota (7203.T) has been giving its mainstream models more expressive styling and advanced technology, to counter a long-held image for dull reliability. The 2018 Camry is expected to reflect that direction. * Mercedes-Benz E Class Coupe. Daimler AG's (DAIGn.DE) mainstream brand has redesigned its mid-size E Class Coupe. It also showed a facelifted version of the GLA compact crossover, as well as a redesigned Smart Electric Drive. * Audi Q8. Audi, the high-volume luxury brand of Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) showed a concept of a new, large sport utility vehicle in Detroit. It is also unveiling a facelifted version of its SQ5 mid-size SUV and redesigned A5 cabriolet. * Volkswagen Tiguan. The mid-size Tiguan crossover utility vehicle has been redesigned. VW is also displaying yet another revival of its classic Microbus, this time as a battery-powered electric concept called I.D. Buzz. * Infiniti QX50. Nissan's luxury brand is showing a concept version of its redesigned QX50 mid-size SUV. * GMC Terrain. The brand's compact SUV gets its first major redesign, sharing major components with the redesigned Chevrolet Equinox.

Dick's shares jumped as much as 6 percent after Reuters first reported the development earlier, which ensures Dick's will no longer be competing against the Sports Authority brand. Dick's shares closed up 4.1 percent at $45.06. Dick's and Sports Authority still have to finalize paper work on the deal, and a U.S. bankruptcy court judge has to approve it, the company said in a regulatory filing. The bankruptcy court's hearing to consider approval of the deal is  scheduled for July 15. The intellectual property of Sports Authority includes its e-commerce website, SportsAuthority.com, a loyalty program with 28.5 million members, and a list consisting of 114 million customer files, according to an advertisement for the intellectual property auction.  Sports Direct International Plc (SPD.L) submitted a bid of $13 million for the intellectual property, a source said. The British firm would be a back-up bidder if Dick's is unable to close the deal, though that is not expected, the source added.  Dick's said it also plans to take over the leases for 31 Sports Authority stores for an additional $8 million. A Sports Authority store is shown in Encinitas, California, U.S. March 2, 2016.Mike Blake/File PhotoOther big box retailers scooped up Sports Authority leases.

The naming rights to a football stadium in Denver, Colorado, home of the National Football League's Denver Broncos, are still up for grabs. Sports Authority, with 464 stores across the United States, had been a formidable competitor to Dick's. But the retailer struggled with a heavy debt load and competition from online giant Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), as well as retailer Wal Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N). Dick's could create an off-price chain under the Sports Authority brand, said Matt Powell, a sports industry analyst at the NPD Group. Discount is a growing sector in retail, he said.

Mats Wilander, a winner of seven grand slam crowns, says the heavy balls and slow conditions at Roland Garros favor up-and-coming tyros over the established guard. To get anywhere here right now, you have to put 10, 20 percent on your shots, the Swede told Reuters on Thursday, as a cold wind whipped the grounds. That is what these underdogs do all the time. The big names, they win matches playing within themselves, and that is fine when you are on a warm, dry hard court in California. But here? Forget it. To get anything you need to take risks and hit big. That's what the underdogs always do, and that's when anything can happen. Top players can adjust, but the advantage is certainly with the underdog. This year's tournament lost a full day's play at the start of the second week, and numerous hours in total lost to drizzle and early finishes. Toughest Slam of All Swiss champion Stan Wawrinka and Britain's Andy Murray are set to contest the bottom semi-final on Friday, so there will be no breakthrough name there. But Dominic Thiem and David Goffin clash in a top-half quarter-final for a chance to face either top seed Novak Djokovic or Tomas Berdych. Of the six remaining possibles, three could be first-time slam winners. To do so, though, they will have to master the toughest grand slam tournament of all, according to John McEnroe. It always used to be Wimbledon was the toughest slam, said the American, who is in Paris with Wilander commentating for Eurosport.  We were always on-off, on-off, on-off, the American added, referring to the rain delays which were a feature of Wimbledon life before the installation of a roof at the All England Club center court. The Australian Open has three roofs at Melbourne Park -- mainly to counter the searing January temperatures -- and Wimbledon added one in 2009. A steel retractable roof will be fully functional before the first 2016 U.S. Open match begins in August in New York, leaving Roland Garros as the only uncovered slam. I'd always thought Wimbledon was the toughest to win, said McEnroe, three times a champion on London's lawns, but never better than a finalist in France. You were on the court, off the court... They've eliminated that now with the roof. But now you are here, and you just have to deal with it. Although it is not only the uncertainty that makes Roland Garros such a tough proposition. You really have to have a total game... be able to do everything, said Wilander. That is what makes this one so hard. It really can be like two different tournaments. Fast and dry and like a hard court... or like this. You need to be the complete player, added the Swede, pulling his collar together as the wind blew through the stadium. Editing by Julien Pretot"

The new service, Tmall World, will allow overseas Chinese users to buy goods from Alibaba's Tmall brand-to-consumer retail site, the company said in a statement.  Alibaba will provide end-to-end solutions including logistics, payment, and localization support catering to each local market's needs, the statement said. The firm plans on extending the Tmall World network to other countries in the future.     Alibaba has invested heavily in Southeast Asia, seeking to meet lofty user acquisition goals as the Chinese retail market shows signs of maturing.      Alibaba chairman Jack Ma told investors on Friday the company is aiming to have 2 billion customers within 15 years, with overseas customers accounting for 1.2 billion of those users.  Alibaba had roughly 450 million active annual buyers on its China marketplaces in the year ended March 31.      In 2016 it agreed to invest $1 billion in Southeast Asian retailer Lazada Group, and launching a service that allows local users to purchase a selection of Tmall goods.     The latest sales channels take aim at the 100 million Chinese citizens living overseas, and users must have an active Chinese payment method to purchase goods.      It comes as Alibaba payment affiliate Ant Financial is also expanding heavily in the region through investments and joint ventures.      In the past year the finance firm has sealed deals in Thailand, Indonesia, South Korea, Hong Kong and India, as well as rebranding Lazada Group's payment arm Hello Pay under Ant Financial's own Alipay brand.     It also comes as rival Chinese e-commerce firm JD.com Inc (JD.O) is expanding operations in Southeast Asia.  On Friday JD.com Chief Executive Richard Liu told Reuters that the firm plans to launch services in Thailand by the end of the year, building on existing activities in Indonesia.

VW Group of America Chief Executive Officer Hinrich Woebcken told reporters at the New York auto show that the automaker planned to build a five-seat SUV in Tennessee, but he declined to say when production would begin. The news follows VW's 2014 announcement that the company would spent $900 million to build a new SUV in Tennessee. VW, the largest automaker worldwide by sales, will start selling its new seven-seat VW Atlas SUV next month. Woebcken said VW was shifting focus in the United States from a mainly car brand to a family friendly automaker offering larger, U.S.-built SUVs. At the show, major automakers said they expected the popularity of SUVs to increase in the United States. SUVs' share of U.S. vehicle sales rose to nearly 40 percent in 2016 from 32.6 percent in 2014.  Woebcken would not say whether VW would add additional workers in Tennessee to build the new SUV. VW will sell four separate SUVs in the United States later this year, a figure that does not include the new one. The company said on Tuesday that it would continue selling the current Tiguan as the Tiguan Limited for several years even as it plans to offer a completely new, larger version later this year. The company also announced it was offering an industry-leading six-year, 72,000 mile warranty on its new SUVs. As part of its diesel emissions settlement, Volkswagen has  agreed to add at least three additional electric vehicles, including an SUV, in California by 2020 and must sell an average of 5,000 electric vehicles annually there through 2025. Woebcken said he hopes that decision will help boost the company's image in the United States.

The new unit, with the project name of Boost, is due to launch this autumn and is Air France's response to pressure from Gulf carriers. It will operate 10 long-haul and 18 short-haul aircraft at lower costs than its main brand. I think people have underestimated the ability of the big carriers and alliances to respond to the Gulf carriers, to budget carriers, to low-cost long-haul, Jean-Marc Janaillac, chief executive of Franco-Dutch Air France-KLM, said in an interview. He said he believed that pure low-cost rivals in Europe, which typically target leisure customers, would have trouble getting enough demand in the winter months, whereas Boost would attract business customers, who typically fly year-round, thanks to lie-flat seats, air miles and the Air France network. Studies show that Air France has more difficulty than others in attracting younger customers, because it's seen as too stiff, Janaillac said. The project and other measures to reduce costs at the carrier are subject to approval from powerful pilot unions.  The SNPL union is due to meet on Thursday. Air France has not said what would happen should the union reject the plan.  I prefer to give dialogue every possible chance and I don't want to specify what will happen after that, Janaillac said. Air France-KLM plans to add capacity to Italy in the event that Italian flag carrier Alitalia collapses, but is not interested in acquiring the airline, Janaillac said. Alitalia is a partner in the North Atlantic joint venture led by Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL.N) and Air France-KLM and Janaillac said he hoped the administration would find a solution to keep the carrier going.

Credit Suisse, Societe Generale, BNP Paribas and Credit Agricole CIB have underwritten the loan which will replace Cortefiel’s €895m existing debt. The change of ownership and new loan will help Cortefiel to reduce its debt and remove the pressure of loans that were due to mature in 2018. The company's existing loans will be repaid at par in September after the deal between CVC, PAI and Permira closes, sources said. PAI and CVC declined to comment. As part of the new deal, CVC and PAI will reinvest €400m of equity – from CVC Fund III and PAI Europe VI respectively, one of the sources said. The private equity trio acquired Cortefiel in 2005 for €1.8bn. The company struggled amid a difficult retail environment in Spain but Cortefiel has appointed new management and trading has improved recently. Cortefiel has been through several financial restructurings since 2005 - most recently in March 2014 when the business amended and extended around €1.4bn of debt through a scheme of arrangement. Covenant headroom was also extended by 25%. That deal included a provision that Cortefiel would automatically fall into the hands of its creditors if the company did not hit targets and Ebitda fell below €70m, Thomson Reuters LPC reported. Cortefiel hired Goldman Sachs earlier this year to sell the business. A group of funds that bought Cortefiel’s debt in Europe’s secondary loan market also mandated restructuring advisers Hoilihan Lokey to represent their interests. Earlier this year it appeared that the funds could take control of the business if a strong enough bid for the company did not materialise, but an improvement in trading removed the need for a sale. Cortefiel’s net revenues between March and June of €345m increased up 9.8% from the same time last year and recurring EBITDA also jumped 230% in the same period to €52.1m, which allowed the private equity firms to come up with the new deal. Cortefiel’s loans were trading at 100.58% of face value on Europe’s secondary loan market on July 26, according to data from Thomson Reuters LPC, after the news that existing lenders will be repaid at face value, or par. The loans were trading at 65 per cent of face value on January 2 this year. We are delighted that CVC and PAI, our long-term partners, have reconfirmed their support for Cortefiel, demonstrating their commitment to the company and its employees, said Jaume Miquel, CEO of Cortefiel. We've seen very strong growth and solid performance across brands, and now look forward to continuing our successes, taking advantage of the stable capital structure and strong balance sheet which is being put in place as a result of the transaction,” he added. Cortefiel operates over 2,000 points of sale in 90 countries with three main brands: Cortefiel, which is aimed at men and women over 40; Springfield, which is targeted at 30-40 year old men and women and Women's Secret, Iberia's largest specialised lingerie chain.

The appointment is the second executive change at Adidas since activist shareholders bought stakes in the company in 2015 after its shares had tumbled following a series of profit warnings as it failed to keep pace with U.S. rival Nike (NKE.N). The stock's value has since almost tripled as the firm has hiked marketing spending, helping sales in the U.S. market. Hainer was replaced as chief executive in October by Kaspar Rorsted, the Danish former chief of consumer goods group Henkel (HNKG_p.DE), prompting speculation among investors that Stalker, 59, might be the next to go. Ohlmeyer, a 49-year-old German, joined the company in 1998, holding roles including head of finance for the core Adidas brand and finance chief for the firm's golf business, before taking over as ecommerce chief in 2011. Adidas supervisory board Chairman Igor Landau said in a statement that Ohlmeyer had played a key role in efforts to make Adidas more digital, increasing ecommerce sales to 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion). Rorsted is due to set out his strategy on Wednesday when Adidas posts results for 2016. He has already said that the U.S. market and digitalization will be top priorities as he seeks to build on a five-year plan launched in 2015 by Hainer.

The dominant feeling in the team right now is one of excitement - the factory is buzzing with anticipation, said team boss Toto Wolff, whose team have won the last three driver's and constructor's titles. It has been a really motivating challenge to develop a brand new car concept and I have never seen our determination to succeed higher than it is right now. Testing will start in Barcelona on Monday, with Bottas doing the first stint before handing over to Hamilton for the afternoon. The season starts in Australia on March 26.

The Galaxy Tab S3 and the Galaxy Book were presented at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, in past years the scene of major Samsung launches. This year, Samsung has postponed the presentation of the Galaxy S8, its next key device. Slideshow (8 Images)Instead, it took the wraps off the Galaxy Tab S3 and the Galaxy Book, which comes in a 10.6-inch and a 12-inch version. The Galaxy Book will run on Microsoft Windows 10. The Tab S3 will have speakers by Harman-owned AKG, Samsung's first use of the brand since agreeing to buy Harman for $8 billion last year. Samsung withdrew the Galaxy Note 7 last October after faulty batteries led some devices to catch fire, leading to a loss of consumer trust, wiping out $5.3 billion of operating profit, and allowing Apple's iPhone to overtake it in sales. Samsung's smartphone market share dropped to 17.7 percent in the fourth quarter, while Apple's rose to 17.8 percent, according to market research firm Strategy Analytics.  Samsung is expected to launch the S8 in April. In the meantime, dozens of device makers are launching new phones at Mobile World Congress, hoping to exploit the gap Samsung has left.

In a symbolic move, the man in charge of making Airbus jets has reluctantly agreed to leave his office by the vast factories in Toulouse and move to a new corporate headquarters in the same southern French city, people familiar with the matter said. At first sight, it might seem an obvious move following the restructuring in which the planemaking division became the mainstay of the overall structure of a company that also manufactures space rockets, helicopters and military jets. But close watchers of the predominantly Franco-German firm, still bruised by decades of infighting, fear the decision to put planemaking chief Fabrice Bregier in the new HQ alongside his boss Tom Enders could test a fragile internal power balance. For Bregier, it may only be a move of about a kilometer on the ground, but it shifts him ever so slightly away from the company's economic nerve center that drives its share price, revenue and profits. And it comes at a critical time for the world's second largest planemaker as it strives to boost output. (Bregier) isn't happy, but he is going to make it work, said one person close to the company, who asked not to be named. Airbus agreed last year to merge its jetliner division with its parent group to reflect the stronger bias toward civil manufacturing that started in 2013, after the failure of a planned merger with British defense firm BAE Systems (BAES.L). After the latest internal restructuring, Bregier gave up his title as chief executive of the Airbus commercial airliner business, but remained its president while also becoming chief operating officer and number two for the group as a whole. Airbus is now an aircraft manufacturing company with two other divisions, so after the merger the focus on the core business is much tighter, an Airbus spokesman said. Enders, 58, is now drawing core people and functions around him at the new HQ to secure his vision of forging the integrated company he believes is necessary to remain on a par with arch-rival Boeing (BA.N) and fend off new competition. He has pledged to make Airbus a normal company after French and German political interference was curbed in 2014 by a change in its corporate governance following the failure of the BAE deal. Critical Task But plucking Bregier from a domain in which he is undisputed leader - having overseen record plane output and an improved industrial performance - and accentuating his other role as deputy to Enders is seen by some as a potential loss of focus. Fabrice Bregier (L), Airbus President and Chief Executive Officer and Tom Enders (R), Chief Executive Officer of Airbus Group, are seen at the Airbus headquarters in Toulouse, France April 11, 2015.Adrien Helou/File PhotoAirbus is confronted with the critical task of raising its jet output fast to fill thousands of orders on its books, and investors are especially sensitive to any risk its top managers become distracted by internal politics. What is unusual is to have restructuring happening at a time when production is increasing sharply, one European aerospace analyst said. At the same time, a raft of top managers in the planemaking business involved in operations, sales, programs and engineering are nearing retirement age. Publicly, Airbus managers have closed ranks behind the CEO's plans. Many recall the industrial chaos and tensions between French and German government shareholders - and their proxies within the company - that hammered Airbus shares a decade ago. Enders, who is German, and Bregier, a 55-year-old Frenchman, have occasionally appeared uneasy partners. Both are major industry figures in their own right and aspire to the top job. But they also demonstrated a pragmatic ability to work together in 2007-12 at what was then the jet division of EADS, later renamed Airbus Group, again with Enders in the lead role. The latest overhaul cements Bregier's position as heir apparent as he is now operational chief of the whole group but it also means he may have to wait longer for the top job. Both men have pledged to make jet production their top priority and company insiders say Bregier had initially suggested he would keep a physical presence in each camp to ensure this. But his office move is just the latest example of a steady shift of key oversight functions toward the center, consolidating the power of Enders and prompting reports of fresh tension in one of the industry's key personal relationships. The Airbus spokesman dismissed such concerns. They worked together well when both at Airbus and both their roles have significantly increased, so there is no overlap. The insistence on unity does not end there. Airbus has quietly axed separate brands for its divisions, including the ball-shaped Airbus logo used on its first flight in 1972. Brand experts say the design was worth less than the name, but the loss of a historic symbol underscores the jetmaker's reduced independence within the corporate structure. Witnesses say workers have put up a new AIRBUS sign -  with the ball removed - above the commercial offices. The helicopter and defense divisions are now expected to undergo similar surgery.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-rights-icj-idUSKBN1A42A3","Trump is new breed of 'authoritarian populist': rights watchdog","","July 19, 2017 /  7:27 PM / 8 days ago","","GENEVA (Reuters) - Donald Trump is one of a new breed of leaders around the world who seek to use their democratic mandate to undermine the rule of law, the head of a legal and human rights watchdog said on Wednesday. Branding the U.S. president an authoritarian populist, Saman Zia-Zarifi, secretary-general of the Geneva-based International Commission of Jurists (ICJ), compared him to the leaders of Turkey, the Philippines, Hungary and Venezuela. Zarifi cited as an example Trump's travel ban on nationals from six Muslim-majority countries, a policy that he called highly problematic under the U.S. constitution and international law. What is different now is that a certain kind of populism is being used to actually counter the notion of the rule of law, Zarifi said in an interview at the headquarters of the ICJ, which is composed of 60 eminent judges and lawyers from all regions who seek to protect human rights and the rule of law.  The new populism has a certain shamelessness about it that is new. It's not that people are denying that they are violating rights, what they are saying is they can violate rights because somehow they are empowered by the people, he said. Zarifi, who took over at the ICJ in April, said the new breed of populists included Turkey's President Tayyip Erdogan, Venezuela's Nicolas Maduro, the Philippines' Rodrigo Duterte, Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban and Jaroslaw Kaczynski, head of Poland's ruling party. I would say that in the U.S., Trump is an authoritarian populist. He has authoritarian tendencies but he still is facing checks and balances, Zarifi said. So he is not a full-blown authoritarian figure. The U.S. Supreme Court revised parts of Trump's executive order banning travellers from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen, a policy Trump says is aimed at tackling terrorism. Looking at it again from the point of view of U.S. law - I'm an American lawyer - it seems highly problematic, said the Iranian-born Zarifi, who moved to the United States as a teenager and holds a law degree from Cornell University. Supreme Court rulings would be, he said, a test for the health of the system of checks and balances in the U.S.  Turkish Judiciary Politically Compromised A crackdown by Erdogan's government has led to the arrest of 50,000 people and the suspension of 150,000 in the year since a failed military coup in Turkey where the judiciary is now politically compromised, Zarifi said. The Turkish government has said the action is justified by the gravity of the threat to the state from the coup attempt. On Monday, the state prosecutor asked a court to remand the local Amnesty International director and nine other activists in custody pending trial for membership of a terrorist organization.     Erdogan was quoted by Turkish media this month as saying they were detained on the basis of intelligence and that the judiciary would make its own decision. But Zarifi said the judiciary should have thrown the case out. The handling of the case highlights the very serious concerns - and alarm in fact at this point - that we have raised about the independence of the judiciary and the legal system in Turkey over the last few years.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/fashion-new-york-preview-idUSL1N1FM1CY","Diversity to rock the runway at New York Fashion Week","","February 8, 2017 /  12:05 AM / in 6 months","","NEW YORK (Reuters) - From faux furs and statement outerwear to floral prints and pants suits for warmer weather, a diversity of styles for all seasons will hit the runway at New York Fashion Week. Many designers at the semi-annual event, which  begins on Thursday, will preview 2017 fall/winter apparel that will land in stores months from now. But others will follow a trend that started last year and show in-season designs for spring/summer that consumers can snap up immediately. We're also seeing a lot of designers show spring as well with their 'see now/buy now' collection, said Katrina Mitzeliotis, fashion director at celebrity and style website HollywoodLife.com. There is more diversity than ever before in what's coming down the runway.  Designers Tommy Hilfiger, Tom Ford and a few others featured in-season looks at last September's Fashion Week, months ahead of when the fashion world was accustomed to seeing them. Look for plenty of mashups, or mixed fabrics that appear to be thrown together with studied casualness, to grace Fashion Week runways this season, said Roseanne Morrison, fashion director of The Doneger Group. She expects plenty of pant suits and outfits with a tailored look, too.   I am sure a lot of the fabrics will be lighter in weight because most of the designers are addressing seasonless, or 'see now/buy now' concept, because nobody is really buying for three months ahead, she said. While the idea has picked up steam, Catherine Bennett, senior vice president, managing director of IMG fashion events, cautioned that it is not a business model for everyone.     FILE PHOTO - Model Gigi Hadid and designer Tommy Hilfiger acknowledge attendees after presenting Hilfiger's Spring/Summer 2017 collection at New York Fashion Week in Manhattan, New York, U.S., September 9, 2016.Andrew Kelly/File PhotoIt's really a personal decision for each designer, she explained. It's a great solution for some brands but not for others.  But diversity may extend beyond the fashions at Fashion Week, which organizers said attracts about 100,000 people and generates $880 million in revenue for New York City. Slideshow (2 Images)Last season more than 25 percent of the models in shows in New York, London, Paris and Milan were women of color, according to a study by thefashionspot.com website.  New York led the way, with 30.3 percent, and that could rise this year. The city's Fashion Week also featured the most plus-size models in recent history, more women over 50 years old and a slight increase in transgender models, with 10 appearances. We're seeing diversity more and more in fashion, whether it is race or size, said Mitzeliotis. Fashion experts hope the trend will continue and make the shows more inclusive, broadening the appeal of the fashions. This year IMG, the organizer of Fashion Week, has moved the shows from midtown venues to the SoHo neighborhood of lower Manhattan. Although some designers will still present their collections at venues in other parts of Manhattan, the bulk of the shows are scheduled for three galleries at Skylight Clarkson Square and the presentation space Industria.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/gsk-ceo-idUSL5N1KC11Z","GlaxoSmithKline's new CEO prepares to trim drug pipeline","","July 21, 2017 /  12:50 PM / in 7 days","","LONDON (Reuters) - GlaxoSmithKline's (GSK.L) new chief executive, who has already made her mark with plans to divest some nutritional products, will turn next week to the main business of focusing the company's pipeline of new drugs. Despite her non-pharmaceutical background in consumer brands, Emma Walmsley sees improving drug research productivity as her top priority, and she wants Britain's biggest drugmaker to have fewer but potentially more lucrative new medicine launches in future. That means axing or licensing out some experimental drugs in non-core therapy areas, while boosting investment - as well as potential early-stage acquisitions - in the most promising fields, according to company insiders. Even after recent expansion of GSK's vaccines and consumer health units, pharmaceuticals still account for nearly 70 percent of group operating profits. Yet while GSK now has leading positions in vaccines and consumer health, it has a lackluster record in prescription medicines and has not come up with the kind of multibillion-dollar products launched by big pharma rivals in recent years. Walmsley will flesh out her plans for overhauling drug research when she presents second quarter results on July 26. She has already flagged her readiness to scrap products not generating sufficient value with plans to sell off malted drink Horlicks in Britain and MaxiNutrition, while considering the disposal of older antibiotics. Describing the approach after presenting her first set of results in April, she said: We will need to be switching off some areas. The goal is to sharpen what is currently one of the more diverse drug pipelines in the pharmaceuticals industry, spread across a wide range of therapy areas. In some fields, like respiratory and HIV medicine, GSK has a clear leading position. But it lags in others such as cardiovascular, rare diseases and diabetes, and some investors worry it has been spreading its R&D; budget too thinly. FILE PHOTO: The GlaxoSmithKline building is pictured in Hounslow, west London June 18, 2013.Luke MacGregor/File PhotoThe result can be sub-optimal product launches, such as Tanzeum for type 2 diabetes, which has generated disappointing sales after GSK launched the injection behind rival medicines from Novo Nordisk (NOVOb.CO) and AstraZeneca (AZN.L). Others, like a novel pill for heart disease, have flopped in tests even before getting to market, while its lupus drug Benlysta has failed to hit initial blockbuster sales forecasts, despite GSK spending $3 billion to buy the firm that invented it. Following Astrazeneca? In prioritizing areas where GSK has deep scientific and market expertise, Walmsley wants the R&D; and commercial departments at GSK to work together much more closely in future. In some ways, GSK looks set to follow in the footsteps of its smaller British rival AstraZeneca (AZN.L), which has divested a large number of non-core drug projects recently as it concentrates on core areas like cancer. Significantly, former AstraZeneca executive Luke Miels will be a key lieutenant for Walmsley during the shake-up. He will join GSK in September, several months later than planned due to a legal tussle with his former employer.  Analysts and investors have welcomed the idea of rationalizing GSK's R&D;, but caution it will be a long haul. It’s a company which has struggled to do what you would hope a pharmaceutical company would do, which is do the R&D; and successfully get the products through, said Insight Investment fund manager Tim Rees. Rees said an R&D; revamp made sense but it would take 5-7 years to yield results. Fortunately, Walmsley has a window to make the changes. GSK is not expecting its next wave of new drugs until after 2020 and also has no significant patent expiries, barring the imminent loss of protection on lung drug Advair, until 2026.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nestle-results-idUSKBN15V0K7","New Nestle CEO ditches elusive sales target","","February 16, 2017 /  6:53 AM / 5 months ago","","VEVEY, Switzerland (Reuters) - Nestle's (NESN.S) new chief executive scrapped the food company's long-standing sales target as it reported disappointing annual results on Thursday, echoing rivals by striking a cautious tone in an uncertain environment. Nestle is the biggest player in a packaged food industry hit by a slowdown in emerging markets, falling prices in developed markets and consumers demanding fresher, healthier products. The maker of Kitkat chocolate bars and Nescafe coffee is aiming to increase underlying sales by 2 to 4 percent this year, below its Nestle Model that called for growth of 5 to 6 percent. It posted weaker-than-expected 3.2 percent growth for 2016 and a drop in profits. CEO Mark Schneider, who joined Nestle only last month,  forecast a return to mid-single-digit growth by 2020, which analysts interpreted as the new boss backing away from a target the company has missed for four successive years. In a more turbulent environment, to narrow it specifically to 5 to 6 percent is probably not the right thing, but the underlying message is the same: there's nothing better than healthy organic growth, Schneider said at Nestle's Vevey headquarters.  Analysts estimated that underlying earnings assumptions could be reduced by around 3 percent. In his first public appearance at Nestle, Schneider, responsible for a string of deals at German healthcare company Fresenius (FREG.DE), also played down the chances of any big acquisitions. Valuations were too high and Nestle planned to keep its credit rating in the near term, he added.  He did, however, say Nestle's portfolio review was ongoing. Related CoverageNestle CEO says any change to L'Oreal stake would have to be done very carefullyIn recent years, the company has sold several underperforming brands and formed a joint venture for its ice cream business. Analysts and bankers often speculate about other businesses that could be sold, such as its confectionery or U.S.  frozen meals businesses.   Asked about Nestle's 23 percent stake in French cosmetics firm L'Oreal (OREP.PA), Schneider said any moves would have to be done very prudently.  Nestle's shares were down 1.9 percent at 71.75 Swiss francs at 1240 GMT. New Boss, Same Problems Nestle Nestle CEO Ulf Mark Schneider(L) and Chief Financial Officer Francois-Xavier Roger(r) before a news conference at the company headquarters in Vevey, Switzerland, February 16, 2017.Pierre AlbouySince his surprise appointment last year, analysts and investors have wondered how Schneider would reignite Nestle's growth and whether he would accelerate the recent push into higher-margin nutrition, health and wellness products. Schneider said he was fully committed to the health drive and would stick to the two-fold strategy of making Nestle's core food products healthier, such as by cutting sugar, while building up its health science and skin health businesses. RBC Capital Markets analysts said Schneider's initial observations were carefully thought through and to the point.     Jefferies analyst Martin Deboo said Nestle capped a subdued earnings season, with average organic growth for the big four food and personal care companies -- Nestle, Unilever (ULVR.L), Danone (DANO.PA) and Reckitt Benckiser (RB.L) - slowing to a weaker-than-expected 2.1 percent. Slideshow (6 Images)    We expect ... investors to continue to ask whether 'the model is broken' on the back of this, he said about the sector.  European consumer goods companies face challenges from local rivals in emerging markets, weaker earnings potential and more aggressive cost-cutting from American companies pressurised by the growing presence of private equity firm 3G Capital. European food and beverage stocks .SX3P fell 12 percent from October to December, underperforming the broader European market by 15 percent. They have not fallen further during the reporting season, suggesting that those challenges are priced in.  Unilever cited problems in Brazil and demonetization in India, while Danone (DANO.PA) pointed the finger at tough conditions in China.

Schneider said already accelerating volume growth was encouraging and he also expected pricing to improve this year.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gsk-ceo-idUSKBN1A61JN","GlaxoSmithKline's new CEO prepares to trim drug pipeline","","July 21, 2017 /  12:50 PM / in 7 days","","LONDON (Reuters) - GlaxoSmithKline's (GSK.L) new chief executive, who has already made her mark with plans to divest some nutritional products, will turn next week to the main business of focusing the company's pipeline of new drugs. Despite her non-pharmaceutical background in consumer brands, Emma Walmsley sees improving drug research productivity as her top priority, and she wants Britain's biggest drugmaker to have fewer but potentially more lucrative new medicine launches in future. That means axing or licensing out some experimental drugs in non-core therapy areas, while boosting investment - as well as potential early-stage acquisitions - in the most promising fields, according to company insiders. Even after recent expansion of GSK's vaccines and consumer health units, pharmaceuticals still account for nearly 70 percent of group operating profits. Yet while GSK now has leading positions in vaccines and consumer health, it has a lackluster record in prescription medicines and has not come up with the kind of multibillion-dollar products launched by big pharma rivals in recent years. Walmsley will flesh out her plans for overhauling drug research when she presents second quarter results on July 26. She has already flagged her readiness to scrap products not generating sufficient value with plans to sell off malted drink Horlicks in Britain and MaxiNutrition, while considering the disposal of older antibiotics. Describing the approach after presenting her first set of results in April, she said: We will need to be switching off some areas. The goal is to sharpen what is currently one of the more diverse drug pipelines in the pharmaceuticals industry, spread across a wide range of therapy areas. In some fields, like respiratory and HIV medicine, GSK has a clear leading position. But it lags in others such as cardiovascular, rare diseases and diabetes, and some investors worry it has been spreading its R&D; budget too thinly. FILE PHOTO: The GlaxoSmithKline building is pictured in Hounslow, west London June 18, 2013.Luke MacGregor/File PhotoThe result can be sub-optimal product launches, such as Tanzeum for type 2 diabetes, which has generated disappointing sales after GSK launched the injection behind rival medicines from Novo Nordisk (NOVOb.CO) and AstraZeneca (AZN.L). Others, like a novel pill for heart disease, have flopped in tests even before getting to market, while its lupus drug Benlysta has failed to hit initial blockbuster sales forecasts, despite GSK spending $3 billion to buy the firm that invented it. Following Astrazeneca? In prioritizing areas where GSK has deep scientific and market expertise, Walmsley wants the R&D; and commercial departments at GSK to work together much more closely in future. In some ways, GSK looks set to follow in the footsteps of its smaller British rival AstraZeneca (AZN.L), which has divested a large number of non-core drug projects recently as it concentrates on core areas like cancer. Significantly, former AstraZeneca executive Luke Miels will be a key lieutenant for Walmsley during the shake-up. He will join GSK in September, several months later than planned due to a legal tussle with his former employer.  Analysts and investors have welcomed the idea of rationalizing GSK's R&D;, but caution it will be a long haul. It’s a company which has struggled to do what you would hope a pharmaceutical company would do, which is do the R&D; and successfully get the products through, said Insight Investment fund manager Tim Rees. Rees said an R&D; revamp made sense but it would take 5-7 years to yield results. Fortunately, Walmsley has a window to make the changes. GSK is not expecting its next wave of new drugs until after 2020 and also has no significant patent expiries, barring the imminent loss of protection on lung drug Advair, until 2026.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-kenya-widows-witches-idUSKCN0Z900Q","Branded witches and cursed by spirits, Kenyan widows ousted from land","","June 23, 2016 /  12:15 AM / a year ago","","NAIROBI (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Juma Kalume Musunye's six grandchildren beat her until she fell to the ground crying, and then doused her in petrol, claiming she had used witchcraft to paralyze their mother's hands. They wanted to kill me, said the 65-year-old widow who lives on Kenya's coast, where the Mijikenda people traditionally blame witches for illness and misfortune. My son told them I had bewitched his wife. Hearing her screams, Musunye's neighbors rushed out and rescued her.  I am really bitter, she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation ahead of International Widows' Day on Thursday.     I am old, my health is not good and my children do not care about me. Musunye was speaking by phone from Kaya Godoma, a center set up in 2008 to care for elderly people ousted by their relatives. Millions of widows across Africa are left destitute after being evicted from their homes and are too poor or uneducated to seek legal redress, campaigners say. Musunye is one of 19 elderly people branded as witches who have found refuge at Kaya Godoma, some 30 km (20 miles) inland from the popular tourist town of Kilifi, with its palm-fringed sandy beaches.  Her seven sons and their families continue to live on her late husband's land, which she described as very big.  Killings of elderly people for witchcraft in Kilifi County are on the rise, according to local media, with 104 such murders reported to the police in 2014.  Mob Attacks Under the guise of culture, widows are often mistreated by relatives who want their property, experts say. Hunger for land is growing in Kenya, a country whose 45 million strong population is predicted to double by 2045. You will see people making up stories that someone is a witch, said Josephine Mongare, chairwoman of the Federation of Women Lawyers in Kenya (FIDA). They will go out there and do mob justice on her ... because her right to that property extinguishes upon her death. Traditionally, women in Kenya could not own land, which was passed down from father to son, leaving widows without a male heir vulnerable to eviction. If you don't have a boy child, you haven't given birth, Mongare said. You'll find relatives now coalescing around the property and wanting to get rid of you. One percent of land in Kenya belongs to women, with five percent jointly owned by spouses, 2006 government data shows. Most of the 300,000 court cases FIDA has pursued since 1985 on behalf of poor women involve land and property rights. Kenya's 1981 Succession Act grants widows the right to live on their late husbands' property until they die, provided they don't remarry, after which it passes on to their children.  This right is often violated, driving poor widows into the slums where they struggle to feed and educate their children, further entrenching poverty. Some widows' children even end up selling sex on the street, said Margaret Gero, a member of the Luo community who runs a widow support group in Kajimbo, some 30 km from Lake Victoria in western Kenya.  While Kenya's progressive 2010 constitution recognizes that men and women have equal rights to own property, parliament has not enacted laws to spell out how these rights can be realized. Courts continue to recognize customary laws as long as they are not inconsistent with the constitution - an ambiguity which often leads to contradictory rulings. Spirits Another traditional belief that has fueled the abuse of widows is the Luo custom of widow cleansing, where a widow is forced to have sex with one of her late husband's brothers as a purification ritual, before being inherited as his wife.  The Luo community believe that when the woman is not (cleansed and) inherited, the spirits of the dead might come back and haunt the community, said Gero, a 48-year-old retired health worker who campaigns against the practice. Wife inheritance was designed to ensure that the wife - and her late husband's land - remained in the family. But it has fueled the spread of HIV in the Luo-dominated counties on the shores of Lake Victoria, which have Kenya's highest HIV prevalence rates, up to four times the national average of six percent, government data shows. Gero blames the practice for her own family's misfortunes. She set up the widows' group to help others avoid the same fate. When her polygamous father died in 1997, leaving behind five daughters, his wife was inherited and contracted HIV.  Gero's uncles destroyed their home, pushing her youngest sister, Rose, to run away and get married at the age of 15. She and her child are also HIV positive.  Several members of Gero's widows' group have chased away men who were trying to inherit them and their land.   I am homeless, but I don't want their children to be homeless, she said.  They have the right to live in the modern world.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-olympics-broadcasting-eurosport-idUSKBN14L12Q","New broadcaster promises year-round buzz","","January 1, 2017 /  12:52 PM / in 7 months","","LONDON (Reuters) - Fans of the Olympics can expect the spirit of the Games to remain aflame all year round, not just during the sporting extravaganzas, the man now responsible for broadcasting both the Summer and Winter events to hundreds of millions of viewers across Europe told Reuters. We can make this a year-round experience... because of all the broadcast rights we have to Olympic sports, Eurosport CEO Peter Hutton said in an interview. We promised the International Olympic Committee (IOC) we would keep the brand alive all year round. Eurosport, through parent company Discovery Communications, bought the exclusive multimedia rights to broadcasting the Olympics in some 50 countries and territories in Europe in a 1.3 billion Euros ($1.37 billion) deal which begins on Jan. 1 and takes them through to the 2024 Olympic Games.  Discovery own the rights across all platforms, including free-to-air television, subscription/pay-TV television, internet and mobile phone in all languages. However, consistent with IOC and local market requirements, Discovery has committed to broadcasting a minimum of 200 hours of the Olympic Games and 100 hours of the Olympic Winter Games on free-to-air television during the Games period, and will sub-license a portion of the rights in many markets across Europe. Hutton says this eight-year contract is just the start of a deal which he says offers much to both parties. For us, the Olympic Games is about changing from what Eurosport used to be, to what we are trying to be, Hutton said of the broadcaster which has grown from modest roots in 1989 to rival the biggest sports broadcasters globally. The Games, and these memorable moments...they give us a sense of purpose. Go back to how the Olympic Games affects you, it is great that the moment affects people, but also look back in time. I have got a picture on the wall here of Seb Coe winning in Moscow in 1980, but I remember him breaking three world records in 41 days the year before... the whole thing became a longer story, and that is what we want to do with the Olympics. Eurosport have a instant opportunity to start building 2018 Winter Olympic buzz with their coverage of the Four Hills ski jumping tournament on Jan. 1. That will be one of our biggest events in multiple markets, Hutton said of the iconic event that has taken place in Germany and Austria each year since 1952. With the next Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, little more than a year away, Hutton acknowledges there are challenges ahead — not least establishing credibility for Eurosport as the natural home of the Olympics Games, but the Briton says the broadcasters' full package can help grow the Olympics. We have got the deal up to 2024; but we would like to do this for longer, he said. Sports channels do what sports channels do but we are a great combination, it is not just Eurosport, but also what Discovery can bring to this project. Discovery, which says it reaches 3 billion cumulative subscribers in more than 220 countries and territories, delivers a range of television programing and content through a number of global brands, including Discovery Channel, TLC, and Animal Planet.

    LOCAL MARKETS OUTLOOK
    (As reported by NewsRise)
     The SGX Nifty Futures was at 8,517.50, up 0.4 pct from its previous close.
     The Indian rupee will likely open lower against the dollar, as the
greenback rebounded tracking a recovery in U.S. Treasury yields after upbeat
corporate earnings outlook eased investors' demand for safe-haven sovereign
debt. 
     Indian government bonds will likely trade steady to lower, as investors
may defer purchases amid lack of domestic triggers and higher U.S. Treasury
yields on renewed optimism over President Donald Trump's growth policies. The
yield on the benchmark 6.97 pct bond maturing in 2026 is likely to trade in a
6.41 pct-6.47 pct band today. The bond had closed at 103.77 rupees, yielding

finish on Wall Street, while a rebound in the dollar looked vulnerable as some
investors grew sceptical about U.S. President Trump's policies translating into

     The dollar drifted lower against the yen and euro on Wednesday, as
lingering concerns about U.S. President Donald Trump's protectionist stance
undermined the greenback's earlier rebound. 
     U.S. Treasury yields rose on Tuesday as investors snapped up equities on
improved outlook on corporate profits, trimming their safe-haven demand for
bonds spurred by U.S. President Donald Trump's protectionist trade stance. 
     Oil edged lower, snapping four sessions of gains as an increase in U.S.
inventories weighed on the market, offsetting bullish momentum from production
cuts announced by OPEC and other producers. 
     Gold held steady after falling from two-month highs in the previous
session, buoyed by a weaker dollar and uncertainty over the policies of U.S.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/new-york-times-advertising-oscars-idUSL1N1G823V","New York Times to air TV ad during Oscars for new ‘Truth’ campaign","","February 23, 2017 /  10:27 PM / 5 months ago","","Feb 23 (Reuters) - The New York Times Co will air its first TV ad in seven years on Sunday's broadcast of the Academy Awards on ABC, as the 166-year old newspaper looks to highlight independent journalism amid U.S. President Donald Trump's attacks on the media as fake news. The Oscars are among the pricier ad buys on television, with 30-second commercials going for between $1.9 and $2 million, according to ad-tracking firm Kantar Media. While ABC, owned by Walt Disney Co, does not comment on how much it receives from advertisers, a source with knowledge of negotiations said the Times' ad buy was in that range. The Oscars is traditionally the most-watched non-sports event broadcast in the United States. Since Trump’s Nov. 8 election victory, the Times has seen an uptick in digital subscribers and revenue even as its business on the print side declines. During the Times’ most recent quarter, the paper added 276,000 digital subscribers and grew digital ad revenue by nearly 11 percent, accounting for more than 40 percent of its overall ad revenues. The New York Times, the Financial Times, The Wall Street Journal and Gannett Co are building on the online readership they gained during the 2016 presidential election by marketing unbiased reporting as a sales strategy. Trump has repeatedly bashed the press. In a tweet last week citing The New York Times, NBC, ABC, CBS and CNN, he said the media was the enemy of the American People! Last year’s Oscars broadcast attracted 34.4 million viewers, making it the third-lowest-rated Oscars since 1974. Still, only National Football League games and Fox’s airing of the final game of last fall’s World Series drew more viewers in 2016. The New York Times commercial is part of a broader brand campaign, the paper’s first in a decade, that aims to position the newspaper as a reliable outlet in the face of the rise of the “fake news” epidemic. The company's 30-second commercial repeats the words “The Truth Is…” on screen, with voices in background getting increasingly louder, with different endings including “our nation is more divided than ever and “alternative facts are lies.” The ad ends with: “The Truth is more important now than ever.”   (Reporting by Tim Baysinger; Editing by Anna Driver and Leslie Adler)"

UAE's Etisalat terminated its management agreement with its Nigerian business in June and surrendered its 45 percent stake to a trustee following regulatory intervention to save the local company from collapse due to debt. 9mobile CEO Boye Olusanya said the company had retained its workforce and that Etisalat's withdrawal had not led to a loss of business opportunities. Like any business we are always available for someone with a good offer ... but we are prepared to manage this business for the long haul, Olusanya said at the event in Lagos. This brand was not developed with the mindset that it's a three-month brand. He declined to say how much the re-branding cost. 9mobile has 20 million subscribers, making it the country's number four mobile operator with a 14 percent market share. South Africa's MTN has 47 percent, Globacom 20 percent and Airtel - a subsidiary of India's Bharti Airtel - 19 percent. Etisalat Nigeria had been in talks with its lenders to restructure a $1.2 billion debt after it missed repayments, but the discussions failed to produce a deal, forcing the banks to step in and order shareholders to transfer their shares to a loan trustee. Lenders have now taken control and appointed a new team to manage the company with a focus on getting it back to profitability while working to eventually raise new capital. If at any point in time someone does come in with an offer that is attractive then that person will have the right to do whatever they want to do with the brand, Olusanya said. The telecoms regulator, Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) approved the brand name change on Tuesday. Under Nigeria's telecoms law, the regulator has to also approve a transfer of telecoms licences or any new investor in a telecoms company with more than 10 percent of the shares. NCC spokesman Tony Ojobo told Reuters that the brand name change did not affect the terms of the license which was granted to a Nigerian entity known as Emerging Markets Telecommunication Services (EMTS). He said it was a change to its trading name. (Editing by Susan Thomas)"

    The Indian rupee is expected to fall further against the U.S. dollar this

    (As reported by NewsRise)
     The SGX Nifty Futures was trading at 8,276.50, trading up 0.1 pct from its
previous close.
     The Indian rupee will likely open lower against the dollar, tracking its
Asian peers, as a rebound in U.S. hourly wages overshadowed a
weaker-than-expected uptick in December's nonfarm payrolls numbers, lifting
Treasury yields and the greenback.
     Indian sovereign bonds will likely edge higher, as the government lowered
its estimate for gross domestic product growth this fiscal year, sparking
speculation of rate cuts to boost the economy. The yield on the benchmark 6.97
pct bond maturing in 2026 is likely to trade in a 6.34 pct-6.40 pct band today.
The bond had closed at 104.16 rupees, yielding 6.39 pct, on Jan. 6.
    
    
    GLOBAL MARKETS
     The Dow came within one point of 20,000 for the first time on Friday and
the Nasdaq and S&P; 500 reached record highs, boosted by Apple, extending a
two-month rally fueled by optimism about U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. 
     Asian stocks edged higher, helped by a strong Wall Street, and the dollar
stood tall against rivals after the latest U.S. payrolls data indicated strong
underlying wage growth, strengthening the case for more rate increases in 2017.
 
     The dollar marked time in Asia after signs of wage pressure in the
December U.S. jobs report proved enough to lift Treasury yields, but with bulls
wary of a setback following last week's wave of profit-taking. 
     U.S. Treasury debt yields rallied from multiweek lows on Friday after data
showed a rebound in U.S. wages last month despite a smaller-than-expected jobs
gain, which could drive the Federal Reserve to consider raising interest rates
as early as the first quarter. 
     Oil prices fell early as Iran increased exports undermining efforts by
other oil producers to curb a global fuel supply overhang and as U.S. drillers
increased activity for a 10th week. 
     Gold prices were little changed early, after dipping from a one-month high
last week on expectations of further interest rate hikes, with investor
attention on more views from the U.S. Federal Reserve.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ralph-lauren-moves-idUSKBN15V1Y7","Ralph Lauren hires Vice Media exec to head new marketing role","","February 16, 2017 /  2:49 PM / in 5 months","","(Reuters) - Ralph Lauren Corp named a Vice Media executive to the newly created role of chief marketing officer and hired Tom Ford International's chief operating officer as a brand president, weeks after the surprise resignation of CEO Stefan Larsson. Jonathan Bottomley, most recently the chief strategy officer at Vice Media's in-house advertising agency, Virtue Worldwide, will take charge effective April 3.      Vice Media, a Canadian-American digital media and broadcasting company, is a youth-focused digital media company known for its immersive journalism. Tom Mendenhall will assume the role of brand president for Men's Polo, Purple Label and Double RL from March 29, the company said on Thursday. The appointments are part of the Way Forward plan, which was introduced by Larsson in June last year to strengthen the leadership team and refocus on the company's core brands. Larsson stepped down on Feb.2, following differences with founder Ralph Lauren over the direction of the luxury brand. Ralph Lauren, like some other luxury brands, has been struggling with sluggish spending on luxury apparel and accessories over the past few quarters.  The company's margins have also taken a knock as department stores discount heavily to get rid of excess inventory. Also, Ralph Lauren's lower-end Polo and Lauren brands are facing competition from fast-fashion retailers such as H&M; and Inditex's Zara. Under the Way Forward plan, the company has said it would cut about 1,000 jobs and close 50 stores to keep a lid on costs. Mendenhall has also held senior roles in companies such as Abercrombie & Fitch Co and Gucci, owned by France-based Kering SA.

Panelists Madhav Chinnappa, Director of Strategic Relations for News and Publishers at Google; Maisie McCabe, Deputy Editor of Campaign; Nic Newman, Research Association at Reuters Institute; and Nathalie Malinarich, Mobile Editor, BBC News Online, joined moderator John Pullman, Reuters Global Head of Video and Pictures, to debate Reuters exclusive survey results of reader trends on news consumption, fake news, trust, social media and consumer behavior and perceptions of news brands.  Among the highlights:   Chinnappa said that Google is “trying to give the answers that the users are looking for when they search, which is a very specific thing. So for us, when you look at false news, on some levels, that’s news spam. It’s people trying to game the system. And we’ve been trying to fight that from the beginning of Google.” Malinarich noted that brand attribution or recognition on social media is really difficult. “If you spend your whole day snacking on Facebook, you know you’ve read things about Trump or whatever it is, but you don’t who wrote them or made the video at the end. …it’s just kind of a jumble in your head and you remember the actual stories and the headlines, but you don’t really remember who provided that.” The way people buy online advertising, McCabe said, was to look for the cheapest way to find people who look like they might be interested in their brand. “That means they don’t pay attention to necessarily where the ad is going to run, so then you have the situation where people are chasing numbers by any means. It’s definitely something advertisers need to be wary of.” On fake news, Newman said “whose responsibility is it—is it publishers, is it platforms, is it users? In this world, it’s all of those. Users get the benefits of greater choice, but downside of that is they have to do more work themselves to work out what is true and what isn’t. They are, and they relish that. They see that trade off when you talk to them. From a publishers point of you, they need to do more about transparency. From a platform point of view, they need to do more as well to show the value of brands.  You can follow more of the discussion on Twitter by searching #tomorrowsnews.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL5N1EA5ST","DERIVATIVES-New committee to lead swaps identifier effort","","December 15, 2016 /  4:19 PM / in 7 months","","LONDON, Dec 15 (IFR) - A new industry committee responsible for derivatives product identifiers has launched the first in a series of consultations as it eyes an April 2017 launch for testing an automated ISIN creation service for over-the-counter swaps. The Product Committee of the Derivatives Service Bureau - the swaps arm of the Association of National Numbering Agencies - includes representatives from banks, buyside firms and trading venues. Nine committee members, who participate for a two-year term, comprise Citigroup, JP Morgan, Societe Generale, Allianz Global Investors, Fidelity, Goldman Sachs Asset Management, Bloomberg, Tradeweb and the InterContinental Exchange. New pre and post-trade transparency rules under the second Markets in Financial Instruments Directive require certain OTC derivatives to be traded on regulated venues from January 2018. In draft regulatory technical standards issued in 2015, the European Securities and Markets Authority ruled that swaps must be categorised using ISINs to determine which products are subject to the requirements. The DSB was created by ANNA - which serves as the registration authority for ISIN standards for bonds and exchange-traded derivatives - after publication of the RTS. The new committee will be responsible for product governance and have direct involvement in the creation and maintenance of data specifications for OTC swaps ISINs as well as addressing new products. Because of the global nature of derivative products, it made sense to create a brand new entity that provides the industry with the opportunity to build, from the ground up, a system that is fit for purpose and uses best-of-breed technology and processes to achieve that, said Sassan Danesh, managing partner of Etrading Software - a management services partner of the DSB, which is also represented on the new committee. The initial consultation is seeking industry comment on the key objectives and principles for generating identifiers. The consultation ends on December 30 for publication by the end of January. Findings from an earlier DSB consultation on how participants will connect to the service and obtain ISINs, as well as the approach for on-boarding onto the user-acceptance testing platform, will be published on December 19. Despite widespread calls for the creation of an industry governance committee to advise ANNA and encourage innovation, some participants have been disappointed by the limited membership of DSB's product committee. Given the scale of the task and ambitious deadlines, many believe that a full industry dialogue is still required, which may not be achieved through a consultation process. There's still a lot that needs to be resolved over the next two months and there hasn't been a lot of discussion around some of the questions such as the treatment of structured products and package trades, said Karel Engelen, co-head of data, reporting and FpML at ISDA. There's a lot still to do, particularly if there's a commitment to a testing deadline at the end of the first quarter. Membership of the committee was limited to buyside, sellside and platform operators, leaving industry groups like ISDA - which spearheaded an initiative for product identification standards in 2015 and formed a symbology governance committee - on the sidelines of the debate. Granularity Level Key questions still to be answered include the appropriate level of granularity for categorising OTC derivatives. According to the RTS, separate ISINs must be issued for every maturity date. That means 10-year interest rate swaps issued just one day apart will trade under different ISINs. In addition, negotiated fixed-leg prices in a swap trade are also treated as a data field, potentially leading almost every swap to trade with its own ISIN. The industry already has highly scalable systems to cope with high volumes of market data, which are much higher than the volumes of reference data that we're talking about, said Danesh. The inclusion of fixed price as a field is more problematic than maturity dates as there's an almost continuous flow of ISINs from prices ticking up and down. If there's too much granularity it becomes difficult to extract useful historic data. ISDA analysis shows that the approach delivered just 1.5 trades per ISIN over a three-month period, compared with 376 trades if those characteristics were removed. Testing is scheduled to run for six months and DSB expects the service to be live for zero-touch ISIN creation on October 1 - three months ahead of MiFID II implementation.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/gsk-results-idUSL8N1HY4RL","UPDATE 2-New GlaxoSmithKline CEO wants fewer, bigger new drug launches","","April 26, 2017 /  12:39 PM / 3 months ago","","* Walmsley says pharma pipeline is top priority * GSK faces challenges from generic Advair, Gilead HIV drug * Q1 adjusted EPS 25.0 pence vs consensus 24.5p (Adds analyst comment, latest shares) By Ben Hirschler LONDON, April 26 (Reuters) - GlaxoSmithKline's new chief executive aims to improve returns in drug development, and wants fewer but bigger new medicine launches. In her first comments since taking over on April 1, Emma Walmsley, 47, said on Wednesday that her priority was the pharmaceuticals unit, where she wants commercial considerations to be given greater weight in early investment decisions. We'd like to have probably fewer and more focused priorities, to have bigger launches, she told reporters, after announcing first-quarter results, adding this would involve tough choices and the closure of some research programmes. Her approach represents a shift for GSK, which has recently had a large number of new drug launches but has not come up with the kind of multibillion-dollar blockbusters produced by Big Pharma rivals. Walmsley, who previously headed GSK's consumer division after 17 years at L'Oreal, said she would set out her detailed vision for the company alongside half-year results in July. Under previous CEO Andrew Witty, GSK has built up a diversified business, with its core pharmaceuticals operation buttressed by large consumer health and vaccine units - a structure Walmsley said had both logic and benefit. Still, the company has struggled to deliver decent returns to investors for around five years, due to sluggish drug sales, although in recent quarters it has returned to steady growth. Since last June, it has been buoyed by a drop in sterling in the wake of the Brexit vote, which has flattered results since the vast majority of its sales are made overseas. First-quarter results were slightly better than expected, keeping Britain's biggest drugmaker on track to hit financial targets in 2017 as it braces for generic competition to blockbuster lung drug Advair. Sales and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) rose 19 and 31 percent respectively to 7.38 billion pounds ($9.46 billion) and 25.0 pence. Analysts, on average, had forecast sales of 7.26 billion pounds and EPS of 24.5p, according to Thomson Reuters data. This is a positive start for the year with sales growth in all three of our businesses and an improvement in the group's operating margin, Walmsley said. However, Deutsche Bank analyst Richard Parkes said sales were boosted in large part by a strong vaccines performance, thanks to several big orders falling in the quarter, and GSK shares slipped around 1.5 percent. Generic Advair Walmsley is the first woman to lead a top global drugmaker and stands out among Big Pharma bosses as a consumer brands guru rather than a prescription medicines expert. She is set to continue funding GSK's dividend, a major lure for investors, at an unchanged level this year. That still leaves her scope for deals, which she said would most likely involve buying in early-stage experimental drugs. We will be continuing to look externally, if that is the right way for us to make sure we have a really strong pipeline to deliver returns, she said. GSK last month won a short-term reprieve from the threat of generic Advair when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration delayed approval of Mylan's copy of the inhaler for asthma and chronic lung disease. But with another substitutable Advair generic from Hikma potentially winning a green light by May 10, GSK reiterated that generic Advair could still dent full-year profits. It predicts that EPS, in constant currencies, will be flat to slightly lower in 2017, if substitutable Advair generics arrive in the United States by mid-year. If they don't launch in 2017, EPS should rise between 5 and 7 percent. With Advair generics looming, GSK needs to prove it can maintain its lead in the respiratory medicine field, where an experimental three-in-one drug inhaler will be critical to future success. It also faces competition in HIV treatment, where Gilead's new drug bictegravir is shaping up as a potent rival to GSK's best-selling dolutegravir. Significantly, Walmsley's first senior appointment as CEO-designate was to poach Luke Miels from AstraZeneca as head of pharma, making him a key lieutenant as the company prepares for the next big wave of new drug launches in the 2020s. GSK is discussing his start date with AstraZeneca. ($1 = 0.7798 pounds) (Editing by Martinne Geller)"

Known for its British-made trenchcoats, Burberry's beauty range is led by fragrances My Burberry and Mr Burberry, and includes cosmetics to help introduce its brand to new consumers. The company, which brought the perfume business in house in 2013, said it would retain creative control while Coty, which counts Gucci, Hugo Boss and Calvin Klein in its portfolio, would bring its global distribution network to the table. Chief Financial Officer Julie Brown said Burberry had repositioned the business by cutting secondary-channel sales, and it was now the time to partner the premium fragrance leader. Coty has very broad experience of working closely with other luxury brands, she said in an interview. We will benefit from their deep beauty industry expertise and also their first class distribution. Coty will pay 130 million pounds for the long-term licence, plus about 50 million pounds for inventory and other assets, Burberry said. It will also pay royalties from October. Beauty contributed 7 percent of Burberry's revenue in the first half of its 2016/17 financial year, down 17 percent on the prior period, partly as a result of the repositioning. It launched men's fragrance Mr Burberry a year ago and young British model Iris Law has promoted its cosmetics. Chief Operating Officer John Smith said there was an opportunity to grow cosmetics sales, which currently account for about 8 percent of beauty sales against an industry average of a third. Make-up is a key recruitment tool for a luxury brand, in that the price points are a lot lower than any other product, he said. As a means of recruiting people into the brand, it's perfect. Shares in Burberry were trading up 1 percent at 1,739 pence. Analysts at Exane BNP Paribas said they welcomed the choice of a first class partner to appropriately develop the business. In fact, we never liked the idea of Burberry managing its beauty business directly, as beauty is an FMCG (fast moving consumer goods) business where you win on the back of global reach, they said. Burberry said the deal would be broadly neutral to adjusted profit before tax in 2017/18 and accretive the following year.

The Internet has become the industry's most important growth engine, with analysts expecting online transactions to represent 20 percent of all luxury sales within a decade, up from 7-8 percent now. LVMH's online sales of 2 billion euros ($2.1 billion) last year equated to 5.3 percent of group revenue. This platform should boost the visibility of the various LVMH brands, one of the sources said, adding that the site would also promote other luxury goods brands not owned by LVMH, which is controlled by French billionaire Bernard Arnault. Leading the initiative will be former Apple executive Ian Rogers, hired by Arnault in 2015 to spearhead digital strategy at the world's biggest luxury goods group. The company's new e-commerce site is due to go live in a few months' time, the sources said. LVMH declined to comment. The group has already sought to tap into the increasing importance to the industry of online social media platforms by setting up LVMH Luxury Ventures last month to invest in start-up luxury goods projects.

Luxury sedans and small sport utility vehicles jostled for the spotlight along with electric cars and diesel-powered pickup trucks. When it came to industry profits, the trucks and SUVs were at center-stage. Here are some of the notable vehicle debuts at the Detroit show, which opens to the public on Saturday, January 14. * Nissan Rogue Sport. A 5-passenger SUV that will be slightly smaller than the Nissan Rogue, which has become the top-selling model in the company's U.S. lineup. Rogue was the top-selling non-pickup truck in the U.S. in December. It will go on sale in the spring. This is part of Nissan's response to U.S. consumers' growing preference for SUVs of all sizes. * Kia Motors Co Stinger. The Stinger is a new 5-passenger fastback sport sedan. Kia said it would produce the Stinger after showing a concept version of it earlier. The car was designed in Frankfurt. It will go on sale in the U.S. market in late 2017. * Lexus LS. Toyota Motor Corp debuted the first Lexus LS 400 sedan in Detroit at the 1989 auto show. On Monday, the brand unveiled the fifth generation of its big sedan to a market that is turning away from the traditional concept that a luxury brand's flagship model must be a sedan, instead of a sport utility vehicle. The brand also is showing a compact crossover concept called UX. * BMW 5-series. BMW AG has already taken the wraps off the look of the new 5-series, which competes with the Mercedes E-class and Audi A6. The German luxury automaker displayed a plug-in hybrid version of the car for the first time in Detroit. Like its competitors, the 5-series is losing ground to SUVs - and the Tesla Model S electric sedan - among affluent U.S. buyers. BMW also is showing a compact X2 crossover concept. * Honda Odyssey. Just in time for millennials starting to have the baby boom generation's grandchildren, Honda Motor Co  debuted a new generation of its Odyssey minivan. The minivan segment has shrunk since the former Chrysler Corp pioneered the concept of a boxy family hauler in the 1980s, but sales in the segment rose 8 percent last year. * Ford F-150. Ford Motor Co will give the 2018 model of the best-selling vehicle in the United States some modest appearance changes, and more significantly, new technology to reduce fuel consumption. For the first time, Ford will offer a diesel engine option in the F-150. The company is not releasing fuel economy estimates for that engine. A new 3.3-liter six-cylinder engine will also be offered and fuel-saving technology that shuts down the engine at a stop light will be available. * Chevrolet Traverse. General Motors Co highlighted two redesigned sport utility vehicles in Detroit, including a new generation of the Chevrolet Traverse, a family hauling SUV that will compete with the likes of the Ford Explorer, Honda Pilot, Toyota Highlander and Jeep Grand Cherokee. * Toyota Camry. The best-selling passenger car in the United States for the past 15 years got a major makeover. Camry sales fell 9.5 percent in 2016 from the year before, reflecting pressure from the shift to SUVs. Overall, mid-sized sedan sales in the United States fell 10 percent. Toyota has been giving its mainstream models more expressive styling and advanced technology, to counter a long-held image for dull reliability. The 2018 Camry is expected to reflect that direction. * Mercedes-Benz E Class Coupe. Daimler AG's  mainstream brand has redesigned its mid-size E Class Coupe. It also showed a facelifted version of the GLA compact crossover, as well as a redesigned Smart Electric Drive. * Audi Q8. Audi, the high-volume luxury brand of Volkswagen AG showed a concept of a new, large sport utility vehicle in Detroit. It is also unveiling a facelifted version of its SQ5 mid-size SUV and redesigned A5 cabriolet. * Volkswagen Tiguan. The mid-size Tiguan crossover utility vehicle has been redesigned. VW is also displaying yet another revival of its classic Microbus, this time as a battery-powered electric concept called I.D. Buzz. * Infiniti QX50. Nissan's luxury brand is showing a concept version of its redesigned QX50 mid-size SUV. * GMC Terrain. The brand's compact SUV gets its first major redesign, sharing major components with the redesigned Chevrolet Equinox.

This will be Polaris's second shot at making electric bikes. In January, the company wound down the production of its Victory motorcycles, which also included its Empulse electric bike, after booking cumulative losses of more than $100 million over the past 18 years. Polaris now wants to attract new riders with fun electric motorcycles as it focuses on the storied Indian brand, which it bought in 2011, Steve Menneto, president of its motorcycles division, told Reuters. The company's new electric motorcycle is expected to cover 120-140 miles on a single charge if driven aggressively, compared with 75 miles for an Empulse bike. The characteristics of the (new) powertrain are going to be more applicable to be able to ride a bike in pleasure and twisties, and kind of how you would use pleasure bikes today, said Menneto. Polaris and larger rival Harley-Davidson Inc are increasingly targeting price-conscious millennials as demand skids for big bikes in the United States, where the core customer group of baby boomers is aging. Polaris would also expand the product line of the Indian brand to include bikes with smaller cylinder capacities, Menneto said. He expects the company's revenue from its motorcycle business to grow to $1 billion in the next five years from $708.5 million last year. Market-leader Harley has also been working to attract young riders. The company unveiled its prototype battery-powered motorcycle, LiveWire, in 2014 and plans to launch an electric bike within the next four years or so. Harley's revenue from motorcycles and related products has fallen about 2.7 percent cumulatively over the past two years. In contrast, Polaris's revenue from its motorcycles business, which includes sales of parts, garments and accessories, has jumped about 30 percent in the same period. Menneto declined to give pricing details about the new electric bike but said that it would be priced competitively. The company's suggested retail price for the Victory Empulse is upward of $19,999.   (Reporting by Ankit Ajmera in Bengaluru; Editing by Sayantani Ghosh and Anil D'Silva)"

Our mandate is to make sure the business runs as profitably as it can. What is most important now is to ... ensure that the business runs and meets its obligations, the company's new chief executive Boye Olusanya told Reuters on Tuesday. Nigerian regulators intervened last week to save Etisalat Nigeria after talks with its lenders to renegotiate a $1.2 billion loan from 2013 with 13 local lenders failed. Etisalat Nigeria has 20 million subscribers, making it the country's number four mobile operator with a 14 percent market share. South Africa's MTN has 47 percent, Globacom 20 percent and Airtel - a subsidiary of India's Bharti Airtel - 19 percent. Once we've gotten ourselves to where certain decisions are made and the structure and form of the business is formed then maybe we would look at a capital raising structure that would be suitable for the nature of how the business will be run, the new CEO said in an interview in his offices. Olusanya, who took over as CEO of Etisalat Nigeria following the appointment of a new board led by Nigeria's central bank, said that while the business could run without an immediate recapitalisation, he would not rule one out completely. Obviously if its possible to do it tomorrow we will do it, because that enhances the ability of this business to roll-out quickly, to get more subscribers, which is what everybody wants, he added. UAE's Etisalat, which had a 45 percent stake in the Nigerian business, has said its exposure to Etisalat Nigeria related to services worth 191 million UAE dirhams ($52 million). In June, Etisalat said it had been ordered to transfer its shares to a loan trustee after debt talks failed. We're still in negotiations with Etisalat over the use of the brand name, Olusanya said, adding that the technical service agreement with Etisalat covered the brand name but the telecoms company was run by Nigerians. The former Celtel executive said he has plans in place to rename the company if needed after UAE's Etisalat said it had terminated a management agreement and given its one-time Nigerian business time to phase out the brand. All UAE shareholders in Etisalat Nigeria, including state-owned investment fund Mubadala, had exited the company and left the board and management, Hatem Dowidar, CEO of Etisalat International, told Reuters.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-campari-marnier-analysis-idUSKBN16V208","From crepes to cocktails: can Grand Marnier's new owner make the leap?","","March 24, 2017 /  3:45 PM / 4 months ago","","MILAN (Reuters) - Italian drinks group Davide Campari (CPRI.MI) has a tall order to fulfill: take a neglected old liqueur out of the kitchen, where it is used as a dessert topping, and turn it into a hot new cocktail trend. Grand Marnier, a 137-year-old French brand that Davide Campari bought for 652 million euros ($700 million) last year, was once a drink for the wealthy, a meld of cognac and oranges that was sipped by first-class passengers on the Titanic. Today, in its European home market, it is more often tucked away in kitchen cabinets than featured prominently in trendy bars, and its return to the cocktail circuit is not assured, even for a company that has a record of reviving faded brands. Grand Marnier sales have fallen around 2 percent in the past three years and Davide Campari expects them to flatline for two years before picking up in 2019. Based on the latest six-month data, annual sales of the brand are running at around 160 million euros, making it the company's fifth biggest brand. The stakes are high for the world's sixth largest premium spirit maker, which bought the French liqueur last June in its biggest-ever acquisition. The price included assumed debt and represented more than a tenth of Davide Campari's market value. Industry analysts say they are confident the company can restore Grand Marnier's fortunes but say it could be costly and take time, a brake on profit margins. A prolonged stagnation of Grand Marnier sales could also slow down the company's acquisition strategy, vital to compete with much bigger rivals. The group's debts, in proportion to core earnings, are manageable but higher than the average of its main rivals after making more than 2 billion euros in acquisitions in 22 years. Euromonitor analyst Jeremy Cunnington thinks it should take a break from acquisitions and develop its newly acquired brands. That all adds up to pressure to revive Grand Marnier, the biggest challenge yet for Chief Executive Bob Kunze-Concewitz. He must shake off the liqueur's reputation in Europe as a fancy dessert topping and introduce it to more drinkers in America, its biggest market even though it is relatively little known there. In Europe the challenge is making the leap from the kitchen to the glass, while in the Unites States the issue is more of increasing the glasses drunk, Kunze-Concewitz told Reuters.  The CEO declined to give his target for Grand Marnier but the company aims to grow sales across all its brands by 5 percent in the medium term. Investment bank Barclays says that implies Grand Marnier reaching around 5 percent growth by 2020. However, it took Kunze-Concewitz six years to shift the group's signature red aperitif, Campari, up a gear and accelerate the drink's growth from 3.5 percent in 2007, when he took the helm, to the high single digits by 2013. Someone says Grand Marnier is an old brand but ... three out of four consumers have never tasted it. This is a great opportunity, like it was for the re-launch of Campari, he told Reuters, adding that the company's last brand makeover, of Appleton rum, took just three years. Bartender Isaac Flores poses at Dick & Janes bar in the Brooklyn borough of New York City, U.S., March 22, 2017. Picture taken March 22, 2017.Brendan McDermidKunze-Concewitz, a multi-lingual Austrian who was actually born in Turkey, expects Grand Marnier's sales to rise in value but not in volumes this year in the United States, while a return to growth in Europe will take longer. Banking on the B-52  Davide Campari will start its offensive in America's biggest cities this year, with young drinkers and also bar managers such as 32-year-old Isaac Flores of Dick & Janes, a trendy cocktail bar in Brooklyn, New York. Flores rarely uses Grand Marnier and says brand recognition is just one of the problems to tackle. Retailing at $47 a bottle, it makes for an expensive cocktail. Slideshow (2 Images)Cocktails including it should cost at least $15-16 compared to $13 I charge the cocktails I craft, said Flores. Grand Marnier is a beautiful liqueur, which is best drunk on its own. Since he was appointed CEO at the family-controlled spirit company, CEO Kunze-Concewitz has bought 14 brands, boosting sales by 80 percent in 10 years. But debt has trebled over that time to more than 1 billion euros, or 2.9 times its core profit against an average of 2.6 for Campari's main rivals. The company plans to launch new long drinks and capitalize on the revival of classic cocktails that feature the liqueur, such as Grand Margarita and B-52. It has tightened its grip on Grand Marnier's distribution, strengthening ties with Southern Glazer's Wine and Spirits in the United States, and dropping third-party distributors and rivals Moet Hennessy (LVMH.PA) and Diageo (DGE.L). Davide Campari did not say how much it would spend on marketing Grand Marnier but the CEO said, overall, advertising and promotion expenses would rise by 20-25 basis points to just over 18 percent of sales, a level above the sector average. Grand Marnier's main rival in the United States is Remy Cointreau's (RCOP.PA) eponymous liqueur which has a smaller market share but has long set a faster pace in terms of sales. Davide Campari plans to hold tasting events in bars to show drinkers the difference between the two. But food and beverage expert Vittoria Veronesi, of Milan's Bocconi University, says it should not take Grand Marnier out of the kitchen altogether. It would be fun to create new dishes and match them to a Grand Marnier-based aperitif, putting together the work of the chef with that of the barman. Editing by Mark Bendeich/Keith Weir"

Trump's lawyers in China applied for the marks in April 2016, and the approvals were published by China's Trademark Office on Feb. 27 and Monday, the AP reported. Representatives for the Trump Organization did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Trump has previously said he has handed over his business interests to a trust overseen by one of his sons and a Trump Organization executive. He can, however, revoke the trust at will and, as its sole beneficiary, benefits from it financially. Democratic Senator Ben Cardin, the ranking member on the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, called for the Departments of State, Commerce and Justice to brief Congress on the approvals and on the potential constitutional dangers that they present. The trademarks, all but three in Trump's name, will be registered after 90 days, barring objections, the AP said. China had already registered one trademark on Feb. 14, for Trump-branded construction services, following a 10-year legal battle that went Trump's way after he declared his candidacy for the White House, it said. This is an astonishing development ... It's clear to me that officials in Beijing have come to appreciate the potential return on investments for China in having a positive, personal business relationship with the President of the United States, who has not taken appropriate and transparent steps to completely sever his relationship from the corporation that bears his name, Cardin said in a statement. Cardin has introduced a resolution demanding Trump cut his ties with the Trump Organization or risk violating the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution, which bars public servants from accepting anything of value from foreign governments unless approved by Congress. AP quoted Dan Plane, a director at Simone IP Services, a Hong Kong intellectual property consultancy, as saying he had never seen so many applications approved by China so quickly. The trademarks cover such businesses as branded spas, massage parlors, golf clubs, hotels, insurance, finance and real estate companies, retail shops, restaurants, bars and bodyguard and escort services, AP reported. Three are for Scion, a hotel brand Trump's sons want to expand in the United States, it said.   (Writing by Eric Walsh; Editing by James Dalgleish)"

We will definitely go as Genesis brand down the road of alternative propulsions and it is very, very obvious that EV is definitely on the map, Fitzgerald told reporters on the sidelines of an auto show in Busan, without elaborating on details such as a launch date.  I think full electric cars will be the future in the auto industry, said the former Lamborghini director who recently joined Hyundai and leads strategy for Genesis, which broke out as a standalone luxury brand in November. Genesis is a departure for Hyundai Motor, which had earned its reputation as a value brand, and is seen aiming at tapping growing demand for premium cars with higher prices to boost flagging profits.  But the brand faces a challenge of carving out its own identity and differentiating itself from its group brands - Hyundai and Kia Motors (000270.KS) - as well as German competitors, analysts say. A lens of a camera system is placed between the radiator grill of a Hyundai Genesis car during the media day ahead of the 84th Geneva Motor Show at the Palexpo Arena in Geneva March 5, 2014.Arnd Wiegmann/File PhotoThe main goal is to have a strong differentiation within brands. No design overlap, said Luc Donckerwolke, senior vice president at Hyundai Design Center.  Genesis is a key initiative for Hyundai Motor Vice Chairman and heir apparent Chung Eui-sun, who is being groomed to succeed his father and chairman Chung Mong-koo. He is involved in all decisions, Fitzgerald said. Hyundai Motor plans to add a diesel version of its Genesis G80 large sedan in the first half of next year, the company said in a statement.  The gasoline-powered G80, unveiled at the auto show, is the second model under the Genesis brand after G90 and will be introduced in South Korea next month.

Last week Munich prosecutors arrested an Audi employee in connection with dieselgate, the latest setback to Volkswagen's (VOWG_p.DE) luxury car arm and main profit driver, after the German government a month earlier had accused Audi of cheating on emissions tests. On Tuesday Audi shifted the focus back to its products with its top management hosting 2,000 guests in Barcelona to unveil the new A8, whose Level-3 self-driving technology enables the car to completely control driving at up to 60 kilometers (37 miles) per hour, beating the Mercedes S-Class and the BMW 7-Series. Having slipped behind its two German rivals on global sales last year, Audi has risked stalling without innovation and needed a new prestige product, said Stefan Bratzel, head of the Center of Automotive Management think-tank near Cologne. Innovation is key in premium car-making, Bratzel said. The new A8 will polish the brand's image and line-up at a critical time. Even Audi acknowledged that amid ongoing investigations, persistent pressure on its chief executive for his crisis management and analysts' criticism of Audi's ageing vehicle design, the new A8 creates an opportunity for a clean break. It's gratifying that we are able to set a positive sign for real 'Vorsprung durch Technik', advancement through technology, R&D; chief Peter Mertens said. Mercedes and BMW have accelerated their autonomous-driving development programs with Mercedes owner Daimler joining forces with car parts maker Robert Bosch [ROBG.UL] in April and BMW collaborating with other firms including U.S. parts maker Delphi and chipmaker Intel. Audi Chief Executive Rupert Stadler presents the new Audi A8 at the Audi Summit in Barcelona, Spain July 11, 2017.Albert GeaFeaturing a more distinctive design and a foot massager for rear-seat passengers, the new A8 heralds the start of a series of redesigns and new model launches at Audi including an electric sport-utility vehicle (SUV) to take on Tesla's Model X, the all-new Q4 and Q8 SUVs and redesigned A6 and A7 model lines. A source at Audi said development of the A8, which took about five years, suffered from changes at the brand's research and development department, though assiduous work by division heads helped ensure that delays were kept in check. The A8 will reach German dealerships in the fourth quarter. Slideshow (21 Images)Audi is on its third development chief since dieselgate broke in late 2015, with Mertens, who took office in May, the brand's fifth R&D; boss since 2012. The top brass at VW group and Audi are so preoccupied with the diesel issue that the company's management is lastingly distracted, said Christian Strenger, a supervisory board member at Deutsche Bank's retail asset management arm DWS. With the new A8's retail price up almost 8 percent on its  predecessor at 90,600 euros ($103,000), Audi will also struggle to narrow the gap with its traditional rivals, research firm IHS Markit said. A8 sales in the core markets of Europe, China and the Americas may climb 3.2 percent to 35,571 cars by 2025 from 34,468 next year, IHS said.

Privately-held Rovio has struggled in recent years as profits from the Angry Birds franchise dropped, prompting deep job cuts and divestments. But last year Rovio launched an animated Angry Birds 3D Hollywood film that it said did well at the box office and yielded new licensing deals. Our business is profitably growing, and the time has come for us to grow in numbers too, said Antti Viitanen, head of Rovio's game studios. The company said it was looking to build a team of about 20 people in London to focus on massively multiplayer online games - like Supercell's Clash of Clans - with new intellectual property. Rovio currently has around 200 employees at its four game studios in Finland and Sweden, and about 400 people in total. The original Angry Birds game, in which players use a slingshot to attack pigs who steal the birds' eggs, remains the top paid mobile app of all time, and Rovio exploited the brand early on by licensing its use on a string of consumer products. But with no new hit games, profits dropped and Rovio slashed more than 300 jobs in 2014 and 2015. In the first half of 2016, Rovio booked a small operating profit, compared with a loss a year earlier.    (Reporting by Jussi Rosendahl; Editing by Greg Mahlich)"

The KEYone combines a touch display with a physical keyboard to give users more useable space for typing than a typical 5.5-inch all-touch smartphone, along with BlackBerry Ltd's security and software, TCL said.     TCL cut the new brand-licensing deal in December with BlackBerry Ltd., which now focuses on making the security software that was another key factor underpinning the Canadian company's phenomenal success in the pre-smartphone era and sustained it with corporate users as the world moved on to smartphones with other features.     The partnership helps address weaknesses for both companies: TCL gives BlackBerry a manufacturer that can still compete at global scale following a decade-long slide in BlackBerry sales, while TCL gains a new brand to shore up its own flagging growth in smartphones.     We have worked closely with TCL to build security and the BlackBerry experience into every layer of KEYone, so the BlackBerry DNA remains very much in place, said Alex Thurber, general manager of BlackBerry Ltd's Mobility Solutions unit.     The new BlackBerry KEYone smartphone was unveiled here ahead of the Mobile World Congress, Europe's largest annual trade fair, on Saturday.     The first fruits of TCL's new product line carries a hefty price tag, which could limit its appeal to diehard fans of the device once known as the Crackberry.      TCL Communcation's CEO Nicolas Zibell presents the new BlackBerry Key One before the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain February 25, 2017.Albert GeaThe KEYone will be available in April and priced around 599 euros, $549 or 499 pounds, in line with premium phones from Apple (AAPL.O), Samsung (005930.KS) and Huawei [HWT.UL]. TCL, which sells its phones in 160 countries, did not specify which would be first to offer the KEYone.     TCL is best known as the maker of Alcatel handsets and ranked as the world's No. 7 phone maker, according to recent data from research group IDC.      TCL Communication's CEO Nicolas Zibell and Kevin Michaluk present the new BlackBerry Key One before the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain February 25, 2017.Albert GeaIt is the third-largest maker of simpler, so-called feature phones popular in Latin America and emerging markets, according to market research firm Strategy Analytics.     TCL has acted as contract manufacturer for earlier BlackBerry devices but now licenses the phone brand and gives the Canadian company a cut of each handset sold.     The device runs Android 7.1 – giving users access to the Google Play store and apps - and receives Google (GOOGL.O) security patch updates, which many Android smartphones lack.     It also runs the BBM secure-messaging system, which BlackBerry earlier this month said it would make available for software developers to build into their own products.

The service, called NBC Left Field, is producing short  documentaries and features for Alphabet Inc's YouTube, Facebook and Instagram with the intention of eventually running ads.  News organizations like NBC News are under pressure to find  ways to draw younger viewers who are increasingly turning to YouTube and Facebook instead of television. Only 8 percent of viewers of national broadcast television news in 2016 were in the 18-34 age bracket, according to Nielsen. It’s my belief that broadcasters need to begin viewing these hubs as digital cities, said Matt Danzico, head of NBC Left Field. So in the same way that it’s clearly important NBC have local bureaus to serve news and information for, about and within the actual cities their audiences live, it’s now imperative that we exist within these digital municipalities. Left Field has hired 10 full-time journalists with broad  backgrounds, such as a former photographer and cinematographer who worked in the Middle East and a fiction writer. They will work from an office in downtown New York, away from the  headquarters. While initially the videos will not have ads, NBC News is looking at different formats for advertising, including branded content, said Nick Ascheim, head of digital at NBC News.  Left Field will have an international focus with the aim of attracting a global audience. For example, one of its first segments is about asylum squatters in Amsterdam. Another video is about a Swedish museum of failed gadgets. NBC News is not the first news outlet to launch a digital video service. In 2015, CNN launched Great Big Story, which  has 128 million multi-platform video views every month, according to CNN. The average viewer is 28. Unlike TV, where NBC News competes with other  broadcasters, Left Field will go head-to-head with all news organizations on social media, which include newspapers, start-ups and cable networks.  NBC recognizes that news organizations need to innovate and experiment and it's very hard to do inside their traditional formats, said Andrew Heyward, the former head of CBS News and  a visiting researcher at MIT Media Lab. The challenge is to figure out ways to create distinctive value. Reporting by Jessica Toonkel; Editing by Dan Grebler"

Then, the company shocked Wall Street on Tuesday with a big drop in holiday-quarter sales growth and issued a glum forecast  for the year, as it grapples with excess inventory amid a glut in the broader athleisure market. Now, analysts say, a roughly 15 percent growth rate could be the new normal for Under Armour. This is the first time since Under Armour has been a public company where sales guidance clearly missed the consensus and a sign it is no longer able to find enough growth in new channels to offset weakness in its core business, Morgan Stanley analyst Jay Sole wrote in a note dated Jan 31. Under Armour ended the year with inventories that were 17 percent higher the year before and analysts said the company's margins would be hit through 2017 as it discounts to get rid of old stock. Inventory problems aside, Under Armour is contending with a host of other issues. While the biggest concern is that the company lacks a true fashion line, Under Armour is also struggling with intensifying competition from Nike Inc and Adidas AG, which have stepped up discounts. The company's Class A shares have lost more than half their market value over the past 12 quarters, including a 23.4 percent decline on Jan 31. Under Armour's problems have been compounded in an industry already reeling from the bankruptcies of big footwear retail chains The Sports Authority and Sport Chalet, which have disrupted distribution channels. To be sure, the Under Armour brand is still a powerful one. It was the No. 2 sportswear brand in the United States for two years, before being recently displaced by Adidas, according to market research firm NPD. Under Armour has also successfully expanded into new categories including sportwear for kids and outdoor products, and signed deals with Major League Baseball, high profile athletes, and  professional teams. Not Too Cool for School Under Armour focuses on selling shoes and apparel that are solely meant for improving sports performance rather than as a fashion accessory, while Adidas and Nike have much broader ranges of fashion offerings. But in the United States, three-quarters of all sports shoes are not used for sports, according to market research firm NPD. For example, Under Armour's Curry shoes are made for on-court performances, unlike Nike's Air Jordans that have become the stuff of fashion lore. Under Armour Chief Executive Kevin Plank himself admitted on the company's earnings call on Tuesday that it needed to become more fashionable at a time when consumers were spoilt for choice. Under Armour is great on the field but is yet to be too-cool-for-school, Susquehanna Financial analyst Sam Poser said. The company has said it will invest aggressively in its premium Under Armour Sportswear business, under which it sells button down shirts, bomber jackets and parkas at high-end stores such as Barneys. It is also looking to expand its top brands to more retailers, much like its new deal with department store operator Kohl's Corp to sell its products in more than 1,100 stores. Analysts, however, don't expect its fledgling fashion business to take off anytime soon. They are going to be moving gradually towards more fashion products ... and I expect we'll see the ramp up a little bit and maybe see some less dependence on the basics, NPD analyst Matt Powell said. But I don't expect a dramatic shift to their high-fashion overnight. Reporting by Gayathree Ganesan and Siddharth Cavale in

At soleRebels, which employs around 420 people, workers on average earn four to five times the Ethiopian minimum wage, according to the brand's website. It is the only footwear company to be certified by the World Fair Trade Organization, the site notes. What I want to see happen is that, in my company, people who are coming to work are able to go to school, are able to support their family, are able to live the life they wanted, Bethlehem said in a phone interview from Copenhagen, where she was speaking at the Global Green Growth Forum this week.  Her aim has been to turn Ethiopian tradition into an international green brand - a challenge she has risen to with energy and enthusiasm, setting up an online shop and soleRebels stores from Taiwan to Silicon Valley and Greece.  This fiscal year, the company expects revenue of $10 million to $12 million. It says it is on track to become the first global retail chain from a developing nation to open 100 stores, and achieve over $200 million in revenues by 2019. Yet despite her ambition, Bethlehem - who has won several international business awards and is a World Economic Forum Young Global Leader - isn't focused primarily on profits. In her eyes, the value of her business lies in bringing Ethiopian craftsmanship to the international market in a way that preserves culture, benefits local people and protects the environment. There is no carbon footprint in our product, said Bethlehem, noting that the shoes are crafted entirely by hand, with each pair touched by some 30 workers.  Shipping overseas produces some climate-changing emissions, but packaging is made from recycled cartons and the shoes are sold in hand-loomed cotton bags. The company says it also comes close to its goal of zero waste, using as many recycled materials as it can. That begins with the old tyres cut up to make shoe soles, a technique used for decades in Ethiopia's selate and barabasso shoes, said to have been worn by rebels fighting for independence.   Setting a Sustainable Example The Ethiopian government has put in place policies and regulations to meet its goal of becoming a middle-income, carbon-neutral country by 2025, Bethlehem said.  For example, it is setting up green industrial parks powered by renewable energy, while factories are treating water and waste, she added. But ethical companies like hers remain a niche business, she admitted, and the task now is to influence young Ethiopian entrepreneurs to adopt a similar model. If I put up a sustainable way of working, a sustainable lifestyle brand, then people will aspire to follow that lead, she said, noting the need to create jobs in a populous country with many young people. The majority of Ethiopians still have a lot to learn about the impacts of climate change and how to fight it, but awareness is building among the expanding middle class in cities like Addis Ababa, Bethlehem said. It's something she has witnessed in the rising number of local people visiting her stores there. The Horn of Africa country is at a very exciting time in its development, she said. But it is also a scary time as the country determines whether it can achieve a more sustainable model of development than rich industrialized nations whose past pollution is largely responsible for heating up the planet.  One barrier may be finding investors prepared to put money into ethical African companies on a scale large enough to make a fundamental economic difference. When it comes to... investments in Ethiopia, they don't choose my way of working because it's not fast, the profit margin is small, and the way it grows - with awareness - takes time, Bethlehem said.  But the businesswoman, who is also expanding into luxury leather wear, coffee and consulting services, remains optimistic that the soleRebels ethos of training workers and paying them well can help beat poverty in a country where more than 10 million need food aid amid a severe drought.

The Gothenburg-based company will continue to produce pure combustion-engine Volvos from models launched before that date, but said it would introduce cars across its model line-up that ranged from fully electric cars to plug-in hybrids. Volvo's plans make it the first major traditional automaker to set a date for the complete phase-out of combustion-engine-only models though electrification has long been a buzzword across the industry and Elon Musk's Tesla Motors has been a pure-play battery carmaker from day one. This announcement marks the end of the solely combustion engine-powered car, Volvo Cars Chief Executive Hakan Samuelsson said in a statement. Five new models set to be launched in 2019 through 2021 - three of them Volvos and two Polestar-branded - will all be fully electric. These five cars will be supplemented by a range of petrol and diesel plug in hybrid and mild hybrid 48-volt options on all models, Volvo said. This means that there will in future be no Volvo cars without an electric motor. Volvo has invested heavily in new models and plants since being bought by Zhejiang Geely Holding Group from Ford Motor Co. in 2010, establishing a niche in a premium auto market dominated by larger rivals such as Daimler's Mercedes-Benz and BMW. Part of its strategy has also been to embrace emerging technologies which allow higher performance electric vehicles as well as, eventually, self-driving cars. Only last month, Volvo said it would reshape its Polestar business into a standalone brand, focused on high-performance electric cars aimed at competing with Tesla and the Mercedes AMG division. Volvo has also taken steps towards an eventual listing, raising 5 billion crowns from Swedish institutional investors through the sale of newly issued preference shares last year, though the company has said no decision on an IPO has been made.

The service, called NBC Left Field, is producing short  documentaries and features for Alphabet Inc's YouTube, Facebook and Instagram with the intention of eventually running ads.  News organizations like NBC News are under pressure to find  ways to draw younger viewers who are increasingly turning to YouTube and Facebook instead of television. Only 8 percent of viewers of national broadcast television news in 2016 were in the 18-34 age bracket, according to Nielsen. It’s my belief that broadcasters need to begin viewing these hubs as digital cities, said Matt Danzico, head of NBC Left Field. So in the same way that it’s clearly important NBC have local bureaus to serve news and information for, about and within the actual cities their audiences live, it’s now imperative that we exist within these digital municipalities. Left Field has hired 10 full-time journalists with broad  backgrounds, such as a former photographer and cinematographer who worked in the Middle East and a fiction writer. They will work from an office in downtown New York, away from the  headquarters. While initially the videos will not have ads, NBC News is looking at different formats for advertising, including branded content, said Nick Ascheim, head of digital at NBC News.  Left Field will have an international focus with the aim of attracting a global audience. For example, one of its first segments is about asylum squatters in Amsterdam. Another video is about a Swedish museum of failed gadgets. NBC News is not the first news outlet to launch a digital video service. In 2015, CNN launched Great Big Story, which  has 128 million multi-platform video views every month, according to CNN. The average viewer is 28. Unlike TV, where NBC News competes with other  broadcasters, Left Field will go head-to-head with all news organizations on social media, which include newspapers, start-ups and cable networks.  NBC recognizes that news organizations need to innovate and experiment and it's very hard to do inside their traditional formats, said Andrew Heyward, the former head of CBS News and  a visiting researcher at MIT Media Lab. The challenge is to figure out ways to create distinctive value. Reporting by Jessica Toonkel; Editing by Dan Grebler"

The Melbourne-based company said it sold 12 U.S. wine brands and raised its annual profit guidance following its purchase of Diageo Plc assets earlier this year. Shares in Treasury gained as much as 4.4 percent on the news, their largest percentage gain since early April, as investors cheered signs of progress in its U.S. strategy. The stock price is nearly double the size of a takeover offer it rejected in 2014, boosted mainly by strong sales in China. We've been waiting with our eyes peeled for this sort of announcement. We've been expecting them to streamline their portfolio, said Ben Le Brun, an analyst at trading house OptionsXpress in Sydney. The owner of Penfolds and Lindemans labels said in a statement that the non-core portfolio of brands comprising about 1 million cases of wine were sold at about book value, without elaborating. The divestment will have nil impact on earnings in F16 and beyond, the statement added. A company spokeswoman declined to comment on a sale price or a buyer. The sale comes as Chief Executive Michael Clarke reorganises the company's U.S. strategy following a disastrous attempt to crack the mass market there in 2013, when it was forced to pour millions of litres of wine down the drain. This led to a new focus on more upmarket brands which saw U.S. sales rebound this financial year. Treasury also said it expected to deliver earnings before interest and tax of between A$330 million ($246.4 million) and A$340 million in FY16. It had previously guided for earnings of A$270 million to A$290 million, although that forecast did not include profits from the acquisition of Diageo's assets. The depreciation of the pound following the Brexit vote would not have a material impact on earnings expectations, it said. $1 = 1.3394 Australian dollars

Crews from Britain, France, Japan, New Zealand and Sweden are seeking to win the right to challenge Oracle Team USA next month, with Oracle chairman Larry Ellison's team looking to win the oldest trophy in international sport, known as the Auld Mug, for a third time in a row. New Zealand, who lost in 2013 after the Americans staged a stunning comeback in San Francisco, are already sponsored by airline Emirates [EMIRA.UL], Japanese carmaker Toyota, Swiss watchmaker Omega and coffee group Nespresso. The sponsors' branding adorns the hulls of the team's high-tech 50-foot black and red foiling catamaran and its towering wing sail, which are controlled using hydraulics.  New Zealand have set themselves apart by incorporating fixed cycles in their design, meaning the crew sits and pedals to power the hydraulics rather than grinding hand winches.

Four years on, the F1 boss appears to be frustrated again as  he tries to keep one of the most glamorous races on the calendar after the contract expires in 2017, at a time when the city-state is weighing whether the event makes economic sense anymore. With its tourism industry increasingly diversified, a stronger country brand than when it first hosted the event in 2008 and other major sporting events in the bag, Singapore seems to have the upper hand in the talks with F1. Moreover, Ecclestone and F1's new owners, U.S. cable TV mogul John Malone's Liberty Media, face a new risk: with Malaysia pulling out of a new deal, they could altogether lose their presence in Southeast Asia, one of the world's fastest-growing regions. F1's 86-year-old commercial supremo first told German magazine Auto Motor und Sport that Singapore does not want to host F1 anymore, then clarified he did not want to lose Singapore. His comments suggest talks getting tougher. I think Singapore has come in and negotiated hard and has realized they are in a position of strength to do so, said James Walton, head of the Sports Business service line at Deloitte Singapore and Southeast Asia. This is one of the top ranked grand prix ... and one of the markets that the key sponsors of F1 are most interested in. Singapore's government funds 60 percent of the S$150 million ($105.13 million) it costs to host the race each year. Analysts say the city-state is weighing the costs, and benefits, of staging the event in the future.   Singapore GP, the event's organizer, said it would not comment on ongoing commercial negotiations. A decision is expected before year-end, Ecclestone has said. The Singapore race is one of the most popular, taking place at night on a street circuit with spectators entertained by music acts such as Beyonce and Justin Bieber, while TV watchers get a bird's-eye view of the glitzy skyline. As a top wealth management hub, the city-state is a natural draw for the region's affluent people, a key target of Formula One sponsors such as Hugo Boss and Tag Heuer, a luxury LVMH brand. An aerial view shows the illuminated Marina Bay street circuit of the Singapore Formula One Grand Prix at dusk in Singapore September 20, 2010.   Picture taken with a fish-eye lens.Edgar Su/File PhotoBut the significance of that is bigger for Ecclestone than for Singapore, which also hosts events such as the WTA women's tennis Finals and the Rugby 7s series that bring over 100,000 visitors each. While the F1 initially played an important role in boosting the tourism industry, Singapore has diversified its offering, now focusing on the emerging middle classes from China, India and Indonesia. Tourism is actually a bright spot in a slowing economy. In the first eight months of this year, before this September's F1 race, the number of visitors was up 10.3 percent from the same 2015 period, at 11.3 million. Tourism receipts grew 12 percent to S$11.6 billion ($8.1 billion) in the first half of 2016. Slideshow (2 Images)Rewards To be sure, Singapore has benefited from hosting F1. Since the 2008 debut race, the event has generated S$150 million in tourism receipts every year on average, except for 2009 at the height of the global financial crisis.  But about 80 percent of the spending gets recycled into the economy, with local firms hired for circuit set-up, ticketing and security, the Singapore Tourism Board says. In these economic times, every order book is important and I believe this is not a small order book, said Kurt Wee, President of the Association of Small & Medium Enterprises. He added though that everybody would understand that the event has to be sustainable. And that is where Singapore has another argument. Attendance, which topped 100,000 on all three days in the first year, has declined, with this year's race averaging 73,000 spectators for each day, down from 87,000 in 2015. With the global economy slowing, the numbers might fall further and a five-year commitment may not be so appealing, although this may be offset in the future by Malaysia pulling out as F1 fans in the region would have only one nearby option. If you think of the government as a business, I think they have to manage their funds prudently to get the most bang for their buck, said ANZ economist Weiwen Ng.

The KEYone combines a touch display with a physical keyboard to give users more useable space for typing than a typical 5.5-inch all-touch smartphone, along with BlackBerry Ltd's security and software, TCL said.     TCL cut the new brand-licensing deal in December with BlackBerry Ltd., which now focuses on making the security software that was another key factor underpinning the Canadian company's phenomenal success in the pre-smartphone era and sustained it with corporate users as the world moved on to smartphones with other features.     The partnership helps address weaknesses for both companies: TCL gives BlackBerry a manufacturer that can still compete at global scale following a decade-long slide in BlackBerry sales, while TCL gains a new brand to shore up its own flagging growth in smartphones.     We have worked closely with TCL to build security and the BlackBerry experience into every layer of KEYone, so the BlackBerry DNA remains very much in place, said Alex Thurber, general manager of BlackBerry Ltd's Mobility Solutions unit.     The new BlackBerry KEYone smartphone was unveiled here ahead of the Mobile World Congress, Europe's largest annual trade fair, on Saturday.

TCL Communcation's CEO Nicolas Zibell presents the new BlackBerry Key One before the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain February 25, 2017.Albert GeaThe KEYone will be available in April and priced around 599 euros, $549 or 499 pounds, in line with premium phones from Apple (AAPL.O), Samsung (005930.KS) and Huawei [HWT.UL]. TCL, which sells its phones in 160 countries, did not specify which would be first to offer the KEYone.     TCL is best known as the maker of Alcatel handsets and ranked as the world's No. 7 phone maker, according to recent data from research group IDC.      TCL Communication's CEO Nicolas Zibell and Kevin Michaluk present the new BlackBerry Key One before the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain February 25, 2017.Albert GeaIt is the third-largest maker of simpler, so-called feature phones popular in Latin America and emerging markets, according to market research firm Strategy Analytics.     TCL has acted as contract manufacturer for earlier BlackBerry devices but now licenses the phone brand and gives the Canadian company a cut of each handset sold.     The device runs Android 7.1 – giving users access to the Google Play store and apps - and receives Google (GOOGL.O) security patch updates, which many Android smartphones lack.     It also runs the BBM secure-messaging system, which BlackBerry earlier this month said it would make available for software developers to build into their own products.        With an aluminum frame and textured backing, the device sports two cameras - 12 megapixels in the rear and eight in front - and a scratch-resistant 4.5-inch screen display.

Crews from Britain, France, Japan, New Zealand and Sweden are seeking to win the right to challenge Oracle Team USA next month, with Oracle chairman Larry Ellison's team looking to win the oldest trophy in international sport, known as the Auld Mug, for a third time in a row. New Zealand, who lost in 2013 after the Americans staged a stunning comeback in San Francisco, are already sponsored by airline Emirates [EMIRA.UL], Japanese carmaker Toyota, Swiss watchmaker Omega and coffee group Nespresso. The sponsors' branding adorns the hulls of the team's high-tech 50-foot black and red foiling catamaran and its towering wing sail, which are controlled using hydraulics.  New Zealand have set themselves apart by incorporating fixed cycles in their design, meaning the crew sits and pedals to power the hydraulics rather than grinding hand winches.   Pirelli and New Zealand said the tire maker's distinctive red and yellow logo will not only feature on the hull, but also on the rudders, which are visible when the catamaran's foils lift it dramatically out of the water in flight mode at speeds of up to 50 knots (92.6 km per hour).  Qualifying racing begins in Bermuda on May 26, with the head-to-head races for the America's Cup between whichever crew emerges as challenger and defender Team USA starting on June 17.

The cautionary note from the watchdog on pre-election polling followed allegations in February by aides of centrist candidate Emmanuel Macron that he was a target of fake news put out by Russian media including the Sputnik news agency. Macron takes a hard line on European Union sanctions imposed on Moscow over the Ukraine crisis, whereas Fillon has said they are totally ineffective, creating a cold war climate that needs to be reversed. Almost all media in France are drawing on polls that have shown since mid-February that Fillon, a former prime minister, is trailing in third place behind Macron and far right leader Marine Le Pen for the April 23 first round. Third place would mean Fillon's elimination from the May 7 runoff. State-run Sputnik carried different findings in a report on March 29 under the headline: 2017 presidential elections: the return of Fillon at the head of the polls. It quoted Moscow-based Brand Analytics, an online audience research firm, as saying that its study based on an analysis of French social media put Fillon out in front. In a statement, France's polling commission said the study could not be described as representative of public opinion and Sputnik had improperly called it a poll, as defined by law in France It is imperative that publication of this type of survey  be treated with caution so that public opinion is aware of its non-representative nature, it said. Brand Analytics' track record either for political polling or for commercial internet audience measurement outside of Russia and former Soviet territory is unknown.     Sputnik published an earlier online survey by the firm from mid-February which also showed Fillon with a strong lead over Macron and Le Pen at a time when other polls showed Macron’s candidacy beginning to surge with Fillon in third place. FILE PHOTO: Emmanuel Macron, head of the political movement En Marche !, or Onwards !, and candidate for the 2017 French presidential election, attends a campaign rally in Marseille, France, April 1, 2017.File PhotoNeither Sputnik in Moscow, nor the company, responded immediately to emailed requests for comment on Sunday.  u.s. Intelligence Warns     Richard Burr, head of the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee which is investigating the Russian hacking during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign, said last week that the Kremlin was trying to interfere in the French vote.   The Kremlin denied in February that it was behind media and internet attacks on Macron's campaign.

Fillon, once the frontrunner for the Elysee before he was hit by a scandal surrounding payments of public funds to his wife and children, dismissed as fantasy concerns of Russian interference in the election. Speaking last Friday, Fillon said he would seek a better balance in relations with a country that was nevertheless dangerous.    Richard Ferrand, the head of Macron's En Marche! (Onwards!) party, said in February that Sputnik and another Russian state-run outlet Russia Today were spreading 'fake news' with the aim of swinging public opinion against Macron. Russia Today, in a statement, said that it rejected any suggestion that it was part of spreading fake news in relation to Macron and the French election. In February, Sputnik announced it would publish weekly French election polls using representative sampling from three mainstream polling firms - IFOP, Ipsos and OpinionWay - alongside an analysis of social media posts in France from Brand Analytics for which it did not disclose its survey methodology.   Separately, Sputnik carried a news report last Friday about Macron supporters being awarded state decorations when he had been a high-level functionary at the Elysee and economy minister in the Socialist government, suggesting this could amount to influence peddling. It offered no proof that Macron had organized the decorations, which were sometimes awarded by other ministers. In several instances, it cited awards made by the economy ministry, without mentioning that Arnaud Montebourg, Macron's predecessor, was minister at the time. The Sputnik report contrasted Macron's alleged action with a judicial inquiry into an award made when Fillon was prime minister to a billionaire friend who owned a cultural magazine where Fillon's wife drew a salary.

The Co-op nearly collapsed in 2013 after a 1.5 billion-pound  ($1.9 billion) funding hole was found in its banking operation. But it has recovered under Chief Executive Richard Pennycook, aided by the shift in Britons' grocery shopping habits towards more frequent trips to smaller convenience stores. In September, Pennycook launched a new membership scheme targeting the recruitment of one million additional members and the handing back of more than 100 million pounds a year from 2018 to members and their local communities. Through the scheme, Co-op members receive a 5 percent reward for purchases they make on own-brand products and services, with a further 1 percent directly benefiting local causes. The mutual said underlying sales in its core convenience supermarket estate increased 4 percent year-on-year from Sept. 21 to Dec. 31, with total Co-op food like-for-like sales up 3.4 percent. The Co-op is Britain's fifth largest grocer with a 6 percent market share, trailing Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda and Morrisons. It said direct motor insurance sales increased 17 percent in the period year-on-year, while sales of pre-paid funeral plans were up 73 percent. The Co-op said the success of the membership scheme, with 400,000 new members in the four months since launch, had prompted it to accelerate its recruitment plans. The target for one million new members has been brought forward to the end of 2017. It currently has 4.1 million active members. Last week, Morrisons and Sainsbury's reported better than expected Christmas trading, while Tesco also reported solid numbers. $1 = 0.8123 pounds

Last week Munich prosecutors arrested an Audi employee in connection with dieselgate, the latest setback to Volkswagen's (VOWG_p.DE) luxury car arm and main profit driver, after the German government a month earlier had accused Audi of cheating on emissions tests. On Tuesday Audi shifted the focus back to its products with its top management hosting 2,000 guests in Barcelona to unveil the new A8, whose Level-3 self-driving technology enables the car to completely control driving at up to 60 kilometers (37 miles) per hour, beating the Mercedes S-Class and the BMW 7-Series. Having slipped behind its two German rivals on global sales last year, Audi has risked stalling without innovation and needed a new prestige product, said Stefan Bratzel, head of the Center of Automotive Management think-tank near Cologne. Innovation is key in premium car-making, Bratzel said. The new A8 will polish the brand's image and line-up at a critical time. Even Audi acknowledged that amid ongoing investigations, persistent pressure on its chief executive for his crisis management and analysts' criticism of Audi's ageing vehicle design, the new A8 creates an opportunity for a clean break. It's gratifying that we are able to set a positive sign for real 'Vorsprung durch Technik', advancement through technology, R&D; chief Peter Mertens said. Mercedes and BMW have accelerated their autonomous-driving development programs with Mercedes owner Daimler joining forces with car parts maker Robert Bosch [ROBG.UL] in April and BMW collaborating with other firms including U.S. parts maker Delphi and chipmaker Intel. Audi Chief Executive Rupert Stadler presents the new Audi A8 at the Audi Summit in Barcelona, Spain July 11, 2017.Albert GeaFeaturing a more distinctive design and a foot massager for rear-seat passengers, the new A8 heralds the start of a series of redesigns and new model launches at Audi including an electric sport-utility vehicle (SUV) to take on Tesla's Model X, the all-new Q4 and Q8 SUVs and redesigned A6 and A7 model lines. A source at Audi said development of the A8, which took about five years, suffered from changes at the brand's research and development department, though assiduous work by division heads helped ensure that delays were kept in check. The A8 will reach German dealerships in the fourth quarter. Slideshow (21 Images)Audi is on its third development chief since dieselgate broke in late 2015, with Mertens, who took office in May, the brand's fifth R&D; boss since 2012. The top brass at VW group and Audi are so preoccupied with the diesel issue that the company's management is lastingly distracted, said Christian Strenger, a supervisory board member at Deutsche Bank's retail asset management arm DWS. With the new A8's retail price up almost 8 percent on its  predecessor at 90,600 euros ($103,000), Audi will also struggle to narrow the gap with its traditional rivals, research firm IHS Markit said. A8 sales in the core markets of Europe, China and the Americas may climb 3.2 percent to 35,571 cars by 2025 from 34,468 next year, IHS said. By comparison, IHS expects deliveries of BMW's 7-Series to fall 7.6 percent to 52,238 cars by 2025 and deliveries of Mercedes' S-Class to jump 24 percent to 85,389 cars. S-Class and 7-Series prices start at 88,447 euros and 78,100 euros respectively, according to company data. Editing by Greg Mahlich"

Alibaba will provide end-to-end solutions including logistics, payment, and localization support catering to each local market's needs, the statement said. The firm plans on extending the Tmall World network to other countries in the future.     Alibaba has invested heavily in Southeast Asia, seeking to meet lofty user acquisition goals as the Chinese retail market shows signs of maturing.      Alibaba chairman Jack Ma told investors on Friday the company is aiming to have 2 billion customers within 15 years, with overseas customers accounting for 1.2 billion of those users.  Alibaba had roughly 450 million active annual buyers on its China marketplaces in the year ended March 31.      In 2016 it agreed to invest $1 billion in Southeast Asian retailer Lazada Group, and launching a service that allows local users to purchase a selection of Tmall goods.     The latest sales channels take aim at the 100 million Chinese citizens living overseas, and users must have an active Chinese payment method to purchase goods.      It comes as Alibaba payment affiliate Ant Financial is also expanding heavily in the region through investments and joint ventures.      In the past year the finance firm has sealed deals in Thailand, Indonesia, South Korea, Hong Kong and India, as well as rebranding Lazada Group's payment arm Hello Pay under Ant Financial's own Alipay brand.     It also comes as rival Chinese e-commerce firm JD.com Inc (JD.O) is expanding operations in Southeast Asia.

VW Group of America Chief Executive Officer Hinrich Woebcken told reporters at the New York auto show that the automaker planned to build a five-seat SUV in Tennessee, but he declined to say when production would begin. The news follows VW's 2014 announcement that the company would spent $900 million to build a new SUV in Tennessee. VW, the largest automaker worldwide by sales, will start selling its new seven-seat VW Atlas SUV next month. Woebcken said VW was shifting focus in the United States from a mainly car brand to a family friendly automaker offering larger, U.S.-built SUVs. At the show, major automakers said they expected the popularity of SUVs to increase in the United States. SUVs' share of U.S. vehicle sales rose to nearly 40 percent in 2016 from 32.6 percent in 2014.  Woebcken would not say whether VW would add additional workers in Tennessee to build the new SUV. VW will sell four separate SUVs in the United States later this year, a figure that does not include the new one. The company said on Tuesday that it would continue selling the current Tiguan as the Tiguan Limited for several years even as it plans to offer a completely new, larger version later this year. The company also announced it was offering an industry-leading six-year, 72,000 mile warranty on its new SUVs. As part of its diesel emissions settlement, Volkswagen has  agreed to add at least three additional electric vehicles, including an SUV, in California by 2020 and must sell an average of 5,000 electric vehicles annually there through 2025. Woebcken said he hopes that decision will help boost the company's image in the United States. VW has agreed to spend up to $25 billion to buy back vehicles and resolve claims from U.S. regulators, dealers, owners and states.

BT has come under fire from regulator Ofcom after rivals including Sky, TalkTalk and Vodafone accused it of delivering a poor service, under investing in the network and running it to serve BT's bottom line rather than the interests of the country. On Friday BT said it had agreed to legally separate its broadband unit, Openreach, moving 32,000 staff into the new company, which will have its own brand without the BT logo. BT has agreed to all of the changes needed to address Ofcom's competition concerns, Ofcom said in a separate statement. As a result, Ofcom will no longer need to impose these changes through regulation. The reforms have been designed to begin this year.   (Reporting by Kate Holton, editing by James Davey)"

The Volkswagen-owned brand last month reported a 37 percent plunge in operating profit after it raised provisions to help meet the cost of the group's diesel emissions test-cheating scandal. Audi said on Tuesday it would start building a full-sized Q8 SUV at a Volkswagen (VW) factory in Bratislava, Slovakia, next year and in 2019 add the Q4 SUV in Gyor, Hungary.

We are integrating two completely new Q models into the existing production network and are raising our competitiveness in an extremely important segment, Audi production chief Hubert Waltl said. Audi's efforts to raise margins with the new vehicles will be helped by low production costs at the chosen sites.

Audi's works council declined to comment when asked why German sites in Ingolstadt and Neckarsulm were not awarded the work.  The works council last year secured a pledge from management to protect jobs in Germany until 2020 and is currently in talks with executives to further extend that guarantee, a source familiar with the matter said.

The newspaper publisher's shares rose as much as 12 percent on Wednesday. The company added 308,000 net digital news subscriptions in the quarter, topping the previous quarter's tally of 276,000. The Times has been building up on the online readership it gained during the U.S. presidential election by marketing unbiased reporting in the face of President Donald Trump's combative view of traditional news media. Trump has repeatedly criticized the press, including the Times, calling it fake news and the enemy of the American People! In response, the New York Times launched its Truth campaign, including its first TV ad in seven years, urging readers to sign up in order to support its fair and accurate reporting. Even the President of the United States was kind enough to draw attention to it, Chief Executive Mark Thompson said on a post-earnings call with analysts on Wednesday, referring to the campaign. New York Times' paid digital-only subscriptions stood at about 2.2 million at the end of the first quarter of 2017, soaring more than 60 percent from a year earlier, and up 16 percent from the end of the preceding quarter. Thompson called the first quarter the single best quarter for subscriber growth in the company's history. Total revenue rose to 5.1 percent to $398.8 million, beating the average analyst estimate of $381.96 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Helped by tailwinds from the political cycle, digital has been increasingly offsetting the secular declines at the legacy print business, Barclays analysts wrote in a client note. Digital advertising revenue, which now makes up about 38 pct of total ad revenue, rose 18.9 percent to $49.7 million. Print advertising revenue continued to fall, down 17.9 percent to $80.4 million in the first quarter. The Times has been investing heavily to boost its digital offerings that focus on mobile devices and brand marketing as well as other services to lure readers. Operating costs rose 4.5 percent to $367.4 million in the first quarter. It has taken up cost-cutting measures, including layoffs and shutting some Paris operations. Net income attributable to the company was $13.2 million or 8 cents per share, compared with a loss of $8.3 million or 5 cents per share, a year earlier.

The company said demand for breakfast items was led by GranDDe Burrito, which was launched as an all-day breakfast item at all Dunkin' Donuts outlets at the end of February.  Franchisees have cited the GranDDe Burrito - a $3.99 burrito with a spicy omelet - as one of the most successful promotions in Dunkin's recent history, Credit Suisse analyst Jason West wrote in a pre-earnings note. The company also said it will offer members of its DD Perks loyalty program in the Metropolitan New York area an option to order and pay in advance through its mobile app from mid-May. Sales at established U.S. Dunkin' Donuts outlets, which account for three quarters of total revenue, rose 2 percent in the first quarter ended March 26. Same-store sales at U.S. Baskin-Robbins ice cream shops were up 5 percent. Sales at U.S. stores open for at least 18 months were expected to rise 0.1 percent at Dunkin' Donuts and 2.3 percent at Baskin-Robbins, according to analysts polled by Consensus Metrix.

A third source said the Trump Organization already has agreed to a settlement that will see it walk away from its branding and management deal for the 65-story hotel and condo tower in the financial district of Canada's largest city. It could still take four to six weeks to close the deal to rebrand the Trump International Hotel & Tower, one of the sources said, while another said it could close in two weeks. There are a number of hotel groups circling for the management, said one of the sources. The sources, who declined to say how much the deals were worth, spoke on condition of anonymity because the privately held talks are confidential. Trump, whose business connections were the subject of two lawsuits filed by members of Congress and Maryland and District of Columbia officials this week, has never owned the project. The building was developed by Talon International Inc, which later defaulted on a construction loan, and the property was bought in a court-run sale by JCF Capital ULC earlier this year. That sale included 211 hotel units, 74 residential units and most of the commercial, retail and amenity space in the property.  Representatives of the Trump Organization have previously said they would resist any efforts to cut short the company's long-term contract. Trump Organization representatives were not immediately available for comment on Friday. Bloomberg earlier reported that interested parties include Marriott's St. Regis, Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc's Waldorf Astoria and Mandarin Oriental International Inc. Since its opening in 2012, Talon had sold less than half of the tower's residential condos and the hotel's occupancy rates have been lower than some investors in the rooms had hoped. A court last year ordered Talon to pay damages to one buyer of a unit in the tower for negligent misrepresentation and another sale was ordered rescinded. A partner with JCF Capital could not immediately be reached for comment on Friday but declined to comment earlier this week when asked about rebranding the hotel. Trump had been pressed to distance himself from his global business before becoming president in January. He said he would maintain ownership while turning over control to his two adult sons. Critics said he still would have conflicts of interests under that arrangement and this week more than 190 Democratic lawmakers sued him, saying he had accepted funds from foreign governments through his businesses in violation of the U.S. Constitution. The attorneys general of Maryland and the District of Columbia also filed a lawsuit this week claiming that government payments to Trump's businesses violate the Constitution.

The appointment is the second executive change at Adidas since activist shareholders bought stakes in the company in 2015 after its shares had tumbled following a series of profit warnings as it failed to keep pace with U.S. rival Nike (NKE.N). The stock's value has since almost tripled as the firm has hiked marketing spending, helping sales in the U.S. market. Hainer was replaced as chief executive in October by Kaspar Rorsted, the Danish former chief of consumer goods group Henkel (HNKG_p.DE), prompting speculation among investors that Stalker, 59, might be the next to go. Ohlmeyer, a 49-year-old German, joined the company in 1998, holding roles including head of finance for the core Adidas brand and finance chief for the firm's golf business, before taking over as ecommerce chief in 2011. Adidas supervisory board Chairman Igor Landau said in a statement that Ohlmeyer had played a key role in efforts to make Adidas more digital, increasing ecommerce sales to 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion). Rorsted is due to set out his strategy on Wednesday when Adidas posts results for 2016. He has already said that the U.S. market and digitalization will be top priorities as he seeks to build on a five-year plan launched in 2015 by Hainer.

The company, one of Europe's most Russia-exposed firms due to its large tyre plant near St Petersburgh, lost CEO Ari Lehtoranta to smaller Finnish firm Caverion last year, creating uncertainty about its future. Korhonen has been a board member at Nokian since 2006. She currently works as CEO of Finland's national alcoholic beverage retail monopoly Alko. We conducted an extensive international recruitment process ... Hille Korhonen brings extensive leadership experience and excellent brand expertise to this position”, Chairman Petteri Wallden said in a statement. Korhonen will start as CEO in June. Nokian's sales were hit by the Ukraine crisis, a slowdown in the Russian economy and a weakening of the rouble, but it has managed to offset lost business by growing in North America and central Europe. The company is expecting moderate growth in Russia this year, saying its key market is showing signs of stabilising. It's a good, neutral choice. The company is in good shape, and she's likely to continue in Lehtoranta's footsteps, said Sauli Vilen, an analyst at Inderes Equity Research. As a board member she knows the company well, but the question is, what new she has to offer, added Vilen, who has a 'reduce' recommendation on the shares. The stock was broadly flat in afternoon trading in Helsinki. Nokian appointed the head of its Russian operations, Andrei Pantioukhov, as interim CEO in December, but said he was not considered for the role permanently.

The Accion Frontier Inclusion Fund will focus on companies that provide financial services such as alternative credit, payments, insurance and small and medium enterprise finance, Accion and Quona said in a joint statement on Sunday. Managed by Quona Capital, the fund will invest in startups that target emerging markets in sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America and Asia. The advent of the fund comes as a growing number of young companies seek to take advantage of new technologies to make it cheaper and easier to serve the three billion people globally who have limited or no access to mainstream financial services, such as savings, insurance, lending or payments. Over the past few years many have come to believe that technologies ranging from mobile banking solutions to credit scoring tools that use alternative sources of data, can play a game-changing role in helping individuals and businesses gain financial access where established financial institutions have not had a strong foothold. If you can use alternative sources of data to make the 3 billion of people who are invisible, become visible, that could change the world, said Michael Schlein, CEO and president of Accion. The fund has invested in eight companies to-date including  Konfio, a company that uses data analytics to offer working capital loans to micro-businesses in Mexico. It has also backed Yoco, a South African payments company that is seeking to expand acceptance of digital payments in Africa. There is an enormous marketplace of consumers and small and medium enterprises that are experiencing tremendous pain points even in basic things, said Monica Brand Engel, a founding partner at Quona Capital.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/starbucks-premium-idUSL1N1E203Y","RPT-Starbucks courts millennials with $10 coffee at new Reserve bars","","December 7, 2016 /  12:03 PM / 8 months ago","","LOS ANGELES/NEW YORK, Dec 6 (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp  co-founder Howard Schultz's plan to build a new prestige brand is a bet that moving upscale can raise the profile of the world's largest coffee brand with millennials like Megan Sauers. Schultz in April will step down as chief executive to focus on building 1,000 new Reserve brand stores. Over time there also will be as many as 30 large, showcase Reserve Roastery and Tasting Rooms in major cities around the world. Starbucks last week announced that Schultz was moving into the role of executive chairman in April to focus on the project. Analysts expect more details at a meeting in New York on Wednesday. The transition marks a turning point for Starbucks, which introduced millions of people around the world to higher quality coffee and espresso drinks and now must find a way to avoid being labeled pedestrian when compared with upscale rivals like Blue Bottle and Intelligentsia, which are popping up in U.S. cities. Starbucks is the millennials' parents' coffee house and Starbucks is acutely aware of that, said Ric Rhinehart, executive director of the Specialty Coffee Association of America. Starbucks' Reserve projects are a reminder that they did this first and they do this best, said AB Bernstein analyst Sara Senatore. The company already has added Reserve bars to a handful of Starbucks shops in major cities including New York. Reuters visited one such cafe on Manhattan's Upper East Side, which offered $10 cups of coffee made in glass siphons, $10 flights of Reserve brews and nitro cold brew via a separate Reserve menu. Twenty-four-year-old Sauers came in for her standard Starbucks caffeine jolt and discovered the new brand. I'd probably just stick to the regular, I'm not too picky, said Sauer, a recent transplant from Ohio. But she showed the kind of aspiration that Starbucks seeks. If I had the money to spend more towards coffee I'd do it, she said, calling the Reserve bar a great idea for the neighborhood. I think people want it, too. Reserve stores will exclusively sell and serve exotic, small-lot coffees that can cost $50 per 8-ounce bag. Executives expect customers to stay longer and spend more, driving twice the financial returns of typical Starbucks stores, which have average unit sales of about $1.6 million annually. Reserve likely has room to set prices higher than Starbucks. Blue Bottle and Intelligentsia shops in Los Angeles charge $4.50 for their 12-ounce lattes, versus $3.25 at Starbucks. Starbucks' 1,000 Reserve stores could boost company revenue if they hit targets, said Bernstein's Senatore, who cautioned that Schultz's new project has investment requirements that could become less attractive in a slowdown. And as Starbucks has already learned, moving upscale carries its own risks. There is always a market for what is different, special and rare, but the minute you become so available that anyone can get what you are selling, you lose your cachet, said market researcher Robert Passikoff, president and founder of Brand Keys.

The London Taxi Company plant near the city of Coventry is Britain's first electric vehicle factory and will help the firm to expand overseas as part of a 300 million pound ($375 million) investment. The move is the latest stage in the turnaround of a company which was saved from bankruptcy just over four years ago by China's Geely and is also a welcome boost for Britain as it prepares to start divorce proceedings from the European Union. This plant, and the related investment, is just one symbol of my own and the wider Chinese confidence in the UK, Geely Chairman Li Shufu wrote in an article in Britain's Daily Telegraph. The first electric taxi to be built in the factory will go on sale in Britain in late 2017 with sales in Europe due at the start of next year. From January, all new cabs in London have to be zero-emissions capable, meaning they cannot be diesel and must be either fully electric or hybrid, according to rules introduced by the mayor of London. Executives from the taxi maker, which traces its origins back to 1899 and was bought by Geely in 2013, have visited cities such as Oslo, Amsterdam, Paris and Berlin in recent months, but have yet to decide on the first foreign market.

The company said on Friday that it had secured more than $125 million in commitments for the new fund which will focus on backing young companies in sectors such as alternative lending, digital investment advice and financial infrastructure. The fund has 10 institutional investors and 29 limited partner advisers with experience in the financial services industry, the company said. New York-based Nyca closed its first fund of $30 million in July 2014 and since backed a number of high-profile fintech startups including lending companies Affirm and Orchard, as well as LendingClub Corp which went public in late 2014. It is also an investor in digital investment advice company SigFig. This is an exciting time for fintech and this latest fund will allow us to continue to invest in companies that leverage technology to build platforms that empower consumers, Nyca's managing partner Morris said in a statement. The new fund has already made more than a dozen investments to date, including artificial intelligence company LeapYear Technologies Inc and digital insurance broker EmBroker Inc, Nyca said. The fund close comes as venture capital investments in fintech companies in North America decrease, following a boom in 2015. North America fintech companies raised $900 million from venture capital firms in the third quarter of 2016, a 68 percent drop compared with a year earlier, according to a report by KPMG and CB Insights.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/ferrari-results-idUSL5N1FN3Y5","Ferrari races to new high after earnings top forecast","","February 2, 2017 /  11:46 AM / 6 months ago","","MILAN (Reuters) - Ferrari (RACE.MI) shares raced to a new high on Thursday after the Italian sports car maker beat quarterly sales and earnings estimates, and gave stronger than expected forecasts for 2017.  Its Milan-listed shares rose more than 4 percent to 60.75 euros, the highest since their debut in January 2016.  Spun off from Fiat Chrysler (FCHA.MI), Ferrari has been under pressure to show it can increase profits without the backing of a large parent and lift sales without sacrificing the brand's exclusive status.  The healthy beat at Q4 and guidance above consensus points to confidence that they can expand the range and still keep pricing power intact, a Milan-based trader said. Ferrari (RACE.N) said adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) in October-December rose 38 percent to 251 million euros ($271 million), above a Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S poll consensus of 225 million euros.  Quarterly sales were up 12 percent, also above expectations, helped by sales of its 12 cylinder models such as the GTC4Lusso and the newly-launched LaFerrari Aperta hybrid convertible. It proposed a cash dividend of 0.635 euros per share.  Ferrari will celebrate its 70th anniversary this year with a series of tailor-made cars, all inspired by iconic models from its past. Overall, the group plans to ship around 8,400 vehicles in 2017, getting closer to the 9,000 goal it has set for 2019.  Beyond special editions, Ferrari has been trying to expand its appeal with cars that have characteristics other than the technological prowess of its recent 8-cylinder and 12-cylinder models. It bills the GTC4Lusso T, a four-seater with a smaller V8 turbo engine, as designed to be driven every day. Ferrari forecast a 2017 adjusted EBITDA of more than 950 million euros and sales above 3.3 billion euros. A big contributor will be deliveries of the 1.86 million-euro hybrid convertible and the anniversary models.     Investors will assume that Ferrari will have left some upside to their 2017 guidance and attempt to follow a similar pattern to 2016 of 'Beat and Raise', said George Galliers, an analyst at Evercore ISI.  While at the time of the IPO Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne promised to expand the luxury brand beyond cars, he recently said Ferrari's focus would be on vehicles first.  He added that from 2019 all vehicles sold would have some hybrid elements, potentially opening the way for shipments to grow substantially in future. At the moment, Ferrari is exempt from certain fuel economy and emissions requirements provided it sells fewer than 10,000 vehicles a year. Reporting by Agnieszka Flak; Editing by Mark Potter"

We are continuing to invest in sports, chief executive Bjorn Gulden told journalists after the company published full second-quarter results, adding that spending on marketing would remain between 10 and 12 percent of sales in the longer run. Appointed in 2013 by majority-owner French luxury goods company Kering, Gulden has invested heavily in celebrity marketing to turn around the Puma brand. For example, Usain Bolt has been at the center of a push to sell sports performance gear, also boosted by its sponsorship of English soccer side Arsenal. With the eight-times Olympic sprinting champion nearing his last race, the group has signed Canadian Olympic silver medalist Andre de Grasse as well as a number of Jamaican sprinters. Puma has also seen strong demand for products promoted by celebrities such as model Cara Delevingne and Canadian rapper The Weeknd. Earlier this month, it hiked its guidance for 2017 sales and operating profit as it announced a 16 percent jump in currency-adjusted second-quarter sales, led by demand for its shoes. Like German rival Adidas, which reports results on Aug. 3, Puma has been enjoying a revival in the U.S. market, helped by a shift towards retro styles and away from basketball shoes which has hurt Under Armour and dented Nike's success. The good thing is that the newer products are selling well, which means that we get a better margin, CEO Gulden said. Puma's operating margin jumped to 4.5 percent in the second quarter, from 1.4 percent in the year-earlier period, as its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) more than tripled to 43.4 million euros ($50.5 million). In the beginning you have to over-invest relative to your sales. Now we are at the point where the leverage is kicking in, which means that for every euro of sales we are getting a bit more profit, Gulden said. But there is still room to improve, and we have to improve, he added. ($1 = 0.8601 euros) Reporting by Maria Sheahan; Editing by Victoria Bryan and Mark Potter"
"https://www.reuters.com/article/heineken-zero-idUSL8N1IF0DQ","Heineken targets global leadership with new zero alcohol beer","","May 13, 2017 /  2:42 PM / 2 months ago",""," (This May 13 story corrects to show in paragraph 2 launch in 14 markets, not 17) BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Dutch brewer Heineken (HEIN.AS) has launched a non-alcoholic version of its namesake beer with the aim of becoming the global leader in a part of the market growing faster than the average. The world's second largest beer maker launched Heineken 0.0 at the Spanish Grand Prix in Barcelona and will sell it in 14 markets, across Europe and also Russia and Israel, unlike rivals which have non-alcoholic beers for individual markets. Heineken is hoping to tap into what it believes is an increasing desire among consumers for beer that will not get them drunk. The European market for zero alcohol beer grew about 5 percent a year from 2010 to 2015, according to research group Canadean, while the overall beer market shrank. Rival AB InBev (ABI.BR), which makes more than a quarter of the world's beer, is aiming to make a fifth of its beer low or zero alcohol by 2025. For the maker of Budweiser, Stella Artois and Corona, low means an alcohol content of up to 3.5 percent. Zero alcohol beers could offer brewers higher margins because of lower taxes and could see them muscling in on the soft drinks market with what they say is a more natural and healthier option. Heineken 0.0, for example, has half the calories of standard Heineken or Coca-Cola. The brewer does not have a target for zero alcohol beer like AB InBev, but notes that in Spain zero strength beer has about a 10 percent market share. You could expect 10 to 15 years down the road this would be more or less the global trend. We want to make Heineken the leading global beer brand in 0.0, senior Heineken brand director Gianluca Di Tondo told Reuters. Beer critics say a key reason why zero alcohol beer has failed on previous occasions is taste. Heineken brewmaster Willem van Waesberghe said many previous and existing non-alcoholic beers were too sweet and malty, either because the fermentation process was cut short or because flavors were lost as alcohol was boiled off. Van Waesberghe recognizes that a beer without alcohol will not taste the same, but believes the company has found a brew that recreates some of the fruity, bitter and acidic tastes found in a normal 5 percent Heineken. The company makes two separate brews with different qualities, then removes the alcohol and blends them together. Both beers are not nice. You need to blend them together to make a good beer, he said. Reporting by Philip Blenkinsop; editing by David Clarke"

In France alone, still Club Med's biggest market, the group plans to open one new mountain village resort each year until 2019, Chief Executive Henri Giscard d'Estaing told a news conference. The club has resumed its march forward and is now accelerating, Giscard said, reflecting a new optimism two years after the company was finally bought out. Fosun Group, China's largest private conglomerate, took control of Club Med in January 2015 after a fierce battle lasting nearly two years with Italian tycoon Andrea Bonomi, the longest takeover fight in French corporate history.  Club Med was seen as overly dependent on Europe, home to 70 percent of its revenue and sluggish economic growth. Fosun offered it a chance to accelerate a strategy focused on moving further upmarket and expanding abroad, notably in the booming Chinese market. Club Med now operates 68 holiday villages worldwide, with some 77 percent of its resorts labeled premium or luxury compared with 55 percent in 2010, when Fosun bought an initial 7 percent stake in the company. China is its second largest market after France with 200,000 customers, up from 59,000 in 2010. This compares with 406,000 customers for France, a number broadly unchanged from 2015. Club Med has five resorts in China, in Yabuli, Guilin, Zhuhai Dong'ao Island, Sanya, and Beidahu, and will open a Joyview branded resort in Anji this year, Giscard said. Designed to offer Chinese urban consumers the opportunity to enjoy short holiday breaks, Joyview resorts are located close to China's major cities. Anji is relatively close to Shanghai. Club Med, which is no longer listed on the stock exchange, reported a 1 percent rise in clients worldwide to 1.26 million in 2016. It also generated a 15 percent rise in Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) despite a 1 percent decline in global revenue to 1.469 billion euros.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/starbucks-premium-idUSL1N1E12B2","Starbucks courts millennials with $10 coffee at new Reserve bars","","December 7, 2016 /  3:23 AM / 8 months ago","","LOS ANGELES/NEW YORK, Dec 6 (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp  co-founder Howard Schultz's plan to build a new prestige brand is a bet that moving upscale can raise the profile of the world's largest coffee brand with millennials like Megan Sauers. Schultz in April will step down as chief executive to focus on building 1,000 new Reserve brand stores. Over time there also will be as many as 30 large, showcase Reserve Roastery and Tasting Rooms in major cities around the world. Starbucks last week announced that Schultz was moving into the role of executive chairman in April to focus on the project. Analysts expect more details at a meeting in New York on Wednesday. The transition marks a turning point for Starbucks, which introduced millions of people around the world to higher quality coffee and espresso drinks and now must find a way to avoid being labeled pedestrian when compared with upscale rivals like Blue Bottle and Intelligentsia, which are popping up in U.S. cities. Starbucks is the millennials' parents' coffee house and Starbucks is acutely aware of that, said Ric Rhinehart, executive director of the Specialty Coffee Association of America. Starbucks' Reserve projects are a reminder that they did this first and they do this best, said AB Bernstein analyst Sara Senatore. The company already has added Reserve bars to a handful of Starbucks shops in major cities including New York. Reuters visited one such cafe on Manhattan's Upper East Side, which offered $10 cups of coffee made in glass siphons, $10 flights of Reserve brews and nitro cold brew via a separate Reserve menu. Twenty-four-year-old Sauers came in for her standard Starbucks caffeine jolt and discovered the new brand. I'd probably just stick to the regular, I'm not too picky, said Sauer, a recent transplant from Ohio. But she showed the kind of aspiration that Starbucks seeks. If I had the money to spend more towards coffee I'd do it, she said, calling the Reserve bar a great idea for the neighborhood. I think people want it, too. Reserve stores will exclusively sell and serve exotic, small-lot coffees that can cost $50 per 8-ounce bag. Executives expect customers to stay longer and spend more, driving twice the financial returns of typical Starbucks stores, which have average unit sales of about $1.6 million annually. Reserve likely has room to set prices higher than Starbucks. Blue Bottle and Intelligentsia shops in Los Angeles charge $4.50 for their 12-ounce lattes, versus $3.25 at Starbucks. Starbucks' 1,000 Reserve stores could boost company revenue if they hit targets, said Bernstein's Senatore, who cautioned that Schultz's new project has investment requirements that could become less attractive in a slowdown. And as Starbucks has already learned, moving upscale carries its own risks. There is always a market for what is different, special and rare, but the minute you become so available that anyone can get what you are selling, you lose your cachet, said market researcher Robert Passikoff, president and founder of Brand Keys.

Since 2014 Marchionne has focused on revamping the sporty Alfa Romeo and luxury Maserati brands and turning Jeep into a global sales engine.  But as the 65-year-old prepares to step down in early 2019, he said the time had come to take into account new industry challenges, including the need to comply with more stringent emissions requirements and a push for autonomous driving.  One pillar of the new strategy will be a push into electrification, with Marchionne promising to incorporate the technology into new models after 2019, including at Maserati. While Marchionne acknowledged that Maserati, Alfa Romeo and some other successful FCA brands could exist on their own, he appeared to pour cold water on the idea that any of them would be sold. He said he had to worry about the stump that's left behind if he parted ways with the most profitable parts. In comments that could pave the way for possible spin-offs or asset sales, Marchionne added, however, that the carmaker needed to decide whether all the activities within FCA were fundamental to running it.  If the answer is no, then we have an obligation to purify that portfolio, he told analysts on a conference call. I don't think that (spin-off) story, at least vis-à-vis FCA, is over.  FCA owns three components businesses which have been the target of M&A; speculation for years, especially Magneti Marelli.  Marchionne, who has put a hunt for a merger partner on hold after being rebuffed by General Motors (GM.N) two years ago, reiterated that he would not be involved in running the company after 2018 and that the search for an in-house successor was progressing well.  Earlier on Thursday FCA reported a slightly better than expected 15 percent rise in second-quarter adjusted operating profit, helped by improvements in Europe and Latin America and continued strong performance in its main North American market. Revenue was flat at 27.9 billion euros. FCA has been retooling some U.S. factories to boost output of sport-utility vehicles (SUVs) and trucks while discontinuing production of some unprofitable sedans in a bid to strengthen its finances as the U.S. car market comes off its peak. The world's seventh-largest carmaker still makes the lion's share of its profits in North America so improving, or at least maintaining, its margins there is a key focus. FCA reported a record 8.4 percent operating profit margin in the region, despite a drop in sales and shipments. Profitability also improved in Europe, helped by sales of Alfa Romeo's Giulia and Stelvio models, while margins at Maserati more than doubled to 14.2 percent on the back of strong demand for its first SUV, the Levante. However, the carmaker's net industrial debt only fell slightly less than expected to 4.2 billion euros ($4.9 billion) at the end of June from 5.1 billion euros three months earlier.  FCA confirmed its targets for the full year, but doubts remain about its exposure to the weakening U.S. market, recall costs and potential fines over emissions after it was targeted by European and U.S. authorities over alleged breaches.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-heineken-zero-idUSKBN1890LT","Heineken targets global leadership with new zero alcohol beer","","May 13, 2017 /  2:42 PM / 2 months ago",""," (This May 13 story corrects to show in paragraph 2 launch in 14 markets, not 17) BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Dutch brewer Heineken (HEIN.AS) has launched a non-alcoholic version of its namesake beer with the aim of becoming the global leader in a part of the market growing faster than the average. The world's second largest beer maker launched Heineken 0.0 at the Spanish Grand Prix in Barcelona and will sell it in 14 markets, across Europe and also Russia and Israel, unlike rivals which have non-alcoholic beers for individual markets. Heineken is hoping to tap into what it believes is an increasing desire among consumers for beer that will not get them drunk. The European market for zero alcohol beer grew about 5 percent a year from 2010 to 2015, according to research group Canadean, while the overall beer market shrank. Rival AB InBev (ABI.BR), which makes more than a quarter of the world's beer, is aiming to make a fifth of its beer low or zero alcohol by 2025. For the maker of Budweiser, Stella Artois and Corona, low means an alcohol content of up to 3.5 percent. Zero alcohol beers could offer brewers higher margins because of lower taxes and could see them muscling in on the soft drinks market with what they say is a more natural and healthier option. Heineken 0.0, for example, has half the calories of standard Heineken or Coca-Cola. The brewer does not have a target for zero alcohol beer like AB InBev, but notes that in Spain zero strength beer has about a 10 percent market share. You could expect 10 to 15 years down the road this would be more or less the global trend. We want to make Heineken the leading global beer brand in 0.0, senior Heineken brand director Gianluca Di Tondo told Reuters. Beer critics say a key reason why zero alcohol beer has failed on previous occasions is taste. Heineken brewmaster Willem van Waesberghe said many previous and existing non-alcoholic beers were too sweet and malty, either because the fermentation process was cut short or because flavors were lost as alcohol was boiled off. Van Waesberghe recognizes that a beer without alcohol will not taste the same, but believes the company has found a brew that recreates some of the fruity, bitter and acidic tastes found in a normal 5 percent Heineken. The company makes two separate brews with different qualities, then removes the alcohol and blends them together. Both beers are not nice. You need to blend them together to make a good beer, he said. Reporting by Philip Blenkinsop; editing by David Clarke"

In France alone, still Club Med's biggest market, the group plans to open one new mountain village resort each year until 2019, Chief Executive Henri Giscard d'Estaing told a news conference. The club has resumed its march forward and is now accelerating, Giscard said, reflecting a new optimism two years after the company was finally bought out. Fosun Group, China's largest private conglomerate, took control of Club Med in January 2015 after a fierce battle lasting nearly two years with Italian tycoon Andrea Bonomi, the longest takeover fight in French corporate history.  Club Med was seen as overly dependent on Europe, home to 70 percent of its revenue and sluggish economic growth. Fosun offered it a chance to accelerate a strategy focused on moving further upmarket and expanding abroad, notably in the booming Chinese market. Club Med now operates 68 holiday villages worldwide, with some 77 percent of its resorts labeled premium or luxury compared with 55 percent in 2010, when Fosun bought an initial 7 percent stake in the company. China is its second largest market after France with 200,000 customers, up from 59,000 in 2010. This compares with 406,000 customers for France, a number broadly unchanged from 2015. Club Med has five resorts in China, in Yabuli, Guilin, Zhuhai Dong'ao Island, Sanya, and Beidahu, and will open a Joyview branded resort in Anji this year, Giscard said. Designed to offer Chinese urban consumers the opportunity to enjoy short holiday breaks, Joyview resorts are located close to China's major cities. Anji is relatively close to Shanghai. Club Med, which is no longer listed on the stock exchange, reported a 1 percent rise in clients worldwide to 1.26 million in 2016. It also generated a 15 percent rise in Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) despite a 1 percent decline in global revenue to 1.469 billion euros. The revenue decline reflected a 3 percent drop in revenue from Europe, where political turmoil in Turkey and North Africa hurt business. Revenue however rose 6 percent in Asia and 4  percent in America. Reporting by Dominique Vidalon; Editing by Keith Weir"
"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-autos-china-geely-idUSKCN0XA2QY","Operation L: China's Geely to launch new car brand - sources","","April 13, 2016 /  11:27 PM / in a year","","BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese automaker Geely will launch a new brand next year, codenamed L, with cars based on joint architecture developed with Volvo, three people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters. The brand will launch with a sport-utility vehicle - the first model based on the Compact Modular Architecture (CMA) platform developed by Zhejiang Geely Holding Group (0175.HK) and Volvo, the Swedish automaker it bought from Ford (F.N) in 2010. A sedan is also under development for the new brand. Spokesmen for both Geely and Volvo declined to comment. Launching a new car brand when China's economic growth is at its slowest in a quarter of a century may seem ambitious, but Geely, under chairman Li Shufu, beat the industry growth rate last year and has turned around Volvo's fortunes. Geely sales rose 22 percent to around 510,000 cars last year, and Volvo earnings tripled, with the Swedish automaker predicting record sales for 2016. Car sales in China, the world's biggest market, are forecast to grow by around 6 percent this year, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. The aim is for L-brand cars to compete with Chinese-foreign venture brands, such as those produced jointly by General Motors (GM.N) and SAIC Motor Corp (600104.SS). That would leave Volvo to focus on the luxury market, and Geely to go up against domestic Chinese brands, two of the people said. The new brand would launch into an already crowded Chinese market where at least a dozen foreign automakers and more than 20 local passenger car manufacturers, many with multiple brands of their own, compete. The last thing the Chinese automotive world needs is another brand, said James Chao, Asia-Pacific chief of consultancy IHS Automotive. The elimination of more brands in China should be the route. Launching a new brand can cost hundreds of millions of dollars, if not billions, require years of patience and even then would need to be a truly groundbreaking product to succeed, Chao said. A Geely EC Cross concept car is displayed at Auto China 2014 in Beijing in this April 20, 2014 file picture.Jason Lee/FilesBut the potential return could be substantial if Geely can pull it off.  SAIC GM's budget Baojun cars, launched in China in 2011, sold nearly half a million vehicles last year. But other new brands, including Toyota Motor's (7203.T) Scion sub-brand aimed at younger buyers in the United States, have failed to gain traction. Scion was axed as a standalone brand earlier this year. Qoros Automotive, backed by Kenon Holdings (KEN.N) and China's Chery Automobile [CHERY.UL], was founded in 2007 and sold just 14,250 cars last year. People are seen in silhouette near the Volvo auto stand during the media preview of the 2016 New York International Auto Show in Manhattan, New York in this March 24, 2016 file picture.Brendan McDermid/FilesStrategy U-Turn? The new L-brand is something of a U-turn for Geely, which said only two years ago it would eliminate three sub-brands and only sell under the Geely logo, consolidating its sales network in the process. L-brand cars will be sold through Geely's existing dealership network, said one individual with direct knowledge of the plan, unlike previous Geely sub-brands that were sold through separate exclusive dealerships.  New factories will be set up to make cars for the new brand, codenamed after the marque's first initial, and once it is established in China it will export to other markets, the person said. China Euro Vehicle Technology AB, a Geely subsidiary that coordinates research and development with Volvo, is leading the work on the CMA platform from its headquarters in Sweden, with some operations in China. Developing the CMA platform is part of Geely's preparations for a push into European and U.S. markets, sources previously told Reuters. The platform will allow all three brands - Volvo, Geely and L-brand - to design new models from a common base. Reporting by Jake Spring; Editing by Ian Geoghegan"

"https://www.reuters.com/article/airbus-reorganisation-idUSL5N1FM5ZF","RPT-Airbus calls in the movers as power shifts to new HQ","","February 2, 2017 /  7:01 AM / in 6 months","","(Repeats story published on Feb. 1 with no changes) * Planemaking chief moves office to new corporate HQ * Move to centre highlights CEO Enders' grip on power * Investors sensitive to any distraction from output drive * Airbus drops historic logo in bid to emphasise unity By Tim Hepher PARIS, Feb 1 (Reuters) - After top-level restructuring at Airbus come the musical chairs and a new logo intended to convey unity as the European giant aims to refocus its management without a return to past infighting. In a symbolic move, the man in charge of making Airbus jets has reluctantly agreed to leave his office by the vast factories in Toulouse and move to a new corporate headquarters in the same southern French city, people familiar with the matter said. At first sight, it might seem an obvious move following the restructuring in which the planemaking division became the mainstay of the overall structure of a company that also manufactures space rockets, helicopters and military jets. But close watchers of the predominantly Franco-German firm, still bruised by decades of infighting, fear the decision to put planemaking chief Fabrice Bregier in the new HQ alongside his boss Tom Enders could test a fragile internal power balance. For Bregier, it may only be a move of about a kilometre on the ground, but it shifts him ever so slightly away from the company's economic nerve centre that drives its share price, revenue and profits. And it comes at a critical time for the world's second largest planemaker as it strives to boost output. (Bregier) isn't happy, but he is going to make it work, said one person close to the company, who asked not to be named. Airbus agreed last year to merge its jetliner division with its parent group to reflect the stronger bias towards civil manufacturing that started in 2013, after the failure of a planned merger with British defence firm BAE Systems. After the latest internal restructuring, Bregier gave up his title as chief executive of the Airbus commercial airliner business, but remained its president while also becoming chief operating officer and number two for the group as a whole. Airbus is now an aircraft manufacturing company with two other divisions, so after the merger the focus on the core business is much tighter, an Airbus spokesman said. Enders, 58, is now drawing core people and functions around him at the new HQ to secure his vision of forging the integrated company he believes is necessary to remain on a par with arch-rival Boeing and fend off new competition. He has pledged to make Airbus a normal company after French and German political interference was curbed in 2014 by a change in its corporate governance following the failure of the BAE deal. Critical Task But plucking Bregier from a domain in which he is undisputed leader - having overseen record plane output and an improved industrial performance - and accentuating his other role as deputy to Enders is seen by some as a potential loss of focus. Airbus is confronted with the critical task of raising its jet output fast to fill thousands of orders on its books, and investors are especially sensitive to any risk its top managers become distracted by internal politics. What is unusual is to have restructuring happening at a time when production is increasing sharply, one European aerospace analyst said. At the same time, a raft of top managers in the planemaking business involved in operations, sales, programmes and engineering are nearing retirement age. Publicly, Airbus managers have closed ranks behind the CEO's plans. Many recall the industrial chaos and tensions between French and German government shareholders - and their proxies within the company - that hammered Airbus shares a decade ago. Enders, who is German, and Bregier, a 55-year-old Frenchman, have occasionally appeared uneasy partners. Both are major industry figures in their own right and aspire to the top job. But they also demonstrated a pragmatic ability to work together in 2007-12 at what was then the jet division of EADS, later renamed Airbus Group, again with Enders in the lead role. The latest overhaul cements Bregier's position as heir apparent as he is now operational chief of the whole group but it also means he may have to wait longer for the top job. Both men have pledged to make jet production their top priority and company insiders say Bregier had initially suggested he would keep a physical presence in each camp to ensure this. But his office move is just the latest example of a steady shift of key oversight functions towards the centre, consolidating the power of Enders and prompting reports of fresh tension in one of the industry's key personal relationships. The Airbus spokesman dismissed such concerns. They worked together well when both at Airbus and both their roles have significantly increased, so there is no overlap. The insistence on unity does not end there. Airbus has quietly axed separate brands for its divisions, including the ball-shaped Airbus logo used on its first flight in 1972. Brand experts say the design was worth less than the name, but the loss of a historic symbol underscores the jetmaker's reduced independence within the corporate structure. Witnesses say workers have put up a new AIRBUS sign -  with the ball removed - above the commercial offices. The helicopter and defence divisions are now expected to undergo similar surgery.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ferrari-results-idUSKBN15H175","Ferrari races to new high after earnings top forecast","","February 2, 2017 /  11:46 AM / 6 months ago","","MILAN (Reuters) - Ferrari (RACE.MI) shares raced to a new high on Thursday after the Italian sports car maker beat quarterly sales and earnings estimates, and gave stronger than expected forecasts for 2017.  Its Milan-listed shares rose more than 4 percent to 60.75 euros, the highest since their debut in January 2016.  Spun off from Fiat Chrysler (FCHA.MI), Ferrari has been under pressure to show it can increase profits without the backing of a large parent and lift sales without sacrificing the brand's exclusive status.  The healthy beat at Q4 and guidance above consensus points to confidence that they can expand the range and still keep pricing power intact, a Milan-based trader said. Ferrari (RACE.N) said adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) in October-December rose 38 percent to 251 million euros ($271 million), above a Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S poll consensus of 225 million euros.  Quarterly sales were up 12 percent, also above expectations, helped by sales of its 12 cylinder models such as the GTC4Lusso and the newly-launched LaFerrari Aperta hybrid convertible. It proposed a cash dividend of 0.635 euros per share.  Ferrari will celebrate its 70th anniversary this year with a series of tailor-made cars, all inspired by iconic models from its past. Overall, the group plans to ship around 8,400 vehicles in 2017, getting closer to the 9,000 goal it has set for 2019.  Beyond special editions, Ferrari has been trying to expand its appeal with cars that have characteristics other than the technological prowess of its recent 8-cylinder and 12-cylinder models. It bills the GTC4Lusso T, a four-seater with a smaller V8 turbo engine, as designed to be driven every day. Ferrari forecast a 2017 adjusted EBITDA of more than 950 million euros and sales above 3.3 billion euros. A big contributor will be deliveries of the 1.86 million-euro hybrid convertible and the anniversary models.     Investors will assume that Ferrari will have left some upside to their 2017 guidance and attempt to follow a similar pattern to 2016 of 'Beat and Raise', said George Galliers, an analyst at Evercore ISI.  While at the time of the IPO Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne promised to expand the luxury brand beyond cars, he recently said Ferrari's focus would be on vehicles first.  He added that from 2019 all vehicles sold would have some hybrid elements, potentially opening the way for shipments to grow substantially in future. At the moment, Ferrari is exempt from certain fuel economy and emissions requirements provided it sells fewer than 10,000 vehicles a year. Reporting by Agnieszka Flak; Editing by Mark Potter"

Then, the company shocked Wall Street on Tuesday with a big drop in holiday-quarter sales growth and issued a glum forecast  for the year, as it grapples with excess inventory amid a glut in the broader athleisure market. Now, analysts say, a roughly 15 percent growth rate could be the new normal for Under Armour. This is the first time since Under Armour has been a public company where sales guidance clearly missed the consensus and a sign it is no longer able to find enough growth in new channels to offset weakness in its core business, Morgan Stanley analyst Jay Sole wrote in a note dated Jan 31. Under Armour ended the year with inventories that were 17 percent higher the year before and analysts said the company's margins would be hit through 2017 as it discounts to get rid of old stock. Inventory problems aside, Under Armour is contending with a host of other issues. While the biggest concern is that the company lacks a true fashion line, Under Armour is also struggling with intensifying competition from Nike Inc (NKE.N) and Adidas AG ADGn.DE, which have stepped up discounts. The company's Class A shares have lost more than half their market value over the past 12 quarters, including a 23.4 percent decline on Tuesday. The Class A stock was flat at $21.47 on Wednesday. Under Armour's problems have been compounded in an industry already reeling from the bankruptcies of big footwear retail chains The Sports Authority and Sport Chalet, which have disrupted distribution channels. To be sure, the Under Armour brand is still a powerful one. It was the No. 2 sportswear brand in the United States for two years, before being recently displaced by Adidas, according to market research firm NPD. Under Armour has also successfully expanded into new categories including sportwear for kids and outdoor products, and signed deals with Major League Baseball, high profile athletes, and  professional teams. Not Too Cool for School Under Armour focuses on selling shoes and apparel that are solely meant for improving sports performance rather than as a fashion accessory, while Adidas and Nike have much broader ranges of fashion offerings. But in the United States, three-quarters of all sports shoes are not used for sports, according to market research firm NPD. For example, Under Armour's Curry shoes are made for on-court performances, unlike Nike's Air Jordans that have become the stuff of fashion lore. Under Armour Chief Executive Kevin Plank himself admitted on the company's earnings call on Tuesday that it needed to become more fashionable at a time when consumers were spoilt for choice. Under Armour is great on the field but is yet to be too-cool-for-school, Susquehanna Financial analyst Sam Poser said. The company has said it will invest aggressively in its premium Under Armour Sportswear business, under which it sells button down shirts, bomber jackets and parkas at high-end stores such as Barneys. It is also looking to expand its top brands to more retailers, much like its new deal with department store operator Kohl's Corp (KSS.N) to sell its products in more than 1,100 stores.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-teva-pharm-ind-asthma-idUSKBN17M2K8","Teva's new asthma inhaler poses first competition for GSK's Advair","","April 20, 2017 /  8:04 PM / 3 months ago","","(Reuters) - Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd on Thursday launched an asthma inhaler that will be the first direct competition to GlaxoSmithKline's best-selling Advair. Teva, which won U.S. approval in January to make an inhaler similar to Advair, also launched a generic version of its own inhaler, AirDuo RespiClick. AirDuo is not a true generic of Advair, but contains the same two active ingredients, fluticasone propionate and salmeterol. However, it delivers a lower dose of salmeterol and uses Teva's RespiClick inhaler rather than copying GSK's device. We imagine that there should be sufficient time window for AirDuo to be the sole competing product to Advair, Raymond James analyst Elliot Wilbur said in a client note. Advair, which brought in 1.83 billion pounds ($2.35 billion) in 2016 sales, is also widely used to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, while AirDuo is only approved for asthma and is not directly substitutable. Neither branded AirDuo, nor its authorized generic are therapeutically equivalent or substitutable for Advair, GSK's spokeswoman Sarah Alspach told Reuters. Still, Teva's product is likely to grab some share of the asthma market. AirDuo could capture 25 percent of the market by 2018, Wilbur said. However, the bigger threat to GSK will likely come from fully substitutable generic copies of Advair that are still awaiting approval. Hikma Pharmaceuticals Plc and Vectura Group Plc are expecting approval for their generic versions by May 10. Mylan NV's generic was rejected in March. GSK has been preparing for the loss of Advair's exclusivity for the past two years. But the potential launch of generics will still be a blow since the medicine is highly profitable and has sold more than $1 billion annually since 2001. Teva's AirDuo will cost wholesalers or direct purchasers $285, while the generic version will cost $90, Michelle Larkin, a spokeswoman for the Israeli drugmaker, told Reuters. The pricing of the branded drug was in line with that of its peers, Bernstein analyst Erica Kazlow said. Teva's willingness to use generic strategy for the product is encouraging as it relates to the company's willingness to look at a tough reality and take appropriate action, Kazlow said.

Oklahoma Attorney General Mike Hunter filed a lawsuit in Cleveland County District Court against Purdue Pharma LP, Johnson & Johnson, Allergan Plc and units of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. The drugmakers engaged in a fraudulent, decades-long marketing campaign to profit from the suffering of thousands of Oklahomans, Hunter said. The lawsuit claims the companies knowingly marketed their drugs as safe for chronic pain management while downplaying the risk of opioid dependency, he added. Purdue, which makes OxyContin, said it denies the allegations but shares Hunter's concerns about the epidemic. J&J; said it acted appropriately, adding that its opioid medications carry U.S. Food and Drug Administration-mandated warnings about their risks. Allergan said it supports the safe, responsible use of prescription medications. Teva said it is committed to the appropriate promotion and use of opioids. Opioids, including prescription painkillers and heroin, killed more than 33,000 people in the United States in 2015, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Oklahoma's lawsuit followed similar cases brought against some of the same companies by Mississippi, Ohio and Missouri. Several cities and counties in California, Illinois, Ohio, Tennessee and New York have also filed lawsuits over companies' marketing of opioids. A group of state attorneys general announced an investigation this month of the role played by pharmaceutical companies in the opioid epidemic. The states investigating include New Hamsphire, where the highest state court on Friday overturned a lower-court ruling that prevented the enforcement of subpoenas against five drugmakers. The lower-court's decision was based on a finding, now reversed, that the attorney general acted outside his authority by executing a contingency fee agreement with a private law firm to pursue the case. This case is massive in scope, and we do not have sufficient resources without assistance of outside counsel, said James Boffetti, chief of the New Hampshire attorney general's consumer protection bureau. Boffetti said Purdue is the probe's current focus. The state had been working with Cohen Milstein Sellers & Toll to push its investigation forward but it is now relying on Motley Rice after the case's lead attorney switched firms. Purdue said it was disappointed and believes that privatizing law enforcement presents serious public policy concerns. Writing by Nate Raymond in Boston; editing by Tom Brown"

Luxury brand Nicholas K opened the Fall/Winter 2017 shows with a homage to 1990s hip hop. Dozens of models paraded down the catwalk wearing vibrantly colored over-sized pants and big hooped earrings with metallic make up. Christopher Kunz, who comprises half of the sibling duo behind the street-wear label, said he was surprised to see so many guests show up for his show during the storm, which dumped roughly 14 inches (36 cm) on the city, turning Manhattan into a slippery mess. His sister, Nicholas Kunz, said they chose a hip hop theme because they felt the 1990s represented communal activism and ethnic diversity, issues that are increasingly relevant after the recent election of U.S. President Donald Trump. I think there was some strong messages in the 90's hip hop era. It was all about communal activism, ethnic diversity, equality, Kunz said. We've always been about diversity and environmental things. It's really disheartening to see things going backwards in those two areas for us.

Although officially atheist, China selected Gyaltsen Norbu as the 11th Panchen Lama in 1995 in a drive to win the hearts and minds of Tibetans. Tibet's current spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, whom Beijing brands a dangerous separatist, had announced his own choice of a six-year-old boy, but he was taken away by authorities and has since vanished from public view. In a message to mark the Tibetan lunar new year, carried by the United Front Work Department which helps oversee religious groups, China's Panchen Lama discussed six months of Buddhist activities he carried out in Tibet last year. My deepest impression after the inspection tour was that Tibet's ethnic and religious policies have been carried out very well, he said in comments carried late on Monday. At the same time, the party has formulated a series of special beneficial policies, and the vast majority of Tibetans have received real benefit. After seeing this I felt very happy, he said. He added that he visited herders, where he got to understand the changes that have taken place for Tibetans. This has made me even more confident in Tibet's tomorrow, he said. China has gradually exposed its Panchen Lama in public roles in the hope he will achieve the respect commanded by the Dalai Lama among Tibetans and globally.

At a conference in San Francisco, Google cloud computing chief Diane Greene ticked off a host of new clients, including HSBC, Colgate, Verizon and eBay. The company also announced it had acquired Kaggle, a popular platform for data scientists that could boost Google's edge in the crowded field of artificial intelligence.  Despite the announcements, analysts said Google remains a distant third in the market for cloud computing, the increasingly popular practice of using remote internet servers to store, manage and process data.  “The big challenge Google faces is that, for all the names it announced today, it’s still miles behind Amazon and Microsoft in terms of scale,” said analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research. “It has a long way to go, and a few more client announcements aren’t going to close the gap.”  Those at the event were more impressed with Google's growing prowess in artificial intelligence (AI), long a strength of the company. The audience cheered when Google announced that it would release software tools to identify objects in videos using AI. Kaggle, which will keep operating as an independent brand, reflects Google’s interest in marketplaces for data, said Fei-Fei Li, Google Cloud’s chief scientist of artificial intelligence and machine learning. Kaggle allows companies and researchers to post data and uses crowdsourcing competitions among experts to produce usable models. “What Kaggle has contributed to the community is the democratization of data,” she said.  While analysts expressed caution about Google as a competitor in cloud computing, company executives insisted they are making brisk progress in the market. Alphabet Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt cited the recent initial public offering of Snap, a Google Cloud client, to illustrate the power of the company’s services.  “We put $30 billion into this platform,” he said. “I know because I approved it. It’s real.” Greene said the company has been successful closing deals, hinting many more client announcements are in the offing. “Already we are winning more than half our deals,” she said.

Within the next year, Tyson, the biggest U.S. chicken company, will launch a pilot program at two processing plants to use gas instead of electricity to stun birds before they are killed. Poultry companies render birds unconscious prior to slaughter so they do not feel pain and have increasingly explored gas as a potentially more humane option. Consumers and some restaurants have also called for more humane practices. Tyson's program is a very significant step forward for us in understanding if this is scalable, Justin Whitmore, chief sustainability officer, said in an interview.  The project is part of a broader shift in production practices in the U.S. poultry industry, in which companies have also backed away from antibiotics due to health concerns. Such changes generally increase production costs.

Whitmore declined to discuss costs of Tyson's gas stunning project. In January, U.S. chicken processor Pilgrim's Pride Corp touted GNP Company's use of gas stunning when it paid $350 million to buy the smaller rival. In GNP's system, birds were lowered into a sealed tunnel in specially designed modules where the amount of carbon dioxide gradually rose to 70 percent from 5 percent, according to the company. In minutes, the birds passed out as carbon dioxide displaced oxygen in the air.  With gas stunning, chickens are unconscious when they are shackled for slaughter.

The presidential motorcade passed hundreds of demonstrators as it arrived at the decommissioned aircraft carrier Intrepid in the early evening for a meeting with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull hours after it was originally scheduled.  Before leaving Washington, Trump held a hastily arranged White House celebration with fellow Republicans from the U.S. House of Representatives who narrowly passed a healthcare bill that would repeal and replace the 2010 Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare. [nL1N1I61UA] If anything, Trump's role in efforts to scrap the signature domestic achievement of his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama, further incensed the protesters. Among those on the street were members of the New York State Nurses Association, who chanted: What do we want? Health care! When do we want it? Now!  Demonstrators from the Working Families Party spent much of the afternoon rallying and marching near the Intrepid, now a floating museum on Manhattan's West Side, banging pans, chanting: Not my president and carrying signs including one that read: This village doesn't want its idiot back! Rob Adkins, 33, a professional musician from Brooklyn who is insured through Obamacare, said he was alarmed by the Trump-backed Republican healthcare plan that passed the House. Protesters demonstrate near Trump Tower against U.S. President Donald Trump in the Manhattan borough of New York City, U.S. May 4, 2017.Mike SegarIt could cost me my health insurance, he said, echoing the sentiments of several other protesters. The demonstrations, which included other groups throughout Manhattan, were reminiscent of the weeks after Trump's Nov. 8 election when frequent protests took place outside his home in the Fifth Avenue tower that bears his name.    Slideshow (13 Images)The first 100 days since the Jan. 20 inauguration of the businessman-turned-politician brought rollbacks of environmental regulations and crackdowns on immigrants, none of which play well in the liberal Northeast city. Fewer than one in five residents in the United States' most populous city voted for Trump, even though he comes from its Queens borough, built a real estate brand and other ventures associated with New York, and has been fodder for its tabloid newspapers for decades. Providing security for first lady Melania Trump, who has continued to live in Trump Tower while their 11-year-old son Barron finishes the school year, has been a costly obligation for New York.  After security costs for Trump and his family of about $24 million during the transition and $300,000 a day since then, Congress voted last week to reimburse the city and other local governments for $61 million. Following the events with Turnbull, which include a black-tie dinner on the Intrepid to mark the 75th anniversary of World War Two's Battle of the Coral Sea, Trump was expected to go to his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, for the weekend.

Diageo is working hard to improve performance in the United States, its biggest profit centre, particularly around Smirnoff vodka, which is still losing market share despite improving sales. The United States is very important for Diageo ... and one of the first priorities for reinvestment, Chief Executive Ivan Menezes told reporters on Tuesday after meetings with analysts and investors. A new method of gathering and analysing data is giving Diageo a better idea of the returns it is making on various investments, allowing the company to switch money around more quickly. That better data and information really gives us much greater confidence in where we should be upweighting our spend, said Chief Financial Officer Kathryn Mikells. And candidly where we would look to cut back our spend. The increased marketing will be concentrated on its main brands, including Smirnoff vodka, Johnnie Walker whisky and Captain Morgan rum. Next year the company will also spend more on marketing Scotch whisky, its biggest product category. The company said it achieved about 80 million pounds ($103.4 million) of savings last year in procurement, including by reducing the number of advertising agencies it works with in Europe from 36 to two. The company expects to increase procurement savings this year. Menezes also said that performance in the company's beer business would improve this year, recovering after first-half problems in Nigeria and a tax change in Kenya.

Italian Gobbetti was named as Christopher Bailey's successor as Burberry CEO last July but contractual obligations have prevented him from taking charge so far. Gobbetti arrives at a difficult time for Burberry which rebuffed a takeover approach from U.S. rival Coach (COH.N) last year according to reports. Burberry, scheduled to update on Christmas trading on Wednesday, said Gobbetti would start at the firm on Jan. 27 as executive chairman, Asia Pacific and Middle East. He will not become CEO and join the board until July 5 when Bailey will take on the new role of president and chief creative officer. The Asia Pacific and Middle East position was created for him by Burberry to enable him to get to know the business before becoming CEO, the firm said. His arrival will allow Bailey to focus again on the design role that made his name. Burberry has suffered from depressed demand at U.S. department stores and is exposed to any slowdown in China, with the Chinese consumer accounting for 40 percent of its global retail sales. It has however been boosted by tourists taking advantage of the weaker pound to spend more in its London stores and the translation benefit when converting overseas revenues to sterling. Foreign exchange benefits have helped to drive a 46 percent rise in its shares over the last year. The stock was up 1.3 percent at 1,632 pence at 1145 GMT (6:45 a.m. ET), valuing the business at around 7.1 billion pounds ($8.6 billion). Last week analysts at Barclays upgraded their stance on Burberry to overweight. They are forecasting a 25 percent rise in third quarter sales to 752 million pounds, with like-for-like sales up 2 percent.

Sales in May fell to 87,733 vehicles, while they fell 11 percent to 436,961 in the January-May period, the U.S. automaker said. Despite the weak May figures, Ford sales are on track to grow for the second-quarter overall, said Peter Fleet, Ford's Asia Pacific sales chief, in a written statement. We've strengthened our marketing plan in China for the second quarter, with new and exciting customer promotions for Ford-branded vehicles, Fleet said. The plan includes a realigned Kuga (sport-utility vehicle) customer offer, the statement said, without elaborating. In the automotive industry, promotions and offers generally indicate price discounting. China's auto market, the world's largest, faces slower growth this year as a tax incentive for small-engined cars is rolled back, with sales rising 4 percent for the market overall in the first four months of the year, according to the latest data available from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. Sales at Ford's U.S. peer General Motors have also fallen this year, while Japanese rival Toyota Motor Corp's sales growth has slowed. Fleet is set to become Asia-Pacific and China chief for Ford on July 1 in a global management shake-up after the dismissal of Chief Executive Mark Fields as the company's sales come under increasing pressure globally. James Hackett, a former office furniture executive heading Ford's self-driving car unit, was named CEO last month with a slate of other leadership posts also set to change hands. Several key models are reaching the end of their life cycles and dragging on sales, including the Kuga and EcoSport in China's fastest growing sport-utility segment as well as the Ford Focus sedan, said Yale Zhang, Shanghai-based managing director for consultancy Automotive Foresight. Sales of all three models have fallen by double-digits year-on-year for January to May. From the second half and into next year they will launch some newer generation products and the situation will be better, Zhang said.

Liverpool unveiled its bid on Friday saying the opening ceremony and rugby sevens would be held at Liverpool FC's Anfield Stadium. The initial bid plan, submitted on Friday, also includes a link-up with neighboring Manchester which would host Twenty20 cricket at Old Trafford cricket ground and cycling at the Manchester Velodrome. Most of the Games will be held at existing venues but a new 50-metre swimming pool will be built within the city center dock system, while triple jump, long jump and pole vault are proposed to be held on the dockside by Mann Island in 'City Games' style. The new Everton stadium, at Bramley-Moore Dock, close to the city center, would host athletics events and would also have  the Athletes Village close by. The city's Arena and Convention Centre (ACC) would host a number of indoor events including Artistic Gymnastics and Badminton. Everton's current stadium, Goodison Park, would host the boxing finals. What we have unveiled is truly transformational. We are utilizing our existing, world-class venues ... as well as facilities linked to the massive regeneration that is already taking place in the Bramley-Moore Dock area, Liverpool bid Chairman Brian Barwick said. The 2022 Commonwealth Games were originally handed to Durban in South Africa but the city was stripped of hosting rights by the Commonwealth Games Federation in March after the plan hit financial problems. Another English city, Birmingham, is also bidding for 2022 along with Victoria in western Canada. Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia has said it is interested in hosting the event, along with several Australian venues. But Liverpool is confident it can secure the backing of the Commonwealth Games Federation. If Birmingham can come up with a better masterplan and vision than this then they will deserve it but I think they are going to have to go far beyond the realms of possibility, said Liverpool Mayor Joe Anderson. He said the plan would encourage faster regeneration of the waterfront area of the city and bring a host of benefits. The economic impact, the jobs impact, skills, health and well-being, the whole branding of the city and the waterfront, it would be absolutely madness not to do it, he added. Liverpool born boxer Tony Bellew, who is backing the bid, said the Games would provide a major economic boost for the city and help raise its profile.

It did not sell Ivanka Trump products.) President Donald Trump blasted department store chain Nordstrom Inc on Wednesday for dropping his daughter Ivanka's clothing line, prompting critics to accuse him of misusing  public office to benefit his family's sprawling business empire. After Trump's highly unusual move to use a White House platform to intervene in a commercial matter involving his daughter, Nordstrom reiterated that its action last week was based on declining sales of the Ivanka Trump products. But White House spokesman Sean Spicer characterized the move as a direct attack on the president's policies. My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom. She is a great person - always pushing me to do the right thing! Terrible! Trump wrote on Wednesday on both his personal and official presidential Twitter accounts. Ethics officials who served past Republican and Democratic administrations said Trump's tweet was both unprecedented for a president and troublesome. This is misuse of public office for private gains, Richard Painter, who served as Republican President George W. Bush's chief ethics lawyer, said in an email to Reuters. And it is abuse of power because the official message is clear - Nordstrom is persona non grata with the administration. Norman Eisen, an ethics adviser to Democratic President Barack Obama, noted that several states have unfair competition laws, including California where Nordstrom operates many stores. The tweet, he said, could spark lawsuits if the company's brand was being injured by an unfair attack. The wealthy New York real estate developer who became president on Jan. 20 has declined to sell off his businesses despite demands from critics that he do so to avoid thorny conflicts of interest. Trump on Jan. 11 said he would maintain ownership of his global business empire but hand off control to his two oldest sons during his presidency. Trump's web of international companies remains a bit opaque since he has refused to release his tax returns, which experts have said would provide a clearer view of his business interests. Ethics experts have said Trump's arrangement does little to address potential conflicts because he would still know what assets he owned, such as Trump-branded golf courses and hotels, and his family would continue to profit from them. Related CoverageNordstrom says decision to drop Ivanka Trump's brand based on performanceWhite House defends Trump criticism of Nordstrom for dropping Ivanka clothing lineIvanka Trump ran a clothing and jewelry business bearing her name, in addition to other work for the Trump Organization,  before saying she would resign when her father was sworn in as president. Her father's various contentious actions and comments have prompted boycott efforts by critics and have driven some consumers away from Trump family businesses. During a White House press briefing, Spicer painted Nordstrom's action as an attack on the president's daughter. For someone to take out their concern with his policies on a family member of his is just not acceptable. And the president has every right as a father to stand up to them, Spicer said. A spokeswoman for the Ivanka Trump brand declined to comment. On Tuesday, First lady Melania Trump filed a $150 million defamation lawsuit accusing the Daily Mail British tabloid of damaging her brand by falsely reporting she had worked as an escort. The lawsuit said the article ruined a unique, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for the first lady but her lawyer said she has no intention of using her position for profit. An Ivanka Trump-branded blouse is seen for sale at off-price retailer Winners in Toronto, Ontario, Canada February 3, 2017.Chris Helgren'Totally Inappropriate' Democrats pounced on Trump for the tweet. I think it's inappropriate, but he's a totally inappropriate president, said Nancy Pelosi, the top U.S. House of Representatives Democrat. Senator Bob Casey, a Democrat, in a tweet indicated the matter should be referred to the federal Office of Government Ethics. Nordstrom said it informed Ivanka Trump about its decision in early January. Slideshow (3 Images)Over the past year, and particularly in the last half of 2016, sales of the brand have steadily declined to the point where it didn’t make good business sense for us to continue with the line for now, the retailer told Reuters. Nordstrom shares initially fell after the president's criticism, but closed up 4 percent on the New York Stock Exchange. Retailers still selling Ivanka Trump products include Macy's Inc, TJX Cos, Hudson's Bay Co, which runs high-end chains like Lord & Taylor, and Dillard's Inc. Retailers that have dropped Ivanka Trump include Neiman Marcus [NMRCUS.UL]. HSN Inc has stopped selling Trump Home products, but still sells Trump presidential memorabilia. The move by some retailers to drop her products comes amid an ongoing campaign called #GrabYourWallet, which encourages shoppers to boycott products with ties to President Trump, his family and his donors. Usage of the hashtag on Twitter rose dramatically on Wednesday.  President Trump said he is going to have nothing to do with his family businesses, said Robert Weissman, president of liberal watchdog group Public Citizen. His reaction to developments with his daughter's business line suggests that claim is untrue. Trump's tweet left fellow Republicans in an uncomfortable position. Republican Senator David Perdue of Georgia told Reuters of Trump's tweet, That sounds like a personal matter to me. Perdue added, He is a citizen and he is a citizen who is now president of the United States. Republican Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, asked whether the president should be criticizing a publicly traded company over its business dealings with Trump's daughter, said, I don't know the answer to that question. Let me think about what the answer is. Since winning the presidential election on Nov. 8, Trump has castigated specific companies on Twitter but this was his first tweet involving a business tied to his family since the victory.  A group including former White House ethics attorneys filed a lawsuit after Trump took office accusing him of allowing his businesses to accept payments from foreign governments, in violation of the U.S. Constitution.

The new Accord, like rival Toyota Motor Corp's all-new Camry launching this month, is expected to offer major improvements in fuel economy, technology, styling and safety, according to Honda's U.S. dealers. Honda declined to discuss details ahead of Friday's event in Detroit. The Accord and Camry are pillars of their manufacturers' U.S. businesses, each selling well over 300,000 vehicles a year. In the coming months, Nissan Motor Co Ltd is expected to launch a new Altima midsize sedan, and Hyundai Motor Co <005380.KS will launch a new Sonata midsize car. Both are popular marques that will be promoted heavily. There has been no new news on the midsize sedan side for three years and we think this is a great opportunity to bring attention back to the segment, said Jack Hollis, Toyota's head of marketing for North America. Year to date, U.S. passenger car sales are down 11.4 percent and sales of midsize sedans are down 14.2 percent. Still, Americans bought 7.1 million sedans in 2016. With General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co cutting sedan production, and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV abandoning the segment, Honda and its Asian rivals could boost sales with updated models, dealers said. They could take share from other brands, which is traditionally what happens when a new product is launched, said Pete DeLongchamps, vice president for manufacturer relations at Group 1 Automotive Inc, the third-largest U.S. auto dealer group. Not Finding a Place With Consumers The Accord for years was Honda's top-selling model in the United States. Within the past year, U.S. sales of the Honda CR-V compact utility vehicle have eclipsed the aging Accord as Honda has expanded production capacity for the former. Passenger car sales have steadily declined since 2012 when they made up 51.2 percent of the U.S. market. Sedans have sagged to a 38.1 percent share in the first half of this year. IHS Markit said U.S. consumer loyalty to SUVs and pickup trucks has risen since 2012, but declined for sedans. (For a graphic, see: tmsnrt.rs/2tNZJ9J) The new Accord and Camry may stem the decline, said IHS Markit's Tom Libby. I don't think they will cause a marked reverse. Improvements to the Accord should boost sales at Galpin Honda in San Fernando, California, general manager Ed Hartoonian said. The dealership sells about 500 Accords and Civics, combined, per month and Accord sales are up nearly 13 percent so far this year, he said. As a dealer we can't ask for much more.

The Gulf airline, which owns almost 30 percent of Air Berlin, appointed a new chief executive in May in a move analysts said gave it a chance to rethink expansion plans that have involved buying minority stakes in airlines. Etihad said it had not been able to reach agreement on the nature of the venture despite many months of negotiations. TUI said Niki was no longer available for a deal. Etihad and TUI declined to give further details. One source familiar with the issue said: The deal didn’t work out because it didn't make sense for Niki, it didn’t add up.  The logo of of German travel company TUI AG is seen outside of one of its branch offices in Vienna, Austria, December 27, 2016.Leonhard FoegerTUI said in a statement that a strong European leisure airline would make sense given overcapacity especially in the German market. We will push the repositioning of TUIfly further ahead in order to develop long-term prospects for the airline and its employees, TUI executive board member Sebastian Ebel said, adding it remained open for partnerships and joint ventures. Air Berlin had already received 300 million euros ($337 million) from Etihad for Niki, Air Berlin had said in its annual report. Etihad said the leisure operations of Air Berlin group would continue to operate as a separate business unit under the Niki brand. Further details of this structure will be announced in due course by Air Berlin, Etihad said. Etihad named Ray Gammell as interim CEO and also appointed a new interim group financial officer following the failure of Alitalia, in which the Gulf airline had a 49 percent stake.  Alitalia sought bankruptcy protection with $3.3 billion of debt. Since 2011, Abu Dhabi state-owned Etihad has spent billions of dollars buying minority stakes from Europe to Australia in a race catch up with regional rivals Emirates and Qatar Airways. Shares in TUI AG were down 1 pct at 1,154 pence by 1430 GMT (10:30 a.m. ET), while shares in Air Berlin shed 7.6 percent to 0.8350 euros. Separately, Air Berlin said on Thursday it had asked the German states of North-Rhine Westphalia and Berlin to consider granting possible loan guarantees.

The strong interest in CST underscores the wave of consolidation sweeping the North American convenience store sector, as retailers try to cope with low profit margins and find savings through gaining scale. Couche-Tard and Seven & i, the owner of U.S. convenience store chain 7-Eleven, are competing against several other bidders for CST, including a consortium of private equity firms Blackstone Group LP (BX.N) and Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), the people said.  CST will seek at least one more round of offers before deciding if will sell itself, the people cautioned. The sources asked not to be named because details of the sale process are confidential.  A Seven & i spokesman denied it made an offer, saying it was not interested in buying the entire company although 7-Eleven earlier this year bought 76 CST stores in California and three stores in Wyoming for $408 million. CST and Blackstone declined to comment, while Couche-Tard and Apollo did not immediately respond to requests for comment. CST shares rose over 18 percent to $44.95 on the news, giving the company a market capitalization of around $3.4 billion. CST, spun off from Valero Energy Corp (VLO.N) in 2013, is one of the largest publicly traded fuel retailers in North America.  Based in San Antonio, Texas, CST owns and operates convenience stores and gas stations in Canada and the U.S. It also controls the general partner of gas station company CrossAmerica Partners LP (CAPL.N). CST has been working with investment banks JP Morgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) and Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) to explore a sale after coming under pressure from activist investors JCP Investment Management and Engine Capital LP.  A sale of CST would follow similar deals in the sector. In 2014, Marathon Petroleum Corp's (MPC.N) subsidiary Speedway acquired oil and gas company Hess Corp's  (HES.N) retail operations and other assets for $2.82 billion.  Last March, Couche-Tard closed its acquisition of The Pantry, a Cary, North Carolina-based convenience store chain, in a deal valued at $1.7 billion, including debt.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-autos-taxi-idUSKBN19W14V","New electric London cabs to make foreign debut in Amsterdam","","July 11, 2017 /  11:16 AM / in 17 days","","LONDON (Reuters) - A new electric version of London's classic black cabs will be exported to Amsterdam next year, its first overseas market, and the firm could source the batteries in Britain, the head of the Chinese-owned London Taxi Company (LTC) told Reuters on Tuesday. LTC, which will formally change its name to the London EV Company later this year, is undergoing a rapid expansion since it was bought by China's Geely in 2013, opening a central English plant in Coventry, earlier this year. By the turn of the decade it hopes to sell to overseas markets 50 percent of the roughly 10,000 vehicles to be produced each year, including a van which could begin production in 2019, and has been showing the new electric plug-in hybrid taxi in a number of European cities. Chief Executive Chris Gubbey said the firm had picked the Netherlands as its first export market due to its receptiveness to new technology and the new model's compatibility with the needs of disabled people, including its ramp and high roof.  It is a city that is very progressive in terms of protecting and improving its air quality, he told Reuters.  They just recognise what the product can do for their market: the accessibility, the ease of getting in and out, he said. Dutch firm RMC is buying 225 vehicles which Amsterdammers will not be able to hail but will be instead used as a part of a service to transport the elderly and disabled, including to and from hospital, and could soon also be used in Rotterdam.  The TX model will go into full production later this year, ready to reach the first customers in around November, with a third of components British and the rest built abroad, including a Korean battery and Chinese engine.  The British car industry has boosted local content in recent years, reaching 44 percent, but the level remains short of the 55 percent stipulated in the kinds of bilateral trade agreements Britain will need to strike as it leaves the European Union.  The country is currently deficient in battery and electric vehicle production capacities compared with other major markets but ministers are pushing to boost infrastructure and could shortly approve its first electric car battery hub.  Gubbey, who was at an industry event in May where the proposals were made to Britain's business minister, said the firm could source batteries locally if such schemes came to fruition. There are opportunities to move batteries towards the UK, he told Reuters. The government is very focussed on that, even local to us, with the technology park that they are talking of putting in a manufacturing capability, he said.   As the firm grows and with fellow Geely-owned brand Volvo raising 5 billion Swedish crowns ($590 million) from a group of investors in a step towards a share market flotation, Gubbey told Reuters there were no plans at present for the cab-maker to also move in the direction of a share listing.  We have no definitive timing or plan to pursue an IPO at this stage, he said.   In the future, if that proves the right thing to do, I'm sure it's what Geely will look at.

Market turnover stayed thin on the last trading day before the Lunar New Year, China's biggest holiday, starting on Friday. Markets will be closed for a week and will reopen on Feb. 3. Hong Kong stocks rallied and were poised for four days of gains, drawing inspiration from the Dow Jones Industrial Average breaching the 20,000-point level for the first time on Wednesday. Sentiment was also helped by a weaker U.S. dollar, easing fears of capital outflows from the city. In China, the blue-chip CSI300 index rose 0.3 percent, to 3,387.16 points at the end of the morning session, while the Shanghai Composite Index gained 0.1 percent, to 3,153.77 points. Blue chip shares have gained almost 1 percent so far this week. Investors are in a holiday mood now, said Cao Xuefeng, head of research at Huaxi Securities in Chengdu, noting the market is traditionally firm ahead of the Lunar New year. But bullish sentiment was partly offset by China's profit growth earned by industrial firms in December, which eased sharply to 2.3 percent compared with November's 14.5 percent. Cao said the slower pace was due to a cooling property market and seasonal factors as many workers had already left the factories for their home towns ahead of the new year. The path of U.S. interest rate rises, Trump's policies to China, whether he will brand China a currency manipulator, is there going to be a trade war - all these will affect the economy in China this year, Cao said, adding that it was hard to predict Trump's next move. He plays against the rules. He isn't like former U.S. presidents. Sector performance was mixed in China. An index tracking the industrial sector lost 0.1 percent at midday after briefly hitting a two-week high in early trade. Banks were among best gainers on the mainland. An index tracking the sector was up nearly 0.8 percent, after China's banking regulator reported that commercial banks' non-performing loan (NPL) ratio stood at 1.74 percent at the end of 2016, basically flat from end of the third quarter. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index added 1.4 percent, to 23,365.01 points, while the Hong Kong China Enterprises Index  gained 1.4 percent, to 9,875.77 points. The Dow surged on Wednesday as solid earnings and optimism over President Donald Trump's pro-growth initiatives revitalised a post-election rally. Sectors gained across the board at midday, with tech stocks  and real estate developers among the best performers. Hong Kong exchanges will be closed on Jan. 30 and 31 for the Lunar New Year.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/fox-ailes-obituary-idUSL2N0GO1PP","Scandal-plagued Fox News founder Roger Ailes dead at 77","","May 18, 2017 /  1:32 PM / 2 months ago","","May 18 (Reuters) - Roger Ailes, who became one of the most powerful figures in both U.S. politics and media by turning the Fox News network into a booming voice for conservatives before he was brought down by sexual harassment charges, has died at the age of 77. Ailes worked as a media strategist for Republican Presidents Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush before launching Fox News in 1996. His wife Elizabeth said in a statement on Thursday he was a patriot who was profoundly grateful for the opportunities his country gave him. As founder, chairman and chief executive officer of Fox News, Ailes became one of the most influential figures in the Republican Party, and the network was integral to U.S. President Donald Trump's successful run for the White House in 2016. From the start, Ailes had a clear conservative vision of what he wanted Fox to be as he took the network to the top of the cable news ratings and made it a major profit center for Rupert Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox Inc media empire. But accusations of Ailes' treatment of women would be his downfall. In July 2016, Gretchen Carlson, a former Miss America who appeared on the popular Fox and Friends morning program before being given her own show, sued him. She said he had made sexual advances toward her and then hurt her career in retaliation after she rejected him. Two weeks later, Ailes was ousted from the network with a $40 million severance package. His departure came during the Republican National Convention and at a time when the network was scoring record ratings. Shortly afterward, he began advising the Trump campaign. Ailes had run Fox News under the slogan fair and balanced and conservatives found it a much-needed antidote to the perceived liberal slant of traditional media. Critics denounced it as a cynical and polarizing right-wing propaganda machine. He helped market a brand of pseudo-journalism that revolves basically around hate, rhetoric, divisiveness, pitting people against each other, Eric Boehlert, senior fellow at liberal media watchdog Media Matters for America, told Reuters. That seeps into the culture and into politics. The story of Fox News was the story of Ailes. His conservative red-white-and-blue beliefs set the narrative for the network's stories, and critics said it was difficult to determine where Ailes' agenda ended and Republican Party talking points began. No potential Republican presidential candidate stood much of a chance without Ailes' blessing. I want to elect the next president, he told Fox executives at a 2010 meeting, according to the 2014 biography The Loudest Voice in the Room by Gabriel Sherman, a writer for New York magazine. Ailes' power and ruthlessness ... allowed him to take over the Republican Party and mold it to fit his paranoid world view, Sherman told the Washington Post in 2016.

The government of California and China's Ministry of Science and Technology will work together to develop and commercialize know-how on carbon capture and storage, clean energy, and information technology to rein in greenhouse gases, according to a Tuesday statement.       President Trump's announcement of the pull-out from the 2015 Paris agreement on climate change was branded as insane by California governor Jerry Brown, who was visiting China this week. The withdrawal decision was seen to have handed the political and diplomatic initiative to China, which has continued to pledge its unqualified support for the accord. Related CoverageCalifornia governor says climate change could be more dangerous than fascismThe failure of leadership by the United States was only temporary, Brown told reporters on the sidelines of a clean energy forum in Beijing on Tuesday, adding that science and the market would be required to get past it. U.S. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry, who was at the same conference, declined to take questions from reporters.     In an earlier speech, Brown had criticized those still resisting reality.

Slideshow (8 Images)Joint pledges by China and the United States ahead of the Paris talks helped create the momentum to secure a global agreement, and included a promise by China to set up a nationwide emissions trading exchange by this year.    Brown told Reuters last week that he would discuss linking China's carbon trading platforms with California's, the biggest in the United States.  However, China's priority is to focus on its own carbon market which is big enough and complex enough, Ma Aimin, of the National Centre for Climate Change Strategy and International Cooperation, told the same energy forum.   Despite China discussing for a long time about linking up with foreign markets, they are still at the stage of talking about it, added Ma, a deputy director general of the body, which is backed by the Chinese government. It will be a long time before there is true cooperation with California, whose market is just at a regional stage and is hard to link up with the Chinese market.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-volkswagen-results-idUSKCN0YM0LK","Cost squeeze helps VW brand back to profit after diesel debacle","","May 31, 2016 /  7:10 AM / a year ago","","BERLIN (Reuters) - Volkswagen's (VOWG_p.DE) mass-market VW brand returned to profit in the first quarter, in a sign deep cost cutting is starting to revive the business at the heart of the German carmaker's emissions test cheating scandal.  Europe's biggest motor manufacturer said on Tuesday group underlying operating profit fell 5.9 percent to 3.1 billion euros ($3.5 billion) in the quarter.  That was better than analysts' average forecast of 2.8 billion euros, as demand for upmarket Audi and Porsche models offset a drop in sales at the mass-market VW brand.  But Volkswagen said it was still braced for a tough year as it battles to rebuild following the biggest business crisis in its 79 year history.  Volkswagen plunged to a record loss last year after making provisions at a group level to cover the costs of the diesel emissions scandal and ditched its long-standing CEO after it admitted in September to cheating tests in the United States.  It has set aside 16.2 billion euros to cover vehicle refits and a settlement with U.S. authorities, but still faces potential U.S. Justice Department fines and questions over who was responsible for the cheating, with investigations ongoing.  The company has been slashing costs by using more common parts across its range of models, investing in electric vehicles and working on a new business structure aimed at improving accountability and speeding up model development.  The VW brand, the group's largest by revenues, which was struggling with high costs and weak sales even before the emissions scandal, showed some signs of improvement.  It swung to a 73 million euro profit, having made a loss of 127 million euros in the previous quarter. But that was still well down on a profit of 514 million in the first quarter of 2015, with revenues down 4.6 percent and an operating margin of just 0.3 percent. Related CoverageVW's European recall takes longer as only 50,000 cars fixedThis compares with a 9.3 percent margin at Volkswagen's Czech division Skoda and 2.6 percent at Spanish brand Seat, which has long been grappling with losses. Finance chief Frank Witter warned of a long road to recovery, saying that while the VW brand was committed to boosting its margin to 2 percent this year, it was unrealistic to expect to it hit its long-standing 6 percent target by 2018.  The situation is on our radar and it is among the highest priorities within the organization, Witter said on a call. Moving the VW brand into sustainable profit is key for the strategic overhaul underway at VW following years of strong volume growth and spiraling costs. Volkswagen is counting on steps to streamline vehicle development to adapt the VW brand more quickly to market trends, speed up cost cuts and expand modular platforms to boost common parts and production flexibility. A VW sign is seen outside a Volkswagen dealership in London, Britain November 5, 2015.Suzanne Plunkett/File photoThis is an ongoing complex task, he said.    Volkswagen shares, which hit an 8-month high heading into the results, were down 1.6 percent at 135.70 euros at 1452 GMT (10.52 a.m. ET). We continue to view VW as a huge restructuring opportunity and nothing from Q1 changes that view, said Evercore ISI analyst Arndt Ellinghorst who has a buy rating on the shares.  Others are more wary, with DZ Bank analysts saying the prospect of further scandal-related costs led them to retain a skeptical view on Volkswagen, which did not make any further provisions in the first quarter. Its turnaround plan has come under close scrutiny recently from activist investor TCI, which has urged it to speed up and extend restructuring efforts. Contrasting Views Group results at the 12-brand company were supported by broadly flat sales at flagship luxury brand Audi and a big rise in both sales and profits at sports car maker Porsche.  Higher demand in western Europe and the Asia-Pacific also helped to offset declines in South America and eastern Europe. However, Volkswagen reported a 25 percent plunge in operating profit at its two Chinese joint ventures - which are not included in quarterly results.  Analysts have said heightened competition in China has led the company to step up incentives for buyers ahead of the expiry of tax breaks for smaller cars at the end of this year. Quarterly sales in China, Volkswagen's biggest market, rose 6.4 percent after falling in 2015.    Including one-off items, group operating profit rose 3.4 percent to 3.4 billion euros. That was helped by 300 million euros of currency-related adjustments to provisions. Volkswagen said net liquidity at its automotive division was 26 billion euros at the end of March, around 1.4 billion higher than at the end of 2015, bolstering its finances ahead of an expected bond issue to replace expensive bank loans.  The company reiterated guidance issued in April for sales to fall this year by up to 5 percent and for a group underlying operating margin of 5-6 percent, versus 6 percent in 2015.

Although officially atheist, China selected Gyaltsen Norbu as the 11th Panchen Lama in 1995 in a drive to win the hearts and minds of Tibetans. Tibet's current spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, whom Beijing brands a dangerous separatist, had announced his own choice of a six-year-old boy, but he was taken away by authorities and has since vanished from public view. In a message to mark the Tibetan lunar new year, carried by the United Front Work Department which helps oversee religious groups, China's Panchen Lama discussed six months of Buddhist activities he carried out in Tibet last year. My deepest impression after the inspection tour was that Tibet's ethnic and religious policies have been carried out very well, he said in comments carried late on Monday. At the same time, the party has formulated a series of special beneficial policies, and the vast majority of Tibetans have received real benefit. After seeing this I felt very happy, he said. He added that he visited herders, where he got to understand the changes that have taken place for Tibetans. This has made me even more confident in Tibet's tomorrow, he said. China has gradually exposed its Panchen Lama in public roles in the hope he will achieve the respect commanded by the Dalai Lama among Tibetans and globally. He made his first trip outside mainland China in 2012, when he visited Hong Kong. Chinese troops marched into Tibet in 1950. China routinely rejects criticism of its rule there, saying it has brought much-needed development to a remote region and that it respects Tibet's culture and religion. After the Dalai Lama fled to India in 1959, the 10th Panchen Lama stayed on and was initially seen as a collaborator. It later emerged that his criticism of Beijing had earned him more than a decade spent either in prison or under house arrest. Freed in 1977, he was politically rehabilitated the following year, and died in 1989. Reporting by Ben Blanchard; Editing by Paul Tait"

Dozens of models paraded down the catwalk wearing vibrantly colored over-sized pants and big hooped earrings with metallic make up. Christopher Kunz, who comprises half of the sibling duo behind the street-wear label, said he was surprised to see so many guests show up for his show during the storm, which dumped roughly 14 inches (36 cm) on the city, turning Manhattan into a slippery mess. His sister, Nicholas Kunz, said they chose a hip hop theme because they felt the 1990s represented communal activism and ethnic diversity, issues that are increasingly relevant after the recent election of U.S. President Donald Trump. I think there was some strong messages in the 90's hip hop era. It was all about communal activism, ethnic diversity, equality, Kunz said. We've always been about diversity and environmental things. It's really disheartening to see things going backwards in those two areas for us.

The canvas compound known as “Tent City” in southwest Phoenix, long branded inhumane by civil rights groups, was no longer needed to handle the inmate population, new Maricopa Sheriff Paul Penzone said. “This facility is not a crime deterrent, it is not cost efficient and it is not tough on criminals,” said Penzone, who took office in January after beating Arpaio in last year's election. He projected $4.5 million savings from closing Tent City.  Penzone said the jail had become a circus that inmates preferred, rather than a prudent law enforcement tool to house law-breakers. “Starting today that circus ends and these tents come down,” he told reporters at a news conference, adding that inmate transfers would begin in 45 to 60 days. “We’re going to give these criminals what they don’t want.” The decision comes after Penzone appointed a committee in January to determine the fate of the outdoor facility, which opened in August 1993 with surplus military tents.

A string of politicians and visitors from across the world have toured the sun-scorched facility erected adjacent to a brick-and-mortar jail.  FILE PHOTO: An inmate serving a jail sentence rests on his bed at Maricopa County's Tent City jail in Phoenix, Arizona, U.S. on July 30, 2010.Joshua Lott/File PhotoArpaio, who became known for his anti-illegal immigration stance and jail practices such as making inmates wear pink underwear and eat green bologna, vowed the jail would never close under his watch. Alessandra Soler, executive director of the ACLU of Arizona, called the closure a “good step forward” but that still more work was needed. “Maricopa County’s jails are plagued by the mistreatment of pre-trial detainees and remain under federal court oversight because of the ongoing abuse of people with mental health problems,” said Soler, in a statement. The dollars saved by the closure should be used for programs and services that address these and other problems, she added. Arpaio, 84, was ousted in November after serving 24 years as sheriff. He faces a criminal contempt trial on April 25 for violating the orders of a federal judge in a racial profiling case. Arpaio declined to comment for this story.

The new Accord, like rival Toyota Motor Corp's all-new Camry launching this month, is expected to offer major improvements in fuel economy, technology, styling and safety, according to Honda's U.S. dealers. Honda declined to discuss details ahead of Friday's event in Detroit. The Accord and Camry are pillars of their manufacturers' U.S. businesses, each selling well over 300,000 vehicles a year. In the coming months, Nissan Motor Co Ltd is expected to launch a new Altima midsize sedan, and Hyundai Motor Co <005380.KS will launch a new Sonata midsize car. Both are popular marques that will be promoted heavily. There has been no new news on the midsize sedan side for three years and we think this is a great opportunity to bring attention back to the segment, said Jack Hollis, Toyota's head of marketing for North America. Year to date, U.S. passenger car sales are down 11.4 percent and sales of midsize sedans are down 14.2 percent. Still, Americans bought 7.1 million sedans in 2016. With General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co cutting sedan production, and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV abandoning the segment, Honda and its Asian rivals could boost sales with updated models, dealers said. They could take share from other brands, which is traditionally what happens when a new product is launched, said Pete DeLongchamps, vice president for manufacturer relations at Group 1 Automotive Inc, the third-largest U.S. auto dealer group. Not Finding a Place With Consumers The Accord for years was Honda's top-selling model in the United States. Within the past year, U.S. sales of the Honda CR-V compact utility vehicle have eclipsed the aging Accord as Honda has expanded production capacity for the former. Passenger car sales have steadily declined since 2012 when they made up 51.2 percent of the U.S. market. Sedans have sagged to a 38.1 percent share in the first half of this year. IHS Markit said U.S. consumer loyalty to SUVs and pickup trucks has risen since 2012, but declined for sedans. (For a graphic, see: tmsnrt.rs/2tNZJ9J) The new Accord and Camry may stem the decline, said IHS Markit's Tom Libby. I don't think they will cause a marked reverse. Improvements to the Accord should boost sales at Galpin Honda in San Fernando, California, general manager Ed Hartoonian said. The dealership sells about 500 Accords and Civics, combined, per month and Accord sales are up nearly 13 percent so far this year, he said. As a dealer we can't ask for much more.

From today's perspective, we will not develop any more new generation diesel engines, Samuelsson told German's Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung in an interview. However, a Volvo Cars spokesman said on Wednesday Samuelsson had been discussing options rather than a firm plan to stop the further development of diesel engines. Samuelsson later said in a statement emailed to Reuters he believed diesel would still play a crucial role in the next few years in helping the company meet targets to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide, being more fuel-efficient than petrol engines. We have just launched a brand new generation of petrol and diesel engines, highlighting our commitment to this technology. As a result, a decision on the development of a new generation of diesel engines is not required, he said. In the FAZ interview Samuelsson said Volvo would continue improving the current range, first introduced in 2013, to meet future emissions standards, with production likely to go on until about 2023. And until 2020 he said diesel would be needed to help meet carbon dioxide emission limits set by the European Union, but after that other regulations would come into play, with the costs of making engines compliant with ever higher anti-pollution standards meaning it would no longer be worth it. Instead, Volvo will invest in the electric and hybrid cars, with its first pure electric model due on the market in 2019. We have to recognize that Tesla (TSLA.O) has managed to offer such a car for which people are lining up. In this area, there should also be space for us, with high quality and attractive design, Samuelsson said. Samuelsson has previously said that tighter emissions rules will push up the price of diesel-engined cars to the point where plug-in hybrids will become an attractive alternative. The average carbon dioxide emissions limit for European carmakers' fleets will need to fall from 130 grams per kilometer to 95 grams in 2021, forcing them to invest more in  exhaust emissions technology. Diesel cars account for over 50 percent of all new  registrations in Europe, making the region by far the world's biggest diesel market. Volvo, owned by China's Geely (0175.HK), sells 90 percent of its XC 90 offroaders in Europe with diesel engines. The scandal over Volkwagen's (VOWG_p.DE) cheating of U.S. environmental tests to mask emissions of nitrogen oxides, which can cause or aggravate respiratory disease, means manufacturers are facing intense scrutiny over the true level of pollutants being emitted by their cars. Goldman Sachs believes a regulatory crackdown could add 300 euros ($325) per engine to diesel costs that are already some 1,300 euros above their petrol-powered equivalents, as carmakers race to bring real NOx emissions closer to their much lower test-bench scores.

Hosszu, whose home city of Budapest hosts the World Aquatics Championship next month, spoke up after the international swimming body FINA recently introduced new restrictions to the annual World Cup pro series. One of the sport's biggest stars, Hosszu has honed her brand for years and cashed in on the pro circuit, raking in dozens of golds and prize money north of $300,000 in each of the past three seasons, while also collecting Olympic and World titles. Her dominance has been so strong that swimming insiders saw the rule changes - limiting the number of events each athlete can enter and mixing up events from contest to contest - as directed at her specifically. The World Cup has huge potential, but the planned new rule changes are destructive and hypocritical, Hosszu wrote on her Facebook page. These rules are risking the future of our sport. She said individuals' dominance was a fact of life in pro sports and should not be artificially weakened, noting this did not happen in pro basketball or tennis events. Will the NBA limit one of its biggest stars, LeBron James, in his eighth participation in the big final next year? Will the ATP try to remind (Rafael) Nadal and (Roger) Federer that their time is over? FILE PHOTO Hungarian swimmer Katinka Hosszu blows a bubble ring at a training session in Budapest, Hungary July 15, 2015.Laszlo Balogh/File photoBoycott?

We have to stand up for what we believe in... Even the biggest, most prestigious event is worthless without the best athletes. FINA declined to comment on Wednesday on Hosszu's remarks. Swim Vortex, a major swimming magazine, dismissed Hosszu's criticisms as self-serving after the rule changes, which were widely seen as trying to break her dominance to make the pro series more open and attractive to viewers. The magazine agreed FINA's sway over the sport could be reduced but said alternatives were already operational in the fledgling World Swimming Association and the Professional Swimmers' Association.

The South Korean automaker also said it would launch an electric version of the Kona small SUV next year and a new large SUV by 2020 in a bid to catch up with rivals in the booming SUV segment. Hyundai looks like missing its annual sales target for a third consecutive year due to the unpopularity of its mainstay small sedans and political tensions between Beijing and Seoul which have battered sales in China, its biggest market. The automaker previously sold subcompact SUVs only in emerging markets, missing out on strong growth in the segment in South Korea, the United States and Europe. The subcompact SUV segment is the top-performing segment, growing an annual average of 46 percent from 2010 to 2016, Hyundai said, citing IHS Automotive data. In South Korea, the Kona, which is positioned below Hyundai's Tucson compact SUV, features a 1.6-litre gasoline or diesel engine and competes with Ssangyong Motor's Tivoli, Renault's QM3 and GM's Trax. Hyundai is targeting annual production of 135,000 Kona models in South Korea next year, after shifting some output of lower-margin Accent cars to Kia Motors' factory in Mexico, a source told Reuters. Hyundai and its affiliate Kia in January said they aimed to increase global sales by 5 percent this year, but their combined sales fell 7 percent from January to May this year, hit by slowing sales in China and the United States. In China, negative sentiment stemming from Seoul's decision to deploy a U.S. anti-missile system exacerbated its sales fall in the country, where it is already suffering from a lack of SUV line-ups and poor brand perception. In the United States, the automaker was one of the poorest performers through May, with sales down 4.8 percent in a market that fell 2.1 percent. The U.S. safety regulator has launched a probe into whether Hyundai and Kia recalled 1.7 million vehicles in a timely manner. In South Korea, its sales were nearly flat this year. Kia will join Hyundai in launching its subcompact SUV, Stonic, starting next month. The South Korean duo also plans to roll out full electric versions of the Kona next year, another person familiar with the plan previously told Reuters.

The firm, which shares facilities and its brand with the Formula One team but is a separate legal entity, will begin building the facility in Sheffield, northern England, early this year with full production due to begin by 2020. The investment of nearly 50 million pounds ($62 million)  will be the firm's first purpose-built site away from its headquarters in the southern English town of Woking and will save it around 10 million pounds per year once it is fully operational. The carbon fibre chassis, which helps to keep the top-end sports cars as light as possible, is currently built by a supplier in Austria with the firm saying it now made sense to make them in Britain. We have been investigating this for over two years, a spokesman told Reuters. This and the engine are strategically the most important parts of the cars and this is us taking control of the production, supply and quality of this vitally important component, he said. The site will be built in cooperation with the University of Sheffield and the local city council. Prime Minister Theresa May's comments last month that when Britain leaves the European Union it will also leave the single market, which protects unfettered trade, has prompted renewed concerns from carmakers about potential barriers to trade. McLaren said building it chassis in Britain will increase the average value of British parts in its models from around 50 percent to 58 percent, depending on the vehicle. McLaren Automotive, which began building cars only in 2011, has grown rapidly and is aiming to double the number of hand-made models it builds to over 3,000 this year. The firm currently makes all of its high-end models, which range from just over 120,000 pounds ($150,000) to around 2 million pounds depending on customisation, at its Woking site  and exports 92 percent of its output.

Many designers at the semi-annual event, which  begins on Thursday, will preview 2017 fall/winter apparel that will land in stores months from now. But others will follow a trend that started last year and show in-season designs for spring/summer that consumers can snap up immediately. We're also seeing a lot of designers show spring as well with their 'see now/buy now' collection, said Katrina Mitzeliotis, fashion director at celebrity and style website HollywoodLife.com. There is more diversity than ever before in what's coming down the runway. Designers Tommy Hilfiger, Tom Ford and a few others featured in-season looks at last September's Fashion Week, months ahead of when the fashion world was accustomed to seeing them. Look for plenty of mashups, or mixed fabrics that appear to be thrown together with studied casualness, to grace Fashion Week runways this season, said Roseanne Morrison, fashion director of The Doneger Group. She expects plenty of pant suits and outfits with a tailored look, too. I am sure a lot of the fabrics will be lighter in weight because most of the designers are addressing seasonless, or 'see now/buy now' concept, because nobody is really buying for three months ahead, she said. While the idea has picked up steam, Catherine Bennett, senior vice president, managing director of IMG fashion events, cautioned that it is not a business model for everyone. It's really a personal decision for each designer, she explained. It's a great solution for some brands but not for others. But diversity may extend beyond the fashions at Fashion Week, which organizers said attracts about 100,000 people and generates $880 million in revenue for New York City. Last season more than 25 percent of the models in shows in New York, London, Paris and Milan were women of color, according to a study by thefashionspot.com website. New York led the way, with 30.3 percent, and that could rise this year. The city's Fashion Week also featured the most plus-size models in recent history, more women over 50 years old and a slight increase in transgender models, with 10 appearances. We're seeing diversity more and more in fashion, whether it is race or size, said Mitzeliotis. Fashion experts hope the trend will continue and make the shows more inclusive, broadening the appeal of the fashions. This year IMG, the organizer of Fashion Week, has moved the shows from midtown venues to the SoHo neighborhood of lower Manhattan. Although some designers will still present their collections at venues in other parts of Manhattan, the bulk of the shows are scheduled for three galleries at Skylight Clarkson Square and the presentation space Industria.

The strong interest in CST underscores the wave of consolidation sweeping the North American convenience store sector, as retailers try to cope with low profit margins and find savings through gaining scale. Couche-Tard and Seven & i, the owner of U.S. convenience store chain 7-Eleven, are competing against several other bidders for CST, including a consortium of private equity firms Blackstone Group LP (BX.N) and Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), the people said.  CST will seek at least one more round of offers before deciding if will sell itself, the people cautioned. The sources asked not to be named because details of the sale process are confidential.  A Seven & i spokesman denied it made an offer, saying it was not interested in buying the entire company although 7-Eleven earlier this year bought 76 CST stores in California and three stores in Wyoming for $408 million. CST and Blackstone declined to comment, while Couche-Tard and Apollo did not immediately respond to requests for comment. CST shares rose over 18 percent to $44.95 on the news, giving the company a market capitalization of around $3.4 billion. CST, spun off from Valero Energy Corp (VLO.N) in 2013, is one of the largest publicly traded fuel retailers in North America.  Based in San Antonio, Texas, CST owns and operates convenience stores and gas stations in Canada and the U.S. It also controls the general partner of gas station company CrossAmerica Partners LP (CAPL.N). CST has been working with investment banks JP Morgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) and Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) to explore a sale after coming under pressure from activist investors JCP Investment Management and Engine Capital LP.  A sale of CST would follow similar deals in the sector. In 2014, Marathon Petroleum Corp's (MPC.N) subsidiary Speedway acquired oil and gas company Hess Corp's  (HES.N) retail operations and other assets for $2.82 billion.

As part of the deal outlined last year, Etihad planned to buy Air Berlin's (AB1.DE) leisure airline Niki before combining the business with TUI's airline TUIfly. The Gulf airline, which owns almost 30 percent of Air Berlin, appointed a new chief executive in May in a move analysts said gave it a chance to rethink expansion plans that have involved buying minority stakes in airlines. Etihad said it had not been able to reach agreement on the nature of the venture despite many months of negotiations. TUI said Niki was no longer available for a deal. Etihad and TUI declined to give further details. One source familiar with the issue said: The deal didn’t work out because it didn't make sense for Niki, it didn’t add up.  The logo of of German travel company TUI AG is seen outside of one of its branch offices in Vienna, Austria, December 27, 2016.Leonhard FoegerTUI said in a statement that a strong European leisure airline would make sense given overcapacity especially in the German market. We will push the repositioning of TUIfly further ahead in order to develop long-term prospects for the airline and its employees, TUI executive board member Sebastian Ebel said, adding it remained open for partnerships and joint ventures. Air Berlin had already received 300 million euros ($337 million) from Etihad for Niki, Air Berlin had said in its annual report. Etihad said the leisure operations of Air Berlin group would continue to operate as a separate business unit under the Niki brand. Further details of this structure will be announced in due course by Air Berlin, Etihad said. Etihad named Ray Gammell as interim CEO and also appointed a new interim group financial officer following the failure of Alitalia, in which the Gulf airline had a 49 percent stake.  Alitalia sought bankruptcy protection with $3.3 billion of debt. Since 2011, Abu Dhabi state-owned Etihad has spent billions of dollars buying minority stakes from Europe to Australia in a race catch up with regional rivals Emirates and Qatar Airways.

But analysts said the reshuffle looked more like a stop-gap measure rather than an long-term fix as the Apple Inc rival copes with the fallout from the absence of Samsung Group [SAGR.UL] leader Jay Y. Lee.  It appears that Samsung made the changes at a smallest possible scale in order to ensure that its business operations keep running, said Park Ju-gun, head of corporate analysis firm CEO Score. Samsung said Executive Vice President Choi Kyung-sik had been promoted to lead the mobile division's strategic marketing office as part of a shake-up at the product businesses such as smartphones and televisions. Choi's predecessor, Lee Sang-chul, had been reassigned to oversee Southeast Asian operations.  Related CoverageSamsung Electronics to announce personnel moves for components business separatelyKwon Kye-hyun was named head of the China business, where Samsung's smartphone sales have struggled to regain momentum amid competition from the likes of Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL], OPPO and Vivo.  Samsung Electronics typically announces such appointments at the end of a year but it did not do so in December as it was embroiled in the graft scandal that led to Lee's detention and the ouster and arrest of former President Park Geun-hye. Samsung Electronics decided to execute on these appointments in the belief that the organizational metabolism would decline if we delay them any further, the company said in a statement, adding they would minimize uncertainties.  Further executive appointments including in the cash-cow semiconductor division would be announced at a later date, a company spokeswoman said, without saying when. Record Profit in Sight The world's top smartphone maker is expected to deliver record profits this year, on the back of a memory market boom and strong sales of its Galaxy S8 smartphones. The stock is up more than 26 percent in 2017.  Lee's arrest in February has had little financial impact so far, but it has raised doubts about how Samsung will tackle future decisions concerning acquisitions or investments in new businesses that would normally need his approval.  As long as the profits keep rolling in, analysts say Samsung Electronics and other affiliates will likely retain their senior leadership and make minor adjustments in Lee's absence.  Pre-orders for the flagship S8 phone have been better than its predecessor, the firm says, suggesting that consumers have stuck by the brand despite the collapse of the fire-prone Galaxy Note 7 phones last year. But China remains a sore point. Samsung's share of the world's biggest smartphone market fell to 3.3 percent in the first quarter of 2017 from 8.6 percent a year earlier, according to researcher Counterpoint.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/autos-china-geely-idUSL3N17G38M","Operation L: China's Geely to launch new car brand - sources","","April 13, 2016 /  11:27 PM / in a year","","BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese automaker Geely will launch a new brand next year, codenamed L, with cars based on joint architecture developed with Volvo, three people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters. The brand will launch with a sport-utility vehicle - the first model based on the Compact Modular Architecture (CMA) platform developed by Zhejiang Geely Holding Group (0175.HK) and Volvo, the Swedish automaker it bought from Ford (F.N) in 2010. A sedan is also under development for the new brand. Spokesmen for both Geely and Volvo declined to comment. Launching a new car brand when China's economic growth is at its slowest in a quarter of a century may seem ambitious, but Geely, under chairman Li Shufu, beat the industry growth rate last year and has turned around Volvo's fortunes. Geely sales rose 22 percent to around 510,000 cars last year, and Volvo earnings tripled, with the Swedish automaker predicting record sales for 2016. Car sales in China, the world's biggest market, are forecast to grow by around 6 percent this year, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. The aim is for L-brand cars to compete with Chinese-foreign venture brands, such as those produced jointly by General Motors (GM.N) and SAIC Motor Corp (600104.SS). That would leave Volvo to focus on the luxury market, and Geely to go up against domestic Chinese brands, two of the people said. The new brand would launch into an already crowded Chinese market where at least a dozen foreign automakers and more than 20 local passenger car manufacturers, many with multiple brands of their own, compete. The last thing the Chinese automotive world needs is another brand, said James Chao, Asia-Pacific chief of consultancy IHS Automotive. The elimination of more brands in China should be the route. Launching a new brand can cost hundreds of millions of dollars, if not billions, require years of patience and even then would need to be a truly groundbreaking product to succeed, Chao said. A Geely EC Cross concept car is displayed at Auto China 2014 in Beijing in this April 20, 2014 file picture.Jason Lee/FilesBut the potential return could be substantial if Geely can pull it off.  SAIC GM's budget Baojun cars, launched in China in 2011, sold nearly half a million vehicles last year. But other new brands, including Toyota Motor's (7203.T) Scion sub-brand aimed at younger buyers in the United States, have failed to gain traction. Scion was axed as a standalone brand earlier this year. Qoros Automotive, backed by Kenon Holdings (KEN.N) and China's Chery Automobile [CHERY.UL], was founded in 2007 and sold just 14,250 cars last year. People are seen in silhouette near the Volvo auto stand during the media preview of the 2016 New York International Auto Show in Manhattan, New York in this March 24, 2016 file picture.Brendan McDermid/FilesStrategy U-Turn? The new L-brand is something of a U-turn for Geely, which said only two years ago it would eliminate three sub-brands and only sell under the Geely logo, consolidating its sales network in the process. L-brand cars will be sold through Geely's existing dealership network, said one individual with direct knowledge of the plan, unlike previous Geely sub-brands that were sold through separate exclusive dealerships.  New factories will be set up to make cars for the new brand, codenamed after the marque's first initial, and once it is established in China it will export to other markets, the person said. China Euro Vehicle Technology AB, a Geely subsidiary that coordinates research and development with Volvo, is leading the work on the CMA platform from its headquarters in Sweden, with some operations in China. Developing the CMA platform is part of Geely's preparations for a push into European and U.S. markets, sources previously told Reuters. The platform will allow all three brands - Volvo, Geely and L-brand - to design new models from a common base. Reporting by Jake Spring; Editing by Ian Geoghegan"

Asian consumers are the world's biggest spenders on high-end fashion, representing around half of total buyers. Most of them are under 35, Internet-savvy and increasingly on the hunt for small, cool, original brands that will make them stand out and look different from their parents, fashion executives and retailers say. High quality is no longer the preserve of Western luxury brands, fashion experts say, and Asian brands are attracting attention as they experiment with new textiles and materials, facilitated by their local manufacturing base.   This growing threat from the east is likely to add misery to big luxury brands such as Prada (1913.HK), Kering's Bottega Veneta (PRTP.PA) and Tod's (TOD.MI), already suffering from plunging sales, partly due to excessive price increases, over-exposure in certain markets such as China and mega-brand fatigue. Chinese fashion brands, such as Ms Min and Comme moi, are the fastest-growing contemporary design labels sold at department store Lane Crawford, which has outlets throughout China and Hong Kong, its Chairman Andrew Keith told Reuters. Lane Crawford also sells Korean menswear brands such as Woo Young Mi and expects to start selling Korean womenswear soon. You sense there is a pride about seeing China develop its own creative community and seeing China emerge as a creative force, Keith said in an interview on the fringes of the Conde Nast luxury conference in Seoul.  Lane Crawford has seen its pool of Chinese labels grow over the past four years to more than 30, from just four. Twenty percent of Chinese-designed clothes bought online are shipped outside of China mainly to Chinese nationals living abroad who want access to these brands, Keith said.  He estimates that his average customer in mainland China is 25 while in Hong Kong the average age is 35-40. Also high on Asians' shopping list are Japanese brands, such as Sacai and Tsumori Chisato, many of them older and better established than South Korean or Chinese labels. Lady Gaga regularly wears Japan's Roggykei, created in 2006 by two graduates from Osaka College of Design.  Unique Style Seoul, Tokyo and Shanghai all have fast-expanding fashion weeks, sponsored by local industrial groups, showing dozens of budding brands. Some labels have also moved West and started showing at Milan and Paris fashion weeks and opened shops there.   Beijing-based designer Guo Pei, whose yellow long cape dress was worn by Rihanna at the Met Gala last year, started showing at Paris Couture week in January, while Chinese shoe brand Stella Luna, whose stilettos cost more than 500 euros ($565), has three free-standing shops in Paris.  Chinese-born designer Yiqing Yin, whose creations are sold in China, New York and Paris, has won several European fashion awards and has been hailed by the international fashion press as one of the most promising designers of her generation.   Popular Korean brand SJYP, run by duo Steve Jung and Yoni Pai, sells in Europe and the United States, including at Selfridges in London and Opening Ceremony in New York and Los Angeles, while Chinese-born Uma Wang, a graduate of London's Central Saint Martins design school, sells in China and in Europe, including at l'Eclaireur in Paris. She also shows at Milan Fashion week. Before many Asians thought luxury goods had to come from the West, said Lee Seo-hyun, president of Samsung C&T;'s fashion division and daughter of Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) Chairman Lee Kun-hee.     But they are becoming more sophisticated and discerning and now more people are interested in local designers who have their own point of view and unique style. Samsung C&T; (028260.KS), affiliated to Samsung Electronics, maker of Apple rival Galaxy smartphones, is one of the biggest corporate investors in Seoul's up-and-coming fashion scene.      Every year, it gives $100,000 to two or three designers to help them develop their collection and since 2005 has invested $2.7 million in 19 design teams through the Samsung Fashion & Design Fund.      Samsung's fashion unit has a stable of brands, ranging from Korean brand Bean Pole to Belgian fashion label Ann Demeulemeester. Erwan Rambourg, author of the book The Bling Dynasty and luxury goods analyst at HSBC, says Asian brands, even if they are still small and not widely distributed yet, are fast becoming serious competitors for Western brands.  Korean cosmetics have long been popular with Chinese customers and Rambourg notes that popular South Korean television series such as My Love from the Star and Descendents of the Sun, and Korean pop music acts such as Big Bang and Girls' Generation, have helped boost South Korea's image as a trend-setter throughout Asia. While Asian consumers have embraced American culture, Korean pop culture is closer to Chinese culture, says Rambourg.  Koreans' self-esteem and self-confidence has been boosted by the power of 'K culture' and this is also why Korean and other Asian brands have started to become more popular, said Sung-Joo Kim, one of Korea's most high-profile female entrepreneurs. She owns and runs German luxury leather goods brand MCM, known for its $700 studded logo-embossed canvas backpacks.  Kim, who previously developed Gucci's Korean business, also  pointed out that Asian brands cater better to Asian women's more petite shape than Western brands.   Can  we make 'made in Asia, designed in Asia' become cool, I think yes we can because the stigma that Asian brands had is disappearing and we have all the right ingredients and the manufacturing base, said Joowon Park, director at Seoul-based Simone Fashion Company. It manufactures for Western brands including Coach, Michael Kors and Kate Spade.      Asian brands are also attracting interest from Western buyers.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/volkswagen-emissions-audi-idUSL1N1IY2AO","Audi emissions scandal erupts after Germany says it detects new cheating","","June 1, 2017 /  9:20 PM / 2 months ago","","BERLIN (Reuters) - Audi's emissions scandal flared up again on Thursday after the German government accused the carmaker of cheating emissions tests with its top-end models, the first time Audi has been accused of such wrongdoing in its home country. The German Transport Ministry said it has asked Volkswagen's luxury division to recall around 24,000 A7 and A8 models built between 2009 and 2013, about half of which were sold in Germany. VW Chief Executive Matthias Mueller was summoned to the Berlin-based ministry on Thursday, a ministry spokesman said, without elaborating. VW didn't return calls seeking comment. The affected Audi models with so-called Euro-5 emission standards emit about twice the legal limit of nitrogen oxides when the steering wheel is turned more than 15 degrees, the ministry said. It is also the first time that Audi's top-of-the-line A8 saloon has been implicated in emissions cheating. VW has said to date that the emissions-control software found in its rigged EA 189 diesel engine does not violate European law. The 80,000 3.0-liter vehicles affected by VW's emissions cheating scandal in the United States included Audi A6, A7 and Q7 models as well as Porsche and VW brand cars. The ministry said it has issued a June 12 deadline for Audi to come up with a comprehensive plan to refit the cars. Ingolstadt-based Audi issued a recall for the 24,000 affected models late on Thursday, some 14,000 of which are registered in Germany, and said software updates will start in July. It will continue to cooperate with Germany's KBA motor vehicle authority, Audi said. When Audi's headquarters were raided by prosecutors on March 15 in connection with the emissions fraud, Chief Executive Rupert Stadler said investigations into the scandal were far from over, promising to keep at it until the work was done. A source close to Audi said problems in the interaction between transmission and engine control units are to blame for the emissions overshoot. A proposal for a fix has already been submitted to the KBA, the source said, declining to elaborate."

The news also weighed on car retailer stocks. The March sales offered the market a glimpse of the overall health of middle-class American consumers. Car sales in America have risen ever since end of the Great Recession and hit a record last year of 17.55 million. Investors and analysts have been watching for signs that the current boom cycle has begun to wane. Trucks and SUVs pushed sales at some major automakers higher in March at the expense of cars as American consumers continued to shun smaller vehicles amid low gasoline prices. No. 1 U.s. automaker General Motors Co reported a 2 percent increase in sales to just over 256,000 vehicles, with sales of its Tahoe and Suburban SUV models seeing their best sales month since 2008. But sales at Ford Motor Co fell more than 7 percent to 236,000 vehicles, with fleet sales to rental agencies, businesses and government entities down nearly 17 percent on the year. On a conference call, Ford executives said they expected the seasonally adjusted annualized rate (SAAR) for U.S. auto sales of over 17 million vehicles. Analyst polled by Reuters expected a SAAR of 17.3 million vehicles for March. Toyota Motor Corp reported a 2.1 percent decrease in sales, including a decline of more than 7 percent at its luxury Lexus brand. Honda Motor Co Ltd reported an overall decline in sales of 0.7 percent versus March 2016, but said truck sales were up 8.4 percent. Nissan Motor Co Ltd reported a 3.2 percent increase in sales and said sales of its trucks, SUVs and crossovers were up 26 percent and had hit record highs.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/alphabet-cloud-idUSL2N1GL1TR","Google touts new cloud computing clients; analysts skeptical","","March 8, 2017 /  10:25 PM / 5 months ago","","(Reuters) - Alphabet Inc's Google is making progress in taking on cloud computing leaders Amazon.com Incand Microsoft Corp, executives said on Wednesday, as the search engine company stakes more of its future on the cloud as a new source of growth.  At a conference in San Francisco, Google cloud computing chief Diane Greene ticked off a host of new clients, including HSBC, Colgate, Verizon and eBay. The company also announced it had acquired Kaggle, a popular platform for data scientists that could boost Google's edge in the crowded field of artificial intelligence.  Despite the announcements, analysts said Google remains a distant third in the market for cloud computing, the increasingly popular practice of using remote internet servers to store, manage and process data.  “The big challenge Google faces is that, for all the names it announced today, it’s still miles behind Amazon and Microsoft in terms of scale,” said analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research. “It has a long way to go, and a few more client announcements aren’t going to close the gap.”  Those at the event were more impressed with Google's growing prowess in artificial intelligence (AI), long a strength of the company. The audience cheered when Google announced that it would release software tools to identify objects in videos using AI. Kaggle, which will keep operating as an independent brand, reflects Google’s interest in marketplaces for data, said Fei-Fei Li, Google Cloud’s chief scientist of artificial intelligence and machine learning. Kaggle allows companies and researchers to post data and uses crowdsourcing competitions among experts to produce usable models. “What Kaggle has contributed to the community is the democratization of data,” she said.  While analysts expressed caution about Google as a competitor in cloud computing, company executives insisted they are making brisk progress in the market. Alphabet Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt cited the recent initial public offering of Snap, a Google Cloud client, to illustrate the power of the company’s services.  “We put $30 billion into this platform,” he said. “I know because I approved it. It’s real.” Greene said the company has been successful closing deals, hinting many more client announcements are in the offing. “Already we are winning more than half our deals,” she said.

Starbucks also envisions as many as 30 large, showcase Reserve Roastery and Tasting Rooms in major cities around the world.  Schultz's transition marks a turning point for Starbucks, which introduced millions of people around the world to higher quality coffee and espresso drinks and now must find a way to avoid being labeled pedestrian when compared with upscale rivals like Blue Bottle and Intelligentsia, which are popping up in U.S. cities. Starbucks is the millennials' parents' coffee house and Starbucks is acutely aware of that, said Ric Rhinehart, executive director of the Specialty Coffee Association of America. Its Reserve projects are a reminder that they did this first and they do this best, said AB Bernstein analyst Sara Senatore. Reserve stores will be about twice the size of typical stores and exclusively sell and serve exotic, small-lot coffees that can cost $50 per 8-ounce bag. The first are planned for Seattle and Chicago.  The new Reserve stores and Roasteries will serve wine, beer and spirits and bake their own pastries from Princi, a boutique Italian bakery and Starbucks partner.   Executives expect customers to stay longer and spend more at Reserve cafes, driving twice the financial returns of typical Starbucks stores, which have average unit sales of about $1.6 million annually. Schultz told attendees at the company's investor meeting on Wednesday that the halo from Reserve will make Starbucks a more compelling destination while providing an antidote to customers spending more of their time and money online.

I'd probably just stick to the regular, I'm not too picky, said Sauer, who showed the kind of aspiration that Starbucks seeks. If I had the money to spend more towards coffee I'd do it, she said. I think people want it, too.” The new Reserve stores could boost Starbucks' revenue if they hit targets, said Bernstein's Senatore, who cautioned that Schultz's new project has investment requirements that could become less attractive in a slowdown. Seattle-based Starbucks debuted the first Roastery in its hometown two years ago, spending a reported $20 million on the  15,000-square-foot industrial-chic playground for coffee enthusiasts. The Shanghai Roastery, which will be twice that size, is slated to open in about a year, with Manhattan to follow about six months later.  But as Starbucks has already learned, moving upscale carries its own risks.

Schultz told attendees at the company's investor meeting on Wednesday that the halo from Reserve will make Starbucks a more compelling destination while providing an antidote to customers spending more of their time and money online.

Starbucks already has added Reserve bars to a handful of Starbucks shops in major cities, including New York, Chicago and Atlanta.  Reuters recently visited a Reserve bar on Manhattan's Upper East Side, which offered $10 cups of coffee made in glass siphons, $10 flights of Reserve brews and nitro cold brew via a separate Reserve menu.

I'd probably just stick to the regular, I'm not too picky, said Sauer, who showed the kind of aspiration that Starbucks seeks. If I had the money to spend more towards coffee I'd do it, she said. I think people want it, too.” The new Reserve stores could boost Starbucks' revenue if they hit targets, said Bernstein's Senatore, who cautioned that Schultz's new project has investment requirements that could become less attractive in a slowdown. Seattle-based Starbucks debuted the first Roastery in its hometown two years ago, spending a reported $20 million on the  15,000-square-foot industrial-chic playground for coffee enthusiasts. The Shanghai Roastery, which will be twice that size, is slated to open in about a year, with Manhattan to follow about six months later.  But as Starbucks has already learned, moving upscale carries its own risks.  There is always a market for what is different, special and rare, but the minute you become so available that anyone can get what you are selling, you lose your cachet, said market researcher Robert Passikoff, president and founder of Brand Keys.

After New York, fashionistas gather for London Fashion Week (LFW) where a mix of established names, highstreet labels and emerging designers will present their latest creations during five days of runway shows and presentations. While smaller than fellow fashion capitals New York, Milan and Paris, the event in London - which is known for its fashion schools and new creative talent - will host labels including Burberry, Mulberry, Versace's Versus line and Temperley London. With some brands using the catwalk to make political statements during New York Fashion Week, fashionistas expect London designers could follow suit. There seems to be a mood of activism. There seems to be a lot of people finding a voice, accessories designer Anya Hindmarch said when asked what to expect this fashion season.  I think London is all about creativity. Among the first to present his autumn/winter 2017 collection was designer Eudon Choi, who dressed models in chunky ribbed jumpers worn like shawls, wide-leg trousers and sports shoes. Taking inspiration from architect Adolf Loos, London-based Choi, who first trained as a designer for menswear in Seoul, presented a line of utilitarian designs, adding metallic button-like fastenings on his tailored looks.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau on Monday finalized the new rule banning mandatory arbitration clauses requiring consumers to forego class-action suits and instead settle disputes in negotiations overseen by arbitrators frequently hired by companies. The rule immediately ran into fierce opposition by Wall Street and Republicans who control both Congress and the White House. They have long criticized the consumer agency, which is run by a Democrat, Richard Cordray. Senator Tom Cotton, a member of the Banking Committee, has already announced he is drafting a resolution to kill the rule. His fellow Republican Senator Pat Toomey, chair of the subcommittee on financial institutions and consumer protection, said he is considering a similar step.  Republican lawmakers plan to eliminate the rule, using a law that allows Congress to undo new regulations with simple majority votes in both chambers and a signature from the president. Analysts and consumer advocates have said the agency's rule may survive the Congressional challenge. Still, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce is contemplating a legal challenge and Trump administration officials are also looking at ways to kill the rule. Isaac Boltansky, a policy analyst for the investment firm Compass Point Research & Trading, said the rule has a slightly better than 50 percent chance of surviving in Congress. Joe Valenti, who tracks the issue for the liberal-leaning Center for American Progress, said the House of Representatives was unified against the rule, which opponents have argued benefits class-action lawyers, not consumers. It comes down to the Senate, said Valenti, noting that the rule would survive if only three Republicans in that chamber switched sides. That is possible, said Ed Mierzwinksi, the consumer program director for the U.S. Public Interest Research Groups. He noted that Senate Republicans have struggled to gather enough votes for majorities and the calendar is swollen with pressing legislation and confirmation hearings. In addition, Mierzwinksi said, senators may be leery of appearing to side with Wall Street against consumers. He noted that Wells Fargo & Co used clauses in its account-opening agreements to block customers from suing over its phantom account scandal. Supporters of the rule say mandatory arbitration denies citizens their day in court and is rigged in favor of big firms. They say litigants banding together in a class-action lawsuit have a better chance of getting companies to answer publicly for illegal activities and that fears of such a suit can discourage law breaking. The consumer protection agency wrote the rule after conducting a lengthy, multi-year study of the issue. Opponents of the rule say the study is flawed and that arbitration is cheaper and faster than class-action lawsuits and produces better awards for consumers. Other Challenges The Chamber is exploring a prompt legal challenge to the rule, said Matt Webb, senior vice president for its legal reform institute. Another possible challenge could come from the acting comptroller of the currency, Keith Noreika. He is laying groundwork to invoke an untested provision of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law that allows the council of the country's top financial regulators to nullify a consumer agency rule if they decide it threatens the safety and soundness of the banking system. Rohit Chopra, senior fellow at the Consumer Federation of America and former CFPB assistant director, said a lawsuit will probably fail because the law says the agency can restrict arbitration as long as it hews to its study.

With competing Saudi products off the shelves, his business is booming. Our sales doubled! There's lots of production as you can see and we have a big share in the market now, said the 30-year-old dairy factory owner. Previously he struggled to compete against products trucked in from Saudi firms like the Middle East's biggest dairy, Almarai. But last week Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Bahrain imposed an economic and diplomatic boycott on Qatar, accusing the small Gulf state of funding terrorism and cosying up to their enemy Iran, which Qatar denies. The measures have disrupted imports in Qatar, which buys most of its food from the neighbors that have ostracized it. Qatar's own mostly small consumer businesses say they are finding new suppliers, which could alter established trading patterns in the Gulf. Plastic and cardboard that Kuwari's company uses to make packaging are stuck in containers in Dubai, he said. We were stunned at first. Our supply of raw materials was completely cut off, said Kuwari. But we took action. Qatar and UAE exchange office in Doha, Qatar, June 13, 2017.Naseem ZeitoonKuwari says he will terminate contracts for raw materials from the Dubai-based conglomerate JRD international worth 30 million riyals ($8.21 million) a year. Instead he is forging deals with Turkish, Indian and Chinese companies to secure future supplies that will be shipped to Qatar via ports in Oman and Kuwait. Qatar typically imports perishable goods through its land link with Saudi Arabia. Millions of dollars of other goods and materials also come every month via Dubai's Jebel Ali port which serves as a major re-export hub for the Gulf. Businesses in Qatar say they are pulling the plug on UAE and Saudi contracts, and don't expect to resume them even if the diplomatic storm blows over.  FILE PHOTO: People exchange money from an exchange house in Doha, Qatar, June 11, 2017.Tom Finn/File PhotoWe are not working with them again. They didn't honor their agreements. Our products are being held up there, said Ahmed al-Khalaf, chairman of International Projects Development Co. and owner of a Qatari meat processing plant that imports materials from the UAE. We may not have many factories in Qatar but we have the money to buy from other sources. Qatar is the world's richest country per capita, with just 2.7 million residents and income from the world's biggest exports of liquefied natural gas. Nearly 90 percent of its population are foreign guest workers, mostly from South Asia or poorer countries in the Middle East. Dubai offers lower costs and shorter shipping times than many other ports in the Middle East. But Oman's Sohar port has been trying to compete by expanding its capacity. Business from Qatar could help that effort. On Monday Qatar launched two new shipping services to Omani ports as the gas-rich country seeks to secure food supplies closed off by the Saudi-led boycott. Editing by Peter Graff"
"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-samsung-elec-smartphones-idUSKBN16Z1WH","With new phone due, Samsung dials down on safety message","","March 28, 2017 /  2:32 PM / 4 months ago","","SEOUL (Reuters) - After the damaging recall of its fire-prone Note 7 smartphone, you could be forgiven for thinking Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS) would make a song and dance about battery safety in its new flagship phones, due to be launched in the United States on Wednesday. But in the run-up to the launch, crucial to the South Korean technology giant winning back consumer confidence, its marketing effort so far makes little mention of safety.  If you talk about safety, it presupposes a rationale for why, unconsciously, and they know this; and they also know the media will pick up that narrative, said Los Angeles-based Eric Schiffer, a brand strategy expert and chairman of Reputation Management Consultants. Highlighting the safety issue at this point will cause the other narrative to be recycled, so they have elected to suppress and hope. Samsung declined to comment ahead of the launch. To be sure, Samsung announced a comprehensive safety plan after concluding in January that faulty batteries from two suppliers caused some Note 7s to catch fire.  It now has an eight-point safety check protocol that includes x-raying the batteries. And, at the design level, phones have more room to properly house the battery. Such steps have been reflected in the S8's development, the company says. Executives have said there will be no repeat of the Note 7 debacle, and one person familiar with the matter told Reuters the S8 launch was pushed back to ensure it is safe to use. The additional measures Samsung has taken should certainly improve battery safety and durability, said Lewis Larsen, president of Chicago-based battery technology consultancy Lattice Energy LLC. These are most definitely not just cosmetic steps 'for show.' The company has also this month put a long-time mobile executive in charge of a new product quality improvement office, and affiliate Samsung SDI Co Ltd (006400.KS) has invested 150 billion won ($135 million) on improving battery safety. Needle in a Haystack A customer tries out a Samsung Electronics' Galaxy Note 7 at the company's headquarters in Seoul, South Korea, October 10, 2016.Kim Hong-JiSamsung recalled the Note 7 last September to replace faulty Samsung SDI batteries, but replacement batteries from Amperex Technology Ltd also proved faulty due to different problems - an embarrassment for a company that prides itself on product quality, analysts say. The Note 7 was eventually pulled from the market in October. The company said earlier this week it plans to sell refurbished versions of the Note 7 smartphones, equipped with new batteries that have gone through new safety measures. Downplaying the battery safety issue may also be a sensible marketing option as the new quality measures can't guarantee there will be no future problems. Any failure rate would likely be very low at first. Samsung said last year it confirmed just 140 faulty batteries in more than 3 million Note 7s it sold - fewer than five in every 100,000. How confident are they that they can actually find a faulty cell with these additional checks, said Venkat Viswanathan, assistant professor at Carnegie Mellon and a battery technology expert. It's sort of finding a needle in a haystack. And safety is still on the minds of potential buyers of the new phone. In one poll asking people what features they were looking forward to most in the S8, one Twitter user quipped: A non exploding phone. And at last week's annual shareholder meeting, one young boy stood up and asked Samsung to double down on safety. In future, even if it takes time, I hope there will be no incidents like the Galaxy Note 7 explosions, he said. Some analysts expect the S8, expected to go on sale next month, to outsell the Galaxy S7, which was Samsung's best seller in its first year from launch.  Others, though, say consumers may prefer to wait a few months before buying, just to be sure the new phones are safe.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/olympics-broadcasting-eurosport-idUSL4N1EQ05P","New broadcaster promises year-round buzz","","January 1, 2017 /  12:52 PM / 7 months ago","","LONDON (Reuters) - Fans of the Olympics can expect the spirit of the Games to remain aflame all year round, not just during the sporting extravaganzas, the man now responsible for broadcasting both the Summer and Winter events to hundreds of millions of viewers across Europe told Reuters. We can make this a year-round experience... because of all the broadcast rights we have to Olympic sports, Eurosport CEO Peter Hutton said in an interview. We promised the International Olympic Committee (IOC) we would keep the brand alive all year round. Eurosport, through parent company Discovery Communications, bought the exclusive multimedia rights to broadcasting the Olympics in some 50 countries and territories in Europe in a 1.3 billion Euros ($1.37 billion) deal which begins on Jan. 1 and takes them through to the 2024 Olympic Games.  Discovery own the rights across all platforms, including free-to-air television, subscription/pay-TV television, internet and mobile phone in all languages. However, consistent with IOC and local market requirements, Discovery has committed to broadcasting a minimum of 200 hours of the Olympic Games and 100 hours of the Olympic Winter Games on free-to-air television during the Games period, and will sub-license a portion of the rights in many markets across Europe. Hutton says this eight-year contract is just the start of a deal which he says offers much to both parties. For us, the Olympic Games is about changing from what Eurosport used to be, to what we are trying to be, Hutton said of the broadcaster which has grown from modest roots in 1989 to rival the biggest sports broadcasters globally. The Games, and these memorable moments...they give us a sense of purpose. Go back to how the Olympic Games affects you, it is great that the moment affects people, but also look back in time. I have got a picture on the wall here of Seb Coe winning in Moscow in 1980, but I remember him breaking three world records in 41 days the year before... the whole thing became a longer story, and that is what we want to do with the Olympics. Eurosport have a instant opportunity to start building 2018 Winter Olympic buzz with their coverage of the Four Hills ski jumping tournament on Jan. 1. That will be one of our biggest events in multiple markets, Hutton said of the iconic event that has taken place in Germany and Austria each year since 1952. With the next Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, little more than a year away, Hutton acknowledges there are challenges ahead — not least establishing credibility for Eurosport as the natural home of the Olympics Games, but the Briton says the broadcasters' full package can help grow the Olympics. We have got the deal up to 2024; but we would like to do this for longer, he said. Sports channels do what sports channels do but we are a great combination, it is not just Eurosport, but also what Discovery can bring to this project. Discovery, which says it reaches 3 billion cumulative subscribers in more than 220 countries and territories, delivers a range of television programing and content through a number of global brands, including Discovery Channel, TLC, and Animal Planet.

Trump, 35, President Donald Trump's older daughter, has emerged as an influential adviser to her father, particularly on issues important to women and minorities. In the self-help book released this week, Trump shares tips about how to have a successful career while making time for your family, your passions, and yourself, according to a press release by publisher Penguin Random House.     The former business tycoon's daughter worked as an executive at the Trump Organization and created her own fashion line before taking a role in the White House as an unpaid assistant to her father. Trump said last month she would not publicize her book through a promotional tour or media appearances to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest. I am committed to working harder than ever to unleash the full power of women and girls, Trump wrote in a preface to Women Who Work. But the first daughter's pledge to be a voice for women was met by American women's rights advocates with reactions ranging from skepticism to anger. At the Washington-based National Organization for Women, Terry O'Neill dismissed Trump's advocacy effort as a gimmick to enrich her family's sprawling business empire. She is not a feminist, O'Neill told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. What she is trying to do... is to gain some respectability.  Branding around Ivanka Trump's eponymous fashion line mixes addressing the needs of the modern professional woman and empowering women to create the lives they want, according to its website. Fatima Goss Graves, a senior vice president at the National Women's Law Center in Washington D.C., echoed criticism by book reviewers that Trump's message was out of touch with less privileged working women. In one notable excerpt, the former fashion model discusses hardships she faced while with her father on the campaign trail, such as not treating myself to a massage. The message in the book is a bit of a 'pull yourself up by your bootstraps', said Graves, whose non-profit helps to protect women against discrimination in the workplace. When you contrast that message to the reality for most women, both in terms of their wages and structural powers in the workplace ... there is a serious disconnect.  On Thursday, President Trump signed an executive order which lifts the risk of religious groups losing their tax-exempt status if they endorse particular political candidates. The same order opens the door to allowing employers to limit women's access contraception through their healthcare plans on grounds of religious objections, Graves said. Heidi Hartmann, president of the Washington D.C.-based Institute for Women's Policy Research, a women's rights think tank, said it remained to be seen whether Ivanka Trump would emerge as a credible champion of women's rights. Most women leaders who write books about these issues try to back up their arguments with facts, she said. Trump, who said she completed the book's manuscript before her father's election win last year, suggested at a women's conference in Berlin last month that the United States needed to look into equal pay and parental leave. Whether Trump would succeed in empowering women all depends on what she does in this administration, said Hartmann. Ivanka Trump's first self-help book targeted at a female audience, The Trump Card, became a New York Times bestseller after its publication in 2009. A portion of proceeds from sales of the new book will be donated to charities working to empower women and girls, Penguin Random House said.

In addition to WrestleMania, the WWE will use its so-called “takeover” strategy for other wrestling events like Summerslam, Survivor Series and The Royal Rumble, providing a four-to-five day live series each quarter. Still, WWE will need to demonstrate it can continue to draw large crowds over the multi-day stretch.     The WWE is coming off a weekend where it sold out five consecutive nights in Orlando, including WrestleMania at the Citrus Bowl, with records for that stadium's attendance of 75,245 fans and its revenue of $14.5 million. Over a five-day stretch that began last Friday the WWE brought in more than 120,000 fans to the city. The other four shows were at the Amway Center.  Previously, WWE would typically hold events that followed one of their major events in nearby cities, as the quick turnaround time does not allow them to travel far.     WWE's live event business is its third-largest source of revenue, grossing $144.4M in 2016. Holding multiple live events  in one location will increase profitability by streamlining ticket sales and paring down costs, since the ring and set don’t have be taken apart and moved, the company said. Robert Routh, an analyst for FBN Securities said WWE's plans to stage multiple live events in one city may lift revenue, but concluded it is too early to tell.  WWE Superstar the Undertaker walks toward the ring at WrestleMania 33 in Orlando, Florida, United States in this April 2, 2017 handout photo.  WWE/Handout via REUTERS“The jury remains out on this,” he said. Putting on the extravagant shows is complicated. For WrestleMania alone, 100 semi-tractor trailer trucks were needed to ferry equipment to Orlando and two weeks were needed to construct the set which included a super-sized ring.  WWE's live events are also key to growing overseas in marketing including China, a market the WWE is eager to break into. Nearly a third of the WWE's $729 million in 2016 revenue came from international, said chief brand officer Stephanie McMahon.  Operating income for their live event business fell 15 percent in the fourth quarter to $6.2 million, while revenue grew 17 percent to $38.6 million in the same period, mainly due to 21 additional events since the previous year. We are constantly evaluating that model,” McMahon said, noting they want to stage more events in China to give more exposure to the Chinese nationals they signed last year. “We’re nowhere near the same kind of penetration that we are in other markets.

Incoming CEO Emma Walmsley, the first woman to lead a top global drugmaker, stands out among Big Pharma bosses as a consumer brands specialist rather than a prescription medicines expert. Since her appointment in September she has spent much of her time learning about GSK's prescription drug research and development (R&D;), according to company insiders. She takes over from Andrew Witty at the end of March. Britain's biggest drugmaker said on Monday that its new science committee would be chaired by non-executive director Jesse Goodman, a former chief scientist for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Patrick Vallance, president of R&D;, will also join the GSK board as an executive director on Jan. 1, ahead of the retirement of current research head and board member Moncef Slaoui on March 31. Despite GSK's diversified structure, which includes vaccines and consumer health products, drug discovery remains a core activity and the company expects important clinical results for between 20 and 30 experimental medicines by the end of 2018.  Walmsley herself has described R&D; as the beating heart of the group.           Reporting by Ben Hirschler; Editing by Greg Mahlich"

With competing Saudi products off the shelves, his business is booming. Our sales doubled! There's lots of production as you can see and we have a big share in the market now, said the 30-year-old dairy factory owner. Previously he struggled to compete against products trucked in from Saudi firms like the Middle East's biggest dairy, Almarai. But last week Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Bahrain imposed an economic and diplomatic boycott on Qatar, accusing the small Gulf state of funding terrorism and cosying up to their enemy Iran, which Qatar denies. The measures have disrupted imports in Qatar, which buys most of its food from the neighbours that have ostracised it. Qatar's own mostly small consumer businesses say they are finding new suppliers, which could alter established trading patterns in the Gulf. Plastic and cardboard that Kuwari's company uses to make packaging are stuck in containers in Dubai, he said. We were stunned at first. Our supply of raw materials was completely cut off, said Kuwari. But we took action. Kuwari says he will terminate contracts for raw materials from the Dubai-based conglomerate JRD international worth 30 million riyals ($8.21 million) a year. Instead he is forging deals with Turkish, Indian and Chinese companies to secure future supplies that will be shipped to Qatar via ports in Oman and Kuwait. Qatar typically imports perishable goods through its land link with Saudi Arabia. Millions of dollars of other goods and materials also come every month via Dubai's Jebel Ali port which serves as a major re-export hub for the Gulf. Businesses in Qatar say they are pulling the plug on UAE and Saudi contracts, and don't expect to resume them even if the diplomatic storm blows over. We are not working with them again. They didn't honour their agreements. Our products are being held up there, said Ahmed al-Khalaf, chairman of International Projects Development Co. and owner of a Qatari meat processing plant that imports materials from the UAE. We may not have many factories in Qatar but we have the money to buy from other sources. Qatar is the world's richest country per capita, with just 2.7 million residents and income from the world's biggest exports of liquefied natural gas. Nearly 90 percent of its population are foreign guest workers, mostly from South Asia or poorer countries in the Middle East. Dubai offers lower costs and shorter shipping times than many other ports in the Middle East. But Oman's Sohar port has been trying to compete by expanding its capacity. Business from Qatar could help that effort. On Monday Qatar launched two new shipping services to Omani ports as the gas-rich country seeks to secure food supplies closed off by the Saudi-led boycott.

Chen Miner was suddenly appointed Chongqing's Communist Party boss on Saturday, unceremoniously replacing Sun Zhengcai, who sources have told Reuters is now under investigation. The government has yet to comment on what is happening with Sun. Bo had been a contender for top leadership before being felled in the scandal that first came to light when his police chief Wang Lijun briefly took refuge in the U.S. consulate in the nearby city of Chengdu, kicking off a series of events that also saw Bo's wife jailed for murdering a British businessman. Sources with ties to the leadership and foreign diplomats say Sun has been out of favor after the party's anti-corruption watchdog in February criticized Chongqing authorities for not doing enough to root out Bo's influence. Meeting city officials, Chen told them that they must unify their thought on the feedback the party graft-buster gave the last time it inspected the city, a reference to the February report. Resolutely eliminate the evil legacy of Bo and Wang thought from thinking, politics and work style, the official Chongqing Daily paraphrased Chen as saying on Monday, using an unusually strong expression that can also refer to syphilis. Jointly create a pure political ecosystem and good environment for work, Chen added.  Sun was not mentioned in the report. Chen is a rising political star close to President Xi Jinping, and is himself seen as a potential new member of the party's elite Standing Committee when it is unveiled after a reshuffle at a once-every-five-years party congress in the autumn. Chen called on officials to recognize the great importance Xi attached to Chongqing's development and take that support as strong motivation to do their job well. Chongqing is one of China's most important cities. Global electronics brands including Hewlett-Packard, Foxconn, Acer and Asus all have operations there, lured by tax breaks, cheap labor and land, plus a developed supply chain and logistics. The region makes a third of the world's laptops. After his appointment as party chief of Chongqing in 2007, Bo turned it into a showcase of revolution-inspired red culture and his policies for egalitarian, state-led growth.  He also won national attention with a crackdown on organized crime, lead by his police chief Wang. His brash self-promotion irked some leaders in Beijing. But his populist ways and crime clean-up were welcomed by many of Chongqing's 30 million residents, as well as others who hoped that Bo could take his leftist-shaded policies nationwide.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-regulation-ipos-idUSKBN1A20EG","New UK listing rules set to attract state companies beyond Aramco","","July 17, 2017 /  6:06 AM / 10 days ago","","LONDON (Reuters) - Proposed changes to Britain's listing regime are likely to attract a series of state-backed companies to London's stock markets as governments in oil rich states prepare for a wave of asset sales.  However some investors and corporate governance groups say Britain's move to make its capital markets attractive to state-controlled firms by loosening some of the rules may lower the quality of companies on its stock exchange and leave shareholders with less protection when things go wrong. The UK financial regulator proposed a new premium listing category for state-owned companies on Thursday, intended to make the market more attractive for oil giant Saudi Aramco as it plans what is expected to be the world's largest ever initial public offering. The move was applauded by Britain's financial lobby groups as helping to make sure the country's capital markets remain attractive once it leaves the European Union.  Capital markets lawyers say that as well as Saudi Arabia, the changes will appeal to a number of countries that are also in the midst of asset privatization plans.  This broadens the appeal of London for companies in countries like Saudi Arabia, Kazakhstan, Russia, and southern Europe, Raj Karia, partner at law firm Norton Rose, told Reuters. There are a lot of companies globally which are state owned and will be privatized and in the run up to Brexit, London is appealing to the world outside of Europe. Falling oil prices have spurred privatizations across the Middle East, with Saudi Arabia, Oman and Abu Dhabi all announcing plans in the past year to float some of their oil assets.   Government asset sales are also expected from Romania and Greece. Nicholas Holmes, a partner at law firm Ashurst, said it was clear the proposed rules were aimed at attracting further sovereign business in London beyond Aramco.  However he cautioned that the changes risked undoing some reforms made to Britain's listing rules in 2014 following a number of scandals. London-listed mining companies Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation (ENRC) from Kazakhstan and Bumi from Indonesia both left minority investors nursing heavy losses which were both blamed on dealings involving company insiders and controlling shareholders. That led to the rule changes, with such companies forced to ensure that all transactions between a controlling shareholder or their associates and the company are conducted on an arm's length basis and on normal commercial terms. These rules will not apply to sovereign-controlled companies under the new proposed listing structure when dealing with the parent state, provided it holds at least 30 percent of the shares.       The fear is that we are rolling back a portion of sensible reforms which came as a result of past scandals such as ENRC. The risk is a dilution of the premium listing brand, Ashurst's Holmes said.          People walk through the lobby of the London Stock Exchange in London, Britain August 25, 2015.Suzanne Plunkett/File photoShareholder groups and investors agreed.  Our initial reaction is that investors and savers should be nervous about any dilution of existing protections which were specifically introduced to avoid a repetition of the governance issues associated with Bumi and ENRC, said Catherine Howarth, Chief Executive of ShareAction. Euan Stirling, Head of Stewardship and ESG (environmental, social and governance) Investment at Standard Life, one of the biggest investors in the British stock market, said the move sent the wrong signal.  We would prefer to see listing rules tightened rather than loosened, he said.  Likely Contenders Sources said Kazakh energy company KazMunaiGas is one of the most likely state-backed companies aside from Aramco to take advantage of Britain's proposed new listing rules. It is currently selecting advisers for its planned 2019 initial public offering and is expected to consider London.  Kazakhstan is listed as number 131 out of 176 on the Transparency International corruption perception index. The company was not immediately available to comment.      Reeling from the collapse of its merger with Deutsche Bourse and a slowdown in large domestic listings, the London Stock Exchange is targeting emerging markets, and the Middle East in particular, as a source of new IPOs. Including Saudi Aramco, Riyadh aims to raise around $200 billion in the next several years through privatization programs in 16 sectors. Fighting a budget deficit, Kuwait is also considering privatizing some assets. United Arab Emirates could raise $1.5 to $2 billion for Abu Dhabi's national oil company. That is initially expected to be a local listing which does not rule out the company tapping the London market in future.  With smaller deal sizes, Egypt plans to list shares in a state-owned bank and companies including Banque du Caire and Arab African International Bank.      Some of the large Middle East companies will be suitable for a listing in London, though some could opt for their local exchange. Russian state-owned companies such as Gazprom and Rosneft are already on the London exchange using the less popular standard listing structure, but will now find it easier to achieve the conditions for a premium listing. For investors, the next step to watch will be whether any companies listed under the new rules will be eligible for including in any stock market indices, meaning they can raise funds from passive index-tracking funds.  FTSE, which runs the main UK stock indices, has already indicated that it will not include Aramco. It said its eligibility criteria for FTSE inclusion would not change if the new listing rules come into force.  Additional reporting by Olzhas Auyezov; Editing by Giles Elgood"

In addition to WrestleMania, the WWE will use its so-called “takeover” strategy for other wrestling events like Summerslam, Survivor Series and The Royal Rumble, providing a four-to-five day live series each quarter. Still, WWE will need to demonstrate it can continue to draw large crowds over the multi-day stretch.     The WWE is coming off a weekend where it sold out five consecutive nights in Orlando, including WrestleMania at the Citrus Bowl, with records for that stadium's attendance of 75,245 fans and its revenue of $14.5 million. Over a five-day stretch that began last Friday the WWE brought in more than 120,000 fans to the city. The other four shows were at the Amway Center.  Previously, WWE would typically hold events that followed one of their major events in nearby cities, as the quick turnaround time does not allow them to travel far.     WWE's live event business is its third-largest source of revenue, grossing $144.4M in 2016. Holding multiple live events  in one location will increase profitability by streamlining ticket sales and paring down costs, since the ring and set don’t have be taken apart and moved, the company said. Robert Routh, an analyst for FBN Securities said WWE's plans to stage multiple live events in one city may lift revenue, but concluded it is too early to tell.  WWE Superstar the Undertaker walks toward the ring at WrestleMania 33 in Orlando, Florida, United States in this April 2, 2017 handout photo.  WWE/Handout via REUTERS“The jury remains out on this,” he said. Putting on the extravagant shows is complicated. For WrestleMania alone, 100 semi-tractor trailer trucks were needed to ferry equipment to Orlando and two weeks were needed to construct the set which included a super-sized ring.  WWE's live events are also key to growing overseas in marketing including China, a market the WWE is eager to break into. Nearly a third of the WWE's $729 million in 2016 revenue came from international, said chief brand officer Stephanie McMahon.  Operating income for their live event business fell 15 percent in the fourth quarter to $6.2 million, while revenue grew 17 percent to $38.6 million in the same period, mainly due to 21 additional events since the previous year. We are constantly evaluating that model,” McMahon said, noting they want to stage more events in China to give more exposure to the Chinese nationals they signed last year. “We’re nowhere near the same kind of penetration that we are in other markets.

The German Transport Ministry said it has asked Volkswagen's (VOWG_p.DE) luxury division to recall around 24,000 A7 and A8 models built between 2009 and 2013, about half of which were sold in Germany. VW Chief Executive Matthias Mueller was summoned to the Berlin-based ministry on Thursday, a ministry spokesman said, without elaborating. VW didn't return calls seeking comment.    The affected Audi models with so-called Euro-5 emission standards emit about twice the legal limit of nitrogen oxides when the steering wheel is turned more than 15 degrees, the ministry said. It is also the first time that Audi's top-of-the-line A8 saloon has been implicated in emissions cheating. VW has said to date that the emissions-control software found in its rigged EA 189 diesel engine does not violate European law. The 80,000 3.0-liter vehicles affected by VW's emissions cheating scandal in the United States included Audi A6, A7 and Q7 models as well as Porsche and VW brand cars. The ministry said it has issued a June 12 deadline for Audi to come up with a comprehensive plan to refit the cars. Ingolstadt-based Audi issued a recall for the 24,000 affected models late on Thursday, some 14,000 of which are registered in Germany, and said software updates will start in July. It will continue to cooperate with Germany's KBA motor vehicle authority, Audi said. When Audi's headquarters were raided by prosecutors on March 15 in connection with the emissions fraud, Chief Executive Rupert Stadler said investigations into the scandal were far from over, promising to keep at it until the work was done. A source close to Audi said problems in the interaction between transmission and engine control units are to blame for the emissions overshoot.

The drugs' success for patients is the result of big bets in cancer therapy made by Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (BMY.N), Merck & Co Inc (MRK.N) and Roche Holding AG (ROG.S), among others in big pharma. The industry's pipeline of cancer drugs expanded by 63 percent between 2005 and 2015, according to the QuintilesIMS Institute, and a good number are reaching the market.  The global market for cancer immunotherapies alone is expected to grow more than fourfold globally to $75.8 billion by 2022 from $16.9 billion in 2015, according to research firm GlobalData.      For cancer drugs in general ... it is hard for us to drive down cost, said Steve Miller, chief medical officer at Express Scripts Holding Co (ESRX.O), the nation's largest manager of drug benefit plans for employers and insurers. You don't want to be in the position of being told to use the second best cancer drug for your child.  Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, as well as President Donald Trump, have been grappling with how to restrain rising prescription drug costs. They have talked about solutions ranging from more price negotiation to faster approval of new drugs, often invoking increased competition between drugmakers.  Competition is key to lowering drug prices, Trump told pharmaceutical executives at an Oval Office meeting in January.  But that is not happening with new drugs called checkpoint inhibitors that work by releasing a molecular brake, allowing the immune system to recognize and attack cancer cells the same way it fights infections caused by bacteria or viruses.  For cancers like melanoma, the treatments can mean long-term survival for around 20 percent of patients.  Bristol's Yervoy, first approved in 2011, targets a protein known as CTLA-4. Other immunotherapies, including Bristol's Opdivo, Keytruda from Merck, Roche's Tecentriq, and Pfizer Inc's (PFE.N) Bavencio, involve a different protein called PD-1.  Other targets are being explored. Some new data will be presented this week in Washington at the American Association for Cancer Research's annual meeting.  Current checkpoint inhibitors each have a list price near $150,000 a year. A combination of Yervoy and Opdivo, approved by the Food and Drug Administration for advanced or inoperable melanoma, has a cost of $256,000 a year for patients who respond to the treatment.  Similar immunotherapies are in development at companies like AstraZeneca Plc (AZN.L). Merck, which declined to comment on pricing plans, expects an FDA decision by May 10 on its combination of Keytruda and chemotherapy as an initial treatment for the most common form of lung cancer - by far the biggest market for cancer drugs.  Pfizer said Bavencio, cleared by the FDA earlier this month to treat Merkel cell carcinoma, a rare type of skin cancer, has a price comparable to other checkpoint inhibitors approved for different indications.  The pharmaceutical industry holds that discussion of prescription drug prices has to take into account the major investment required for innovation and discovery of new lifesaving drugs.  Unrestrained Pricing Power  Scientific progress, and pricing power, are driving pharmaceutical companies to emphasize oncology research.  Most of the strategy on the part of pharmaceutical companies assumes unrestrained pricing power, said Dr. Peter Bach, director of Memorial Sloan Kettering's Center for Health Policy Outcomes in New York. We don't see evidence that companies are pursuing cost-effective strategies.  Health insurers have had success in demanding price concessions in some drug categories - like diabetes, where several companies sell similar products and insurers are able to negotiate price discounts or rebates in exchange for coverage.  According to IMS, that tactic capped the overall rise in spending on diabetes medicines at 8 percent in 2015, compared with an increase of 30 percent in billed invoices. All of the invoice price growth for insulin was offset by price cuts, the institute said.  But discounting is much less common for newer, innovative cancer drugs, mostly given by injection and approved for defined patient populations.  Net price growth for branded oncology drugs averaged 4.8 percent in 2015, versus 6.4 percent for invoices, according to IMS.  Express Scripts' Miller and others said makers of new cancer medications enjoy pricing power due to coverage requirements, insurance plan structure and a lack of head-to-head comparison studies.  Cancer drugs don't compete on price, said Dr. Aaron Kesselheim, a researcher at Harvard Medical School and author of several studies of drug pricing. Drug companies have market exclusivity and we require payers to cover cancer drugs - Medicare has six protected classes, including cancer.  Medicare, the federal government's healthcare plan for seniors and the disabled, covers most prescription drugs under its Part D pharmacy benefits. The plans are required to cover all drugs in six classes: cancer, HIV, antidepressants, antispychotics, seizure disorders like epilepsy, and immune system suppressants for people undergoing organ transplantation.  Trump met recently with Representatives Elijah Cummings and Peter Welch, both Democrats, to discuss draft legislation allowing the government to negotiate Medicare drug prices - but the bill preserves the six protected classes.  In addition, drugs given by injection, including many cancer therapies, are covered under Medicare's main medical benefit.  Bristol disappointed investors when it did not pursue accelerated FDA review of the Opdivo/Yervoy combination for newly-diagnosed lung cancer - putting Merck ahead in the lucrative lung cancer market.  All of the immunotherapies have similar price points, said Miller at Express Scripts. When you stack therapies, it means more expense for patients and (health) plan sponsors.

Still, the industry is expected to benefit this year from new media exposure, as young golf stars compete in the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro this summer for the first time in more than a century. For Acushnet, its greatest defense against broader industry woes may be its commanding market share in golf balls. Golf balls are cheaper and more easily lost than golf equipment, making them more frequently replaced. The more rounds of golf people play, the more balls they will buy."

The virus is believed to have first taken hold on Tuesday in Ukraine where it silently infected computers after users downloaded a popular tax accounting package or visited a local news site, national police and international cyber experts said. More than a day after it first struck, companies around the world were still wrestling with the fallout while cyber security experts scrambled to find a way to stem the spread. Danish shipping giant A.P. Moller-Maersk said it was struggling to process orders and shift cargoes, congesting some of the 76 ports around the world run by its APM Terminals subsidiary. U.S. delivery firm FedEx Corp said its TNT Express division had been significantly affected by the virus, which also wormed its way into South America, affecting ports in Argentina operated by China's Cofco. The malicious code locked machines and demanded victims post a ransom worth $300 in bitcoins or lose their data entirely, similar to the extortion tactic used in the global WannaCry ransomware attack in May. More than 30 victims paid up but security experts are questioning whether extortion was the goal, given the relatively small sum demanded, or whether the hackers were driven by destructive motives rather than financial gain. Hackers asked victims to notify them by email when ransoms had been paid but German email provider Posteo quickly shut down the address, a German government cyber security official said. Ukraine, the epicentre of the cyber strike, has repeatedly accused Russia of orchestrating attacks on its computer systems and critical power infrastructure since its powerful neighbour annexed the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea in 2014. The Kremlin, which has consistently rejected the accusations, said on Wednesday it had no information about the origin of the global cyber attack, which also struck Russian companies such as oil giant Rosneft and a steelmaker. No one can effectively combat cyber threats on their own, and, unfortunately, unfounded blanket accusations will not solve this problem, said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. ESET, a Slovakian company that sells products to shield computers from viruses, said 80 percent of the infections detected among its global customer base were in Ukraine, with Italy second hardest hit with about 10 percent. Eternal Blue The aim of the latest attack appeared to be disruption rather than ransom, said Brian Lord, former deputy director of intelligence and cyber operations at Britain's GCHQ and now managing director at private security firm PGI Cyber. My sense is this starts to look like a state operating through a proxy ... as a kind of experiment to see what happens, Lord told Reuters on Wednesday. While the malware seemed to be a variant of past campaigns, derived from code known as Eternal Blue believed to have been developed by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA), experts said it was not as virulent as May's WannaCry attack. Security researchers said Tuesday's virus could leap from computer to computer once unleashed within an organisation but, unlike WannaCry, it could not randomly trawl the internet for its next victims, limiting its scope to infect. Bushiness that installed Microsoft's latest security patches from earlier this year and turned off Windows file-sharing features appeared to be largely unaffected. There was speculation, however, among some experts that once the new virus had infected one computer it could spread to other machines on the same network, even if those devices had received a security update. After WannaCry, governments, security firms and industrial groups advised businesses and consumers to make sure all their computers were updated with Microsoft security patches. Austria's government-backed Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) said a small number of international firms appeared to be affected, with tens of thousands of computers taken down. Security firms including Microsoft, Cisco's Talos and Symantec said they had confirmed some of the initial infections occurred when malware was transmitted to users of a Ukrainian tax software programme called MEDoc. The supplier of the software, M.E.Doc denied in a post on Facebook that its software was to blame, though Microsoft reiterated its suspicions afterwards. Microsoft now has evidence that a few active infections of the ransomware initially started from the legitimate MEDoc updater process, it said in a technical blog post. Russian security firm Kaspersky said a Ukrainian news site for the city of Bakhumut was also hacked and used to distribute the ransomware to visitors, encrypting data on their machines. Corporate Chaos A number of the international firms hit have operations in Ukraine, and the virus is believed to have spread within global corporate networks after gaining traction within the country. Shipping giant A.P. Moller-Maersk, which handles one in seven containers shipped worldwide, has a logistics unit in Ukraine. Other large firms affected, such as French construction materials company Saint Gobain and Mondelez International Inc, which owns chocolate brand Cadbury, also have operations in the country. Maersk was one of the first global firms to be taken down by the cyber attack and its operations at major ports such as Mumbai in India, Rotterdam in the Netherlands and Los Angeles on the U.S. west coast were disrupted. Other companies to succumb included BNP Paribas Real Estate , a part of the French bank that provides property and investment management services. The international cyber attack hit our non-bank subsidiary, Real Estate. The necessary measures have been taken to rapidly contain the attack, the bank said on Wednesday. Production at the Cadbury factory on the Australian island state of Tasmania ground to a halt late on Tuesday after computer systems went down. Russia's Rosneft, one of the world's biggest crude producers by volume, said on Tuesday its systems had suffered serious consequences but oil production had not been affected because it switched to backup systems.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/fitch-affirms-new-york-lifes-ifs-at-aaa-idUSFit53b04","Fitch Affirms New York Life's IFS at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable","","June 27, 2017 /  2:47 PM / a month ago","","(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, June 27 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed New York Life Insurance Company's (New York Life) Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) rating at 'AAA'. Fitch has also affirmed all other ratings assigned to New York Life and certain of its subsidiaries. The Rating Outlook is Stable. A full list of ratings follows at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS Fitch's ratings reflect New York Life's leading market position in the U.S. individual life insurance market, extremely strong capitalization and conservative operating profile. Key competitive strengths include the company's strong brand recognition, well-established market position, effective career distribution system and its stable block of participating whole life insurance. New York Life is one of the top producers of whole life insurance and a leading writer of guaranteed income annuities. The company's market position is deepened by its loyal and productive career agency distribution channel, which Fitch believes reduces pricing pressure and anti-selection in competitive market environments. Fitch views New York Life's extremely strong capitalization as a fundamental strength to its rating, which is reflected by its RBC ratio of 550%, Prism capital model score of 'Extremely Strong' and low operating leverage at year-end 2016. Financial leverage, defined as surplus notes to total adjusted capital (TAC), remained low at 8%. New York Life reported a 3% increase in TAC during 2016 to $24 billion, which was primarily driven by earnings and unrealized investment gains. Fitch views New York Life's profitability as moderate on an absolute basis but favorable on a risk-adjusted basis, given its conservative product profile and operating strategy. Its large, traditional life insurance book generates high-quality, stable earnings, which is supported by its non-insurance business. The company reported statutory net income of $1.1 billion in 2016 compared with $257 million in 2015. The statutory accounting treatment of the company's acquisition of John Hancock's closed block adversely affected results in 2015. Fitch expects the relative stability of New York Life's par whole life book and earnings diversification from non-insurance businesses to be somewhat offset by low interest rates and lower income from limited partnerships investments. New York Life manages a well-diversified liquid investment portfolio that continues to perform well, despite continued low interest rates. The company's risky assets ratio remains above the industry average and in line with similarly rated mutual peers with participating products, given their strategy to pass investment performance to policyholders. As of year-end 2016, New York Life's risky asset ratio was 96%, driven primarily by its above-average exposure to Schedule BA assets. Credit impairments remain modest and well below historical averages. The ratings on the funding agreement-backed note programs of New York Life Funding and New York Life Global Funding recognize that the trust obligations are secured by funding agreements issued by New York Life with cash flow structures that enable the trustees to pay the principal and interest on the notes. Thus, the note programs are dependent on New York Life's credit quality and are assigned a rating equal to the company's IFS rating. RATING SENSITIVITIES New York Life's IFS ratings are currently at Fitch's highest level. Key ratings triggers that could result in a downgrade include: --A decline in capitalization which includes an RBC ratio below 450% or a PRISM capital model score below 'Extremely Strong'; --Future increases in financial leverage to more than 15%, or a reduction in GAAP-based, EBIT fixed-charge coverage below 6x; --Significantly reduced profitability evidenced by a GAAP operating ROA sustained below 0.5%; --A major acquisition that leads New York Life away from its core expertise and significantly reduces the proportion of its participating whole life insurance; --An unexpected shift in tax, regulatory or market dynamics that weakens New York Life's competitive strengths. Fitch has affirmed the following ratings with a Stable Outlook: New York Life Insurance Company --IFS at 'AAA'; --Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'AA+'; --Short-term IDR at 'F1+'; --$1,000,000,000 5.875% surplus note due May 15, 2033 at 'AA'; --$1,000,000,000 6.75% surplus note due Nov. 15, 2039 at 'AA'. New York Life Insurance and Annuity Corporation --IFS at 'AAA'. NYL Capital Corporation --Commercial paper at 'F1+'. New York Life Funding --Program rating at 'AAA'. New York Life Global Funding --Program rating at 'AAA'. Contact: Primary Analyst Dafina M. Dunmore, CFA Director +1-312-368-3136 Fitch Ratings, Inc. 70 W.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/nestle-results-idUSL8N1G13YF","New Nestle CEO ditches elusive sales target","","February 16, 2017 /  6:53 AM / 5 months ago","","VEVEY, Switzerland (Reuters) - Nestle's (NESN.S) new chief executive scrapped the food company's long-standing sales target as it reported disappointing annual results on Thursday, echoing rivals by striking a cautious tone in an uncertain environment. Nestle is the biggest player in a packaged food industry hit by a slowdown in emerging markets, falling prices in developed markets and consumers demanding fresher, healthier products. The maker of Kitkat chocolate bars and Nescafe coffee is aiming to increase underlying sales by 2 to 4 percent this year, below its Nestle Model that called for growth of 5 to 6 percent. It posted weaker-than-expected 3.2 percent growth for 2016 and a drop in profits. CEO Mark Schneider, who joined Nestle only last month,  forecast a return to mid-single-digit growth by 2020, which analysts interpreted as the new boss backing away from a target the company has missed for four successive years. In a more turbulent environment, to narrow it specifically to 5 to 6 percent is probably not the right thing, but the underlying message is the same: there's nothing better than healthy organic growth, Schneider said at Nestle's Vevey headquarters.  Analysts estimated that underlying earnings assumptions could be reduced by around 3 percent. In his first public appearance at Nestle, Schneider, responsible for a string of deals at German healthcare company Fresenius (FREG.DE), also played down the chances of any big acquisitions. Valuations were too high and Nestle planned to keep its credit rating in the near term, he added.  He did, however, say Nestle's portfolio review was ongoing. Related CoverageNestle CEO says any change to L'Oreal stake would have to be done very carefullyIn recent years, the company has sold several underperforming brands and formed a joint venture for its ice cream business. Analysts and bankers often speculate about other businesses that could be sold, such as its confectionery or U.S.  frozen meals businesses.   Asked about Nestle's 23 percent stake in French cosmetics firm L'Oreal (OREP.PA), Schneider said any moves would have to be done very prudently.  Nestle's shares were down 1.9 percent at 71.75 Swiss francs at 1240 GMT. New Boss, Same Problems Nestle Nestle CEO Ulf Mark Schneider(L) and Chief Financial Officer Francois-Xavier Roger(r) before a news conference at the company headquarters in Vevey, Switzerland, February 16, 2017.Pierre AlbouySince his surprise appointment last year, analysts and investors have wondered how Schneider would reignite Nestle's growth and whether he would accelerate the recent push into higher-margin nutrition, health and wellness products. Schneider said he was fully committed to the health drive and would stick to the two-fold strategy of making Nestle's core food products healthier, such as by cutting sugar, while building up its health science and skin health businesses. RBC Capital Markets analysts said Schneider's initial observations were carefully thought through and to the point.     Jefferies analyst Martin Deboo said Nestle capped a subdued earnings season, with average organic growth for the big four food and personal care companies -- Nestle, Unilever (ULVR.L), Danone (DANO.PA) and Reckitt Benckiser (RB.L) - slowing to a weaker-than-expected 2.1 percent. Slideshow (6 Images)    We expect ... investors to continue to ask whether 'the model is broken' on the back of this, he said about the sector.  European consumer goods companies face challenges from local rivals in emerging markets, weaker earnings potential and more aggressive cost-cutting from American companies pressurised by the growing presence of private equity firm 3G Capital. European food and beverage stocks .SX3P fell 12 percent from October to December, underperforming the broader European market by 15 percent. They have not fallen further during the reporting season, suggesting that those challenges are priced in.  Unilever cited problems in Brazil and demonetization in India, while Danone (DANO.PA) pointed the finger at tough conditions in China. In 2016, Nestle's net profit fell to 8.5 billion Swiss francs, well below forecasts, and sales rose less than expected to 89.5 billion Swiss francs ($89.3 billion), up 3.2 percent on an organic basis.  Schneider said already accelerating volume growth was encouraging and he also expected pricing to improve this year. The company forecast a stable trading operating profit margin in 2017, due to expectations for increased restructuring costs of around 500 million Swiss francs ($498 million). It proposed to increase its dividend to 2.30 francs per share, after 2.25 francs last year.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/britain-regulation-ipos-idUSL8N1K51XO","New UK listing rules set to attract state companies beyond Aramco","","July 17, 2017 /  6:06 AM / 10 days ago","","LONDON (Reuters) - Proposed changes to Britain's listing regime are likely to attract a series of state-backed companies to London's stock markets as governments in oil rich states prepare for a wave of asset sales.  However some investors and corporate governance groups say Britain's move to make its capital markets attractive to state-controlled firms by loosening some of the rules may lower the quality of companies on its stock exchange and leave shareholders with less protection when things go wrong. The UK financial regulator proposed a new premium listing category for state-owned companies on Thursday, intended to make the market more attractive for oil giant Saudi Aramco as it plans what is expected to be the world's largest ever initial public offering. The move was applauded by Britain's financial lobby groups as helping to make sure the country's capital markets remain attractive once it leaves the European Union.  Capital markets lawyers say that as well as Saudi Arabia, the changes will appeal to a number of countries that are also in the midst of asset privatization plans.  This broadens the appeal of London for companies in countries like Saudi Arabia, Kazakhstan, Russia, and southern Europe, Raj Karia, partner at law firm Norton Rose, told Reuters. There are a lot of companies globally which are state owned and will be privatized and in the run up to Brexit, London is appealing to the world outside of Europe. Falling oil prices have spurred privatizations across the Middle East, with Saudi Arabia, Oman and Abu Dhabi all announcing plans in the past year to float some of their oil assets.   Government asset sales are also expected from Romania and Greece. Nicholas Holmes, a partner at law firm Ashurst, said it was clear the proposed rules were aimed at attracting further sovereign business in London beyond Aramco.  However he cautioned that the changes risked undoing some reforms made to Britain's listing rules in 2014 following a number of scandals. London-listed mining companies Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation (ENRC) from Kazakhstan and Bumi from Indonesia both left minority investors nursing heavy losses which were both blamed on dealings involving company insiders and controlling shareholders. That led to the rule changes, with such companies forced to ensure that all transactions between a controlling shareholder or their associates and the company are conducted on an arm's length basis and on normal commercial terms. These rules will not apply to sovereign-controlled companies under the new proposed listing structure when dealing with the parent state, provided it holds at least 30 percent of the shares.       The fear is that we are rolling back a portion of sensible reforms which came as a result of past scandals such as ENRC. The risk is a dilution of the premium listing brand, Ashurst's Holmes said.          People walk through the lobby of the London Stock Exchange in London, Britain August 25, 2015.Suzanne Plunkett/File photoShareholder groups and investors agreed.  Our initial reaction is that investors and savers should be nervous about any dilution of existing protections which were specifically introduced to avoid a repetition of the governance issues associated with Bumi and ENRC, said Catherine Howarth, Chief Executive of ShareAction. Euan Stirling, Head of Stewardship and ESG (environmental, social and governance) Investment at Standard Life, one of the biggest investors in the British stock market, said the move sent the wrong signal.  We would prefer to see listing rules tightened rather than loosened, he said.  Likely Contenders Sources said Kazakh energy company KazMunaiGas is one of the most likely state-backed companies aside from Aramco to take advantage of Britain's proposed new listing rules. It is currently selecting advisers for its planned 2019 initial public offering and is expected to consider London.  Kazakhstan is listed as number 131 out of 176 on the Transparency International corruption perception index. The company was not immediately available to comment.      Reeling from the collapse of its merger with Deutsche Bourse and a slowdown in large domestic listings, the London Stock Exchange is targeting emerging markets, and the Middle East in particular, as a source of new IPOs. Including Saudi Aramco, Riyadh aims to raise around $200 billion in the next several years through privatization programs in 16 sectors. Fighting a budget deficit, Kuwait is also considering privatizing some assets. United Arab Emirates could raise $1.5 to $2 billion for Abu Dhabi's national oil company. That is initially expected to be a local listing which does not rule out the company tapping the London market in future.  With smaller deal sizes, Egypt plans to list shares in a state-owned bank and companies including Banque du Caire and Arab African International Bank.      Some of the large Middle East companies will be suitable for a listing in London, though some could opt for their local exchange. Russian state-owned companies such as Gazprom and Rosneft are already on the London exchange using the less popular standard listing structure, but will now find it easier to achieve the conditions for a premium listing. For investors, the next step to watch will be whether any companies listed under the new rules will be eligible for including in any stock market indices, meaning they can raise funds from passive index-tracking funds.  FTSE, which runs the main UK stock indices, has already indicated that it will not include Aramco. It said its eligibility criteria for FTSE inclusion would not change if the new listing rules come into force.  Additional reporting by Olzhas Auyezov; Editing by Giles Elgood"
"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gsk-results-idUSKBN1AB1BH","GlaxoSmithKline's new boss streamlines R&D, axes slew of drugs","","July 26, 2017 /  10:19 AM / a day ago","","LONDON (Reuters) - GlaxoSmithKline's new chief executive announced plans on Wednesday to narrow the focus of the group's drug research by ditching more than 30 drug projects to improve returns in its core pharmaceuticals business. Emma Walmsley, who took over in April, said GSK would in future allocate 80 percent of its R&D; budget to respiratory and HIV/infectious diseases, along with two other potential areas of oncology and immuno-inflammation.  Thirteen clinical and around 20 pre-clinical programmes will be stopped, partnered or divested, and the group is considering options for its rare diseases unit after a strategic review. It also plans to stop selling the struggling diabetes drug Tanzeum and end a collaboration with Johnson & Johnson over experimental rheumatoid arthritis drug sirukumab, as well as divesting around 130 old drugs with limited sales. GSK has lagged behind rivals recently in producing multibillion-dollar blockbusters and has suffered a number of high-profile failures, undermining faith in its R&D; skills.  We've been too broadly spread, Walmsley told reporters, adding that the overhaul would not result in a lower R&D; budget because GSK had been investing too little in individual experimental drugs in the past. Indeed, spending could rise as Walmsley and her team go shopping for promising early-stage experimental drugs to bolster the pipeline in GSK's priority areas.  The announcement came as Britain's biggest drugmaker reported a 12 percent rise in adjusted earnings per share in sterling terms to 27.2 pence on sales up 12 percent at 7.32 billion pounds ($9.53 billion).  Analysts, on average, had forecast EPS of 26.2 pence and sales of 7.26 billion pounds, according to Thomson Reuters data. The group reiterated its outlook for 2020, first given in 2015, forecasting sales growth of low-to-mid single digits and adjusted earnings of mid-to-high single digits on a constant currency basis. For 2017, it now sees EPS growth of 3-5 percent, against 5-7 percent predicted previously, following investment in a priority review voucher to accelerate U.S. approval of a new HIV medicine.  FILE PHOTO: The GlaxoSmithKline building is pictured in Hounslow, west London June 18, 2013.Luke MacGregor/File PhotoShares in the group fell 1.3 percent by 1400 GMT, with some investors disappointed that Walmsley had not taken the opportunity to increase long-term financial targets. Given that she announced an extended cost-cutting programme to deliver an additional 1 billion pounds of annual cost savings by 2020, UBS analyst Michael Leuchten said the cautious approach suggests tougher underlying trends. Following Astrazeneca Walmsley, who previously headed GSK's consumer health unit after 17 years working for L'Oreal, is known for her focus on benchmarking business performance and had been expected to revamp pharma R&D.; Slideshow (2 Images)She had previously said she was considering the divestment of older antibiotics and planning to sell two UK nutritional brands. Overhauling GSK's R&D; machine is her biggest task, however, and she wants scientific and commercial teams to work closely together to pick winners.  The changes will take time to deliver results but Walmsley does have a window as GSK is not expecting its next wave of new drugs until after 2020. It also has no further major patent expiries until 2026. To some extent GSK is following in the footsteps of its smaller British rival AstraZeneca, which has divested a large number of non-core drug projects recently. Significantly, former AstraZeneca executive Luke Miels, who joins in September, will be a key lieutenant for Walmsley during the shake-up. GSK benefited once again in the quarter from a weak pound, after last year's Brexit vote, as well as strong demand for HIV medicines and the failure, so far, of generic firms to win U.S. approval for copies of its inhaled lung drug Advair. But HIV competition is set to increase next year and U.S. generics to Advair, which has generated more than $1 billion in annual sales for GSK since 2001, are likely by mid-2018. The company extended a commitment to pay its current 80 pence per share annual dividend through 2018.

The drugs' success for patients is the result of big bets in cancer therapy made by Bristol-Myers Squibb Co, Merck & Co Inc and Roche Holding AG, among others in big pharma. The industry's pipeline of cancer drugs expanded by 63 percent between 2005 and 2015, according to the QuintilesIMS Institute, and a good number are reaching the market. The global market for cancer immunotherapies alone is expected to grow more than fourfold globally to $75.8 billion by 2022 from $16.9 billion in 2015, according to research firm GlobalData. For a graphic, click tmsnrt.rs/2omboI1 For cancer drugs in general ... it is hard for us to drive down cost, said Steve Miller, chief medical officer at Express Scripts Holding Co, the nation's largest manager of drug benefit plans for employers and insurers. You don't want to be in the position of being told to use the second best cancer drug for your child. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, as well as President Donald Trump, have been grappling with how to restrain rising prescription drug costs. They have talked about solutions ranging from more price negotiation to faster approval of new drugs, often invoking increased competition between drugmakers. Competition is key to lowering drug prices, Trump told pharmaceutical executives at an Oval Office meeting in January. But that is not happening with new drugs called checkpoint inhibitors that work by releasing a molecular brake, allowing the immune system to recognize and attack cancer cells the same way it fights infections caused by bacteria or viruses. For cancers like melanoma, the treatments can mean long-term survival for around 20 percent of patients. Bristol's Yervoy, first approved in 2011, targets a protein known as CTLA-4. Other immunotherapies, including Bristol's Opdivo, Keytruda from Merck, Roche's Tecentriq, and Pfizer Inc's Bavencio, involve a different protein called PD-1. Other targets are being explored. Some new data will be presented this week in Washington at the American Association for Cancer Research's annual meeting. Current checkpoint inhibitors each have a list price near $150,000 a year. A combination of Yervoy and Opdivo, approved by the Food and Drug Administration for advanced or inoperable melanoma, has a cost of $256,000 a year for patients who respond to the treatment. Similar immunotherapies are in development at companies like AstraZeneca Plc. Merck, which declined to comment on pricing plans, expects an FDA decision by May 10 on its combination of Keytruda and chemotherapy as an initial treatment for the most common form of lung cancer - by far the biggest market for cancer drugs. Pfizer said Bavencio, cleared by the FDA earlier this month to treat Merkel cell carcinoma, a rare type of skin cancer, has a price comparable to other checkpoint inhibitors approved for different indications. The pharmaceutical industry holds that discussion of prescription drug prices has to take into account the major investment required for innovation and discovery of new lifesaving drugs. Unrestrained Pricing Power Scientific progress, and pricing power, are driving pharmaceutical companies to emphasize oncology research. Most of the strategy on the part of pharmaceutical companies assumes unrestrained pricing power, said Dr. Peter Bach, director of Memorial Sloan Kettering's Center for Health Policy Outcomes in New York. We don't see evidence that companies are pursuing cost-effective strategies. Health insurers have had success in demanding price concessions in some drug categories - like diabetes, where several companies sell similar products and insurers are able to negotiate price discounts or rebates in exchange for coverage. According to IMS, that tactic capped the overall rise in spending on diabetes medicines at 8 percent in 2015, compared with an increase of 30 percent in billed invoices. All of the invoice price growth for insulin was offset by price cuts, the institute said. But discounting is much less common for newer, innovative cancer drugs, mostly given by injection and approved for defined patient populations. Net price growth for branded oncology drugs averaged 4.8 percent in 2015, versus 6.4 percent for invoices, according to IMS. Express Scripts' Miller and others said makers of new cancer medications enjoy pricing power due to coverage requirements, insurance plan structure and a lack of head-to-head comparison studies. Cancer drugs don't compete on price, said Dr. Aaron Kesselheim, a researcher at Harvard Medical School and author of several studies of drug pricing. Drug companies have market exclusivity and we require payers to cover cancer drugs - Medicare has six protected classes, including cancer. Medicare, the federal government's healthcare plan for seniors and the disabled, covers most prescription drugs under its Part D pharmacy benefits. The plans are required to cover all drugs in six classes: cancer, HIV, antidepressants, antispychotics, seizure disorders like epilepsy, and immune system suppressants for people undergoing organ transplantation. Trump met recently with Representatives Elijah Cummings and Peter Welch, both Democrats, to discuss draft legislation allowing the government to negotiate Medicare drug prices - but the bill preserves the six protected classes. In addition, drugs given by injection, including many cancer therapies, are covered under Medicare's main medical benefit. Bristol disappointed investors when it did not  pursue accelerated FDA review of the Opdivo/Yervoy combination for newly-diagnosed lung cancer - putting Merck ahead in the lucrative lung cancer market. All of the immunotherapies have similar price points, said Miller at Express Scripts. When you stack therapies, it means more expense for patients and (health) plan sponsors.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cyber-attack-idUSKBN19I1TD","New computer virus spreads from Ukraine to disrupt world business","","June 27, 2017 /  2:06 PM / a month ago","","FRANKFURT/MOSCOW/KIEV (Reuters) - A new cyber virus spread from Ukraine to wreak havoc around the globe on Wednesday, crippling thousands of computers, disrupting ports from Mumbai to Los Angeles and halting production at a chocolate factory in Australia. The virus is believed to have first taken hold on Tuesday in Ukraine where it silently infected computers after users downloaded a popular tax accounting package or visited a local news site, national police and international cyber experts said. More than a day after it first struck, companies around the world were still wrestling with the fallout while cyber security experts scrambled to find a way to stem the spread. Danish shipping giant A.P. Moller-Maersk (MAERSKb.CO) said it was struggling to process orders and shift cargoes, congesting some of the 76 ports around the world run by its APM Terminals subsidiary. U.S. delivery firm FedEx Corp (FDX.N) said its TNT Express division had been significantly affected by the virus, which also wormed its way into South America, affecting ports in Argentina operated by China's Cofco. The malicious code locked machines and demanded victims post a ransom worth $300 in bitcoins or lose their data entirely, similar to the extortion tactic used in the global WannaCry ransomware attack in May. More than 30 victims paid up but security experts are questioning whether extortion was the goal, given the relatively small sum demanded, or whether the hackers were driven by destructive motives rather than financial gain. Hackers asked victims to notify them by email when ransoms had been paid but German email provider Posteo quickly shut down the address, a German government cyber security official said. Ukraine, the epicenter of the cyber strike, has repeatedly accused Russia of orchestrating attacks on its computer systems and critical power infrastructure since its powerful neighbor annexed the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea in 2014. The Kremlin, which has consistently rejected the accusations, said on Wednesday it had no information about the origin of the global cyber attack, which also struck Russian companies such as oil giant Rosneft (ROSN.MM) and a steelmaker. No one can effectively combat cyber threats on their own, and, unfortunately, unfounded blanket accusations will not solve this problem, said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. Related CoverageCyber attack hits property arm of French bank BNP ParibasCofco's Argentina grains operations affected by cyber attackESET, a Slovakian company that sells products to shield computers from viruses, said 80 percent of the infections detected among its global customer base were in Ukraine, with Italy second hardest hit with about 10 percent. Eternal Blue The aim of the latest attack appeared to be disruption rather than ransom, said Brian Lord, former deputy director of intelligence and cyber operations at Britain's GCHQ and now managing director at private security firm PGI Cyber. My sense is this starts to look like a state operating through a proxy ... as a kind of experiment to see what happens, Lord told Reuters on Wednesday. While the malware seemed to be a variant of past campaigns, derived from code known as Eternal Blue believed to have been developed by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA), experts said it was not as virulent as May's WannaCry attack. Security researchers said Tuesday's virus could leap from computer to computer once unleashed within an organization but, unlike WannaCry, it could not randomly trawl the internet for its next victims, limiting its scope to infect. Customers queue in 'Rost' supermarket in Kharkiv, Ukraine June 27, 2017 in this picture obtained from social media. MIKHAIL GOLUB via REUTERSBushiness that installed Microsoft's (MSFT.O) latest security patches from earlier this year and turned off Windows file-sharing features appeared to be largely unaffected. There was speculation, however, among some experts that once the new virus had infected one computer it could spread to other machines on the same network, even if those devices had received a security update. After WannaCry, governments, security firms and industrial groups advised businesses and consumers to make sure all their computers were updated with Microsoft (MSFT.O) security patches. Austria's government-backed Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) said a small number of international firms appeared to be affected, with tens of thousands of computers taken down. Security firms including Microsoft, Cisco's (CSCO.O) Talos and Symantec (SYMC.O) said they had confirmed some of the initial infections occurred when malware was transmitted to users of a Ukrainian tax software program called MEDoc. Slideshow (11 Images)The supplier of the software, M.E.Doc denied in a post on Facebook that its software was to blame, though Microsoft reiterated its suspicions afterwards. Microsoft now has evidence that a few active infections of the ransomware initially started from the legitimate MEDoc updater process, it said in a technical blog post. Russian security firm Kaspersky said a Ukrainian news site for the city of Bakhumut was also hacked and used to distribute the ransomware to visitors, encrypting data on their machines. Corporate Chaos A number of the international firms hit have operations in Ukraine, and the virus is believed to have spread within global corporate networks after gaining traction within the country. Shipping giant A.P. Moller-Maersk (MAERSKb.CO), which handles one in seven containers shipped worldwide, has a logistics unit in Ukraine. Other large firms affected, such as French construction materials company Saint Gobain (SGOB.PA) and Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ.O), which owns chocolate brand Cadbury, also have operations in the country. Maersk was one of the first global firms to be taken down by the cyber attack and its operations at major ports such as Mumbai in India, Rotterdam in the Netherlands and Los Angeles on the U.S. west coast were disrupted. Other companies to succumb included BNP Paribas Real Estate (BNPP.PA), a part of the French bank that provides property and investment management services. The international cyber attack hit our non-bank subsidiary, Real Estate. The necessary measures have been taken to rapidly contain the attack, the bank said on Wednesday. Production at the Cadbury factory on the Australian island state of Tasmania ground to a halt late on Tuesday after computer systems went down. Russia's Rosneft, one of the world's biggest crude producers by volume, said on Tuesday its systems had suffered serious consequences but oil production had not been affected because it switched to backup systems.

Shares of General Motors Co (GM.N) rose 5.5 percent and  Ford Motor Co <F.N) stock rose 4.6 percent, far outpacing the wider Dow Jones Industrial Average, which was up only 0.3 percent. Autodata Corp said 2016 U.S. auto sales of 17.55 million were 0.4 percent higher than the previous record set in 2015. December sales rose 3 percent, and on a seasonally adjusted annualized basis were 18.43 million vehicles, Autodata said. That widely beat expectations of economists polled by Thomson Reuters of 17.7 million vehicles. The results prompted executives from the three biggest sellers in the U.S. market, GM, Ford, and Toyota Motor Corp, (7203.T), to predict that this year's sales will be near 2016's record levels. Related CoverageU.S. 2016 auto sales set new record at 17.465 million: WardsAutoU.S. consumer confidence reached levels not seen in 15 years in December. Auto sales are an early indicator of consumer spending, and account for about a fifth of U.S. retail spending. GM's December sales rose 10 percent, Ford was up 0.3 percent and Toyota increased 2 percent. All three automakers' results, lifted by strong demand for pickup trucks and SUVs, beat Wall Street expectations. Ford said it sold 87,512 F-Series pickups in December, the lineup’s best overall sales month in 11 years. The F-series was the best-selling model line in the United States last year, for the 40th year in a row. A newly remodeled Ford F250 Super Duty truck is displayed in front of the new Louisville Ford truck plant in Louisville, Kentucky, U.S. September 30, 2016.Bryan WoolstonRogue, a compact SUV from Nissan Motor Co, (7201.T) in December was the fourth best-selling model in the U.S. market and showed a sales increase of 53 percent from a year earlier.  Pickups and SUVs accounted for 59.5 percent of 2016 auto sales, up from 55.8 percent in 2015. Pickup trucks and compact SUVs held the first six spots in the monthly top-selling models list, as reported by the automakers. Rush-hour traffic passes through Washington, U.S., December 20, 2016.Joshua RobertsStrong consumer discounts, also called sales incentives, also helped December's sales. December consumer discounts averaged about $4,000 per vehicle, up by about $500 from a year earlier, according to J.D. Power data provided to Reuters. Discounts erode automakers' profits but GM said the average transaction price for its vehicles rose $740 from November to $36,386 in December, reflecting in part strong sales of large SUVs such as the Chevrolet Tahoe. That is important to investors because Detroit's automakers make the bulk of their global profits from sales of trucks and SUVs in North America. Industry executives have cautioned for several months that the U.S. market's post-financial crisis recovery was due for a slowdown, but such concerns seem to be easing. “Key economic indicators, especially consumer confidence, continue to reflect optimism about the U.S. economy and strong customer demand continues to drive a very healthy U.S. auto industry,” said Mustafa Mohatarem, GM’s chief economist.

The drugs' success for patients is the result of big bets in cancer therapy made by Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (BMY.N), Merck & Co Inc (MRK.N) and Roche Holding AG (ROG.S), among others in big pharma. The industry's pipeline of cancer drugs expanded by 63 percent between 2005 and 2015, according to the QuintilesIMS Institute, and a good number are reaching the market.  The global market for cancer immunotherapies alone is expected to grow more than fourfold globally to $75.8 billion by 2022 from $16.9 billion in 2015, according to research firm GlobalData.      For cancer drugs in general ... it is hard for us to drive down cost, said Steve Miller, chief medical officer at Express Scripts Holding Co (ESRX.O), the nation's largest manager of drug benefit plans for employers and insurers. You don't want to be in the position of being told to use the second best cancer drug for your child.  Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, as well as President Donald Trump, have been grappling with how to restrain rising prescription drug costs. They have talked about solutions ranging from more price negotiation to faster approval of new drugs, often invoking increased competition between drugmakers.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-election-socialists-idUSKBN19A25D","Fractured French Socialists seek new identity after election disaster","","June 19, 2017 /  3:38 PM / a month ago","","PARIS (Reuters) - After the Socialist Party's dismal showing in the first round of France's parliamentary election, an advert appeared on a property website: Historic building for sale - former seat of the Socialist Party - at 10 Rue de Solferino. Sale due to poor election results.  It was a prank but after a drubbing in Sunday's second round vote, the future of the building may be up for discussion as the party tries to reinvent itself for survival. The number of Socialist seats in the 577 seat chamber plummeted from 280 in 2012 to just 29, the lowest in the post-war Fifth Republic. Parliament's lower house will be dominated by President Emmanuel Macron's centrist Republic on the Move party that blew apart the traditional two-party system. The Socialists may be sidelined for years and will be a weak force in parliament where they have been a major obstacle to more liberal economics that investors hope Macron will bring.  If the Socialists move to the left -- to capture voters whose growing support of hard-left ideas has helped Jeremy Corbyn in Britain -- they will compete with Jean-Luc Melenchon's France Unbowed. The stunning demise reflects the wider struggle of left wing parties in Europe to overcome internal divisions and win votes.  Just five years after hailing the election of Francois Hollande as a new dawn for French Socialists, they will not even be the official opposition -- the conservative The Republicans party will take that role.  The collapse of the Socialist Party is beyond doubt, Jean-Christophe Cambadelis said late on Sunday after announcing he would step down as party chief. The president of the Republic has all the powers. Cambadelis said it was time to build a new political force on the left. The crisis facing the Socialists has its roots in Hollande's mid-term shift from being the self-proclaimed enemy of bankers and defender of workers to advocate of business-friendly reform. Hollande's move split the party, exposing a deep-seated rift between moderates and hard-left lawmakers, and when the reforms failed to spur the economy, the Socialists haemorrhaged support.  Hollande became the first postwar French president not to seek re-election. The party's nominee, Benoit Hamon, adopted a message veering toward the far-left. But hard-left voters were already flocking to  Melenchon, while progressive party grandees inclined toward the center jumped ship to Macron. Hamon polled fifth, setting the party on course for Sunday's disastrous parliamentary vote. The Socialist Party has been through crises before, but this one is unprecedented in size, said historian and party member Denis Lefebvre. Boxed in An immediate concern for the Socialist Party will be its finances because of a sharp drop in public funding. French political parties receive government financing worth 1.42 euros each year for every vote won in the parliamentary elections and over 37,000 euros for every elected lawmaker.  The 2012 election results translated into 24.9 million euros last year, almost half its total budget, French media has calculated and that will now fall sharply.  The Socialist party has low debt but the loss of funding will mean scaling back operations just as it needs to reconcile rival factions after Hollande lost control.   The Socialist Party has faced near-death experiences before -- in 1969, when it won just 5 percent of the presidential vote and in 1993 when it was all but wiped out as a major party in parliamentary elections, collecting 53 seats.  On both occasions the Socialists recovered but bouncing back this time may be more difficult.  The scale of Macron's win pointed to widespread disillusion with the two main traditional parties. It also blew apart the left-right divide and left the Socialists boxed in between a powerful centrist party and a buoyant France Unbowed. From a strategic standpoint, they are wedged between Macron and Melenchon, said Antonio Barroso, an analyst at Temeo Intelligence. And they're a tarnished brand, part of the mainstream, part of the old politics. Fight for Survival For decades, France's fractured left was glued together by a common enemy on the right but Macron's victory may split the party along its progressive-traditional socialist faultline. Jim Shields, professor of French at Aston University, said the party had to reinvent itself if it is to survive.  This means (the Socialist Party) facing up to its own ideological contradictions and forging a clear policy direction that no longer pays lipservice to the far-left in opposition while inclining to the center in government, Shields said. Sebastian Denaja, a 38-year-old Hollande loyalist who lost his parliamentary seat in the first round said a new Socialist Party needed to be social-democrat, European, green.  He said there was still space for a reinvented center-left party because Macon's plans to cut public jobs and ease labor regulations showed that he was pure right-wing. Others on the traditional left, led by Hamon, believe a rapprochement with Melenchon, who rails against Europe and the rich and powerful, is possible. But in a typically combative speech on Sunday night that contrasted sharply with the Socialists' tone of defeat, Melenchon, a former Trotskyist, showed no sign of wanting to work with the party he quit in 2008. Hamon and Greens leader Yannick Jadot are due to launch a new movement on July 1. Meanwhile former minister Christiane Taubira, Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo and her Lille counterpart have launched a process of reflection called From Tomorrow.  It may be too late. There's no reason now to support the Socialist Party, said Sciences Po lecturer Thomas Guenole. They can try and create a new party but will it be a satellite (orbiting around) Melenchon or around Macron.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/lunar-newyear-china-tourism-idUSL5N1EZ1DS","Playing politics? Chinese tourism under scrutiny as Lunar New Year nears","","January 22, 2017 /  6:21 AM / 6 months ago","","SHANGHAI/BEIJING (Reuters) - With 6 million Chinese tourists expected to travel abroad over the Lunar New Year break, China's Jan. 27 to Feb. 2 holiday is crucial for Taiwan tour agency operator Li Chi-yueh, who relies on mainland visitors for a third of his revenue. But Li's hopes are not high this year, after the number of mainland tourists plummeted 36 percent since President Tsai Ing-wen took power in May. Though Tsai says Taiwan wants peace with China, Beijing suspects she seeks formal independence. China uses its sightseeing tourists as a diplomatic weapon, said Li, owner of Taipei-based Chung Shin Travel Service, who has been representing Taiwan's tour operators to lobby Tsai to improve ties with Beijing. There's a lot of concern that the industry won't survive if we carry on like this. The concern is not confined to Taiwan - tour operators and government officials elsewhere in Asia say they fear China is using its increasingly high-spending tourists as a lever to pressure or reward its neighbors. A government official from South Korea - which has irked China by agreeing to let the United States deploy an anti-missile system - said Chinese and Korean tour companies had told him the China National Tourism Administration (CNTA) had instructed Chinese agencies to cut tours to South Korea by at least 20 percent between November and February. The official calculated that thousands of potential travelers were lost after eight applications to add charter flights between the countries in January and February were rejected without explanation. This is not a win-win situation - it is mutually disadvantageous. But what can we do? As far as defense is concerned, we have no room to compromise, said the official, declining to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter. Chinese companies told him the measure was designed to cut an excessive number of low-quality, low-priced tours for Chinese tourists visiting Korea, the official said. The CNTA did not respond to Reuters' requests for comment. The number of Chinese tourists visiting South Korea inched up 1.8 percent on year in November, versus a 70.2 percent increase in August and a 22.8 percent rise in September. That was the worst since August 2015, when arrivals slid 32 percent after a Middle East Respiratory Syndrome outbreak. In early November, the United States said it would deploy the anti-missile system battery in South Korea within eight to 10 months. Political Uncertainty China has not said it is seeking to limit tourists to South Korea or Taiwan to express displeasure at political disputes.  Earlier this month, when asked about the limiting of charter flights over Lunar New Year, China's Foreign Ministry said it did not understand the details of the situation but that cooperation and exchanges between the two countries needed to have a basis in public opinion. For Taiwan, China has said it was natural that Chinese tourists were choosing not to visit Taiwan at a time of political uncertainly. By contrast, the Philippines and Malaysia are enjoying strong spurts in growth of Chinese tourism as Beijing removes travel warnings and eases visa rules. Chinese tourist arrivals between March and December in Malaysia jumped 83 percent from a year earlier. Tourist stroll through a food stall at Raohe street Night Market in Taipei, Taiwan January 18, 2017.Tyrone SiuBoth countries have been moving diplomatically closer to Beijing in recent months.  Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak returned from a November state visit with about $34 billion in deals, prompting criticism at home that he was selling off his country.  The Philippines, historically at odds with Beijing over territorial disputes in the South China Sea, has seen its President Rodrigo Duterte make overtures to China at the expense of traditional ally United States since he was elected in May 2016.  The number of tourists visiting the Philippines from China rose 40 percent in the first 10 months of 2016 compared with the previous year.  Chinese tourists are the world's highest overseas spenders. They are expected to spend $210 billion abroad this year, Euromonitor data shows, double the amount Chinese firms spent on overseas mergers and acquisitions in 2016. Slideshow (5 Images)Unwelcome Mainland travel companies Reuters spoke to acknowledged that traveler numbers to some countries were changing, but declined to comment on whether they had received government directives to discourage particular destinations.  Travelers are voting with their feet. They are choosing to go the country that will make them happy and avoid the country that might make them feel unwelcome, said Xu Xiaolei, chief brand officer at China Youth Travel Service (CYTS), one of China's top three state-owned travel companies.  Of course political and diplomatic matters are also under our consideration, as tourism is part of diplomacy in many ways. But demands of tourists are always the core principle when designing our travel packages. Shanghai Spring International Travel Service, parent of Spring Airlines, told Reuters its tours to Taiwan had become less frequent and had halved in size, without saying when. Its tour groups to South Korea have shrunk by 20 percent. Chinese tourists were turning to other destinations that are more friendly in terms of travel environment because of well-known reasons, Shanghai Spring International said.   Chinese flag carrier Air China said travelers were visiting new destinations in Europe and Southeast Asia.   As an airline we make our route arrangements according to market demand, said Luo Yang, head of marketing. Mercy Ma, a translator who plans to visit Cambodia with her family over the Lunar New Year break, said political events in Turkey and Thailand had deterred her from visiting those countries, but she paid less attention to other countries' ties with China. Taiwan was, in fact, a destination she had long wanted to visit, but was crimped by visa restrictions. We had been prepared to go to Taiwan, but then found out that there were quite a bit of restrictions, so we eventually decided against it.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/fitch-assigns-cp-alls-new-unsecured-bond-idUSFit993588","Fitch Assigns CP ALL's New Unsecured Bonds at 'A-(tha)'","","March 23, 2017 /  7:00 AM / 4 months ago","","(The following statement was released by the rating agency) BANGKOK, March 23 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings (Thailand) Limited has assigned CP ALL  Public Company Limited's (CP ALL, A(tha)/Stable) new senior unsecured bonds a  National Long-Term Rating of 'A-(tha)'. The bonds, totalling up to THB4.5  billion, will be due in 2029. The proceeds will be used to repay the  Thailand-based retailer's maturing bonds. The rating on the senior unsecured bonds is one notch lower than CP ALL's  'A(tha)' National Long-Term Rating due to a significant amount of prior-ranking  debt, which made up 3.5x of the company's EBITDA in 2016. KEY RATING DRIVERS High Financial Leverage: Fitch expects CP ALL's FFO-adjusted net leverage to  remain high at above 3.5x beyond 2018. Deleveraging at CP ALL has been slower  than we had expected because of a weak domestic economy in past two years. Sale  of shares in subsidiary Siam Makro Public Company Limited (Makro) is also  unlikely to take place in the next 12 months, in our view. Moderate-but-Defensive Growth: Fitch expects CP ALL's sales to increase by  9%-10% a year in 2017-2018, driven mainly by new store openings and a recovery  in same-store sales growth to 3%-4% a year for both 7-Eleven and Makro stores  (2016: 2.4% and 4.1%, respectively), in line with the domestic economic  recovery. The company also continues to benefit from the defensive nature of  its business, which sells daily essentials with low revenue and margin  volatility; its medium-term growth potential is still supported by Thailand's  immature market for modern-food retailing. Leading Market Position: We believe CP ALL is likely to maintain its leading  position despite intense competition. The company has more than 9,500 stores  nationwide, and a more-than-60% share of the convenience-store market in  Thailand, far more than its closest rival. Its dominance is supported by its  large network and coverage area, along with well-established functions such as  logistics, supply and maintenance, and staff training and development. Strong Retail Brand: CP ALL operates 7-Eleven stores, a leading international  brand of convenience chain stores. CP ALL was granted an area licence agreement  for Thailand from 7-Eleven, Inc., USA, with the first store opening in 1989.  Thailand is now the second-largest international licensee of 7-Eleven, Inc.,  after Japan.  DERIVATION SUMMARY CP ALL has a strong domestic market position as the largest convenient store  chain in Thailand, similar to The Siam Cement Public Company Limited (SCC,  A(tha)/Positive), the largest cement and downstream petrochemicals producer in  Thailand and Thai Oil Public Company Limited (TOP, AA-(tha)/Stable), the largest  oil refiner in Thailand. However, CP ALL has a stronger competitive position  with its market share significantly larger than that of its closest rival. CP  ALL also has lower business risk than SCC and TOP, which are exposed to cyclical  demand for their products and the fluctuation of commodity price, reflected by  CP ALL's more stable level of EBITDAR margin.  CP ALL's financial leverage is,  however, significantly higher than both peers, due to the debt incurred from the  leveraged buy-out of Makro in 2013. Given the sector's low capital  intensiveness, CP ALL's financial leverage should decrease over time.  CP ALL's lower business risk should compensate for its higher financial leverage  than SCC. On the other hand, the financial leverage of TOP, which is very low at  about 1.0x, warrants its higher rating. TOP's credit rating is also notched up  to reflect its linkage to the PTT group. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: - Revenue growth of 9%-10% per year in 2017-2018;  - EBITDAR margin to improve to 10.2%-10.4% in 2017-2018; - 700 new 7-Eleven stores per year in 2017-2018 and four new large-format stores  per year for Makro in 2017-2018.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: Developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to positive  rating action include: - FFO-adjusted net leverage at less than 3.5x (end-2016: 5.4x). Negative: Developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to negative  rating action include: - A failure to reduce FFO-adjusted net leverage to below 4.5x by 2018. - Deterioration in EBITDAR margin to below 7.5% on a sustained basis (2016:  10.1%). LIQUIDITY Strong Liquidity: CP ALL had total debt of THB199 billion as of end-2016. About  15.8% will be due in the next 12 months from end-2016. About 96% of its total  debt is Thai baht bonds, 67% of which are secured by Makro shares. The liquidity  is mainly supported by its cash and current investment of THB34.8 billion, its  strong cash flow generation as well as its strong accessibility to debt capital  market.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/fitch-rates-new-telefonica-moviles-chile-idUSFit998409","Fitch Rates New Telefonica Moviles Chile S.A. 'BBB+' Upon Merger","","May 5, 2017 /  4:29 PM / 3 months ago","","(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, May 05 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned Inversiones Telefonica Moviles Holdings S.A. (ITMH) Long-term Foreign-currency and Local-currency Issuer Default Ratings (IDR) of 'BBB+' with a Stable Outlook following the company's merger with its subsidiary, Telefonica Moviles Chile S.A. (TMCH). Fitch has also affirmed TMCH's Long-term FC and LC IDRs at 'BBB+' and simultaneously withdrawn the ratings as the entity no longer exists after the merger. Fitch also affirmed Telefonica Chile S.A.'s (TCH) Long-term FC and LC IDRs at 'BBB+' with a Stable Outlook. A full list of rating actions follows at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS TMCH announced today the completion of the reorganization plan approved by the shareholders on March 22, 2017. Under the plan TMCH merged with its parent, ITMH, with the latter being the surviving entity. Upon completion of the merger, all of TMCH's existing local debt was assumed by the merged entity, and ITMH changed its legal name to Telefonica Moviles Chile S.A. ITMH is a holding company for the Telefonica group in Chile, which also owns 97.9% of the group's fixed-line operator, Telefonica Chile S.A. (TCH, rated 'BBB+'/Outlook Stable). The ratings of the newly merged ITMH (new TMCH) are based on the full consolidated credit profile of the group. TCH and TMCH both have solid financial profiles for a 'BBB+' rating level, and their current ratings already incorporate a degree of financial and operational linkage between them given the, integrated business and financial strategy under the common management and brand unity, as well as sales coverage. This relationship will remain intact, as TCH is now a subsidiary of TMCH following the merger. ITMH's ratings reflect Telefonica Chile group's entrenched leading positions in the Chilean telecommunications market, strong brand recognition and network competitiveness, and sound financial profile backed by solid cash flow generation. Fitch does not foresee any material change to these credit qualities in the short to medium term. Strong Market Positions: TMCH is one of the two dominant mobile operators in Chile, along with Empresa Nacional de Telecomunicationes S.A. (ENTEL), with a 32% subscriber market share as of December 2016, estimated by Subsecretaria de Telecomunicaciones (Subtel). Its high capex to bolster network competitiveness bodes well for its growth strategy, which is focused on mobile data and still has ample room for growth given only 35% of mobile internet penetration of the company's subscriber base. TCH is also the largest fixed-line service provider in Chile, and Fitch expects its strong market position to remain intact over the medium term backed by the company's continued high investments, especially in fiber, to improve service quality. As of December 2016, the company's revenue-generating units amounted to 3.2 million, which was relatively unchanged compared to a year ago as continued fixed-voice customer loss was compensated for by steady increase in broadband and pay-TV subscribers. TCH retained leading market share of 41% in the fixed-voice segment, and the second-largest market shares of 36% and 21% in broadband and pay-TV, respectively, behind VTR Globalcom S.A. during the same time period. Competitive Mobile Market: Fitch expects the competitive landscape of the mobile business in Chile to remain intense as other major mobile operators, including WOM, the new entrant, continue to offer aggressive tariff plans to improve market shares. While this would suppress the company's subscriber base growth, especially in the prepaid segment, and profitability, Fitch expects TMCH's market position to remain relatively intact as its solid network quality and strong brand recognition will help fend off competition to an extent. During 2016, TMCH's revenues fell by 3% with EBITDA margin deteriorating to 26% from 28%, compared to 2015. Stable Fixed-line Operation: Positively, TCH's steady subscriber growth in broadband and pay-TV operations will continue to support stable performance of the fixed-line operations in the short- to medium term despite ongoing contraction in traditional voice service revenues. High-speed broadband and pay-TV services still offer growth headroom in terms of service penetrations, and the company's attractive bundled product offerings should help prevent the churn of the voice customers and protects profitability. Fixed-line services resumed growth in 2016, with revenue improvement of 3% and a stable EBITDA margin of 34%, which was in line with the 2015 level. Solid Financial Profile: Fitch forecasts ITMH's consolidated operational cash flow generation will remain robust at about CLP400 billion annually, which should comfortably cover the annual capex requirements of about CLP300 billion during 2017 and 2018. In the absence of any sizable dividend payments, Fitch forecasts ITMH's FCF margin will be 3%-4% in 2017 and 2018, which will continue to support the company's solid financial profile for the rating category. Fitch forecasts the company's net leverage, measured by total adjusted net debt/EBITDAR, remain in line with the end-2016 level of 1.2x. DERIVATION SUMMARY ITMH's BBB+ rating, based on the consolidated credit profile of the Telefonica Chile Group, is well positioned relative to its regional peers on major comparative. The company holds entrenched leading market positions in Chilean mobile and fixed-line segments, and its robust operational cash flow generation and low leverage compare favorably to other operators in the 'BBB' category, such as Empresa Nacional de Telecomunicaciones S.A. Strong linkage exists between ITMH and its subsidiary, TCH, given a high degree of operational and financial linkages with common management and business strategy. ITMH's ratings are based on the group's consolidated credit profile, including TCH. No country ceiling constraint or operating environment influence was in effect for the ratings. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: --Slow revenue growth at low-single-digits in 2017 and 2018; -- Consolidated EBITDA margin to remain at around 29% in 2017 and 2018; --Annual capex requirement of about CLP300 billion; --Mid-single-digits Pre-divided FCF margin in 2017 and 2018; --Net leverage of 1.1x-1.2x In 2017 and 2018. RATING SENSITIVITIES An upgrade of ITMH's ratings, which results in more than one notch differential from its parent, Telefonica SA's 'BBB' rating is unlikely given the companies' financial linkage. Negative rating action could be considered in the case of material deterioration of the company's key operating and financial metrics due to intense competition, unfavorable regulatory impact, and higher than expected capex and shareholder distributions - all of which combined resulting in negative FCF generation and net leverage increasing to over 2.0x on a sustained basis. Telefonica Moviles Chile S.A.'s ratings are not directly linked to the ratings of its parent, Telefonica SA (TEF). However, any significant deterioration in the parent's credit profile, to the effect that it results in further rating downgrades or in an increased needs for dividend income for the parent, could place pressure on ITMH's ratings. Fitch currently rates TEF 'BBB'/Outlook Stable. LIQUIDITY Sound Liquidity: ITMH's liquidity profile is sound as its cash balance of CLP221 billion comfortably covered its short-term debt obligation of CLP59 billion, net of its short-term hedge derivatives instruments. Fitch does not foresee any material change in the company's liquidity as its operational cash flow generation remains robust and its debt maturities are well spread out. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Telefonica Moviles Chile S.A --FC/LC IDRs affirmed at 'BBB+'/ Outlook Stable and withdrawn; --National Long term rating affirmed at 'AA(cl)' / Outlook Stable and withdrawn; --Local debt issuance programme series No. 589, No. 590, No. 813, and No.814 and series F, G, H, I, J, K, L, and M bond issuances affirmed at 'AA(cl)'; transferred to Inversiones Telefonica Moviles Holding S.A.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/correction-fitch-rates-new-europlan-opco-idUSFit4zSZJb","Correction: Fitch Rates New Europlan Opco 'BB-', Withdraws Ratings on Holdco","","July 7, 2017 /  9:20 AM / 21 days ago","","(The following statement was released by the rating agency) LONDON, July 07 (Fitch) This commentary replaces the version published on 30 June 2017. It corrects  the rating action on the senior unsecured rating of JSC Leasing company Europlan's bonds to affirmation at 'BB-' following the transfer of the notes from PJSC Europlan, and not withdrawn at PJSC Europlan and assigned at opco as stated initially. Fitch Ratings has withdrawn PJSC Europlan's ratings, including its Long-Term Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) of 'BB-'. Simultaneously, the agency has assigned the newly created JSC Leasing company Europlan (LC Europlan) Long-Term IDRs of 'BB-' with a Stable Outlook. The rating actions follow the completion of the reorganisation of PJSC Europlan. The reorganisation involved the transfer from PJSC Europlan to its new subsidiary LC Europlan of all financial liabilities relating to its leasing business (including outstanding bonds and bank loans) and all of its leasing assets, but only a portion of its cash and liquid assets. Fitch has withdrawn PJSC Europlan's ratings as it has undergone a reorganisation. Accordingly, Fitch will no longer provide ratings or analytical coverage for PJSC Europlan. A full list of rating actions is at the end of this rating action commentary. KEY RATING DRIVERS The asset/liability transfer is the second stage of Europlan's reorganisation, the ultimate purpose of which is to create a holding company for the non-bank financial assets of Safmar Group, which apart from Europlan include a 49% stake in VSK Insurance (BB-/Stable), and a 100% stake in Safmar pension fund. The first stage of the reorganisation was completed in December 2016, when Safmar contributed its stakes in the pension fund and insurance company to PJSC Europlan, which additionally raised RUB15 billion of equity contributed in cash via a secondary public offering. The rating actions reflect Fitch's view that LC Europlan's credit profile does not significantly differ from that of PJSC Europlan before it received stakes in the pension fund and VSK. LC Europlan's management has informed us that there are no plans to change the strategy of the company after the carve-out. The company will continue to focus on retail financial leasing of vehicles. LC Europlan will retain its core management team and existing branding. LC Europlan's 'BB-' Long-Term IDRs and senior debt rating reflect the company's significant franchise in the Russian auto leasing sector, so far conservative management and risk appetite, and sound financial metrics. At the same time, the ratings also reflect the high-risk Russian operating environment and contagion risks resulting from Europlan's shareholder, Safmar Group (previously known as B&N; Group). As per preliminary management accounts after the reorganisation, LC Europlan's leverage (defined as debt/equity) has increased to 3.3x compared with 1.5x at PJSC Europlan prior to reorganisation, as a result of PJSC Europlan retaining a sizable part of its cash and liquid assets. However, Fitch views this leverage as consistent with a 'BB-' rating. The senior unsecured notes issued by PJSC Europlan were transferred to LC Europlan's as part of the group reorganisation and have been affirmed at 'BB-'. LC Europlan's senior debt rating is aligned with the company's Local-Currency IDR, reflecting Fitch's view of average recovery prospects for unsecured senior creditors in case of default. This in turn is driven by the moderate proportion of company assets that have been pledged to secured creditors. RATING SENSITIVITIES An upgrade of LC Europlan's IDRs is currently unlikely given the still challenging operating environment and expected further increase in leverage from renewed business growth. The company could be downgraded if its asset quality and performance weaken significantly, to the extent that this results in a marked increase in the company's leverage or compromises the quality of its capital. LC Europlan could be also downgraded if Fitch concludes that its strategy, risk appetite, balance sheet structure and/or financial metrics are likely to significantly weaken following shareholder actions, or if the company become significantly exposed to related parties, non-core assets or other contingent risks arising from the other assets of its owner. The senior debt rating could be downgraded in case of downgrade of the company's Local-Currency IDR, or a marked increase in the proportion of pledged assets, potentially resulting in lower recoveries for unsecured senior creditors in a default scenario. The rating actions are as follows: PJSC Europlan Long-Term Foreign- and Local-Currency IDRs: 'BB-'; withdrawn Short-Term Foreign-Currency IDR: 'B'; withdrawn JSC Leasing company Europlan Long-Term Foreign- and Local-Currency IDRs: assigned at 'BB-'; Outlooks Stable Short-Term Foreign-Currency IDR: assigned at 'B' Senior unsecured debt: affirmed at 'BB-' (transferred from PJSC Europlan) Contacts: Primary Analyst Aslan Tavitov Director +44 20 3530 1788 Fitch Ratings Limited 30 North Colonnade London E14 5GN Secondary Analyst Ruslan Bulatov Associate Director +7 495 956 9982 Committee Chairperson James Watson Managing Director +7 495 956 6657 Media Relations: Julia Belskaya von Tell, Moscow, Tel: +7 495 956 9908, Email: julia.belskayavontell@fitchratings.com; Peter Fitzpatrick, London, Tel: +44 20 3530 1103, Email: peter.fitzpatrick@fitchratings.com.

Automakers, in recent years, have come under pressure from ride-sharing companies such as Uber, and technology giants Google and Apple that are investing in building autonomous car technologies. TAMO will contribute to the repositioning of the Tata Motors brand, Managing Director Guenter Butschek told reporters at an event in Mumbai. The first car under the TAMO brand will be launched at the Geneva Motor show in March, the company said. Tata Motors also said it would reduce the number of car platforms from six to two, which will be introduced in 2018, to increase production efficiency and reduce costs.

The world's largest automaker's core division is being restructured with thousands of job cuts and retrenchments in parts and vehicle development as it struggles to fund a post-dieselgate shift to electric cars and new technologies. More than 10 new models launched this year including the top-of-the-line Arteon fastback and a redesigned Polo subcompact, one of VW's all-time bestsellers, would stoke demand and underpin the turnaround, VW brand chief executive Herbert Diess told Reuters on Friday. We are making good progress, Diess said during an event to present the next-generation Polo. 2018 will be a strong year for VW, he said, adding a new product always helped margins. VW brand's operating margin jumped to 4.6 percent in the first quarter from 0.3 percent a year earlier, still lagging French rivals PSA Peugeot Citroen (PEUP.PA) and Renault (RENA.PA) but nearing its long-term 2025 target of 6 percent. Diess said VW had a goal for 2017 to maintain the brand's first-quarter performance when operating profit surged to 869 million euros from 73 million a year ago.

Slideshow (15 Images)A spokesman declined to specify the new Polo's on-road nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions and whether they met EU targets, saying VW at this point only had emissions estimates for the model which cannot be disclosed.

Research firm IHS Markit expects the VW model to win easily. European deliveries of the Polo may jump a quarter to 368,158 cars by 2025 from 293,700 this year, compared with a 2.7 percent gain to 328,846 models for the Fiesta and a 32 percent plunge to 185,525 cars for the Clio, according to IHS.

The new chain, the product of conversations last year between President Donald Trump's sons Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump about the lack of options in the midscale market, will be franchised and thus not directly operated by Trump Hotels, unlike most of the company's other properties. When closely held Trump Hotels, which is part of the Trump Organization, announced the brand last month, it said it had struck a deal with Chawla Pointe, LLC, to open three of the properties in Mississippi. If the further 10 or so properties come to fruition, the deals would thrust Trump Hotels into the midscale market at a time when other hotel companies are extending their range in that area. Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc (HLT.N) and Intercontinental Hotels Group Plc (IHG.L) have announced new midscale brands in recent months.      Generally that midscale product is all the same with a different name on it, Danziger said in a phone interview this week, adding that American Idea would differentiate itself with a decor he described as flea market chic, with decor and design tailored to local industries and landmarks.

The group, whose sales have suffered in recent years, said in a statement on Wednesday that Tommaso Bruso would become chief operating officer while Chief Executive Marco Airoldi -  a former partner at Boston Consulting who took the helm at Benetton in 2104 - was stepping down. A source close to the matter said Bruso, currently in charge of the U.S. unit of Italian clothing group Diesel, would effectively replace Airoldi to revamp Benetton's labels and the group's franchising network. Benetton, fully owned by the eponymous family through their Edizione holding, has had more than half a dozen chief executives in the past 15 years. Airoldi had focused on overhauling the structure of the company, separating the real estate business from the core activities of the group. The company, which has 5,000 stores around the world, in 2013 embarked on a restructuring plan aimed at cutting down losses and retaking its place amongst forefront fashion brands. Famous in the 1980s and 1990s for its colourful jumpers and controversial advertising campaign, Benetton has failed to keep up with the rapid expansion of trendier rivals such as Zara, which woos clients with fast-changing, affordable collections inspired by catwalk fashion. In the latest financial statement available the group reported a 1.2 percent drop in 2015 sales to 1.53 billion euros and a 46 million euro loss for the year. Before joining Diesel, Bruso was the CEO for North America at Italian handbag and accessories maker Furla. The chairman of Edizione, Gilberto Benetton, said last year the group was not looking for investors but may list again in a few years, after de-listing in 2012.

GSK bought the business, which makes protein bars, drinks and powders, for 162 million pounds ($205 million) in 2010 under previous CEO Andrew Witty. It is best known for its Maximuscle products for weight-trainers. The original acquisition was seen as complementing GSK's Lucozade sports drinks. Lucozade, however, was sold in 2013 and Walmsley, who took over on April 1, has decided the UK-focused MaxiNutrition business no longer fits in the wider group. GSK's consumer healthcare business, which was previously led by Walmsley and includes an extensive range of over-the-counter medicines, is heavily geared towards global brands.  The proceeds from the sale of MaxiNutrition will not move the dial significantly at the drugs giant, which has a market value of 85 billion pounds, but the decision shows Walmsley is ready to reverse past management decisions. A spokesman for GSK declined to comment on the divestment plans, which were first reported by Sky News. Walmsley is due to outline her vision for GSK alongside half-year results next month.

The company announced in February that Emporio Armani was to absorb the Armani Collezioni and Armani Jeans brands.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sears-restructuring-brands-analysis-idUSKBN16U2PX","Sears' plan to sell brands no salve for financial woes","","March 23, 2017 /  7:18 PM / in 4 months","","(Reuters) - Sears' plan to avoid bankruptcy in part by selling off or licensing brands including Kenmore and DieHard may prove difficult because of changing consumer tastes and possible legal roadblocks. Sears Holdings Corp, once the largest U.S. retailer, warned on Tuesday about its ability to continue as a going concern after years of losses and declining sales. The Kenmore brand for appliances and the DieHard brand for car batteries are among the best-known remaining assets of the U.S. retailer, whose roots date back to 1886. In January, Sears sold its Craftsman tool brand to Stanley Black & Decker Inc for $900 million. Sears, which also owns Kmart Corp, has dozens of other in-house apparel and houseware brands. Analysts in the past four years have collectively valued the Craftsman, Kenmore and DieHard brands at up to $3 billion. However, several industry consultants and restructuring experts  said the worth of those assets has declined as Sears has fallen out of favor with consumers. Like their parent, Sears brands are hampered by a perception that they are yesterday's names. Sears is serving a customer base that is over the age of 50 or 55, said Doug Stephens, an independent retail industry consultant. As younger consumers increasingly embrace smart appliances, they do not perceive the 90-year-old Kenmore brand as being at the cutting edge of technology, he said. Sears declined to comment. Fitch Ratings said in January Sears would need to raise $2 billion in 2017 to avoid bankruptcy and another $2 billion in 2018. 'Not a Throwaway Brand' Because of Sears' shaky financial situation, potential buyers of Sears' brands would have to confront some unusual hurdles. Any asset sale would need approval from the U.S. Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp, a government agency that protects retirement incomes for American workers.  Sears Kenmore washing machines are shown for sale inside a Sears department store in La Jolla, California, U.S., March 22, 2017.Mike BlakeSears made a deal with the PBGC in March 2016 to use certain intellectual property and real estate assets to fulfill its pension obligations. The agency signed off on the Craftsman sale only after securing a promise from Sears that its pension plans would receive a $250 million payment and a 15-year income stream from Stanley Black & Decker’s sales of Craftsman products.  Another obstacle to selling the Kenmore and DieHard brands is the prospect that Sears could end up filing for bankruptcy. If it does, unhappy creditors could retroactively challenge a sale and ask a judge to void it as a fraudulent conveyance intended to hide assets. David Tawil, president of the hedge fund Maglan Capital, which invests in distressed companies but does not have a stake in Sears, said that was unlikely, but the risk might deter some buyers. Sears Kenmore washing machines are shown for sale inside a Sears department store in La Jolla, California, U.S., March 22, 2017.Mike BlakeKenmore was once the top U.S. appliance brand. But its share of the home appliances market fell from 17.4 percent in 2011 to 12.7 percent in the twelve months ending in March 2016, according to the Stevenson Company, a market research firm. DieHard’s share of the auto battery market dropped to 5.2 percent from about 7 percent during the same period, the firm said. Sears itself has lowered the book value of its intangible assets, which include the brands and other items like internet domain names and customer goodwill, from around $4.5 billion in 2011 to $1.8 billion in January.  Greg Portell, a retail industry consultant with A.T. Kearney, said he believes Sears brands can still command a strong price. He said big-box retailers or hardware superstores might take over the Kenmore brand to launch an in-house line. And lesser-known foreign manufacturers might see it as a way to gain a foothold in the U.S. market.  “This is not a throwaway brand that someone is going to shut down,” Portell said. The company has already raised some money from the Kenmore name. In February, Sears announced it reached a licensing agreement with the grill manufacturer Permasteel Inc that allows the company to sell Kenmore-branded grills. Financial terms of that transaction were not disclosed. Gene Baldwin, a restructuring expert at the financial advisory firm CR3 Partners, said it is unlikely Sears can generate the liquidity it needs just from selling or licensing its brands. The retailer's most valuable assets are its real estate holdings, he said.  I don't see Sears and Kmart stores sticking around, said Baldwin. This has been a slow-motion liquidation for a while now.

Apple (AAPL.O) and Samsung (005930.KS) lead the smartphone pack worldwide but impressive growth in the Chinese market has left room for a host of home-grown manufacturers to come to the fore, with China's Huawei now third in the world. Within China, Oppo surged to become market leader last year and it is expanding rapidly in Asia to stand fourth in the world rankings, even if its brand is little known in developed and increasingly stagnant Western markets. A closely related Chinese brand, Vivo, has muscled its way into fifth place globally. What this means, though, is that former Chinese market leaders, such as Lenovo (0992.HK) and TCL Communications (TCCLF.PK), are losing ground, and some are counting on retro Western brands to revive their fortunes at home and abroad. Emerging from a sea of indistinguishable smartphones, the showstopper at this year's main European technology trade fair was a revival of the Nokia (NOKIA.HE) 3310, its brightly colored cases and month-long battery life tugging at the heartstrings of erstwhile fans in search of a digital detox. The new phone was launched by Finnish firm HMD Global, led by former Nokia executives and backed financially by Chinese electronics giant Foxconn (2354.TW), which makes devices for Apple and Sony (6758.T), among others. Priced at 49 euros, the 3310 is meant to appeal to old fans in the West as well as finding a new generation of younger users in emerging markets looking for a good-looking reliable phone. The BlackBerry made a splash at the Barcelona trade fair too thanks to China's TCL Communication (TCCLF.PK) (000100.SZ), which unveiled a BlackBerry-licensed handset with the physical keyboard many professionals clung onto even as Apple's iPhone revolutionized the smartphone market. BlackBerry Ltd (BB.TO) supplies the phone's security software.  TCL, which is part of a group that makes appliances ranging from TVs to washing machines, has kept France's Alcatel brand alive for a decade. TCL-Alcatel is now the world's 10th biggest smartphone maker, according to research firm Strategy Analytics. International Expansion     FILE PHOTO: Nokia 3310 device is displayed after its presentation ceremony at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, February 26, 2017.Paul Hanna/File PhotoLenovo, the world's third largest mobile phone supplier in 2014 when it acquired U.S. cellphone pioneer Motorola, has subsequently sunk to ninth globally but is counting on Motorola as its premium smartphone brand to battle back. The Chinese firm is even open to following in Nokia's footsteps and reviving the retro, flip-top Motorola Razr, which was the second best selling phone in the world in 2004 and 2005. Lenovo Chief Executive Yang Yuanqing told CNBC this week that launching a revamped Razr could be a way of bringing customers back to the Motorola brand as it tries to drive into developed markets such as the United States. The Philips handset brand also lives on in India and China after the Dutch firm licensed its brand to Sang Fei, a subsidiary of TPV Technology (0903.HK), which also makes Philips television sets. FILE PHOTO: The Nokia 3310 is seen in an office in London, Britain February 24, 2017.Eddie Keogh/File PhotoFor now, though, the top Chinese phone makers such as Huawei [HWT.UL], Oppo and Vivo, look set on developing their own brands in a domestic market that is still growing even as demand in developed economies plateaus. China accounted for more than a third of the world's mobile phones shipped last year and domestic firms still had 90 percent of sales, according to a government report.  But as the market becomes overrun with me-too smartphones and margins evaporate, rivals may spot more opportunities to leapfrog rivals by capitalizing on familiar Western brands, said Strategy Analytics analyst Neil Mawston.      As the Chinese market peaks and organic growth becomes harder, these brands may consider takeovers as the fastest way to speed up their expansion, he said, referring to moves overseas.     At some point, either Huawei, Vivo or Oppo may come to the point where buying an existing international brand is their best way to expand, Mawston said. Analyst say possible targets could include famous phone brands fallen on hard times including Japan's Sony (6758.T) or Taiwan's HTC (2498.TW). It could well be that we see more brands of yesteryear picked up by Chinese brands, said phone industry analyst Ben Wood of CCS Insight.

Sunrise Brands' bid underscores the value it sees in The Limited's online presence and intellectual property, even as the specialty retailer was forced to close its roughly 250 bricks-and-mortar stores earlier this year. It filed for bankruptcy last month, with Sycamore Partners as a stalking-horse bidder.  The sources asked not to be identified because details of the bankruptcy auction are confidential. Sycamore declined to comment, while The Limited and Sunrise Brands did not respond to requests for comment. Mall-based retailers such as The Limited have experienced fierce competitive pressure as shoppers turn to e-commerce giants such as Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O). The bankruptcy auction for The Limited is scheduled for Feb. 21 in Philadelphia. While the value of Sunrise Brands' offer could not be learned, the bankruptcy court required bids topping the one from Sycamore to start at $26.5 million. Wet Seal, a U.S. teen retailer, has been following a similar course to The Limited. It plans to auction off its intellectual property early next month after filing for bankruptcy and shutting down its stores.  Sunrise Brands' holdings include Seven7 Jeans, American Rag and branded apparel for actresses Melissa McCarthy and Eva Longoria. The retail portfolio of Sycamore includes department store chain Belk, footwear and accessories line Nine West and online-only women's apparel company Coldwater Creek, whose intellectual property it acquired through bankruptcy proceedings in 2014.

Arne Sorenson also said 2017 was shaping up to be a solid year, though with some clouds on the horizon. We are concerned about whether national policies around travel roll out in a way that is harmful to our business and economies, he said on the sidelines of the IHIF hotel conference in Berlin, highlighting political changes in the United States and Britain, and upcoming elections in Europe.  Marriott, with brands including Ritz-Carlton, Renaissance and Autograph, completed the acquisition of Starwood in September, adding names such as Sheraton, W and Aloft to create the world's largest hotel chain with more than more than 6,000 properties in 122 countries. Sorenson said Marriott wanted to keep up the same rate of expansion as before the deal, meaning faster growth for the Starwood brands. He said a new Marriott group hotel would open on average every 15 hours in 2017. We think with Aloft we can really ramp it up and grow them at a faster pace than Starwood, Sorenson said. He noted that while it had taken Aloft about a decade to reach 100 hotels globally, Marriott's comparable AC Hotels had reached that figure since 2014 in the United States alone.  Even with 30 brands now, Marriott was not ruling out further additions to its portfolio, Sorenson added.   We don't think we've grown to the point where we're complete, we think we have a lot of growth ahead of us, he said, noting that even in the United States Marriott only had a market share of 14-15 percent.   In a nod to competition from apartment rentals, Sorenson said the Element brand acquired via Starwood was considering a concept for rooms with shared communal space. That could be suitable for groups such as hen parties or college reunions. A hotel's not been a great place for them, he said.       Despite the addition of more upscale brands via Starwood, the fastest rate of growth in Europe would still come from the Moxy budget brand, Europe head Amy McPherson said, with plans to open 18,000 rooms over the next three years from 1,000 now.

Marriott, with brands including Ritz-Carlton, Renaissance and Autograph, completed the acquisition of Starwood in September, adding names such as Sheraton, W and Aloft to create the world's largest hotel chain with more than more than 6,000 properties in 122 countries. Sorenson said Marriott wanted to keep up the same rate of expansion as before the deal, meaning faster growth for the Starwood brands. He said a new Marriott group hotel would open on average every 15 hours in 2017. We think with Aloft we can really ramp it up and grow them at a faster pace than Starwood, Sorenson said. He noted that while it had taken Aloft about a decade to reach 100 hotels globally, Marriott's comparable AC Hotels had reached that figure since 2014 in the United States alone.  Even with 30 brands now, Marriott was not ruling out further additions to its portfolio, Sorenson added.   We don't think we've grown to the point where we're complete, we think we have a lot of growth ahead of us, he said, noting that even in the United States Marriott only had a market share of 14-15 percent.   In a nod to competition from apartment rentals, Sorenson said the Element brand acquired via Starwood was considering a concept for rooms with shared communal space. That could be suitable for groups such as hen parties or college reunions. A hotel's not been a great place for them, he said.       Despite the addition of more upscale brands via Starwood, the fastest rate of growth in Europe would still come from the Moxy budget brand, Europe head Amy McPherson said, with plans to open 18,000 rooms over the next three years from 1,000 now.

CWJ said it was hiring a new head of timepiece division to lead its Swiss watch brands, Corum and Eterna, to replace Davide Traxler, who left last month just two months after taking on responsibility for Eterna on top of his job at Corum. A spokeswoman for Corum said the new CEO was already at work, but the name would only be made public in a few weeks. CWJ will continue to do what is necessary to ensure the development of Eterna, CWJ said in a statement, adding Corum's management team would share its expertise with Eterna while synergies in back-office operations and distribution networks would also help. CWJ injected more than 5 million Swiss francs ($5.2 million) this spring to help Eterna that was struggling to pay its suppliers, it said. CWJ posted an 88 percent decline in net profit and a 15 percent fall in sales in 2016, saying it expected trading to remain difficult. It said Corum almost broke even last year, while Eterna was suffering from a decrease in demand for luxury watches.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/fitch-affirms-imperial-brands-at-bbb-sta-idUSFit6XYpqt","Fitch Affirms Imperial Brands at BBB; Stable Outlook","","June 22, 2017 /  3:50 PM / in a month","","(The following statement was released by the rating agency) LONDON/MILAN, June 22 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Imperial Brands PLC's Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) and senior unsecured ratings of 'BBB', as well as its Short-Term IDR of 'F3'. A full list of rating actions is provided at the end of this commentary. The affirmation of Imperial's ratings reflects Fitch's confidence regarding the continuation of its deleveraging, the resilient and strong cash-flow generation, and a renewed commitment to a prudent financial policy. These aspects offset the weak organic growth in the financial years to September 2016 and 2017 (FY16 and FY17), a modest drain on cash flow from a new phase of marketing and cost rationalisation investments and the adverse effect on net debt the pound's depreciation. The weakening of sterling against the dollar and the euro during 2016 has delayed the reduction in leverage that we expected when in March 2016 we changed our Outlook to Stable from Negative. KEY RATING DRIVERS Temporary Profit Contraction: Imperial's revenues and profit have been reduced in organic terms in 1H17 by considerable price and marketing investments, largely aimed at defending its market share in its key markets. We believe these investments should deliver returns during the balance of FY17 and result in moderate profit growth in FY17, thanks also to currency translation benefits from the company's overseas operations. Thereafter we expect modest profit growth in the low single digits. The company's EBITDA margin (calculated against the company's economic net revenue of GBP8.0 billion) remains among the highest in the industry at 47% in FY16 (FY15: 46%). Operating Efficiency: The company intends to spend GBP750 million over the next four years to reduce complexity, drive operational efficiencies and secure additional global procurement benefits. This should help deliver additional savings of GBP300 million annually by 2020 on top of the previously announced GBP300 million savings that the company is targeting by FYE18 at a cost of GBP600 million. These resources will be deployed to further support the business. Deleveraging Path: We project that Imperial's lease adjusted net debt/funds from operations (FFO) should decline to approximately 3.7x in FY18 having fallen to 4.6x in FY16 from a peak of 5.1x in FY15. Compared to our expectations of March 2016 when we changed our Outlook to Stable, this deleveraging path is delayed by over one year due to adverse currency movements that affected Imperial's FY16 net debt position. The maintenance of a Stable Outlook is aided by FCF generation and from management's track record of prioritising debt repayment. Consistent Free Cash Flow: In FY16 Imperial's free cash flow (FCF) grew to a strong GBP980 million, representing a healthy 12.3% of economic revenues. We expect FCF to fall to approximately GBP800 million pa over FY17-FY18 as we assume a progressive increase in dividend distributions by 10%. Nevertheless, this remains very healthy FCF which supports continued deleveraging. Management Commitment: Net debt increased by GBP1.7 billion in FY16, mostly due to the adverse impact of sterling weakness. However, management's intention to continue to prioritise paying down debt, together with the announced capital discipline and management policy of cash allocation underlines the company's willingness to protect its credit metrics. US Turnaround: Imperial's strategy in the US centres around a relaunch of the Winston brand, which had suffered a long-term decline in volume before its acquisition by Imperial. Encouragingly in FY16, Winston's market share improved by 23bp, thanks to new packaging and advertising together with optimised retailer agreements. Part of Imperial's marketing investments during 1H17 were directed at repositioning Winston to a more affordable pricing point and should result in a further volume recovery. Manageable Regulatory Changes: The first notable implementations of plain packaging in Europe are taking place in 2017 in the UK and France. We believe that part of Imperial's pricing investments of 1H17 have been directed at maintaining an overall competitive profile in the UK market ahead of the introduction of plain packaging and addressing the likely reduction of pricing power that tends to result from restricted branding differentiation. This early reaction to the regulatory change should enable Imperial to defend its market share in the profitable UK market. Overall, Fitch continues to view the impact of regulatory restrictions on the tobacco industry, including the revised European Union Tobacco Product Directive (EUTPD), of smoking bans, cabinet display bans, graphic health warnings on consumption, and plain packaging, as broadly manageable. However, plain packaging could in the longer term lead to erosion of pricing power for the more premium brands and a reduction in the new generation smokers. In Europe, the strength of Imperial's portfolio in the lower priced segment helps it cope with this challenge. DERIVATION SUMMARY In comparison to its peers, Imperial Brands is mainly a European operator, although now with a larger US presence and with a strong presence in the medium- and low-priced segments. Its lower rating than its peers' - British American Tobacco (A-/RWN) and Philip Morris International (A/Negative Outlook) - reflects more limited geographic diversification and higher leverage. At the same time, Imperial's creditors benefit from a more conservative shareholder distribution policy, which gives Imperial the highest free cash-flow margin in the industry. Imperial's 'BBB' is at the same level as Reynolds American Inc, which has seen a spike in leverage from the 2015 merger with Lorillard but which only operates in the more protected environment of the large and oligopolistic US market. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: - Revenue growth by +3% in FY17, aided by favourable FX of +1% onwards; - EBITDA margin gradually growing from 47% towards 50% over the forecasts horizon; - dividends per share increasing by 10% pa; - no further material M&A; - capex of GBP250 million pa; - tax rate of 20% for FY17; - average exchange rates: GBP/EUR 1.18 (FY16: 1.28); GBP/USD 1.25 (FY16: 1.42) RATING SENSITIVITIES Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action - In light of the company's current stretched financial profile, we do not foresee any rating upside in the short term. However, future developments that could lead to positive rating action include: - the trading environment in Imperial's territories is not permanently challenged by widespread introduction of plain packaging legislation or by an accelerated substitution of traditional cigarettes by other products; - FFO net leverage below 3.0x and FFO fixed charge cover ratio above 5.0x; - EBITDA margin above 48% (FY16: 47%); - maintenance of current financial policy. Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action - Another M&A; transaction or a change in shareholder distribution policies preventing FFO net leverage from returning to a sustainable level of around 3.5x (FY16: 4.6x) - FFO fixed charge cover ratio below 4.0x (FY16: 5.4x) - Annual FCF margin below 5% (FY16: 12.3%) on a sustained basis. LIQUIDITY Adequate liquidity: At FYE16, Imperial had GBP0.8 billion of unrestricted cash (as defined by Fitch) and undrawn committed facilities of GBP4.7 billion. The cash decreased in FY16 as a result of a major bond repayment; but liquidity is sufficient to meet short-term debt of GBP1.3 billion due in FY17. The majority of debt is composed of bonds issued by the wholly owned issuing vehicle Imperial Brands Finance PLC and guaranteed by Imperial Brands PLC and by the sub-holding and UK operating subsidiary Imperial Tobacco Ltd.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-autoshow-geneva-mini-britain-idUSKBN16E1F0","Mini boss says UK production not essential to brand","","March 7, 2017 /  12:18 PM / 5 months ago","","GENEVA (Reuters) - Building in Britain is not essential to BMW's (BMWG.DE) Mini brand as most customers do not know where the compact cars are built and its new electric model could be made elsewhere, the brand's boss told Reuters on Tuesday.  Peter Schwarzenbauer said the German carmaker would decide by the end of 2017 whether to build the new electric model at an existing site in Britain or the Netherlands, or whether to pick a new location. The BMW board member said the possibility of post Brexit tariffs was only one point ... when you have to decide where to produce a car and the first question was where the model would be primarily sold.  But asked whether it really mattered to British or foreign buyers that the Mini, sometimes sold with the image of the union flag on the roof, is made in Britain, Schwarzenbauer said: No. The brand being perceived as British, that's important but this does not mean necessarily that you have to produce it (in Britain). Most people don't know where the cars are produced, he said.  Mini makes around 70 percent of its 360,000 cars at its southern English Oxford plant but there are concerns that uncertainty over Britain's future trading relationship with the EU could hurt the UK car industry, reliant on tariff-free trade.  Prime Minister Theresa May has said Britain will leave the EU's single market and could also exit the customs union but she would seek to maintain the best possible access to the EU, the British car sector's biggest export market.  Schwarzenbauer also noted elections in the Netherlands, where nationalist leader Geert Wilders is neck-and-neck with the Conservative prime minister ahead of polls next week, but said politics was only one factor in the decision-making process. BMW is considering how many electric models might be sold in Europe or the United States, he said, and the firm constantly reassesses its global sites especially when it commits to new models to take into account a whole range of factors.

Shares were up 2.9 percent in early trading after analysts brushed off the company's softer-than-expected 2017 forecast as  conservative. Net income attributable to Dunkin' Brands was $56.1 million, or 61 cents per share, for the fourth quarter. The company reported a loss of $8.9 million, or 10 cents per share, a year earlier. Dunkin' had a 64-cent quarterly profit, excluding items, which topped analysts' average estimate of 61 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Total sales rose almost 6 percent to $215.7 million. Sales at established U.S. Dunkin' Donuts outlets, which  contribute about three-fourths of company revenue, rose 1.9 percent in the fourth quarter, just missing analysts' average estimate of 2.1 percent, according to Consensus Metrix. An increase in spending on things like Cold Brew coffee, doughnuts and the sweet black pepper bacon breakfast sandwich offset a decline in traffic during the quarter. Dunkin' forecast adjusted earnings per share of $2.34 to $2.37 for 2017, below analysts' average estimate of $2.41. The initial EPS guidance for 2017 is a bit disappointing, though we see upside potential to this initial guidance, Maxim Group analyst Stephen Anderson wrote in a client note. Among other things, Anderson said the 2017 guidance is based on 385 new units, lower than 2016, and that the company's new bottled coffee deal with Coca-Cola Co has the potential to boost earnings. Dunkin' also raised its quarterly cash dividend by 7.5 percent  to 32 cents per share, representing a 2.5 percent dividend yield. Reporting by Lisa Baertlein in Los Angeles"

We see that we are not going to decrease marketing. It will always stay between 10 percent and 12 percent of sales, Bjorn Gulden told journalists after the company published full second-quarter results. Puma's operating expenses rose 11 percent in the second quarter as it spent on marketing and retail, but demand for new high-margin shoe models still helped more than triple its operating profit (EBIT) to 43.4 million euros ($50.5 million).

Bature Brewery has faced a slog to launch the first commercial products from its microbrewery tucked behind a burger joint in the capital, seeking to gain a foothold - albeit a small one - in Africa's second biggest beer market. It has had to navigate Nigeria's Byzantine bureaucracy to secure a license, install cables and a generator to deal with frequent blackouts and raise financing to import equipment and ingredients while the naira currency plunged. But the three expatriate founders of Bature, who want to turn a passion for home brewing into commercial success, have been spurred on by an enthusiastic reception for their beers and encouraged by growth prospects in a nation of some 190 million. Nigerians drink 16 million hectoliters of beer a year, which is half as much as South Africans - the continent's biggest beer market - even though Nigeria has a population that is more than three times the size. Having Nigerians taste our beer and say, 'Wow, this is really great,' we decided to go for it and try and build this first (craft) brewery here in Nigeria, co-founder Kevin Conroy told Reuters at their Abuja operation. Conroy, a Scot, came to Nigeria like his two co-founding colleagues to work in international development. Tired of mass-produced beers that they found bland, the three brewed their own and soon found others liked it too. Conroy still works in development alongside helping build the brewer. His two colleagues - James Turley and Andrew Seward - have both quit their development jobs. Bature - pronounced ba-tor-ray and meaning white person or European in the Hausa language mainly spoken in northern Nigeria - started production from its Abuja brewery in June. It now aims to raise 15,000 pounds ($19,500) via the Indiegogo crowdfunding site for a new equipment and a tap room where the public can try Bature brews on site. The microbrewery's ambitions remain modest in the giant market. Bature plans to produce 40,000 to 50,000 liters in the next 12 months. But its premium price reflects confidence in a class of more affluent drinkers in Nigeria, even when the oil-producing nation's economy has been hammered by weak crude prices.

In a nation with annual gross national income per capita of $2,450, even the big brands - let alone Bature's pricier offerings - are out of reach of many in a country almost evenly split between Christians and Muslims.

The consumer is under enormous duress with that 18 percent, 19 percent inflation on the back of a naira devaluation, and we are seeing disposable income dry up, John O'Keeffe, the Africa president for drinks maker Diageo, told a March conference call. Nigeria is a major global market for Diageo's Guinness brand, the dark, extra stout whose local version comes with a hefty alcohol content of 7.5 percent. But O'Keeffe said cheaper value beers had risen to almost half the market from 26 percent in the past 2-1/2 years. Last year, Diageo scrapped plans to lift its stake in Guinness Nigeria due to tough economic conditions.  Bature is unperturbed. In its effort to appeal to local palates and cut import costs, the microbrewer has sought to use more local ingredients.

Bature, which also brews lighter ales, uses Nigerian sorghum for malting mixed with imported hops. Nigeria may offer a good, long-term punt for brewers. Nigeria's per capita beer consumption is about 10 liters a year, compared to a global average of 35-40 liters, said Morgan Stanley analyst Olivier Nicolai.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-women-conference-slavery-tattoos-idUSKBN13N009","Former sex slave helps women reclaim their branded bodies with new tattoos","","November 28, 2016 /  12:16 AM / 8 months ago","","LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - After escaping years of sexual slavery, Jennifer Kempton could not look in the mirror without being taken back to her dark, traumatic past. On her neck was tattooed the name of one of her traffickers along with his gang's crown insignia. Above her groin were the words Property of Salem - the name of the former boyfriend who forced her into prostitution nine years ago. Slaves have been branded for centuries and it's just evolved into being tattooed. It's happening all over the world, said Kempton who suffered horrific brutality during six years working on the streets of Columbus, Ohio. Today the tattoo on her neck has been transformed into a large flower blooming out of the darkness. Three other brandings have been masked with decorative, symbolic motifs. Two years ago Kempton, now 34, set up a charity called Survivor's Ink to help others who have escaped enslavement get their brandings covered up or removed. It was very empowering for me so I wanted to pay forward that liberation to other girls in my area who had been branded like cattle, just like I was, Kempton told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Most requests for help come from women in the United States, but the grassroots project increasingly receives applications from other countries including Canada, Britain, Australia and Croatia. Some of the stories are very disturbing. Kempton said they recently helped a woman in Britain whose mother had carved the word 'whore' into her leg when she was a child and sold her. Every time the word faded it was recarved. Globally some 4.5 million people are trapped in sexual exploitation, according to the International Labor Organization, generating an estimated $99 billion in illegal profits a year. Sold and Resold  Kempton says there is a major misconception that women trafficked into prostitution are brought in from poor countries. In the United States an estimated 80 percent of women trafficked into prostitution are U.S.-born citizens, Kempton said, ahead of the Trust Women conference in London this week which will focus on human trafficking and slavery.  Kempton wants tougher penalties for traffickers and improved training for police to better identify and help victims. She is also an advocate of an approach adopted by Canada and some European countries which criminalizes men who buy sex rather than the women trafficked into prostitution.  Describing her downward spiral, Kempton refers to a dysfunctional background in which she was raped at the age of 12. In her 20s, after a series of abusive relationships, she thought she had finally met her Prince Charming. But he soon got her addicted to heroin, put her on the streets and plied her with crack cocaine so she could work longer hours. At one point she was kidnapped by armed men who locked her in a hotel room to have sex with a stream of men. After escaping to her boyfriend she discovered she was pregnant with his child, but when her body grew and her earnings shrank he sold her to a couple of drug dealers. After the birth she was sold again to the most violent gang in Columbus.      The turning point came in April 2013 after a brutal rape.     During a prolonged attack she was beaten beyond recognition and raped with a knife. As she fled the house bleeding she begged two men for help but they laughed and locked their door. The sound of the door locking just echoed in my mind. I was locked out of society, I was not seen as worthy of help, said Kempton. Afterwards she tried to hang herself, but the rope snapped.  In her despair, she heard a voice telling her she had a purpose in life and it wasn't to die in the basement of a crackhouse. Survivor's Ink has so far provided grants to help around 100 women cover up their slavery brandings.      It's always amazing to see the look on their face when they no longer have to look at this dehumanizing mark of ownership and violence, Kempton said. Sometimes I'll get a call a few days later with someone just bawling their eyes out saying 'Oh my gosh, I can actually look at my body. It's my own again.'.

The WEY brand will be launched on Nov. 16 ahead of the Guangzhou motor show, China's second most prominent auto exhibition of the year, the company said in an exchange filing on Thursday. The brand name appears to be a nod to Great Wall Chairman Wei Jianjun. Great Wall was an early mover in China's craze for SUVs with its H6 model topping sales charts going back to 2014. But thus far the brand has not been able to command the higher prices of foreign marques. To gain the next level of pricing, they may need to create another brand, said James Chao, Asia-Pacific chief of IHS Markit Automotive. Product is very important but equally important is a brand that people start to recognise as being equal to global brands in value and prestige. A Great Wall spokesman declined to elaborate on the brand in advance of the launch, referring to the exchange statement. The new brand follows on Chinese rival Geely  launching the Lynk & Co brand last month that seeks to compete globally with mainstream foreign brands like General Motors  and Volkswagen.

Henkel on Thursday said its top brands, including Persil laundry detergent and Schwarzkopf beauty line products, should make up 75 percent of total group sales by 2020, while online sales should double to more than four billion euros ($4.28 billion) by that date. The German company also said it targeted a growth of organic sales of between two and four percent on average, adding that an over-proportionate amount of these sales would be generated in emerging markets. Henkel last week posted consensus-beating third-quarter results, boosted by growing demand in emerging markets, particularly strong sales in India, South Korea, China and Latin America.

The move could spare BCBG the fate of other bankrupt retailers who have completely gone out of business and sold their brands, such as The Limited Stores, American Apparel and Wet Seal. Marquee has partnered with Global Brands Group Holding Limited (0787.HK), a spin-off of global exporter Li & Fung Ltd (0494.HK), which already has a licensing agreement for some of BCBG's brands, the sources said. The consortium plans to make a stalking-horse bid for BCBG that would set the floor for any other proposals in a bankruptcy auction for the retailer to be held as soon as this month, the sources added. Liquidators Hilco Global and Gordon Brothers are also members of the consortium, the sources said. A successful starting bid for BCBG must total at least $150 million, one of the sources said, and a U.S. bankruptcy court judge must approve the final sale. The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. BCBG declined to comment. Marquee, Global Brands, Gordon Brothers and Hilco did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  Other potential bidders include buyout firm Sycamore Partners and brand licensor Bluestar Alliance LLC, the sources said. Sycamore Partners declined to comment. Bluestar did not immediately return a request for comment. BCBG, which is owned by investment firm Guggenheim Partners, filed for bankruptcy in March after it fell behind in rent payments and struggled with a debt load of about $485 million.  BCBG had scheduled a bankruptcy auction for last month, but delayed it to give bidders more time to finalize their offers for the high-end retailer, a favorite of celebrities including Selena Gomez and Drew Barrymore.      Marquee owns British menswear brand Ben Sherman, surf line Body Glove and Bruno Magli, an Italian fashion line. Global Brands in April sold a majority stake of The Frye Company brand, known for its cowboy boots, to brand licensor Authentic Brands Group for $100 million.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/volkswagen-results-idUSL8N1HQ492","VW brand recovery helps to power Volkswagen profit rise","","April 18, 2017 /  2:07 PM / 3 months ago","","FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) reported a 28 percent jump in first-quarter operating profit, helped by a return to earnings growth at its core VW brand which has struggled to recover from the German carmaker's diesel emissions scandal. Group operating profit came to 4.4 billion euros ($4.7 billion) in the three months to the end of March, compared with 3.4 billion in the year-earlier period, Volkswagen said on Tuesday as it published key financial figures ahead of schedule. Although the group has bounced back from the scandal and overtook Japan's Toyota (7203.T) last year to become the world's biggest selling carmaker, analysts view a turnaround at the VW brand as key to its prospects. Shares in Volkswagen jumped on the news, trading 3.7 percent higher at 136.00 euros at 1436 GMT, making them the third-biggest gainers on the STOXX Europe 600 index . Volkswagen said on Tuesday that first-quarter operating earnings at the VW brand came to around 900 million euros, up from 73 million in the year-earlier period. Causal factors for the Volkswagen Brand result include the success of new model introductions, particularly the Tiguan, and a strong financial performance in the West European market, Volkswagen said in a statement. Optimized fixed costs also positively affected the result, it added. DZ Bank analyst Michael Punzet, who has a hold recommendation on VW's stock, said he had expected the brand's operating profit to come to around 500 million euros. Volkswagen said its other brands, which include Audi (NSUG.DE) and Skoda, also contributed to the good performance but did not provide details. E It said it still expected to report a full-year group return on sales of between 6 and 7 percent this year. If Q2 continues to do well, we expect VW to increase its full-year guidance in summer, said Evercore ISI analyst Arndt Ellinghorst, who had expected first-quarter group operating profit of around 3.8 billion euros. Volkswagen is due to publish detailed first-quarter financial results on May 3. Reporting by Maria Sheahan; Editing by Harro ten Wolde and Victoria Bryan"

Marla Malcolm Beck went for ultra-luxe.  But the early lessons on dollars and cents were valuable, and with the aid of an MBA from Harvard Business School, Beck turned luxury into big business when she founded the high-end beauty retailer Bluemercury in 1998 with her husband Barry.  They now have over 100 stores across the country, as well as a skincare line, M-61.  In 2015, Macy's purchased the Washington, D.C.-based Bluemercury for $210 million and Beck, 46, remains chief executive.  Beck talked to Reuters about her unusual business path. Q: What early lessons about money stuck with you? A: I remember when Izod shirts were hot, my mom wouldn't buy me one because she thought it was ridiculous to spend $20 more just so you could have the Izod symbol.  That always stuck with me in two ways: (her message that) if you want a shirt like that, you have to earn your money and buy it yourself. Also, that with brands, sometimes to make a brand where there's this one little extra twist that you have, and some people believe it and some people don't. Q: What did starting a business in the beauty industry teach you about finances? A: Don’t run out of money. Within the first six months of launching in the late 1990s, we had $150,000 in the bank and we had an Internet site, but we were a little too early, so revenue for e-commerce wasn't building fast enough. Because we couldn't raise more, we had to learn how to build a profitable business. Q: What did you do with your first paycheck? A: I remember buying a really fashionable black jacket and then being sort of disappointed afterward. After that, I just let my bank account fill up and I used some of it for spending money in college. It was very gratifying to build up your own bank account. It’s a powerful feeling. Q: What has running a company taught you about finances? A: When you set up a company, you have your core mission, your strategy and you have your metrics. It's so critical. Every two hours, I get a report on what the store sales and digital sales are.  Q: What drives you to give? A: We have areas of interest that we give in - schools, entrepreneurship, religion - and then direct giving of those in need. This would be handout money to families that have hit a hard time. There are certain funds that do that - one of our religious groups, one of the schools our kids go to, for example - so we know who's handing out the money. It might be someone’s out of work and needs to pay their utility bill, that sort of giving.  It’s very satisfying to know you can help a family or individual that’s fallen on a hard time. We talk about it with our kids. We always talk about how they have to save and give, how you should always be able to reduce the amount you're spending on, teaching them not to buy as much and how to make little gifts. That's important.  Q: What money lessons do you pass down to your three kids? A: We always encourage them to be debt free. I remember the day I paid off my student loans - it was six or seven years after my we started Bluemercury. That debt had hung over me until I was able to pay it off myself.  I also try to teach the kids entrepreneurial lessons. One of our daughters just started an entrepreneur group. Our other daughter is starting a nonprofit to raise money for orphan diseases (which affect a small number of people) and she’s asking questions like, ‘How do I set up a 501(c)(3)?’  The nonprofit will help with diseases that affect a small number of children but need more research.

The rules, largely unchanged from a draft issued in January 2016, forbid manufacturers from signing deals that prevent the dealers from selling other brands of cars or parts, among a wide variety of protections for dealers and consumers. The rules break up the singular nature of brand licensing in car sales, allowing for licensed and unlicensed sale methods in parallel, to break up brand monopolies and ensure fair market competition, Hu Jianping, a deputy supervisor in the Ministry of Commerce's Department of Market System Development, said at a media briefing. The policy will also prevent manufacturers from imposing stock and sales targets upon dealers without agreement, tactics that many dealers have complained force them to bear the cost of high inventories as the market slows. BMW AG paid $820 million to Chinese dealers in early 2015 over complaints of burdensome inventories, with dealers for Hyundai Motor Co, Kia Motors Corp and Audi AG following suit in demanding compensation for similar issues.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-volkswagen-golf-idUSKBN135288","VW bets on Golf update to bolster brand revival","","November 10, 2016 /  5:33 PM / 9 months ago","","WOLFSBURG, Germany (Reuters) - Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) launched a technology-packed updated version of its top-selling Golf hatchback on Thursday to underpin efforts to revive its core brand. The group's VW brand has suffered from high labor and development costs for years, with the need to improve profitability amplified by the billions of euros in costs the company faces in the aftermath of the emissions-cheating  scandal that broke 14 months ago. While brand and labor bosses are struggling to agree on cost cuts and strategy for the group's biggest division by sales, management aims to refresh the VW brand's model line-up to sustain demand. Changes brought to the seventh-generation Golf, such as a fully digital dashboard and gesture control technology for the information and entertainment system, are designed to improve the competitiveness of the model until the arrival of a fully redesigned Golf in 2019. The Golf represents the essence of the brand better than any other model, Herbert Diess, VW's brand chief executive, told Reuters. That's why we continuously invest in the technology and improvements of this core product.     Worldwide sales have topped 33 million since the Golf first entered production in 1974. As many as 2,000 are still being built each day at Wolfsburg, helping to safeguard the jobs of the bulk of the plant's production workforce. Yet the updated Golf, due to hit European dealerships in February, faces a tough battle for buyers. Research company IHS Automotive expects Golf sales to plunge 14 percent to 753,110 vehicles in 2019 from an estimated 873,033 this year. Sales of Toyota's (7203.T) Corolla model are forecast by IHS to drop 3.3 percent to 1.15 million vehicles while the Ford (F.N) is expected to chalk up a hefty 38 percent increase to 1.01 million vehicles. Our brand is facing some pretty big challenges, Diess said at the updated Golf's launch in Wolfsburg. A new Golf always stands for a new beginning, a new momentum. The location of Thursday's launch reflected a new-found sense of modesty at post-dieselgate VW. The carmaker picked the plain office tower on its factory grounds to present the new model, breaking with a tradition of choosing exclusive venues for the unveiling of key models.  It's undeniable that cost discipline has become the name of the game at VW, one senior manager told Reuters at the event. Editing by David Goodman"

The move could spare BCBG the fate of other bankrupt retailers who have completely gone out of business and sold their brands, such as The Limited Stores, American Apparel and Wet Seal. Marquee has partnered with Global Brands Group Holding Limited (0787.HK), a spin-off of global exporter Li & Fung Ltd (0494.HK), which already has a licensing agreement for some of BCBG's brands, the sources said. The consortium plans to make a stalking-horse bid for BCBG that would set the floor for any other proposals in a bankruptcy auction for the retailer to be held as soon as this month, the sources added. Liquidators Hilco Global and Gordon Brothers are also members of the consortium, the sources said. A successful starting bid for BCBG must total at least $150 million, one of the sources said, and a U.S. bankruptcy court judge must approve the final sale. The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. BCBG declined to comment. Marquee, Global Brands, Gordon Brothers and Hilco did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  Other potential bidders include buyout firm Sycamore Partners and brand licensor Bluestar Alliance LLC, the sources said. Sycamore Partners declined to comment. Bluestar did not immediately return a request for comment. BCBG, which is owned by investment firm Guggenheim Partners, filed for bankruptcy in March after it fell behind in rent payments and struggled with a debt load of about $485 million.  BCBG had scheduled a bankruptcy auction for last month, but delayed it to give bidders more time to finalize their offers for the high-end retailer, a favorite of celebrities including Selena Gomez and Drew Barrymore.      Marquee owns British menswear brand Ben Sherman, surf line Body Glove and Bruno Magli, an Italian fashion line.

Sunrise Brands' bid underscores the value it sees in The Limited's online presence and intellectual property, even as the specialty retailer was forced to close its roughly 250 bricks-and-mortar stores earlier this year. It filed for bankruptcy last month, with Sycamore Partners as a stalking-horse bidder.  The sources asked not to be identified because details of the bankruptcy auction are confidential. Sycamore declined to comment, while The Limited and Sunrise Brands did not respond to requests for comment. Mall-based retailers such as The Limited have experienced fierce competitive pressure as shoppers turn to e-commerce giants such as Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O). The bankruptcy auction for The Limited is scheduled for Feb. 21 in Philadelphia. While the value of Sunrise Brands' offer could not be learned, the bankruptcy court required bids topping the one from Sycamore to start at $26.5 million. Wet Seal, a U.S. teen retailer, has been following a similar course to The Limited. It plans to auction off its intellectual property early next month after filing for bankruptcy and shutting down its stores.  Sunrise Brands' holdings include Seven7 Jeans, American Rag and branded apparel for actresses Melissa McCarthy and Eva Longoria. The retail portfolio of Sycamore includes department store chain Belk, footwear and accessories line Nine West and online-only women's apparel company Coldwater Creek, whose intellectual property it acquired through bankruptcy proceedings in 2014.

The group's VW brand has suffered from high labor and development costs for years, with the need to improve profitability amplified by the billions of euros in costs the company faces in the aftermath of the emissions-cheating  scandal that broke 14 months ago. While brand and labor bosses are struggling to agree on cost cuts and strategy for the group's biggest division by sales, management aims to refresh the VW brand's model line-up to sustain demand. Changes brought to the seventh-generation Golf, such as a fully digital dashboard and gesture control technology for the information and entertainment system, are designed to improve the competitiveness of the model until the arrival of a fully redesigned Golf in 2019. The Golf represents the essence of the brand better than any other model, Herbert Diess, VW's brand chief executive, told Reuters. That's why we continuously invest in the technology and improvements of this core product.     Worldwide sales have topped 33 million since the Golf first entered production in 1974. As many as 2,000 are still being built each day at Wolfsburg, helping to safeguard the jobs of the bulk of the plant's production workforce. Yet the updated Golf, due to hit European dealerships in February, faces a tough battle for buyers. Research company IHS Automotive expects Golf sales to plunge 14 percent to 753,110 vehicles in 2019 from an estimated 873,033 this year. Sales of Toyota's (7203.T) Corolla model are forecast by IHS to drop 3.3 percent to 1.15 million vehicles while the Ford (F.N) is expected to chalk up a hefty 38 percent increase to 1.01 million vehicles. Our brand is facing some pretty big challenges, Diess said at the updated Golf's launch in Wolfsburg. A new Golf always stands for a new beginning, a new momentum. The location of Thursday's launch reflected a new-found sense of modesty at post-dieselgate VW. The carmaker picked the plain office tower on its factory grounds to present the new model, breaking with a tradition of choosing exclusive venues for the unveiling of key models.  It's undeniable that cost discipline has become the name of the game at VW, one senior manager told Reuters at the event. Editing by David Goodman"

Europe's largest hotel group also said on Wednesday it would buy full control of Squarebreak, a French home rental company in which it has a 49 percent stake, for an undisclosed amount. AccorHotels said it would group the Travel Keys and Squarebreak units under the umbrella of the 'onefinestay' brand before the end of the year. It also named Javier Cedillo-Espin as the chief executive of the brand. The move will allow guests of 'onefinestay' to have access to over 10,000 rental spaces as well as hospitality and concierge services around the world, the company said. AccorHotels chief executive Sebastien Bazin has long warned that revenue from traditional hoteliers is under threat from companies such as Airbnb, which offer travelers accommodation options other than hotels, and from online booking websites like Expedia (EXPE.O). His response to the threat of the so-called 'sharing economy' - namely ways to share or rent rather than own outright - has been a flurry of recent acquisitions in the sector. The group's ambition is to generate 30 percent of its revenue in the medium term from new businesses, such as concierge services or home rentals. AccorHotels announced the acquisition of Travel Keys and Squarebreak earlier this year, saying the deal would boost its presence in the luxury, private rentals market. It bought British loss-making company onefinestay in April 2016. At the time, onefinestay had a portfolio of 2,600 properties in London, New York, Paris, Los Angeles and Rome.

Marla Malcolm Beck went for ultra-luxe.  But the early lessons on dollars and cents were valuable, and with the aid of an MBA from Harvard Business School, Beck turned luxury into big business when she founded the high-end beauty retailer Bluemercury in 1998 with her husband Barry.  They now have over 100 stores across the country, as well as a skincare line, M-61.  In 2015, Macy's purchased the Washington, D.C.-based Bluemercury for $210 million and Beck, 46, remains chief executive.  Beck talked to Reuters about her unusual business path. Q: What early lessons about money stuck with you? A: I remember when Izod shirts were hot, my mom wouldn't buy me one because she thought it was ridiculous to spend $20 more just so you could have the Izod symbol.  That always stuck with me in two ways: (her message that) if you want a shirt like that, you have to earn your money and buy it yourself. Also, that with brands, sometimes to make a brand where there's this one little extra twist that you have, and some people believe it and some people don't. Q: What did starting a business in the beauty industry teach you about finances? A: Don’t run out of money. Within the first six months of launching in the late 1990s, we had $150,000 in the bank and we had an Internet site, but we were a little too early, so revenue for e-commerce wasn't building fast enough. Because we couldn't raise more, we had to learn how to build a profitable business. Q: What did you do with your first paycheck? A: I remember buying a really fashionable black jacket and then being sort of disappointed afterward. After that, I just let my bank account fill up and I used some of it for spending money in college. It was very gratifying to build up your own bank account. It’s a powerful feeling. Q: What has running a company taught you about finances? A: When you set up a company, you have your core mission, your strategy and you have your metrics. It's so critical. Every two hours, I get a report on what the store sales and digital sales are.  Q: What drives you to give? A: We have areas of interest that we give in - schools, entrepreneurship, religion - and then direct giving of those in need. This would be handout money to families that have hit a hard time. There are certain funds that do that - one of our religious groups, one of the schools our kids go to, for example - so we know who's handing out the money. It might be someone’s out of work and needs to pay their utility bill, that sort of giving.  It’s very satisfying to know you can help a family or individual that’s fallen on a hard time. We talk about it with our kids. We always talk about how they have to save and give, how you should always be able to reduce the amount you're spending on, teaching them not to buy as much and how to make little gifts. That's important.  Q: What money lessons do you pass down to your three kids? A: We always encourage them to be debt free. I remember the day I paid off my student loans - it was six or seven years after my we started Bluemercury. That debt had hung over me until I was able to pay it off myself.  I also try to teach the kids entrepreneurial lessons. One of our daughters just started an entrepreneur group. Our other daughter is starting a nonprofit to raise money for orphan diseases (which affect a small number of people) and she’s asking questions like, ‘How do I set up a 501(c)(3)?’  The nonprofit will help with diseases that affect a small number of children but need more research.

The rules, largely unchanged from a draft issued in January 2016, forbid manufacturers from signing deals that prevent the dealers from selling other brands of cars or parts, among a wide variety of protections for dealers and consumers. The rules break up the singular nature of brand licensing in car sales, allowing for licensed and unlicensed sale methods in parallel, to break up brand monopolies and ensure fair market competition, Hu Jianping, a deputy supervisor in the Ministry of Commerce's Department of Market System Development, said at a media briefing. The policy will also prevent manufacturers from imposing stock and sales targets upon dealers without agreement, tactics that many dealers have complained force them to bear the cost of high inventories as the market slows. BMW AG paid $820 million to Chinese dealers in early 2015 over complaints of burdensome inventories, with dealers for Hyundai Motor Co, Kia Motors Corp and Audi AG following suit in demanding compensation for similar issues.

The Milanese group said its haute couture line Giorgio Armani Privé and its homeware brand Armani/Casa, would continue to exist as part of its signature Giorgio Armani label. The second core brand, Emporio Armani, will absorb the Armani Collezioni and Armani Jeans lines. A third label, the younger and more informal A|X Armani Exchange, will now include part of the product area previously under Armani Jeans, it said. The reorganization comes as Armani confirmed on Tuesday that sales fell 5 percent last year, to 2.5 billion euros ($2.9 bln).  Founded by 83-year-old designer Giorgio Armani, it is Italy's second-biggest fashion group behind Prada (1913.HK) which has also been battling with fast shrinking revenues.  Big brands such as Prada and Armani have had trouble adjusting to a growing digital world and consumers' increasing preference for niche labels and more accessibly priced luxury brands.  Following the reorganization of the group's brand portfolio, the number of retail outlets of the three brands will evolve rationally on the basis of the new positioning, the company said in a statement. It blamed the fall in 2016 sales on a difficult year for the luxury sector and the ongoing revamp of its distribution network. The privately owned group said profit margins in 2016 contracted slightly compared to the past three years, but annual net profit rose 12.4 percent to 271 million euros thanks to cost cuts. In January, Giorgio Armani said this year looked complicated like the previous year. The designer said on Tuesday that difficulties in the luxury business were linked to China's slowing growth and security concerns in the aftermath of terror attacks in Europe. In addition to this there has also been a general change in purchasing behaviors and attitudes, he said in the statement. Reporting by Valentina Za; Editing by Susan Fenton"

Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach, speaking in a quarterly conference call with fixed income investors, said the revision is a result of changing interest rates and a greater portion of the business coming from its new Costco (COST.O) co-branded card.  The Costco card, he said, is outperforming expectations and will bring in more revenue and income but with a lower return on assets. Gerspach said the Costco card business, which Citigroup won by outbidding American Express (AXP.N), is exceeding the bank's targets for numbers of accounts, use by customers, revenue and return on assets.    Gerspach's comments provided a hint of the details that analysts expect to hear from Citigroup on Tuesday when the bank holds its first investor day conference since the financial crisis. He also said that Citigroup's retail services division, which mostly issues store-branded cards in the United States, is still expected to earn a 2.50 return on assets despite a rise in the rate of losses on accounts because of new problems collecting from delinquent borrowers.

The comments by the company, part of U.S. group Coty Inc , came in a landmark case which could determine whether luxury goods companies can stop retailers from selling their products via online marketplaces such as Amazon or eBay . Brand owners have for the past decade argued that they should have the right to choose their distributors to protect their image and exclusivity. Online platforms say such curbs are anti-competitive and hurt small businesses. The issue is significant for Europe which accounts for 70 percent of global luxury sales. The company told Europe's top court that its dispute with German retailer Parfumerie Akzente, which sells its goods on sites including Amazon against its wishes, was not about imposing a ban on such trade. The company's agreements preventing retailers from selling on third-party online platforms are aimed at preserving the image and quality of its products, its lawyer Andreas Lubberger told the Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ). In Germany, we have a saying a picture is worth a thousand words, in this case a name is worth a thousand words, he said. Coty brought the original case in a Frankfurt court which subsequently sought guidance from the ECJ. Parfumerie Akzente's lawyer Oliver Spieker questioned the validity of Coty's arguments. If you are talking about a well-known marketplace which sells products to consumers, then you need proper considerations to ban it, he told judges. Amazon and eBay already sell well-known brands, do these brands have more to lose than Coty? L'Oreal for example has a platform on Amazon, he said. The German government, a proponent of online trade, said online platforms were key outlets for small- and medium-sized enterprises. Restrictions must never be abused in order to close off new innovative formats of distribution, its lawyer Thomas Henze said. Luxembourg sees a blanket ban as disproportionate and unjustified, its lawyer Philippe-Emmanuel Partsch said. Amazon's European headquarters is located in the Grand Duchy. France, home to luxury brands such as Louis Vuitton, Chanel and Christian Dior, sprang to Coty's defence. Online curbs safeguard the prestige and image of such products in the eyes of consumers, Julie Bousin, lawyer for the French government, said. Italy, Sweden, the Netherlands and Austria also intervened in the case. An ECJ court adviser will issue a non-binding opinion in the coming months. Judges who follow such recommendations in four out of five cases, will rule shortly after that. The case is C-230 Coty Germany. (Editing by Keith Weir)"

U.S. President Donald Trump never owned the project, but his company had signed a long-term branding and management deal with the building's developer, Talon International Development Inc, which defaulted on its construction loan last year. JCF Capital ULC earlier this year bought units in the 65-story Trump International Hotel & Tower that were not owned by individuals in a court-run sale. In a statement announcing the buyout on Tuesday, JCF Capital did not say whether it had reached a deal yet with another group to take over the management and branding of the building in Toronto's financial district. Sources told Reuters earlier in June that Marriott International Inc's (MAR.O) St. Regis brand was the lead bidder to take over the brand and management rights, with one saying that the Trump Organization had agreed to sever its connections.  The Trump International Hotel and Tower is seen in downtown Toronto, Ontario, Canada June 27, 2017.Chris HelgrenWe are pleased to have reached this agreement with JCF and have enjoyed our relationship with them as the new owners of this property, Eric Danziger, chief executive of Trump Hotels, said in the JCF statement. JCF is a vehicle created by Juniper Capital Partners LLC and Cowie Capital Partners Inc to buy the tower. The Trump International Hotel and Tower is seen in downtown Toronto, Ontario, Canada June 27, 2017.Chris HelgrenTrump's business interest will receive at least $6 million for walking away from its long-term contracts, and the Trump signage could be removed as early as Aug. 1, Bloomberg reported, citing a person it did not identify. The tower, which opened in 2012 after construction delays, has had a troubled history, including lawsuits from unhappy investors and has also been the scene of several protests against President Trump's policies and statements. His business connections around the world have sparked lawsuits and criticism about potential conflicts of interest since he took office in January.  Since its opening, Talon had sold less than half of the tower's residential condos, and the hotel's occupancy rates have been lower than some investors in the rooms had hoped. A court last year ordered the developer to pay damages to one investor for negligent misrepresentation and for another sale to be rescinded.

The comments by the company, part of U.S. group Coty Inc, came in a landmark case which could determine whether luxury goods companies can stop retailers from selling their products via online marketplaces such as Amazon or eBay. Brand owners have for the past decade argued they should have the right to choose their distributors to protect their image and exclusivity. Online platforms say such curbs are anti-competitive and hurt small businesses. The issue is significant for Europe which accounts for 70 percent of global luxury sales.  The company told Europe's top court that its dispute with German retailer Parfumerie Akzente, which sells Coty's goods on sites including Amazon against its wishes, was not about imposing a ban on such trade. The company's agreements preventing retailers from selling on third-party online platforms are aimed at preserving the image and quality of its products, its lawyer Andreas Lubberger told the Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ). Coty brought the original case in a Frankfurt court which subsequently sought guidance from the ECJ. Parfumerie Akzente's lawyer Oliver Spieker questioned the validity of Coty's arguments. The company has 26 shops and owns the second biggest online site for perfumes and cosmetics in Germany. The German government, a proponent of online trade, said online platforms were key outlets for small- and medium-sized enterprises. Restrictions must never be abused in order to close off new innovative formats of distribution, its lawyer Thomas Henze said. eBay said in a statement it was vital to remove restrictions that prevent small and medium-sized businesses from growing and succeeding. Platform bans allow brands to keep prices artificially high and restrict consumer choice, the company said. Luxembourg sees a blanket ban as disproportionate and unjustified, its lawyer Philippe-Emmanuel Partsch said. Amazon's European headquarters is located there. France, home to luxury brands such as Louis Vuitton and Chanel, sprang to Coty's defense. Online curbs safeguard the prestige and image of such products, Julie Bousin, lawyer for the French government, said. Italy, Sweden, the Netherlands and Austria also intervened in the case. An ECJ court adviser will issue a non-binding opinion in coming months. Judges, who follow such recommendations in four out of five cases, will rule shortly after that.

The re-branded service will remain independent of Alipay's existing app, which has 450 million users in China and is the country's most popular mobile payment app. Ant did not disclose financial terms of the helloPay deal.  In recent months Ant Financial has invested in a string of payment firms in Asia, but helloPay represents the firm's first foray into re-branding an acquisition under the Alipay name. It comes as Ant is trying to boost brand recognition in several markets where helloPay operates.  Last week Ant announced a tie-up with Indonesia's Elang Mahkota Teknologi (Emtek) (EMTK.JK) to roll out a mobile payments service.

VW, Europe's biggest carmaker, is aiming to beat rivals for profitability rather than chasing sales volumes through aggressive pricing as it invests billions of euros in electric cars, new mobility services and self-drive technology. First-quarter operating profit at VW's largest division surged to 869 million euros ($948.9 million) from 73 million a year earlier, the carmaker said on Wednesday, even as its sales slipped 1.3 percent to 1.44 million vehicles. Investors have said a turnaround at the VW brand, which has long been saddled with high fixed and R&D; costs, is key to turning the German giant into a more attractive business. Despite the damage to its reputation from the dieselgate scandal, the VW group last year eclipsed Toyota (7203.T) as the world's biggest selling carmaker. It is facing cash outflows in the double-digit billion-euro range this year to pay for costs of the emissions cheating, CFO Frank Witter said. The quarterly profit gain reflects VW's improving operating performance and will help the carmaker cushion the financial blow from the scandal. VW has to date set aside 22.6 billion euros to cover the costs of dieselgate including fines and compensation payouts. Structural changes since the scandal broke in Sept. 2015 include streamlining vehicle development, cutting material costs by reducing complexity in parts, dropping unprofitable models and shifting more power to brands and regions to respond more quickly to market needs. Our efforts to improve efficiency and productivity across all areas of the company are also paying off, Chief Executive Matthias Mueller said. A man uses phone under a Volkswagen logo at the Shanghai Auto Show, in Shanghai, China April 20, 2017.Aly SongWitter backed that up by saying that the quarterly earnings yielded the first tangible results of cost savings. New Models Analysts hope improvements will be sustained as VW renews core models such as the Polo subcompact and Touareg SUV and implements a hard-fought turnaround plan with its unions. I can see all sorts of reasons suggesting that profit dynamics will stay high, said Bankhaus Metzler analyst Juergen Pieper who has a Buy recommendation on the stock. The operating margin at VW's core brand jumped to 4.6 percent in the January-to-March period from 0.3 percent a year ago, still lagging French rivals PSA Peugeot Citroen (PEUP.PA) and Renault (RENA.PA) but nearing its long-term 2025 target of 6 percent. Group operating profit jumped 40 percent to 4.37 billion euros in the three months to the end of March, one of the carmaker's highest-ever quarterly results, even as vehicle sales at the 12-brand group declined. Shares were trading down 1 percent at 143 euros as of 0939 GMT as VW stuck to its outlook despite the robust quarterly showing. The Wolfsburg-based group expects the 2017 return on sales to come in between 6 and 7 percent, after reaching 6.7 percent in 2016, and group revenue to exceed last year's record 217 billion euros by as much as 4 percent.

Sears and its wholly owned subsidiary, Kmart, disclosed their decision on Saturday, saying it was part of a push to focus their online business on the most profitable items. Separately, the Wall Street Journal reported on Saturday that Nordstrom sales of Ivanka Trump's brand had dropped sharply before the retailer discontinued sales this week. Citing internal Nordstrom data, the Journal reported sales of Ivanka Trump-branded clothing and shoes had dropped more than 70 percent in the second, third and fourth week of October compared with the same weeks the previous year. The election was held on Nov. 8.  The developments were the latest in a week of controversy swirling around commercial activity connected to the Trump name. And the moves may be a rare sign of companies taking calculated risks in making business decisions that might invite criticism from President Donald Trump's Twitter account.  Neil Stern, a retail consultant for McMillan Doolittle, said Nordstrom may have felt insulated given its stores tend to be located in cities and affluent suburbs, which tend to tack Democratic. “If there is a political blowback they will survive it given where there stores are,” he said. For Sears, which last month announced plans to close 150 stores, any publicity that draws attention away from the retailer's financial struggles is welcome, Stern added. A Sears department store is seen in New Hyde Park, New York, U.S., January 5, 2017.Shannon StapletonOn Friday, three athletes sponsored by Under Armour Inc took to social media to distance themselves from comments by the company's chief executive, Kevin Plank, in support of President Trump. Earlier in the week, a congressional committee said it was seeking a review into whether senior White House adviser Kellyanne Conway had violated ethics rules by using her position to promote Ivanka Trump's product lines. Prior to Conway's comments, Donald Trump used Twitter to defend his daughter in the wake of Nordstrom's decision to discontinue her product line. White House spokesman Sean Spicer characterized the Nordstrom move as a direct attack on the president's policies.  Customers are seen outside of a Kmart department store in Killeen, Texas, U.S., January 5, 2017.Mohammad KhursheedNeither Sears nor Kmart carried the Trump Home products in their retail stores, a Sears Holdings Corp spokesman said.  As part of the company’s initiative to optimize its online product assortment, we constantly refine that assortment to focus on our most profitable items, spokesman Brian Hanover said in a statement. Amid that streamlining effort, 31 Trump Home items were among the items removed online this week, he said, adding those items can be found through a third-party vendor, without providing additional information about the products. The Trump Home collection includes lines of furniture, bedding and lighting, often from makers that supply Trump hotels, according to the collection's website. Nordstrom, in announcing the discontinuation of Ivanka Trump's line last week, said sales had steadily declined to the point where it didn’t make good business sense to continue selling the products.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hyundai-motor-china-analysis-idUSKBN18O01X","Beijing bling: Hyundai plots China branding reboot after missile row","","May 28, 2017 /  2:07 AM / 2 months ago","","SEOUL/BEIJING (Reuters) - Bruised by anti-Korean sentiment in its biggest market and losing ground to local automakers, Hyundai Motor (005380.KS) will open its first Chinese brand store, and may locally assemble its premium Genesis cars and accelerate the launch of a sport-utility vehicle (SUV), people familiar with the plans said. The measures are aimed at rebooting the South Korean firm's branding in China, where many see Hyundai as a lower-end maker of city taxis. Hyundai and its affiliate Kia Motors (000270.KS) were not long ago ranked third among foreign car brands in China, but recent sales have been hit by a consumer backlash over South Korea's deployment of a U.S. anti-missile defense system which Beijing opposes. Analysts say the diplomatic row masks broader problems for Hyundai/Kia in China: poor brand recognition and a model line-up struggling against local brands' cheaper SUVs.  Hyundai has an in-between brand that doesn't have a clear identity in China, and there's the backdrop of poor China-Korea relations, said James Chao, Shanghai-based Asia-Pacific chief of consulting firm IHS Markit Automotive.  Newly introduced SUVs should help, but they are late to the game. Even before the missile systems row, Hyundai/Kia's China market share tumbled to 8.1 percent last year, the lowest in eight years. This year, it has slid further to 5 percent. To help its identity crisis, Hyundai will in September open a brand experience center in Beijing's 798 Art District, a trendy hub of refurbished factory buildings. Hyundai has three similar centers in Seoul and one in Moscow. We're not going to show a real car. This space is only for focusing on brand building, Xu Jing, the Hyundai executive in charge of the project, told Reuters. The center was planned before the recent political tensions, but its completion is now a key plank in Hyundai's efforts to regain a lost position in China as local automakers and European brands gain ground. Volvo-owner Geely (0175.HK) and Great Wall Motor (601633.SS) are also looking to move upmarket. The branding store ventures into territory traditionally held by premium names such as Daimler's (DAIGn.DE) Mercedes me stores and BMW's (BMWG.DE) brand centers, already in China. Making Genesis Hyundai is also considering using complete knock-down (CKD) kits shipped from South Korea to assemble Genesis cars in China - more than halving import tariffs to 10 percent - two people familiar with the matter said. FILE PHOTO: The 2017 Hyundai Genesis G90 is unveiled at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Michigan January 11, 2016.Rebecca Cook/File PhotoBuilding Genesis cars from kits in China would also prevent technology leaking to its local joint venture partner, BAIC (1958.HK), one of the people added. The kits are a first step, said one Hyundai insider. We are agonizing over how to source local parts and secure enough sales to build the Genesis cars. Hyundai launched its Genesis luxury sedan in 2008, and two years ago spun it off with the larger Equus sedan into a standalone premium brand. Brand chief Manfred Fitzgerald said last year Genesis would launch in China within 2-3 years. Hyundai has not decided which Genesis model it will build in China first, but plans to have six models including a sports sedan and two SUVs under the premium marque by 2020.  While the Genesis brand is reviewing a variety of strategies for the China market, no specific decisions have been made yet, Hyundai said in a statement. Slideshow (2 Images)Hyundai sold 74 Genesis sedans in China last year, down from 1,016 in 2015. It sold a single Equus, down from 10 the previous year, according to export data seen by Reuters. Recovery Time Hyundai may also bring forward by a month, to November, the launch of a small SUV, codenamed NU, to be built at its fourth factory in China, one of the people told Reuters. And Kia is considering launching the Stinger, its first sports sedan, in China, people with direct knowledge of the matter said, though there are no plans to build the model there. Hyundai said it also plans to apply new, cutting-edge technologies such as connectivity and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) to many products from the second half of this year, and soon introduce six new-energy vehicles. Since starting to make cars in China in 2002, Hyundai has aggressively chased sales and market share by selling both older and new versions of models including the Elantra and Sonata sedans and Tucson SUV. Among foreign car brands, Hyundai's China sales lag only those of General Motors (GM.N) and Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE), but it's generally seen as more lower-end than American, German and Japanese rivals. Beijing Hyundai has supplied around a fifth of the capital's taxis. The volume sales model did wonders for sales growth, but dented the Hyundai image in the minds of Chinese buyers, said Michael Dunne, president of consultancy Dunne Automotive. (Having a) weaker brand ... than Japanese automakers, I think it might take more time to restore the brand and sales, said Han Sang-yun, director at S&P;, noting Japanese car makers took a year to bounce back in China after a 2012 consumer backlash over a territorial dispute between Beijing and Tokyo.

It raised particular concern over China's largest shoe retailer, Belle International, which failed to provide any information on its leather supply chain in a survey and made no commitments for improvements. The survey of five footwear and five luxury clothes brands was done by KnowTheChain, a resource for businesses and investors wanting to address forced labor within their supply chains. It said information from the 10 companies generally revealed very little on how - apart from auditing suppliers - they addressed forced labor risks in countries which produce hides, process leather and manufacture leather goods. But it singled out Adidas for praise, saying the German sportswear manufacturer had trained tanneries in Taiwan and China on how to deal with forced labor risks, and was taking steps to address risks at hide suppliers in Brazil and Paraguay. Belle, which sells both its own brands and international brands, could not immediately be reached for comment. Poor working conditions in leather supply chains have been well documented over the years, with evidence from countries like Pakistan, Bangladesh, and India revealing abusive practices including child labor, the study said.    It noted that workers at shoe factories in China - the world's largest footwear producer - had reported being forced to work overtime. Punishments for those who refused included having allowances docked or demotion. The study said forced labor was a significant problem on cattle ranches in Brazil, the world's largest hide-producing country, with young men ending up in debt bondage after being brought to plantations by labor brokers. We believe that all companies in our case study either source or potentially source hides from Brazil and/or produce leather goods in China, thus are exposed to countries where we know forced labor risks are the greatest, the report said.  However, it said footwear brands were generally making headway, partly because of increased scrutiny. Nike, the largest of the five footwear companies, was praised for leading the way in disclosing information on the workforce in its supply chains.     The study also highlighted Puma's grievance mechanisms set up for workers at suppliers in China, which include an SMS service and another via a popular social media network. KnowTheChain called on companies to join forces to eradicate forced labor across leather supply chains, and suggested they collaborate with industries outside the sector such as meat companies and other users of leather like the car industry.

Volkswagen's (VW) labor bosses earlier this month had accused Diess of breaking promises made under a turnaround plan agreed in November and halted cooperation with brand management on issues including overtime work, cost savings and apprenticeships. Europe's largest automaker is hard pressed to cut spending to fund a costly shift to electric cars and new mobility services while grappling with billions of euros in costs for its emissions test cheating scandal. But Diess, who was known as a cost-cutter at BMW (BMWG.DE), has repeatedly clashed with VW works council chief Bernd Osterloh since he joined VW in July 2015 over where to make those savings. The Porsche and Piech families, which control a majority of VW common stock through the family-owned holding company Porsche SE (PSHG_p.DE), stand behind the 58-year-old engineer despite the quarrelling, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Friday. VW declined to comment. Analysts have said VW's ability to overhaul its mass-market brand, the group's largest by sales, will be key to the company's post-Dieselgate recovery and have urged Diess to stand firm on structural changes despite resistance from unions.  The Porsche and Piech families were instrumental in choosing VW's former finance chief Hans Dieter Poetsch to become supervisory board chairman after the emissions scandal broke in September 2015, and likewise in picking former Porsche AG boss Matthias Mueller to become VW group chief executive. VW's supervisory board is expected to meet from 2 pm local time (1300 GMT) on Friday to discuss the carmaker's 2016 financial results and new compensation guidelines for top executives.

U.S. President Donald Trump never owned the project, but his company had signed a long-term branding and management deal with the building's developer, Talon International Development Inc, which defaulted on its construction loan last year. JCF Capital ULC earlier this year bought units in the 65-story Trump International Hotel & Tower that were not owned by individuals in a court-run sale. In a statement announcing the buyout on Tuesday, JCF Capital did not say whether it had reached a deal yet with another group to take over the management and branding of the building in Toronto's financial district. Sources told Reuters earlier in June that Marriott International Inc's (MAR.O) St. Regis brand was the lead bidder to take over the brand and management rights, with one saying that the Trump Organization had agreed to sever its connections.  The Trump International Hotel and Tower is seen in downtown Toronto, Ontario, Canada June 27, 2017.Chris HelgrenWe are pleased to have reached this agreement with JCF and have enjoyed our relationship with them as the new owners of this property, Eric Danziger, chief executive of Trump Hotels, said in the JCF statement.

The tower, which opened in 2012 after construction delays, has had a troubled history, including lawsuits from unhappy investors and has also been the scene of several protests against President Trump's policies and statements. His business connections around the world have sparked lawsuits and criticism about potential conflicts of interest since he took office in January.  Since its opening, Talon had sold less than half of the tower's residential condos, and the hotel's occupancy rates have been lower than some investors in the rooms had hoped.

Volkswagen (VW) is reining in spending across the group, including cutting thousands of jobs at its core passenger-car brand, to help pay for a multibillion-euro shift to embrace electric cars and new mobility services. VW has tasked investment banking boutique Evercore (EVR.N) with evaluating possible options including a sale of the Ducati brand, which its Audi division (NSUG.DE) acquired for about 860 million euros ($935 million) in 2012, the sources said. While Wolfsburg-based VW has started reaching out to potential buyers to sound out their interest, no decision has been taken on whether the brand will be sold, they added. VW referred to Audi for comment. Audi and Evercore declined to comment. One of the sources said Ducati made annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of roughly 100 million euros and could fetch a valuation of up to 1.5 billion euros, or 15 times its core earnings - a multiple similar to that of Italian supercar maker Ferrari (FCHA.MI).  A banker close to the industry said potential buyers were likely to offer VW an earnings multiple of more than 10. The motorbike maker may appeal to peers in China, India's Hero (HROM.NS) or investors such as the consortium that bought British sports car maker Aston Martin in 2007, the sources said. It is an asset for trophy buyers with bigger interest in the brand than in the technology, one of the people said. Private equity firms could also be attracted to a brand whose motorcycles have won the Superbike racing competition 17 times, the sources said.  It remained unclear whether large competitors such as Polaris (PII.N), Harley Davidson, Suzuki (7269.T), Honda (7267.T) or Kawasaki (3045.T) might be interested, they added. If VW does not attract sufficient interest, it may also consider a stock market flotation for Ducati, the people said.  Analysts questioned Audi's purchase of Ducati when it was announced in April 2012, saying the deal had no economic or industrial logic and just reflected former VW Chairman Ferdinand Piech's passion for the Italian company's expertise on design and light engines. But Piech has since bowed out as chairman and agreed earlier this month to sell the bulk of his stake in the Porsche SE (PSHG_p.DE) family holding that controls VW to his younger brother. VW said last June it would review its portfolio of assets and brands, rekindling speculation among analysts that non-core businesses such as Ducati or a diesel-engine business for machinery could be up put for sale. Chief Executive Matthias Mueller, asked by Reuters at the March 14 annual press conference whether this review had reached any conclusions, said VW still had nothing to announce.  Ducati posted sales of 593 million euros in 2016, according to Audi's annual report. Audi's motorcycle unit, of which Ducati is a part, made adjusted earnings before interest and taxes of 51 million euros in that year.

Group operating profit came to 4.4 billion euros ($4.7 billion) in the three months to the end of March, compared with 3.4 billion in the year-earlier period, Volkswagen said on Tuesday as it published key financial figures ahead of schedule. Although the group has bounced back from the scandal and overtook Japan's Toyota (7203.T) last year to become the world's biggest selling carmaker, analysts view a turnaround at the VW brand as key to its prospects. Shares in Volkswagen jumped on the news, trading 3.7 percent higher at 136.00 euros at 1436 GMT, making them the third-biggest gainers on the STOXX Europe 600 index . Volkswagen said on Tuesday that first-quarter operating earnings at the VW brand came to around 900 million euros, up from 73 million in the year-earlier period. Causal factors for the Volkswagen Brand result include the success of new model introductions, particularly the Tiguan, and a strong financial performance in the West European market, Volkswagen said in a statement. Optimized fixed costs also positively affected the result, it added. DZ Bank analyst Michael Punzet, who has a hold recommendation on VW's stock, said he had expected the brand's operating profit to come to around 500 million euros.

While stay-at-home Muscovites can order an array of international pizza brands from Sbarro to Domino's to Papa John's, regional cities such as Rostov-on-Don and Nizhny Novgorod are still chiefly the preserve of small local chains. Multiple challenges have kept global fast food brands wedded to major Russian cities, including patchy transport links, bureaucratic delays, finding an army of chefs who can maintain quality, as well as the sheer cost of shipping often perishable ingredients across a vast country that spans 11 time zones. Western fast food chains have also had to adapt menus to suit Russian palates better, once the allure of new foreign tastes has worn off. One of Domino's best-selling pizzas is the Russian with 13 toppings including potato, beef, pork, bacon, mushrooms, pepperoni and cheese to help ward off the cold. But Domino's Pizza's Russian franchisee, DP Eurasia , believes the time is now right to expand beyond Moscow, where sales at the 76 outlets it had at the end of March are far outstripping growth in its main market Turkey. The company has done its own research and realised that there's almost no quality pizza in the regions, which gives us enormous ground for development, said DP Eurasia's head of Russian development Elena Ivanova. Like-for-like sales in Russia have risen 30.1 percent this year up to May 21, whereas the comparable figure for Turkey was 6.3 percent growth. Aggressive Expansion Domino's was Russia's third-largest pizza chain last year yet its share of the fragmented market stood at less than 2 percent, according to Euromonitor International. Guvenc Donmez, DP Eurasia's Russian head, said he saw room for 1,500 Domino's outlets in the longer term. For now, the company is using part of the 148 million pounds ($192 million) it raised listing shares in London in June to add 40 outlets this year, venturing as far as Krasnodar, 1,200 kilometres (750 miles) south of Moscow. Domino's closest rival is not standing idle. The Russian franchise of U.S. chain Papa John's International Inc, the fourth biggest player in the country in 2016, sees room for 60-80 store openings each year over the next five years. We still see potential in Moscow. I think we could open a further 40-50 stores there, but we are also embarking on an aggressive expansion to small towns, Christopher Wynne, the chief executive of Papa John's franchisee, told Reuters. Another U.S. brand Sbarro was the market leader with a 4 percent market share in 2016, according to Euromonitor, followed by DoDo Pizza, a Russian chain with a presence in former Soviet states as well as China and the United States. Sbarro's Russian franchise had 88 stores last year, including in provincial cities. However, it was hit by a Russian food import ban and a drop in the rouble as Sbarro refused to let it replace imports with local products and the franchising agreement was terminated, Russia's RBC daily has reported. Sbarro did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Wynne said Papa John's Russia had imported 90 percent of products before the 2014 food ban came in but had replaced all its suppliers within six months. DP Eurasia acknowledged the restrictions could adversely affect its business, even though it too had managed to replace the banned imports. It also said there could be challenges in rolling out the franchise in places with less dense populations than Moscow but believes it can stay profitable thanks to greater purchasing power and economies of scale. Russia is a huge market and is still very underpenetrated. You don't have many options to eat, Donmez said in an interview with Reuters TV.

The re-branded service will remain independent of Alipay's existing app, which has 450 million users in China and is the country's most popular mobile payment app. Ant did not disclose financial terms of the helloPay deal.  In recent months Ant Financial has invested in a string of payment firms in Asia, but helloPay represents the firm's first foray into re-branding an acquisition under the Alipay name. It comes as Ant is trying to boost brand recognition in several markets where helloPay operates.  Last week Ant announced a tie-up with Indonesia's Elang Mahkota Teknologi (Emtek) (EMTK.JK) to roll out a mobile payments service. Earlier this year Ant confirmed it will make a strategic investment in Filipino payment firm Mynt. This week, Ant also entered a hefty second bid for U.S. transfer service MoneyGram International Inc (MGI.O), trumping rival U.S. bidder Euronet Worldwide Inc (EEFT.O) in a bitter battle and valuing MoneyGram at $1.2 billion. Together with recent investments in Asia, MoneyGram is a lynchpin asset in Ant's ambition to grow its payments infrastructure beyond China, which would also clear the path for Alibaba to target new markets with its e-commerce empire.  Alibaba holds approximately two-thirds of Lazada, according to figures released on the 2016 deal. It has an option to buy the remaining stakes from Lazada shareholders 12-18 months after the deal closes. helloPay, which was launched in 2014 by Lazada as a payments service for its e-commerce platform, will operate under the Alipay brand from April 19, the Ant statement said.

Europe's largest hotel group also said on Wednesday it would buy full control of Squarebreak, a French home rental company in which it has a 49 percent stake, for an undisclosed amount. AccorHotels said it would group the Travel Keys and Squarebreak units under the umbrella of the 'onefinestay' brand before the end of the year. It also named Javier Cedillo-Espin as the chief executive of the brand. The move will allow guests of 'onefinestay' to have access to over 10,000 rental spaces as well as hospitality and concierge services around the world, the company said. AccorHotels chief executive Sebastien Bazin has long warned that revenue from traditional hoteliers is under threat from companies such as Airbnb, which offer travelers accommodation options other than hotels, and from online booking websites like Expedia (EXPE.O). His response to the threat of the so-called 'sharing economy' - namely ways to share or rent rather than own outright - has been a flurry of recent acquisitions in the sector. The group's ambition is to generate 30 percent of its revenue in the medium term from new businesses, such as concierge services or home rentals. AccorHotels announced the acquisition of Travel Keys and Squarebreak earlier this year, saying the deal would boost its presence in the luxury, private rentals market. It bought British loss-making company onefinestay in April 2016. At the time, onefinestay had a portfolio of 2,600 properties in London, New York, Paris, Los Angeles and Rome.

Seat, bought by Volkswagen (VW) in 1986, is the first of VW's five main passenger-car brands to report March sales figures. Parent VW is expected to publish first-quarter sales on Thursday as is its luxury division Audi.

Slideshow (9 Images)The campaign including television would be rolled out in the United States, China and other markets to coincide with the launch. Nissan is expected to publicly announce the campaign later on Wednesday. The U.S. is our biggest market and China is our biggest growth market, so partnering with Mr. Curry ... is a great way to reach consumers around the world in an authentic way,” said Roland Krueger, head of Infiniti, in a statement. Curry has won two NBA Championships with the Golden State Warriors. He is a two-time NBA Most Valuable Player, four-time NBA All-Star and the NBA leading scorer in 2016.

Our brands embody a Parisian chic, both aspirational and accessible, that seduces Chinese clients, SMCP Chief Executive Daniel Lalonde told Reuters in an interview.      The French fashion group, controlled by China's Shandong Ruyi (002193.SZ), said 2016 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) rose 22 percent to 130 million euros ($140 million). Sales rose by 16.4 percent to 787 million euros. SMCP operates in what analysts classify as the accessible luxury segment of the fashion market, and it aims to become a leader in the more affordable space. Accessible luxury is benefiting from buoyant demand among a fast-growing middle class, particularly in countries such as China, where the group already has 70 stores. The logo of ready-to-wear Maje brand is seen on a fashion shop storefront in Paris, France, March 29, 2017.Charles PlatiauThe Sandro, Maje, and Claudine Pierlot labels sell dresses for between 150-250 euros, and employ supply chain practices borrowed from retailers such as Zara (ITX.MC) and H&M; (HMb.ST).  SMCP's solid 2016 results strike a contrast to rival luxury brand Michael Kors (KORS.N), which last month reported profit below market forecasts, raising concerns over Michael Kors' efforts to reinvigorate its brand. SMCP's growth in its domestic French market also stood out, compared with the overall French fashion market, where sales have declined by 2.6 percent.  International sales, which now account for 54 percent of SMCP's global turnover, rose by 24 percent.  Similar to other major fashion companies, CEO Lalonde is also banking on harnessing the Internet and digital media to spur sales growth.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-volkswagen-emissions-jobs-idUSKBN19E1OI","VW brand is cutting jobs more quickly than planned: HR boss","","June 23, 2017 /  2:41 PM / a month ago","","WOLFSBURG, Germany (Reuters) - Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) is reducing the workforce at its core division more rapidly than planned, its human resources chief said, helping the brand make progress on cost cuts needed to revive the business. The world's largest automaker is overhauling its biggest division by sales to generate funds to invest in electric cars and self-driving technology as it struggles to overcome its emissions-cheating scandal. More than 7,500 workers have accepted offers of early retirement since a hard-fought turnaround plan was signed with unions last November, about 80 percent of the 9,300 pledges VW had budgeted for by 2020, group HR boss Karlheinz Blessing said in an interview with Reuters. To stoke demand for the measure, the carmaker has restricted until July 31 an offer to workers and managers born between 1955 and 1960 to take early retirement, the executive said. Whoever comes later has missed an opportunity, Blessing said. I believe we will achieve our targets on staff reduction sooner than planned. Investors have said a turnaround at the VW brand, long saddled with high development and personnel costs, will be key to turn the crisis-ridden group into a more attractive business. VW plans to raise productivity at its German plants by 7.5 percent this year and next, and a further 5 percent in 2019 and 2020, counting on fixed-cost cuts and fine-tuning of R&D;, procurement and production operations. The carmaker is seeking to raise its brand operating margin to near the upper end of a 2.5-to-3.5 percent range this year, from 1.8 percent in 2016. That's still below profitability benchmarks at European rivals such as Peugeot Citroen (PEUP.PA) and Renault (RENA.PA). It's a long way to lastingly raise profitability, said Blessing. 2018, 2019 and 2020 will be the challenging years.   VW is also moving fast with efforts to weed out temporary jobs. The core brand has slashed the number of temporary positions to around 2,600 now from 6,500 when the turnaround plan was launched, and aims to cut them further to around 1,000 by year-end, he said. The carmaker has a goal to work without any temporary jobs in its home market by the end of 2020.  Management and unions have agreed to cut up to 23,000 jobs and, in return, create 9,000 new positions in the area of battery production and mobility services. Headcount may fall further due to natural turnover and buyouts which VW has not yet offered, Blessing said. We have enough instruments to carry out the reduction in staff in a socially acceptable way. Reporting by Andreas Cremer and Jan Schwartz; Editing by Tom Sims and Adrian Croft"

Adidas has shaken up its business in the United States and shed non-core businesses to regain ground lost to Nike, outpacing its rival's sales growth in key markets this year. It sold its golf business this year, striking a deal in May to sell brands TaylorMade, Adams Golf and Ashworth to private equity firm KPS Capital Partners for $425 million. The divestiture of CCM further reflects the commitment to our 'Creating the New' strategy, with complete focus on building on our strength in footwear and apparel via our adidas and Reebok brands, Chief Executive Kasper Rorsted said in a statement. Rorsted was installed to replace long-serving former boss Herbert Hainer - who bought Reebok in 2005 - after activist shareholders took stakes in Adidas, and after several investors called on the company to sell more non-core businesses. Birch Hill will pay most of the purchase price for CCM in cash and the rest in the form of a secured note, Adidas said on Thursday. The sale will have a high double-digit million euro impact on its profit from discontinued operations in the second quarter but does not change its full-year guidance, said Adidas, which is due to publish quarterly results on Aug. 3.

A combination would be the third-biggest takeover in history and the largest acquisition of a UK-based company, according to Thomson Reuters data. It would bring together some of the world's best known brands, from toothpaste to ice creams, and combine Kraft's  strength in the United States with Unilever's in Europe and Asia. The global packaged food industry is grappling with slowing growth, new competition from upstart brands, deflation in developed markets and more health-conscious consumers. Although Kraft, which is controlled by U.S. billionaire Warren Buffett and private equity firm 3G Capital, said it looked forward to talking terms, Unilever said it saw no reason to discuss a deal without financial or strategic merit. Kraft approached Unilever earlier this week, according to people familiar with the matter, who declined to be identified because the approach was confidential. Kraft believes that investing in innovation would be an important part of the combined company, one of the people said. Kraft has also offered to keep three headquarters for the combined company in the United States, Britain and the Netherlands, the source added. Credit rating agency Moody's characterized the bid for Unilever as credit negative as the combined company would be more highly financially leveraged. There would be offsetting benefits such as cost savings, an expanded geographic footprint and improved product diversification, the agency said. Kraft wants the combined company's credit rating to be investment-grade, according to the sources. Kraft has until March 17 to make a final bid for Unilever under UK takeover rules. Unilever shares rose to a record following news of the offer, which analysts at Jefferies called a seismic shock, and  closed 15 percent higher, short of Kraft's $50 per share offer price, with the news lifting shares across the sector. Unilever said Kraft's proposal included $30.23 per share in cash, payable in U.S. dollars, and 0.222 of a share in a new enlarged entity per Unilever share and represented an 18 percent premium to its share price on Thursday. We believe Kraft will likely need to raise its offer substantially if it hopes to change the outcome, RBC Capital Markets analyst David Palmer said in a research note. Kraft's move could flush out other bidders for Unilever, but of the potential rivals, U.S. consumer giant Procter & Gamble Co  may face anti-trust hurdles, while pharmaceutical and consumer packaged goods company Johnson and Johnson would likely not be interested in household products. Unilever's Challenges Unilever, which has struggled recently amid slowing growth and currency fluctuations, saw its shares tumble 4.5 percent on Jan. 26, its worst day in nearly a year, when the company reported lower-than-expected fourth-quarter sales. The share plunge encouraged Kraft to make an approach, another source familiar with the matter said, asking not to be named because the matter is confidential. Unilever has been hit by a slowdown in emerging markets, which it and other consumer companies have long relied on for growth, as well as in its home market, where consumers have been rattled after Brexit, Britain's decision to leave the European Union last year. Brexit pushed down the value of the pound, raising the cost of producing consumer goods in Britain and straining relations between the country's retailers and suppliers. For Kraft, its move comes as low interest rates and cheap debt have fuelled big cross-border deals, making it the busiest start to the year for M&A; activity on record. Still, investors will look at Kraft-Heinz's own track record of boosting sales when evaluating whether they can help Unilever cope with its own slowed growth. Kraft's sales fell 3.8 percent to $6.86 billion in the fourth quarter ending Dec. 31, and its U.S. sales, which account for more than 70 percent of total sales, fell 3.1 percent to $4.84 billion. Kraft Heinz shares rose more than 10 percent in New York trading, helping lift the Nasdaq to a record high. 3g Ready to Deal Although Kraft is smaller than Unilever, with a market value of $106 billion as of Thursday, it is 50.9-percent owned by Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc and 3G Capital, which also controls Anheuser-Busch InBev. 3G, known for driving profits through aggressive cost cutting, has orchestrated a string of big deals rocking the food and drink industry, including Anheuser-Busch InBev's takeover of SABMiller and the combination of Kraft and Heinz. A deal would offer opportunities to combine marketing, manufacturing and distribution in addition to cutting costs, but some industry analysts said Kraft might not want Unilever's household and personal goods brands and could spin them off. This is cheap money meeting industrial logic, said Steve Clayton, manager of the HL Select UK Shares fund at Hargreaves Lansdown, which owns Unilever shares. Kraft Heinz are attempting a massive push on the fast forward button ... To acquire the sheer scale of brands that Unilever represents through one-off acquisitions could take decades, Clayton added. Britain's largest union, Unite, represents employees at Unilever, according to its website. Unite urged Unilever to continue fending off the takeover attempt to prevent job losses. Unilever employs 168,000 people and generates roughly 17 percent of its revenue in the United States compared with Kraft-Heinz, which generates roughly 78 percent in America.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/fashion-leather-forcedlabour-idUSL8N1JK44D","Shoe brands urged to tackle forced labor at tanneries and ranches","","June 23, 2017 /  5:02 PM / a month ago","","LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Leading shoe and designer clothing labels including Nike and Puma have made progress in tackling forced labor in their leather supply chains but could do more to address the issue at tanneries and ranches providing hides, according to a study. It raised particular concern over China's largest shoe retailer, Belle International, which failed to provide any information on its leather supply chain in a survey and made no commitments for improvements. The survey of five footwear and five luxury clothes brands was done by KnowTheChain, a resource for businesses and investors wanting to address forced labor within their supply chains. It said information from the 10 companies generally revealed very little on how - apart from auditing suppliers - they addressed forced labor risks in countries which produce hides, process leather and manufacture leather goods. But it singled out Adidas for praise, saying the German sportswear manufacturer had trained tanneries in Taiwan and China on how to deal with forced labor risks, and was taking steps to address risks at hide suppliers in Brazil and Paraguay. Belle, which sells both its own brands and international brands, could not immediately be reached for comment. Poor working conditions in leather supply chains have been well documented over the years, with evidence from countries like Pakistan, Bangladesh, and India revealing abusive practices including child labor, the study said.    It noted that workers at shoe factories in China - the world's largest footwear producer - had reported being forced to work overtime. Punishments for those who refused included having allowances docked or demotion. The study said forced labor was a significant problem on cattle ranches in Brazil, the world's largest hide-producing country, with young men ending up in debt bondage after being brought to plantations by labor brokers. We believe that all companies in our case study either source or potentially source hides from Brazil and/or produce leather goods in China, thus are exposed to countries where we know forced labor risks are the greatest, the report said.  However, it said footwear brands were generally making headway, partly because of increased scrutiny. Nike, the largest of the five footwear companies, was praised for leading the way in disclosing information on the workforce in its supply chains.     The study also highlighted Puma's grievance mechanisms set up for workers at suppliers in China, which include an SMS service and another via a popular social media network. KnowTheChain called on companies to join forces to eradicate forced labor across leather supply chains, and suggested they collaborate with industries outside the sector such as meat companies and other users of leather like the car industry.

Chief Executive John Martin said Wolseley, which started life in 1887 manufacturing machine tools and was involved in early motor car production, would keep its main market listing in London where it is a constituent of the FTSE 100 index. The renaming of the parent company, subject to investor approval, alongside news that Wolseley will switch to reporting results in dollars reflects its focus on U.S. growth as Britain and continental Europe remains challenging. We have decided to align the group's name with our most significant brand in our largest market, Martin said. We will continue to use the Wolseley name in the UK and Canada where it has strong local recognition, he added. Wolseley's shares gained over 8 percent to their highest since 2007 after the company said trading profit rose 25 percent to 515 million pounds ($646 million) in the six months to the end of January. Martin said Wolseley would make more of its group profit in the United States over the next five years, as continuing growth in the residential and commercial markets would push the company to hire more people and buy more assets there. I think we'll become more American over the short term, Martin said. Over the second quarter, U.S. like-for-like revenue growth accelerated to 6.7 percent year-on-year, the strongest percentage growth of all of Wolseley's regions. The Nordic region accounts for only 3 percent of trading profit and the company said there were few synergies with the rest of its business.  Martin said the company would negotiate with vendors in the UK to offset an expected 3-4 percent increase in its cost of goods sold later this year.

Speaking on ABC's This Week program, White House aide Stephen Miller said Trump adviser Conway was making a light-hearted, flippant comment when she urged Americans to buy Ivanka Trump's products. Conway's comments prompted criticism from both Republican and Democratic lawmakers, as well as some legal experts who said she may have violated ethics rules that prohibit using a public office to endorse products or advance personal business gains. In comments to the Associated Press last week, Republican Jason Chaffetz, chairman of the House of Representatives Oversight committee, said Conway's statement was clearly over the line, unacceptable. Elijah Cummings, the top Democrat on the same committee, said on Sunday that Miller's characterization of Conway's remarks was incorrect. This was a textbook case of a violation of the law, he said on This Week.  White House advisor Kellyanne Conway listens as U.S. President Donald Trump meets with county sheriffs at the White House in Washington, U.S. February 7, 2017.Kevin LamarqueCummings said he was troubled by the fact that Trump is the authority who will ultimately decide how to punish Conway, if at all, after the Office of Government Ethics issues its recommendation on the matter. Conway made the comments after retailer Nordstrom said it would stop selling Ivanka Trump's clothing line, a move that had prompted a tweet from the president blasting Nordstrom. Nordstrom said it had made the decision to drop the brand because sales had steadily declined, especially in the last half of 2016, to where carrying the line didn't make good business sense. Nordstrom shares initially fell after the president's criticism last Wednesday, but closed up 4 percent on the New York Stock Exchange that day. On Saturday, a spokesman for major U.S. retailers Sears and Kmart said they had removed 31 Trump Home items from their online product offerings in order to focus on more profitable merchandise.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-imperial-brands-jv-china-idUSKBN14V28V","UK's Imperial Brands teams up in joint venture with China Tobacco","","January 11, 2017 /  5:47 PM / 7 months ago","","(Reuters) - Britain's Imperial Brands (IMB.L) has formed a joint venture with state-owned China National Tobacco (CNTC) in a move to gain a foothold in the world's largest cigarette market. The joint venture announced on Wednesday could boost Imperial's long-term earnings potential and competitive position in the growing e-cigarette market and increase the chances of the world's fourth-biggest tobacco company attracting takeover interest as the industry consolidates, according to analysts.  Big tobacco companies are facing shrinking markets due to health concerns and are all investing heavily in developing less harmful alternatives to smoking tobacco. Imperial's shares closed up 1 percent at 3,626.5 pence in London. We think today's news could make a bid more likely, said Jefferies analysts, citing speculation that Imperial could be swept up in a wave of consolidation brought on by British American Tobacco's (BATS.L) $47 billion bid for Reynolds American RAI.N. The joint venture, Global Horizon Ventures Limited (GHVL), will be based in Hong Kong and link Imperial with CNTC subsidiary Yunnan Tobacco, which controls over one-fifth of the Chinese market.  Imperial said the joint venture will expand Imperial's West and Davidoff brands in China, and Yunnan's Jade and Horizon brands internationally.  Further tobacco and next-generation product launches, as well as potential M&A; opportunities, will also be evaluated by GHVL in due course, it said in a statement.   China is by far the world's largest tobacco market, selling about 2.5 trillion cigarettes a year, or about one in every third cigarette smoked.  The market is dominated by state-owned monopoly CNTC, which struck partnerships with Marlboro maker Philip Morris International (PM.N) in 2005 and British American in 2013. A partnership with China Tobacco could give Imperial more capital and scale with which to expand in the growing market for cigarette alternatives. So far it has stuck to e-cigarettes, which heat nicotine-laced liquid into vapor, unlike Philip Morris and BAT, which also have tobacco-heating devices they say may be more appealing to smokers who can't quit. A successful initial partnership could pave the way for an all-out takeover bid down the road, Jefferies analysts said, noting it also makes Imperial more attractive to Japan Tobacco (2914.T), long seen as a likely suitor. Imperial was advised by Vermilion Partners and Allen & Overy on the transaction, whose financial terms were not disclosed. BAT is in talks with U.S. peer Reynolds about buying the 58 percent of the company it does not already own. Reynolds' next-generation technology is seen as a key driver for that move, as smoking declines in Western markets due to growing health consciousness.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/russia-pizzas-idUSL8N1K45PJ","Global pizza brands battle for Russia's far-flung regions","","July 21, 2017 /  3:12 PM / 6 days ago","","MOSCOW (Reuters) - Global pizza brands Domino's and Papa John's are preparing an assault on Russia's provinces, betting they can turn a profit far from Moscow as online card payments become more widespread and consumers get to know foreign brands better. While stay-at-home Muscovites can order an array of international pizza brands from Sbarro to Domino's to Papa John's, regional cities such as Rostov-on-Don and Nizhny Novgorod are still chiefly the preserve of small local chains. Multiple challenges have kept global fast food brands wedded to major Russian cities, including patchy transport links, bureaucratic delays, finding an army of chefs who can maintain quality, as well as the sheer cost of shipping often perishable ingredients across a vast country that spans 11 time zones. Western fast food chains have also had to adapt menus to suit Russian palates better, once the allure of new foreign tastes has worn off. One of Domino's best-selling pizzas is the Russian with 13 toppings including potato, beef, pork, bacon, mushrooms, pepperoni and cheese to help ward off the cold. But Domino's Pizza's Russian franchisee, DP Eurasia, believes the time is now right to expand beyond Moscow, where sales at the 76 outlets it had at the end of March are far outstripping growth in its main market Turkey. The company has done its own research and realized that there's almost no quality pizza in the regions, which gives us enormous ground for development, said DP Eurasia's head of Russian development Elena Ivanova. Like-for-like sales in Russia have risen 30.1 percent this year up to May 21, whereas the comparable figure for Turkey was 6.3 percent growth. Aggressive Expansion Domino's was Russia's third-largest pizza chain last year yet its share of the fragmented market stood at less than 2 percent, according to Euromonitor International. Guvenc Donmez, DP Eurasia's Russian head, said he saw room for 1,500 Domino's outlets in the longer term. A staff member prepares pizzas at a Domino's Pizza restaurant in Moscow, Russia, July 14, 2017.Sergei KarpukhinFor now, the company is using part of the 148 million pounds  ($192 million) it raised listing shares in London in June to add 40 outlets this year, venturing as far as Krasnodar, 1,200 kilometers (750 miles) south of Moscow. Domino's closest rival is not standing idle. The Russian franchise of U.S. chain Papa John's International Inc, the fourth biggest player in the country in 2016, sees room for 60-80 store openings each year over the next five years. We still see potential in Moscow. I think we could open a further 40-50 stores there, but we are also embarking on an aggressive expansion to small towns, Christopher Wynne, the chief executive of Papa John's franchisee, told Reuters. Another U.S. brand Sbarro was the market leader with a 4 percent market share in 2016, according to Euromonitor, followed by DoDo Pizza, a Russian chain with a presence in former Soviet states as well as China and the United States. Slideshow (6 Images)Sbarro's Russian franchise had 88 stores last year, including in provincial cities. However, it was hit by a Russian food import ban and a drop in the rouble as Sbarro refused to let it replace imports with local products and the franchising agreement was terminated, Russia's RBC daily has reported. Sbarro did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Wynne said Papa John's Russia had imported 90 percent of products before the 2014 food ban came in but had replaced all its suppliers within six months. DP Eurasia acknowledged the restrictions could adversely affect its business, even though it too had managed to replace the banned imports. It also said there could be challenges in rolling out the franchise in places with less dense populations than Moscow but believes it can stay profitable thanks to greater purchasing power and economies of scale. Russia is a huge market and is still very underpenetrated. You don't have many options to eat, Donmez said in an interview with Reuters TV.

Our brands embody a Parisian chic, both aspirational and accessible, that seduces Chinese clients, SMCP Chief Executive Daniel Lalonde told Reuters in an interview.      The French fashion group, controlled by China's Shandong Ruyi (002193.SZ), said 2016 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) rose 22 percent to 130 million euros ($140 million). Sales rose by 16.4 percent to 787 million euros. SMCP operates in what analysts classify as the accessible luxury segment of the fashion market, and it aims to become a leader in the more affordable space. Accessible luxury is benefiting from buoyant demand among a fast-growing middle class, particularly in countries such as China, where the group already has 70 stores. The logo of ready-to-wear Maje brand is seen on a fashion shop storefront in Paris, France, March 29, 2017.Charles PlatiauThe Sandro, Maje, and Claudine Pierlot labels sell dresses for between 150-250 euros, and employ supply chain practices borrowed from retailers such as Zara (ITX.MC) and H&M; (HMb.ST).  SMCP's solid 2016 results strike a contrast to rival luxury brand Michael Kors (KORS.N), which last month reported profit below market forecasts, raising concerns over Michael Kors' efforts to reinvigorate its brand. SMCP's growth in its domestic French market also stood out, compared with the overall French fashion market, where sales have declined by 2.6 percent.  International sales, which now account for 54 percent of SMCP's global turnover, rose by 24 percent.  Similar to other major fashion companies, CEO Lalonde is also banking on harnessing the Internet and digital media to spur sales growth.

The company's shares rose as much as 2.1 percent to $67.98, its highest in more than a year. Same-store sales rose 3 percent at KFC and Taco Bell in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, helped in part by new items such as the $1 Double Stacked Tacos. Operating profit at Yum's three chains, which also includes Pizza Hut, grew in the double digits, helping the company top its own growth forecast. Helped by the refranchising of 232 stores in the quarter, core operating profit rose 13 percent, ahead of the 10 percent Yum had forecast in October. KFC and Taco Bell have gotten off to a good start this year, Chief Executive Greg Creed said on a call with analysts and forecast a high single-digit percentage rise in Yum's underlying operating profit.  The company expects a 2-3 percent rise in same-store sales for the full year. Pizza Hut Doesn't Deliver   In contrast to KFC and Taco Bell, Pizza Hut sales at established restaurants fell 2 percent in the quarter. This contributed to a modest 1 percent rise in same-store sales, missing analysts' average estimate of a 2.1 percent rise, according to Consensus Metrix.   The quarter's results (at Pizza Hut) disappointed and are not acceptable, Creed said. The lack of a single ordering system as well as Pizza Hut's reputation of being a sit-down restaurant rather than a delivery chain hurt sales. To turnaround the business, Yum has hired outside experts to address issues, such as delivery times, digital efforts and layouts of the restaurants, which have larger dining areas than those focused on delivery. Yum said in October it would reduce annual capital expenditure to about $100 million in 2019 from about $500 million in 2015 and planned to reduce general and administrative expenses by a cumulative $300 million by fiscal 2019.     Income from continuing operations fell to $285 million in the quarter from $290 million a year earlier. Earnings per share from continuing operations rose to 76 cents per share from 66 cents in the year-ago period. Excluding items, Yum earned 79 cents per share, topping analysts' expectations by 5 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Total revenue rose 2 percent to $2.02 billion, marginally below the average analyst estimate of $2.09 billion.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-viacom-results-idUSKBN15O1FU","Viacom puts its might behind six brands in turnaround push","","February 9, 2017 /  12:23 PM / 6 months ago","","(Reuters) - Viacom Inc (VIAB.O) will focus on five of its cable television brands and the Paramount movie studio, license less content to video streaming companies and consider selling assets as part of a turnaround plan, it said on Thursday. The New York-based media company, which has struggled with declining domestic advertising revenue and poor ratings, also reported stronger-than-expected quarterly results that benefited from growth in its domestic affiliate and theatrical revenues.  Shares of Viacom were up 3.8 percent at $43.67 in midday trading. The company said it was giving top priority to its BET, Comedy Central, MTV, Nickelodeon and Nick Jr channels as well as Paramount. It will reorganize other brands to support those six. The flagship six is essentially the strongest entertainment pack you can get in the market, new Chief Executive Officer Bob Bakish said in a call to analysts. Viacom is focused on improving its programming, but that takes time, Bakish said. More immediately, he said, it is making changes to improve affiliate relations, such as licensing only older content to Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) and other streaming services that compete with its cable and satellite TV affiliates.  Ultimately, we don't believe that those (streaming) players are a positive catalyst in terms of the evolution of the pay TV ecosystem, Bakish said in an interview. Viacom, which has long promoted its own data capabilities, is also looking to give its affiliates access to some information it uses to help advertisers better target viewers, Bakish said.  The company expects U.S. affiliate revenue to rise by a low- to mid-single-digit percentage rate this year, executives said on the call. Viacom is also reviewing its non-core assets, Bakish said, declining to elaborate. The new brand focus is the first major move by Bakish. The former head of Viacom's international business took over as permanent CEO in December after the Redstone family stopped exploring a merger of the company and CBS.  Sumner Redstone and his family own controlling stakes in Viacom and CBS through privately held movie theater company, National Amusements Inc. Bakish's plans come after a year of distractions for the company as the Redstones battled to maintain control, resulting in the departure of former CEO Philippe Dauman. The company said it would begin co-branding releases.  For example, Nickelodeon and Paramount will make four films together.  Next year, Viacom will rename its Spike network The Paramount Network, which will consist mainly of scripted content. Meanwhile, MTV will focus more on unscripted shows, music and live events.  In the first quarter ended Dec. 31, net income attributable to Viacom fell to $396 million, or $1 per share, from $449 million, or $1.13 per share, a year earlier.  Excluding special items, the company earned $1.04 per share, beating the analysts' average estimate of 84 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Revenue rose 5.4 percent to $3.32 billion. Analysts had expected $3.18 billion.  U.S. ad sales fell 3 percent, in line with industry expectations.

This will lead to further brand polarisation and dampen the profitability of weaker brands. Chang'an Automobile lowered its retail prices across different models in late-May 2017, followed by JAC Motors' price promotions for its best-selling models in early June. Great Wall, the largest Chinese sport utility vehicle (SUV) manufacturer, cut the retail prices of various H2/H6 models in early June after launching a CNY1 billion red packet promotional campaign in March. Fitch expects price competition to intensify among proprietary brands in 2017, especially in the rich-margin SUV segment, as auto demand remains subdued. Some small, weak proprietary brands are likely to suffer market share losses and margin compression, while brands with competitive product offerings in the past twelve months, including Geely, Guangzhou Automobile Group's Trumpchi and SAIC Motor's Roewe, are likely to outperform in sales growth and retain healthy profitability. Proprietary automakers have slowed wholesale vehicle deliveries to dealers to ease the latter's inventory and financial burdens. Chinese proprietary brand dealer inventory levels peaked at 2.5 months in April 2017 and remained high at 1.9 months in May after aggressive destocking. Chang'an Automobile, for example, has voluntarily cut its production and wholesale sales since April to help dealers clear old models before new product launches in 2H17. The company's wholesale volume declined by 27.6% yoy in April and 25.8% yoy in May. We believe Chinese automakers have strong incentives to keep dealer inventories under control in 2017 in light of weak demand and new automobile distribution rules that prohibit manufacturers from setting dealer sales targets or pushing inventories to dealers, which come into effect from 1 July 2017.

Sears and its wholly owned subsidiary, Kmart, disclosed their decision on Saturday, saying it was part of a push to focus their online business on the most profitable items. Separately, the Wall Street Journal reported on Saturday that Nordstrom sales of Ivanka Trump's brand had dropped sharply before the retailer discontinued sales this week. Citing internal Nordstrom data, the Journal reported sales of Ivanka Trump-branded clothing and shoes had dropped more than 70 percent in the second, third and fourth week of October compared with the same weeks the previous year. The election was held on Nov. 8.  The developments were the latest in a week of controversy swirling around commercial activity connected to the Trump name. And the moves may be a rare sign of companies taking calculated risks in making business decisions that might invite criticism from President Donald Trump's Twitter account.  Neil Stern, a retail consultant for McMillan Doolittle, said Nordstrom may have felt insulated given its stores tend to be located in cities and affluent suburbs, which tend to tack Democratic. “If there is a political blowback they will survive it given where there stores are,” he said. For Sears, which last month announced plans to close 150 stores, any publicity that draws attention away from the retailer's financial struggles is welcome, Stern added. A Sears department store is seen in New Hyde Park, New York, U.S., January 5, 2017.Shannon StapletonOn Friday, three athletes sponsored by Under Armour Inc took to social media to distance themselves from comments by the company's chief executive, Kevin Plank, in support of President Trump. Earlier in the week, a congressional committee said it was seeking a review into whether senior White House adviser Kellyanne Conway had violated ethics rules by using her position to promote Ivanka Trump's product lines. Prior to Conway's comments, Donald Trump used Twitter to defend his daughter in the wake of Nordstrom's decision to discontinue her product line. White House spokesman Sean Spicer characterized the Nordstrom move as a direct attack on the president's policies.  Customers are seen outside of a Kmart department store in Killeen, Texas, U.S., January 5, 2017.Mohammad KhursheedNeither Sears nor Kmart carried the Trump Home products in their retail stores, a Sears Holdings Corp spokesman said.  As part of the company’s initiative to optimize its online product assortment, we constantly refine that assortment to focus on our most profitable items, spokesman Brian Hanover said in a statement. Amid that streamlining effort, 31 Trump Home items were among the items removed online this week, he said, adding those items can be found through a third-party vendor, without providing additional information about the products. The Trump Home collection includes lines of furniture, bedding and lighting, often from makers that supply Trump hotels, according to the collection's website. Nordstrom, in announcing the discontinuation of Ivanka Trump's line last week, said sales had steadily declined to the point where it didn’t make good business sense to continue selling the products.

While stay-at-home Muscovites can order an array of international pizza brands from Sbarro to Domino's to Papa John's, regional cities such as Rostov-on-Don and Nizhny Novgorod are still chiefly the preserve of small local chains. Multiple challenges have kept global fast food brands wedded to major Russian cities, including patchy transport links, bureaucratic delays, finding an army of chefs who can maintain quality, as well as the sheer cost of shipping often perishable ingredients across a vast country that spans 11 time zones. Western fast food chains have also had to adapt menus to suit Russian palates better, once the allure of new foreign tastes has worn off. One of Domino's best-selling pizzas is the Russian with 13 toppings including potato, beef, pork, bacon, mushrooms, pepperoni and cheese to help ward off the cold. But Domino's Pizza's Russian franchisee, DP Eurasia, believes the time is now right to expand beyond Moscow, where sales at the 76 outlets it had at the end of March are far outstripping growth in its main market Turkey. The company has done its own research and realized that there's almost no quality pizza in the regions, which gives us enormous ground for development, said DP Eurasia's head of Russian development Elena Ivanova. Like-for-like sales in Russia have risen 30.1 percent this year up to May 21, whereas the comparable figure for Turkey was 6.3 percent growth. Aggressive Expansion Domino's was Russia's third-largest pizza chain last year yet its share of the fragmented market stood at less than 2 percent, according to Euromonitor International. Guvenc Donmez, DP Eurasia's Russian head, said he saw room for 1,500 Domino's outlets in the longer term. A staff member prepares pizzas at a Domino's Pizza restaurant in Moscow, Russia, July 14, 2017.Sergei KarpukhinFor now, the company is using part of the 148 million pounds  ($192 million) it raised listing shares in London in June to add 40 outlets this year, venturing as far as Krasnodar, 1,200 kilometers (750 miles) south of Moscow. Domino's closest rival is not standing idle. The Russian franchise of U.S. chain Papa John's International Inc, the fourth biggest player in the country in 2016, sees room for 60-80 store openings each year over the next five years. We still see potential in Moscow. I think we could open a further 40-50 stores there, but we are also embarking on an aggressive expansion to small towns, Christopher Wynne, the chief executive of Papa John's franchisee, told Reuters. Another U.S. brand Sbarro was the market leader with a 4 percent market share in 2016, according to Euromonitor, followed by DoDo Pizza, a Russian chain with a presence in former Soviet states as well as China and the United States. Slideshow (6 Images)Sbarro's Russian franchise had 88 stores last year, including in provincial cities. However, it was hit by a Russian food import ban and a drop in the rouble as Sbarro refused to let it replace imports with local products and the franchising agreement was terminated, Russia's RBC daily has reported. Sbarro did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Wynne said Papa John's Russia had imported 90 percent of products before the 2014 food ban came in but had replaced all its suppliers within six months. DP Eurasia acknowledged the restrictions could adversely affect its business, even though it too had managed to replace the banned imports. It also said there could be challenges in rolling out the franchise in places with less dense populations than Moscow but believes it can stay profitable thanks to greater purchasing power and economies of scale. Russia is a huge market and is still very underpenetrated. You don't have many options to eat, Donmez said in an interview with Reuters TV.

Speaking on ABC's This Week program, White House aide Stephen Miller said Trump adviser Conway was making a light-hearted, flippant comment when she urged Americans to buy Ivanka Trump's products. Conway's comments prompted criticism from both Republican and Democratic lawmakers, as well as some legal experts who said she may have violated ethics rules that prohibit using a public office to endorse products or advance personal business gains. In comments to the Associated Press last week, Republican Jason Chaffetz, chairman of the House of Representatives Oversight committee, said Conway's statement was clearly over the line, unacceptable. Elijah Cummings, the top Democrat on the same committee, said on Sunday that Miller's characterization of Conway's remarks was incorrect. This was a textbook case of a violation of the law, he said on This Week.  White House advisor Kellyanne Conway listens as U.S. President Donald Trump meets with county sheriffs at the White House in Washington, U.S. February 7, 2017.Kevin LamarqueCummings said he was troubled by the fact that Trump is the authority who will ultimately decide how to punish Conway, if at all, after the Office of Government Ethics issues its recommendation on the matter. Conway made the comments after retailer Nordstrom said it would stop selling Ivanka Trump's clothing line, a move that had prompted a tweet from the president blasting Nordstrom. Nordstrom said it had made the decision to drop the brand because sales had steadily declined, especially in the last half of 2016, to where carrying the line didn't make good business sense. Nordstrom shares initially fell after the president's criticism last Wednesday, but closed up 4 percent on the New York Stock Exchange that day. On Saturday, a spokesman for major U.S. retailers Sears and Kmart said they had removed 31 Trump Home items from their online product offerings in order to focus on more profitable merchandise.

A portfolio of competitive brands is the key driver of DFG's credit strength. The diverse portfolio provides higher stability than that experienced by other large Chinese car manufacturers, which typically rely heavily on one or two joint ventures or just a few key models. Together with parent, Dongfeng Motor Corporation, DFG operates a diversified brand portfolio, including DF Nissan, DF Honda, DF Peugeot, DF Citroen, DF Renault, DF Yueda KIA, DF Sokon, DF Infiniti, DF Venucia, DF Luxgen, DF Liuzhou Moor, Zhengzhou Nissan and DF passenger vehicles. The portfolio provides the company with balanced product offerings that cover a number of market segments, improving business stability when individual brands or segments experience a downturn. Dongfeng Motor Corporation sold 4.3 million vehicles in 2016, up 10.6% yoy. However, some group divisions, such as Dongfeng Peugeot-Citroen and Dongfeng Yueda Kia, which ranked third and second by sales volume, respectively, recorded poor performance during 2016.  DF PSA experienced a 15.5% yoy decline in units sold, while DF Yueda Kia had only 5.5% growth.

Beijing is trying to modernize its sprawling farm sector, the world's largest, and rebalance output away from basic grains towards foods such as meat, dairy and other value-added products increasingly in demand from its urbanizing population. But the policy document published late on Sunday suggested that local producers in the world's second-largest economy are struggling to compete with imports because of high production costs and inventory. Known as the number one document, the statement sets out Beijing's priorities in rural policy for the year. It reiterated earlier plans to modify the crop structure, encouraging farmers to grow less grain corn and more soybeans, as well as more corn silage and alfalfa for livestock. The reforms are designed to improve the quality of agricultural supply, to be market-oriented, optimize the supply structure, and keep up with changing consumer demand, Tang Renjian, deputy head of the Communist Party's rural policy group, told reporters at a briefing on Monday. But Tang said changes to the supply structure would depend on whether farmers could continue to increase their incomes.  Analysts said the document underlined the challenge facing the government as it seeks to boost farmers' incomes and ensure food supply for China's giant population while preventing over-production of grains as the pace of demand growth slows. FILE PHOTO: A farmer dries newly harvested corn cobs near her field in Zhuliang village of Qingzhou, Shandong province, September 27, 2013.China Daily/File PhotoBut they expressed disappointment that it didn't include specific measures that would improve farmers' incomes, which have fallen in recent years as living and farming costs have increased. The document is significant, but effective implementation is the key, said Ma Wenfeng, analyst at Beijing Orient Agri-business Consultant Co Ltd. Farmers' incomes have fallen significantly in the past few years, the whole society is getting poorer and demand and consumption are down sharply. The government said it plans to promote new channels of demand for corn to help digest excess stocks, built up after years of buying from farmers to support their income. FILE PHOTO: A harvester unloads corn to a cargo truck at a farm in Gaocheng, Hebei province, China, September 30, 2015.Kim Kyung-Hoon/File PhotoAfter abandoning the policy last year, it still has an estimated 200 million tonnes in warehouses, according to some estimates, much of poor quality. Meanwhile it will promote local and specialty products and geographical indications as well as organic products, with favorable taxes for start-ups in rural areas and innovation centers to support high quality produce. It will also encourage exports, and support companies to set up overseas production bases, particularly in countries that are part of its Silk Road initiative. Beijing will also make use of anti-dumping and other measures to protect its producers, said the document.  It placed significant emphasis on making agriculture more environmentally sustainable, promoting major water-saving programs through technology such as drip irrigation, tackling overuse of pesticides and strict standards on handling manure as well as use of more technology such as large-scale biogas digesters. Reforms must however ensure that grain production capacity is not reduced, the income of farmers is not reversed and rural stability is not a problem, added the document.

Gucci, in double digit sales growth territory for the first time since 2012, accounts for more than 60 percent of Kering's operating profit. Analysts had expected its third-quarter sales growth to reach around 10 percent. Under the leadership of designer Alessandro Michele and chief executive Marco Bizzarri, the brand has been rolling out a new geek chic look, revamping its stores and offering leather bags with painted insects and animals that have proven popular.   Asked if the turnaround was sustainable, Kering Finance Director Jean-Marc Duplaix said: We have a plan for Gucci and we are not at the end of the plan yet.  He predicted more gains from the brand's new store concepts, product ranges and client loyalty programmes.  Yves Saint Laurent also surprised with a 33.9 percent jump in comparable third-quarter sales even though the French fashion brand parted ways with its star designer Hedi Slimane, replaced in April by Anthony Vaccarello.  Kering posted one of the strongest beats in memory in the luxury sector, with Gucci and Saint Laurent significantly ahead of expectations, Exane BNP Paribas analyst Luca Solca said.  Gucci is cashing in on a brilliant self-help programme, which has brought the brand back on the map.  But the group said its Italian tailor Brioni's sales were still declining. Brioni's creative director Justin O'Shea left after seven months in the job, having overseen an unexpected gothic makeover of the brand. Kering has been through an intensive reshuffle in the past few months. In October alone, it appointed new chief executives for Balenciaga, Christopher Kane and Bottega Veneta. Duplaix said Bottega Veneta's sales decline was mainly due to a drop in Chinese tourist spending in Japan and Europe, a pruning of its wholesale and retail network and fewer discounts.   It will take time and it will require investments, Duplaix said about the brand's turnaround, adding that it could possibly return to growth in 2017 but its ascent would be very progressive. Duplaix said Kering's watch trading remained challenging adding that he did not think there was a big difference between us and the market.  Overall, Kering's sales rose 10.5 percent while its Puma sports brand grew 10.8 percent during the period under review.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-afghanistan-women-lawyers-idUSKBN19P0L4","Afghanistan's female lawyers risk danger to help women branded 'cheap and filthy'","","July 4, 2017 /  6:23 AM / 24 days ago","","LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Three years ago Maliha, 24, was sitting in a park in western Afghanistan with the man she thought was the love of her life. The pair were planning a future together, but that future was cut short in a brutal instant. Suddenly, police officers barged into the park in the city of Herat and arrested the couple. Maliha was accused of maintaining an illicit relationship, which in the eyes of Islamic law is a criminal act. At the police station, her companion called his family, bribed the police and disassociated himself from her. He deserted me like he never knew me, said Maliha said. They informed my family about the incident and my involvement with a man. My father disowned me immediately and threatened to kill me if I ever approached him. Maliha was convicted of being a prostitute and spent more than three years in a women's prison, sharing a cell with women convicted on similar charges. Wardens at the prison came to the cell and harassed, beat and sexually assaulted the women, she said. We were branded as cheap and filthy women. Some nights I heard girls shouting...the prison officers were taking them out and sexually abusing them, she said. I was so scared that I hardly ever bathed as it could attract attention toward me. Maliha herself was abused one day when a man arrived claiming to be a lawyer. She was shown into a room with him where he tried to rape her. She was badly beaten when she resisted. Her suffering continued until a woman lawyer and women's rights activist, Mahdis Doost, stepped into help her. Afghanistan is one of the most dangerous countries to be a woman or girl in, and a shortage of female police officers and lawyers means women rarely report abuse, rights groups say. Research indicates that more than eight in 10 women in Afghanistan have been sexually, physically or psychologically abused, but only a few thousand cases are reported each year. If an unmarried woman is caught alone with a man who is not her relative, she can be accused, like Maliha, of being a prostitute. A man and woman in Herat province, accused of being in an illicit relationship, were captured by a mob and shot in an extra-judicial killing, Herat's police spokesman said on Monday. Patriarchal      When women do report abuse or are arrested themselves, they find themselves at the mercy of Afghanistan's patriarchal judicial system, shaped by sharia law, women's rights campaigners say. In many court meetings, I could easily defend my client but the judge didn't let the proceedings be completed. The atmosphere was heavily antagonistic and many times I was called a whore or abused - just because of my choice of clients, Doost, 26, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Afghanistan's roughly 500 registered women lawyers - mostly confined to the big cities of Kabul, Mazar-i-Sharif and Herat, undertake some of the most dangerous jobs in Afghan society. They help women fleeing domestic violence and forced marriage. Divorce still remains taboo in Afghan society and if a woman wants to get a divorce lawfully, she has to navigate the male-dominated judicial system.  There is a common phrase in Afghanistan which says a girl should come to her in-laws in a white dress and leave them in a white shroud, said Fereshta Karimi, another women lawyer working in Herat. Among Afghanistan's women lawyers, only a few actually dare to practice in court. Doost, who represented Maliha, is one of them.  When I took Maliha's case, she had been held in prison for nearly three years without a single appearance in court and no lawyer. I provided evidence that she was arrested in a public place and the crime (sex with a man) didn't happen and there were no witnesses for that, Doost said by phone. She had already spent more time than she should in prison for a crime she did not commit. The judge would not cooperate. That is why it took eight months for me to release Maliha. Danger Abdul Qadir Rahimi, head of the Human Rights Commission of Afghanistan, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation they were aware of abuse of women by the police and judicial authorities. No specific report about rape or sexual exploitation (of women in detention) has surfaced yet, but we cannot deny such incidents occur as the system and police are corrupt in this country, he said. There are around 100 women lawyers in Herat working under the Afghanistan Independent Bar Association (AIBA), Aziz Rafi, the head of the AIBA told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  But most of them are working as advisors and do not appear in court because of the dangers. Fereshta Karimi has worked on more than 30 women's cases over the last six years.  As a married woman, every day I invite unwanted danger to my family with the nature of my job, she said. Sometimes clients' associates come to my door to discuss the intricacy of a case, which makes my family worried and upset.  Many times my husband has tried to stop me from working and I have to struggle every day to continue my job as a lawyer. she said. For women like Maliha, rejected by their own families, women lawyers have been their only hope. Maliha is now living secretly with her widowed aunt. Because of her conviction, she can't resume her studies, get a job or move freely in society. Her male relatives have threatened to kill her. Doost has promised to send her to the capital Kabul and find her a job there. It may be a place where I can resume my life among unknown people, Maliha said. My aunt keeps saying me she can't hide me for long and I am scared for my life if my brother finds me.

The brand is part of Geely's efforts to broaden its appeal by tackling the middle market. It will be rolled out across China from next year and will go on sale in Europe and the United States in 2018. The SUV model, called '01', will be the first vehicle based on the Complex Modular Architecture (CMA) platform developed by Geely and Volvo, which Geely acquired six years ago. The carmaker is targeting tech-savvy drivers. Registered owners will be able to rent out their car to others using the Lynk & Co app and a shareable digital key, said Alain Visser, a senior vice president at Lynk & Co. The new model for car ownership and the smart comfort that modern tech communication offers is designed to fill a much-needed gap in today's car industry, Visser said in a statement. China's economic growth is at its slowest in a quarter of a century, but Geely, under Chairman Li Shufu, beat the industry growth rate last year and has turned around Volvo's fortunes. The aim is for Lynk & Co-brand cars to compete with Chinese foreign venture brands, such as those produced jointly by General Motors and SAIC Motor Corp, people familiar with the matter have told Reuters. Geely said the car, to be presented at a special event in Berlin, will be priced competitively and have a fixed pricing model for all markets with Lynk & Co controlling both customer relations and the distribution channels. It did not give a specific price however.   (Reporting by Caroline Copley; Additional reporting by Jake Spring in Beijing; Editing by Adrian Croft)"

Trump, however, has grown increasingly frustrated over China's inaction on North Korea and bilateral trade issues and is considering possible trade actions against Beijing, three senior administration officials told Reuters. Myanmar was upgraded to the Tier 2 Watch List of nations that deserve special scrutiny, from Tier 3, which includes those countries not complying with minimum U.S. standards and making no significant effort to do so. Afghanistan, Malaysia and Qatar moved up to Tier 2, a list of nations making significant efforts to comply, from the Tier 2 Watch List. Tier 1 designates nations that meet minimum U.S. standards. The report said China convicted fewer sex and labor traffickers in the 12 months ended on March 31 than in the previous year, forcibly repatriated North Koreans without screening them for indicators of trafficking and handled most forced labor cases as administrative issues rather than criminal prosecutions. China was downgraded to Tier 3 status in this year's report in part because it has not taken serious steps to end its own complicity in trafficking, including forced laborers from North Korea that are located in China, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said as he presented the report. For the previous three years, China was on the Tier 2 Watch List. It was last in Tier 3, the lowest ranking, in 2013. A Tier 3 rating can trigger sanctions limiting access to U.S. and international aid, but U.S. presidents frequently waive such action. Twenty-one countries were downgraded from their status on last year's report, and 27 countries were upgraded, said Susan Coppedge, the senior State Department official working on human trafficking issues, at a briefing with reporters on Tuesday. Tillerson presented the report in the State Department's Benjamin Franklin room alongside Ivanka Trump, the president's daughter and adviser. A crowd of about 300 people, including Republican Senator Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Republican Representative Chris Smith, who authored the anti-trafficking law that mandated the State Department report, attended the ceremony. In a statement, Smith called for sanctions against China as punishment for its record on human trafficking. Ivanka Trump speaks at the 2017 Trafficking in Persons Report (TIP) Ceremony at the State Department in Washington, U.S., June 27, 2017.Yuri GripasIvanka Trump has tried to make the fight against human trafficking one of her signature issues. She was instrumental in arranging a White House meeting with anti-trafficking activists that Trump attended in the first few weeks of the administration.  During a visit to Rome last month, she met privately with a group of African women who had been trafficked into prostitution. Beijing confirmed this month that it had detained labor rights activists who scrutinized conditions at a Chinese company making shoes for Ivanka Trump's namesake apparel line. The State Department has urged China to release the activists immediately. Slideshow (5 Images)The State Department on Tuesday also removed Iraq and Myanmar from a list of countries that recruit and use child soldiers. The announcement confirmed a report by Reuters on Friday. U.S. officials told the news agency that Tillerson had disregarded recommendations of State Department experts, senior U.S. diplomats and the State Department's legal office to keep the countries on the list. The State Department declined to comment on how the decision was made, saying it does not discuss details of internal deliberations. Human rights advocates criticized the decision, saying international observers continue to document child recruitment by both countries' militaries. Under the Child Soldiers Prevention Act of 2008, the U.S. government must be satisfied that no children are recruited, conscripted or otherwise compelled to serve as child soldiers for a country to be removed from the list and U.S. military assistance to resume. Taking (Myanmar) and Iraq off the list when they continue to use child soldiers is both contrary to U.S. law and harms children still in the ranks, Jo Becker, children's rights advocacy director at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement on Monday.  Coppedge said she had raised U.S. concerns about Myanmar's response to the use of child soldiers directly with the Myanmar government in December, and acknowledged that in Iraq children are highly vulnerable to forcible recruitment by Iraqi forces in the fight against Islamic State, as well as by Islamic State. But she did not directly respond when asked why the two countries were removed from the list, except to say that Myanmar has made significant strides in removing children from military service.

The brand will be used to launch the first vehicle based on the Complex Modular Architecture (CMA) platform developed by Geely and Volvo, which Geely acquired six years ago. Reuters was first to report in April that Geely would launch a new middle market brand, codenamed L, to compete with Chinese-foreign venture cars such as those produced by GM  and SAIC Motor Corp - leaving Volvo to focus on the luxury end and Geely to go up against domestic producers. The L codename represents Lynk & Co, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters, a company which has already launched a holding website, showing next week's launch date. Geely declined to comment. The website - lynkco.com - shares Internet license and other registration details with Geely and China Euro Vehicle Technology (CEVT), a subsidiary that coordinates research and development with Volvo. The site does not, though, provide details on the brand or cars. As you have seen on the Lynk & Co website, CEVT is indeed the company behind this website and it's no secret that it is developing the CMA platform for Geely Auto, said Stefan Lundin, a CEVT spokesman based in Sweden. Lundin said Lynk & Co would launch on Oct. 20 in Berlin, but declined to elaborate on the nature of the venture. Lynk & Co will enter a tough Chinese auto market where the car industry has struggled with slowing economic growth since last year. Geely has weathered the slowdown better than most, with sales of its feature-packed cars growing for 16 consecutive months to September.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-volkswagen-china-idUSKCN12J0PV","Volkswagen challenges sister brand Audi with new China-only model","","October 19, 2016 /  8:33 AM / in 9 months","","BEIJING (Reuters) - Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) (VW) will launch a top-end sedan in China on Friday that will compete directly with sister brand Audi and is aimed at buyers looking for luxurious yet less-flashy cars amid a nationwide crackdown on conspicuous consumption. Chinese President Xi Jinping's sweeping war on deep-seated graft and extravagant lifestyles since assuming power almost four years ago has made the country's consumer more wary about displaying wealth when buying anything - from fancy cars to designer handbags and fine wines. Volkswagen hopes the Phideon, a luxury-style sedan from a brand that has a mass-market image unlike automakers such as BMW or Mercedes-Benz, will help it cash in on buyers' sentiments and drive sales in China - the world's top auto market. Shiny, blingy showing-off is no longer the behavior in the (larger) cities, said Holger Santel, vice president of sales for SAIC Volkswagen, VW's joint venture with SAIC Motor (600104.SS). Customers are increasingly saying I don't want Audi, Benz, BMW. I don't want to show off. VW displayed the Phideon alongside Audi's A6 sedan, BMW's (BMWG.DE) 5 series and Daimlers' (DAIGn.DE) Mercedes-Benz E-Class at a media event in Shanghai, indicating it expects the Phideon to compete with these German luxury marques. We definitely believe that our models are positioned in their own market segments, an Audi spokesman said, adding Audi does not comment on VW models as a matter of policy. Audi first rose to prominence in China as the vehicle of choice for government officials and some of its association with government excesses persists to date. The Audi A6 has a flashier price tag than Phideon but could cost the same after dealership discounts, auto experts say. Logos of Volkswagen (R) and Audi are seen on a wheel of a car at a used car dealership in Seoul, South Korea, October 2, 2015.Kim Hong-JiPhideon's Fate VW, which is still associated with its low-end Santana sedans that have dominated the Shanghai taxi market for decades, will not offer discounts or push sales volume targets on the Phideon model to keep the focus on quality, Santel said. Phideon is the second flagship sedan experiment for VW after the Phaeton, a global model in the same class as the Audi A8, that was discontinued earlier this year after it failed to meet sales targets in its roughly 13 years of existence. The smaller Phideon differs in that it is being launched as a China-only model, but a VW spokesman said the firm does not rule out exporting to other regions in the future. Phideon's fate will depend on its price, said Yale Zhang, the managing director of consultancy Automotive Foresight.  Ford's (F.N) launch of Taurus as a flagship sedan for China last November was a success, with its sales outstripping that of its entire Lincoln luxury brand in the first half of 2016, according to data from consultancy JATO Dynamics. But the Phideon's 359,000 yuan ($53,273.58) starting price is roughly 100,000 yuan more than the Taurus and according to Zhang there is a risk the VW sedan could find a similar reception as the expensive Phaeton.

Consumers may be carrying different smartphones now, but are they really in love and loyal to those brands? said Nummela in an interview.  The Nokia consumer brand lives on as the badge on cheaper, entry-level feature phones sold mainly in Asia, India and Eastern Europe, though Microsoft invested little to market the name in recent years.

The casting notice, circulated on Twitter and Facebook, said an agency was looking for any and all real alt-right thinkers/believers and indicated the call was for a Cadillac advertisement to be filmed later this month. The alt-right is a loose grouping characterized by a rejection of mainstream politics that includes neo-Nazis, white supremacists and anti-Semites.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/volkswagen-china-idUSL4N1CN22U","Volkswagen challenges sister brand Audi with new China-only model","","October 19, 2016 /  8:33 AM / in 9 months","","BEIJING (Reuters) - Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) (VW) will launch a top-end sedan in China on Friday that will compete directly with sister brand Audi and is aimed at buyers looking for luxurious yet less-flashy cars amid a nationwide crackdown on conspicuous consumption. Chinese President Xi Jinping's sweeping war on deep-seated graft and extravagant lifestyles since assuming power almost four years ago has made the country's consumer more wary about displaying wealth when buying anything - from fancy cars to designer handbags and fine wines. Volkswagen hopes the Phideon, a luxury-style sedan from a brand that has a mass-market image unlike automakers such as BMW or Mercedes-Benz, will help it cash in on buyers' sentiments and drive sales in China - the world's top auto market. Shiny, blingy showing-off is no longer the behavior in the (larger) cities, said Holger Santel, vice president of sales for SAIC Volkswagen, VW's joint venture with SAIC Motor (600104.SS). Customers are increasingly saying I don't want Audi, Benz, BMW. I don't want to show off. VW displayed the Phideon alongside Audi's A6 sedan, BMW's (BMWG.DE) 5 series and Daimlers' (DAIGn.DE) Mercedes-Benz E-Class at a media event in Shanghai, indicating it expects the Phideon to compete with these German luxury marques. We definitely believe that our models are positioned in their own market segments, an Audi spokesman said, adding Audi does not comment on VW models as a matter of policy. Audi first rose to prominence in China as the vehicle of choice for government officials and some of its association with government excesses persists to date. The Audi A6 has a flashier price tag than Phideon but could cost the same after dealership discounts, auto experts say. Logos of Volkswagen (R) and Audi are seen on a wheel of a car at a used car dealership in Seoul, South Korea, October 2, 2015.Kim Hong-JiPhideon's Fate VW, which is still associated with its low-end Santana sedans that have dominated the Shanghai taxi market for decades, will not offer discounts or push sales volume targets on the Phideon model to keep the focus on quality, Santel said. Phideon is the second flagship sedan experiment for VW after the Phaeton, a global model in the same class as the Audi A8, that was discontinued earlier this year after it failed to meet sales targets in its roughly 13 years of existence. The smaller Phideon differs in that it is being launched as a China-only model, but a VW spokesman said the firm does not rule out exporting to other regions in the future. Phideon's fate will depend on its price, said Yale Zhang, the managing director of consultancy Automotive Foresight.  Ford's (F.N) launch of Taurus as a flagship sedan for China last November was a success, with its sales outstripping that of its entire Lincoln luxury brand in the first half of 2016, according to data from consultancy JATO Dynamics. But the Phideon's 359,000 yuan ($53,273.58) starting price is roughly 100,000 yuan more than the Taurus and according to Zhang there is a risk the VW sedan could find a similar reception as the expensive Phaeton.

The turnaround plan announced on Friday will lead to 3.7 billion euros ($3.9 billion) in annual savings by 2020 and lift the Volkswagen (VW) brand's operating margin to 4 percent that year, from an expected 2 percent in 2016. That target still remains below rival European carmakers such as Renault (RENA.PA) and Peugeot Citroen (PEUP.PA), which is targeting an operating margin of 6 percent in 2021. VW, Europe's largest carmaker, is seeking to move beyond an emissions-cheating scandal that has tarnished its image and left it facing billions of euros in fines and settlements. The cuts came with a management pledge to create 9,000 new jobs in the area of battery production and mobility services at factories in Germany as part of efforts to shift toward electric and self-driving cars. We have to invest billions of euros in new cars and services while new rivals will attack us - the transformation will surely be more radical than everything we have experienced to date, VW brand CEO Herbert Diess said at a press conference. Deep Enough? Some experts argued the cost cuts were not deep enough. Related CoverageVW lowers spending plans as emissions costs weighSpending on R&D; and staff across VW's automotive operations has been growing for years with the need to overhaul the cost base dating back to before the diesel emissions scandal broke 14 months ago. The deal may be the best the company could negotiate with labor but it's not a victory for either side, said Erik Gordon, a University of Michigan business professor. The cuts are too small to make VW cost competitive with Toyota (7203.T) and other global rivals. With 610,000 workers globally, VW last year built slightly fewer vehicles than Toyota which has 350,000 staff. The German company has also been slow to cease production of unprofitable vehicles in its 340-model range. New Volkswagen models Golf Cabriolet and Passat are stored at the 'CarTowers' in the theme park 'Autostadt' next to the Volkswagen plant in Wolfsburg March 9, 2011.Christian Charisius/File PhotoVW's labor leaders said management had agreed to avoid forced redundancies in Germany until 2025, a step which clears the way to cutting 23,000 jobs via the more palatable methods of buyouts, early retirements and reducing part-time staff. Jobs will also be cut in North America, Brazil and Argentina, VW said, without being more specific. Around 120,000 employees work for VW brand in Germany including 6,000 temporary staff. Unions Pleased Many analysts and investors nonetheless welcomed the deal, sending the shares more than 2 percent higher to the top of the blue-chip DAX .GDAXI index in early Frankfurt trading. At 1324 GMT (8:24 a.m. ET), the stock was still trading up 0.8 percent at 118.5 euros. Slideshow (3 Images)Activist hedge fund TCI, which has been critical of Volkswagen management, said it looked like a good deal all round provided it could be made to stick. As long as they are net savings – the savings are not given back by increased costs elsewhere in the organization, said TCI partner Ben Walker. They've just to deliver now. It's easy to talk. They now have to deliver and execute, he added.  Labor leaders were pleased with the outcome. The most important message is the jobs of the core workforce is secure, VW's works council chief Bernd Osterloh said at the news conference in Wolfsburg, where the company has its headquarters. Management and labor agreed to outsource production of plastic parts from the German Braunschweig plant but will compensate workers by assigning more orders for chassis and steering assembly needed with rising investment in self-drive cars. In a further sign of its shifting focus, VW said it will build electric cars at its German factories in Zwickau and Wolfsburg.   Electric motors will be built in Kassel, and VW will start battery cell production and development in Salzgitter.

The company, which is spinning off its China division at the end of the month, now plans to expand its share buyback plan to $13.5 billion, including dividends. It already has bought back about $5.5 billion shares as part of a previously announced $6.2 billion capital return program that has reduced its share count by about 16 percent. Yum did not immediately have a breakdown on much of the extra returns would be from share repurchases and how much from dividends. Related CoverageYum China aims to triple restaurants as challenges loomExecutives say Yum Brands will be leaner and less exposed to the ups and downs of the restaurant business following the separation of Yum China and the sale of more company-owned restaurants to franchisees.  It's about delivering higher growth with lower risk, Yum Brands Chief Executive Officer Greg Creed told Reuters in a telephone interview. Yum said franchisees will own 93 percent of the nearly 36,000 Yum restaurants remaining in the company after the China unit is carved off. The combined company currently is 77 percent franchised, in part because Yum China owns most of its restaurants. The sign at a Pizza Hut location, which is owned by Yum Brands Inc, is pictured ahead of their company results in Pasadena, California U.S., July 11, 2016.Mario AnzuoniYum Brands aims to have at least 98 percent of its restaurants owned by franchisees by the end of 2018, which will lower costs and increase its dependence on more stable franchise and license fees.  Yum's China business will begin trading on Nov. 1 on the New York Stock Exchange with the ticker symbol YUMC. The new company, Yum China Holdings Inc, will become a licensee of Yum Brands in mainland China and will have exclusive rights there to KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell.  Yum China now accounts for 45 percent of Yum Brands' earnings, a contribution expected to fall to 14 percent after the spinoff, when Yum China will begin paying Yum Brands a license fee of 3 percent of restaurant system sales, Creed said. The company plans to reduce annual capital expenditures to about $100 million in 2019 from about $500 million in 2015 and cut general and administrative expenses by a cumulative $300 million by fiscal 2019. About half of that $300 million in new savings will come from shifting restaurant expenses to new franchisees, the remainder will come from job eliminations and tighter expense controls on things like travel, Creed said. Yum last week reported its first same-store sales drop in five quarters in China, blaming anti-U.S. protests after an international court rejected China's claim to historic rights in the South China Sea. Shares in Yum were up 1.1 percent at $88.31 after hitting a session high of $90.68. Up to Monday's close, the stock had risen about 20 percent since the start of the year.

California, home to the majority of owners of the diesel cars found to cheat emissions tests, is also a key market for the sport utility vehicles Volkswagen hopes will represent its U.S. growth, which as of Oct. 31 had tumbled 13 percent year over year. Volkswagen of America Chief Executive Hinrich Woebcken told a press roundtable that despite ongoing legal and operational matters, the brand is focused on a planned rollout of new U.S.-targeted models in the next few years, including its new Atlas SUV that hits showrooms next spring.  We decided not to go back staying a niche player. We want to be a relevant player in this market, Woebcken said. So Volkswagen definitely is in front of a great comeback story. SUVs are the fastest-growing product category in the United States. Noting that the United States was famous for giving second chances, Woebcken said he was cheered by the number of 2.0 liter diesel vehicle owners, eligible for a buyback under terms of a civil settlement negotiated in June, who had opted instead for a fix. Regulators must still approve proposed fixes for the 2.0 liter vehicles. Beyond the Atlas - introduced at the auto show by former Lakers basketball star Kareem Abdul-Jabbar - Volkswagen will introduce next summer a longer Tiguan, followed in 2017 by a new Golf, and a new Jetta in 2018. We decided not to be loud in expressing numbers, let's simply do it and deliver, said Woebken, declining to share sales targets. But Volkswagen will be economically profitable and a part of the global profitability for the brand, he added. A new management structure that allows for more regional autonomy not only on product decisions but on production in its three factories in the region will help Volkswagen be more competitive, executives said.

Crew Group Inc has started to separate its thriving Madewell brand from the parent group, people familiar with the matter said this week. Battling sliding sales at its core J. Crew brand and a weighty debt burden, the company is working with investment bank Lazard Ltd (LAZ.N) to assess multiple strategic and balance sheet options, the people said. The separation of Madewell, which has won over shoppers with its laid-back, artsy clothes, may lead to a sale or spinoff. However, the sources cautioned that no decision has been made. They declined to be named because they are not authorized to speak publicly about the company. J. Crew could be limited in how it ultimately proceeds with Madewell because of a provision in its agreement with lenders. The provision, meant to protect the lenders' collateral, prohibits J. Crew from selling Madewell if its total debt compared with a measure of profit exceeds a certain ceiling. J. Crew, including Madewell, had roughly $2 billion in debt as of July 30 and just $49.2 million in cash.  Separating the two brands would allow the company's private equity owners to gain value, but could anger creditors by stripping the flagship brand of its fast-growing segment, one source said. J.Crew was taken private by TPG Capital LP and Leonard Green & Partners L.P. for $2.8 billion in 2011.  Lazard and TPG declined comment. Leonard Green and J. Crew did not immediately return requests for comment. J. Crew's approximately $1.5 billion term loan and its bonds were trading below face value this week, reflecting investor concerns about full repayment.  The term loan was trading at around 71 cents on the dollar, while its bonds were trading at 42 cents on the dollar, according to Thomson Reuters data.  J. Crew, once known for its relatively affordable all-American style, has struggled to retain its core following after going through several brand reinventions. By comparison, Madewell, which J. Crew launched in 2006, has consistently appealed to young shoppers by marketing itself as a modern-day interpretation of classic American denim. Madewell is significantly smaller than J. Crew. Madewell's sales totaled $301 million in the last fiscal year, while J. Crew's were $2.1 billion. As of August this year, there were 287 J.Crew retail stores and 108 Madewell stores. J. Crew is reshuffling its collections in an effort to turn around its business.

Ring-fencing aims to avoid a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis, when banks' bad bets threatened ordinary depositors' cash, leading to big taxpayer-funded bailouts. The rules apply to all banks in Britain that have both retail and commercial or investment banking activities.  State-backed RBS said on Friday NatWest would become its main retail brand in England, Wales and western Europe, while its historic Royal Bank of Scotland name, which dates back to 1727, will be for Scotland only. The shake-up reflects RBS's latest effort to rebuild its reputation after the bank's reckless lending and a takeover spree on the eve of the financial crisis threatened to topple the UK financial system. Our proposed future structure under the ring-fencing legislation and our brand strategy are key elements of the bank we are becoming, Chief Executive Ross McEwan said in a statement. The future ring-fenced structure of the bank is not only designed to be in compliance with the new regulatory requirements and objectives but will better reflect who we are as a bank and what we stand for: a bank that is focused on its customers, he said. RBS's shares were down 1.8 percent at 173.9 pence at 0845 GMT amid a sell-off in banking shares across Europe. The logo of the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) is seen at an office building in Zurich March 27, 2015.Arnd Wiegmann/File PhotoNatWest has a better net promoter score - a measure of customer satisfaction - than RBS so it makes sense to use the brand with the better profile in England and Wales, Shore Capital analyst Gary Greenwood said. He said it would be harder to ditch the RBS name in Scotland where NatWest has never really been used. RBS, which is 73 percent owned by the British taxpayer, is the latest bank to announce how it plans to reform its business to comply with the ring-fencing changes, recommended by the Vickers Commission in 2011.  HSBC (HSBA.L) has outlined similar plans including the relocation of its UK business to Birmingham last year, while Barclays (BARC.L) has carved its business into two core divisions, including Barclays UK, to comply with the new rules. RBS said its new ring-fenced bank would be called NatWest Holdings, comprising its core NatWest, Royal Bank of Scotland, Coutts & Co, Ulster Bank Limited and Ulster Bank Ireland DAC brands.  The legal entity of its private bank, Adam & Company, will be renamed Royal Bank of Scotland Plc as part of the changes. Its Corporate and Institutional Banking business will be called NatWest Markets and will form the non ring-fenced bank, together with the bank's Channel Islands operations. The group holding company will remain Royal Bank of Scotland. Under the rules, banks' ring-fenced businesses, which will be funded and capitalized separately, must include UK retail banking and small business customers and most simple banking transactions.    Big global corporate customers and most investment banking activities must be held in a separate entity.     Editing by Jane Merriman"

Tiger Brands, which makes bread, breakfast cereals and energy drinks, started the review under new chief executive Lawrence MacDougall after heavy losses in Nigeria. The company sold the bulk of its Nigerian business to Dangote Flour Mills last year and has also pulled back from East Africa as part of the review. The immediate priority is to rejuvenate the domestic business to deliver sustainable, profitable growth, the company said on Thursday. We have refined our approach to our African strategy by exiting non-core categories in Kenya and Ethiopia. Tiger Brands is not planning to scale back much further after these disposals and Africa remains part of its growth strategy, MacDougall said in a call to reporters. The company was among a number of South African businesses that ventured into the rest of the continent hoping to profit from Africa's commodity-fueled boom and large population but have pulled back as growth has slowed. Tiger Brands now sees the manufacturing, marketing and distribution of branded food to middle-income consumers in South Africa as its core business, accounting for 70 percent of sales. The previous company focus on African expansion resulted in a rather neglected South African portfolio despite this being the real core of Tiger Brands, said Kagiso Asset Management's associate portfolio manager Dirk van Vlaanderen. Its domestic market offers good growth prospects, he added. The company will also cut costs to generate significant savings over the next five years, CEO MacDougall said, adding that this is unlikely to affect employee numbers. Tiger Brands had earlier reported Headline earnings per share of 1,036 cents for the six months to March 31, against 974.6 cents a year earlier, but warned of a tough outlook for the rest of the year. Volumes in the domestic market slowed significantly in the second quarter and a recovery in the rest of Africa is not imminent, the company said. Shares in Tiger Brands were down 1.7 percent at 392 rand by 1139 GMT, against a 0.2 decline for the benchmark JSE Top-40 index.

This is about proof of concept ... about bringing new technologies and ideas fast to the market, Managing Director Guenter Butschek told reporters at an event in Mumbai. Eventually we will decide to take some of these concepts into the mainstream, he said. Butschek did not disclose how much has been invested so far but the first car under the brand will be launched at the Geneva Motor show in March, the company said in a statement, without giving further details. Trade magazine Autocar has said that the first TAMO car will be a two-seater, mid-engined sportscar, internally called the Futuro. Tata Motors, which owns the British luxury carmaker Jaguar Land Rover, has previously faced criticism for being slow to react to changing trends and has lost market share as a result. The company now expects TAMO to help it meet its target of becoming one of India's three biggest carmakers by the end of March 2019 as it helps reposition the brand image. Organised like a start-up, TAMO could employ people from outside the industy who will focus on sourcing new technologies and forming partnerships to develop new transport concepts, the company said. Production Overhaul Tata Motors, maker of the loss-making Nano small car, also said on Thursday it was restructuring its passenger vehicles business in India, which includes reducing the number of car platforms from six to two to improve production efficiencies. The two modular platforms, to be introduced in 2018, will carry different powertrains including hybrid and electric, and a wide range of different body designs including hatchbacks,  crossovers and sport-utility vehicles (SUVs). The platforms will enable Tata Motors to widen its product range, taking it into market segments where it has previously not been, the company said, adding that it has seen a shift in demand towards premium hatchbacks and SUVs and away from saloon cars. While some of Tata Motors' existing and recently-launched cars will be built on the new platform, the shift will naturally allow it to phase out older models that it does not see potential for, Butschek said. The company is also reviewing its supplier base and plans to drastically reduce the number of suppliers, he said.   (Editing by Greg Mahlich)"

Adidas has shaken up its business in the United States and shed non-core businesses to regain ground lost to Nike, outpacing its rival's sales growth in key markets this year. It sold its golf business this year, striking a deal in May to sell brands TaylorMade, Adams Golf and Ashworth to private equity firm KPS Capital Partners for $425 million. The divestiture of CCM further reflects the commitment to our 'Creating the New' strategy, with complete focus on building on our strength in footwear and apparel via our adidas and Reebok brands, Chief Executive Kasper Rorsted said in a statement. Rorsted was installed to replace long-serving former boss Herbert Hainer - who bought Reebok in 2005 - after activist shareholders took stakes in Adidas, and after several investors called on the company to sell more non-core businesses. Birch Hill will pay most of the purchase price for CCM in cash and the rest in the form of a secured note, Adidas said on Thursday. The sale will have a high double-digit million euro impact on its profit from discontinued operations in the second quarter but does not change its full-year guidance, said Adidas, which is due to publish quarterly results on Aug. 3.

Volkswagen's (VW) labor bosses earlier this month had accused Diess of breaking promises made under a turnaround plan agreed in November and halted cooperation with brand management on issues including overtime work, cost savings and apprenticeships. Europe's largest automaker is hard pressed to cut spending to fund a costly shift to electric cars and new mobility services while grappling with billions of euros in costs for its emissions test cheating scandal. But Diess, who was known as a cost-cutter at BMW (BMWG.DE), has repeatedly clashed with VW works council chief Bernd Osterloh since he joined VW in July 2015 over where to make those savings. The Porsche and Piech families, which control a majority of VW common stock through the family-owned holding company Porsche SE (PSHG_p.DE), stand behind the 58-year-old engineer despite the quarrelling, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Friday. VW declined to comment. Analysts have said VW's ability to overhaul its mass-market brand, the group's largest by sales, will be key to the company's post-Dieselgate recovery and have urged Diess to stand firm on structural changes despite resistance from unions.  The Porsche and Piech families were instrumental in choosing VW's former finance chief Hans Dieter Poetsch to become supervisory board chairman after the emissions scandal broke in September 2015, and likewise in picking former Porsche AG boss Matthias Mueller to become VW group chief executive. VW's supervisory board is expected to meet from 2 pm local time (1300 GMT) on Friday to discuss the carmaker's 2016 financial results and new compensation guidelines for top executives.

The comments by the company, part of U.S. group Coty Inc, came in a landmark case which could determine whether luxury goods companies can stop retailers from selling their products via online marketplaces such as Amazon or eBay. Brand owners have for the past decade argued they should have the right to choose their distributors to protect their image and exclusivity. Online platforms say such curbs are anti-competitive and hurt small businesses. The issue is significant for Europe which accounts for 70 percent of global luxury sales.  The company told Europe's top court that its dispute with German retailer Parfumerie Akzente, which sells Coty's goods on sites including Amazon against its wishes, was not about imposing a ban on such trade. The company's agreements preventing retailers from selling on third-party online platforms are aimed at preserving the image and quality of its products, its lawyer Andreas Lubberger told the Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ). Coty brought the original case in a Frankfurt court which subsequently sought guidance from the ECJ. Parfumerie Akzente's lawyer Oliver Spieker questioned the validity of Coty's arguments. The company has 26 shops and owns the second biggest online site for perfumes and cosmetics in Germany. The German government, a proponent of online trade, said online platforms were key outlets for small- and medium-sized enterprises. Restrictions must never be abused in order to close off new innovative formats of distribution, its lawyer Thomas Henze said. eBay said in a statement it was vital to remove restrictions that prevent small and medium-sized businesses from growing and succeeding. Platform bans allow brands to keep prices artificially high and restrict consumer choice, the company said. Luxembourg sees a blanket ban as disproportionate and unjustified, its lawyer Philippe-Emmanuel Partsch said. Amazon's European headquarters is located there. France, home to luxury brands such as Louis Vuitton and Chanel, sprang to Coty's defense. Online curbs safeguard the prestige and image of such products, Julie Bousin, lawyer for the French government, said. Italy, Sweden, the Netherlands and Austria also intervened in the case. An ECJ court adviser will issue a non-binding opinion in coming months. Judges, who follow such recommendations in four out of five cases, will rule shortly after that.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSFit979351","Fitch: Imperial Brands Cash Flow Allocation Underpins Ratings","","November 8, 2016 /  8:15 AM / 9 months ago","","(The following statement was released by the rating agency) LONDON, November 08 (Fitch) Imperial Brands PLC's announcement today that it  will increase spending on cost rationalisation underpins its priorities and our  view that Imperial intends to protect its credit profile while navigating  through changes in consumer behaviour, foreign exchange volatility and the  regulatory environment.  The company said it plans to spend GBP750m over the next four years to reduce  complexity, drive operational efficiencies and secure additional global  procurement benefits. This will help deliver additional savings of GBP300m  annually by 2020 on top of previously announced GBP300m savings that the company  is targeting by end-September 2018 (FY18) at a cost of GBP600m. The company  plans to reinvest GBP300m of the benefits from these plans towards supporting  the marketing of its key brands.  Despite this additional cash cost, we project that Imperial's lease-adjusted net  debt/funds from  operations (FFO) should decline to approximately 3.4x in FY18  having reduced to 4.2x in FY16 from a peak of 5.1x in FY15, based on preliminary  figures published today. This deleveraging path remains aligned to our initial  expectations of February 2016 when we changed our Outlook on Imperial's  Long-Term Issuer Default Rate to Stable. Our forecast leverage of 3.4x in FY18 is compatible with Imperial's 'BBB' rating  and our leverage downgrade sensitivity of a maximum 3.5x. Similarly, we estimate  FFO fixed charge cover ratio to be above 5.5x in FY16 (FY15:5.1x) against a  downgrade sensitivity of 4x and our previous expectation of above 4.7x. The improvement in credit metrics is also supported, in part, by the currency  benefit as a result of the depreciation of the sterling against the dollar and  euro. As a result, we project Imperial's annual free cash flow to improve to  between GBP800m and GBP1bn for the period FY17-FY19 instead of the GBP600m and  GBP700m range (FY16: GBP1bn) that Fitch had expected prior to the depreciation  of the sterling and these additional investments.  The FCF margin should also be higher (between 7% and 8%). Imperial is the  third-largest tobacco player in Europe but generates the highest free cash flow  after dividends given its conservative financial policy and management focus on  cash preservation.  The company's trading performance in financial year to end-September 2016 adds  further to its improving financial profile compared with FY14 and FY13, when  profits had contracted in many of its core markets. We estimate the FY16 EBITDA  margin has remained above its FY15's 46% (calculated against the company's  economic net revenue of GBP7.2bn and excluding the effect from the sizeable  low-margin distribution business of Logista), a level that we consider strong  for the rating.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-garments-labour-idUSKBN1A50H9","Fashion brands bring hand-washing but little else to India's garment workers, say critics","","July 20, 2017 /  6:08 AM / in 8 days","","CHENNAI, India (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The agenda was to improve the conditions for tens of thousands of India's women garment workers who stitch everything from jeans to jackets for the world's leading fashion brands. But the strategy was flawed, say critics.  The Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI) aimed to gain access to often highly restricted factories in the southern textile center of Tamil Nadu with a hygiene awareness program and use that as a platform for promoting workers' rights. Five years and 485,000 pounds ($630,000) later, the ETI, which brings together labels like H&M;, GAP and Burberry with unions, factory owners and civil society groups, has done little more than teach workers hand washing, campaigners say. Trade unions and labor rights charities, some of them partners in the initiative, say its shortcomings show big stores are merely paying lip service to the rights of garment workers. It is like image management. Brands are using the ETI platform to safeguard themselves, said Nambi Chelliah of non-profit group the Centre for Social Education and Development that was part of the ETI's initial meetings. Workers' representatives say employees in textile mills and factories have not benefited, with fair wages, contracts and a workplace free of abuse still elusive for most. ETI has not been able to leverage any benefits for the workers from either the brands or the factories, both of whom are members of the alliance, said a trade union official who requested anonymity. The ETI denies the claims and says progress has been made in Tamil Nadu through community programs and peer groups at factories and mills that discuss rights beyond hygiene. This is the only large-scale initiative that is working within mills to address such issues and to build the trust of all concerned. We are showing such programs can work to the benefit of all, Alok Singh, ETI's South Asia head, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Suspicion While the ETI has been around since 1998 working on issues like child labor and workers' rights in countries including South Africa, Thailand and Peru, it began focusing on India's textile workers in Tamil Nadu in 2012. The region, often dubbed the Textile Valley of India - where 400,000 women work in around 2,000 spinning mills and factories - supplies to various European and American retailers. ETI officials said they knew addressing exploitation of textile workers - from long hours and little freedom of movement to low pay and poor healthcare - was not going to be easy.  The $40 billion textile and garment sector is a pillar of India's economy and moves aimed at improving workers' rights are often viewed with suspicion by authorities, politicians and management, who see it as a threat to the thriving industry. We...need to note that when the program started there was no appetite for transparency among the mills themselves, said Singh. The Nalam - meaning well-being in Tamil - program was ostensibly to teach women and adolescent girls workers about hygiene and sanitation and has been rolled out in more than 30 mills and factories. Armed with pamphlets, ETI staff infiltrated high-walled compounds where employees live and work, and went about asking women how often they brush their teeth, when they wash their hands and how much they spend on sanitary towels. Posters demonstrating the correct way to wash hands were put up near restrooms and adolescent girls were told to eat more greens and fruit. They were also taught how to deal with menstrual cramps with diet and medication. The initiative has contributed to an attitudinal shift within mill managers, who have seen the benefits of treating workers better, and allowing workers to be educated on their rights, Singh said. Failures But others have a different perspective. Freedom of association is in (the ETI's) code, so is assuring fair wages and making sure there is no exploitation. How will workers eat more fruits if they can't afford to buy it? said the trade union member who did not want to be named. Activists and labor rights charities say the ETI has failed to get brands to map and disclose information on supply chains - from the cotton picked in the fields to the buttons stitched on the garments - which is key to ending exploitation of workers. If they were more transparent about their supply chains, it would make it possible for global advocacy organizations to increase public pressure on companies to take action to ensure respect for labor rights, said Tim Connor, lecturer at Newcastle Law School in Australia and co-author of a 2016 report on the ETI's effectiveness. But the ETI's Singh said transparency would increase as the initiative progressed. As we move forward to the next five years, we expect that we will have access to clearer supply chain information from participating brands, he said.

Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach, speaking in a quarterly conference call with fixed income investors, said the revision is a result of changing interest rates and a greater portion of the business coming from its new Costco (COST.O) co-branded card.  The Costco card, he said, is outperforming expectations and will bring in more revenue and income but with a lower return on assets. Gerspach said the Costco card business, which Citigroup won by outbidding American Express (AXP.N), is exceeding the bank's targets for numbers of accounts, use by customers, revenue and return on assets.    Gerspach's comments provided a hint of the details that analysts expect to hear from Citigroup on Tuesday when the bank holds its first investor day conference since the financial crisis. He also said that Citigroup's retail services division, which mostly issues store-branded cards in the United States, is still expected to earn a 2.50 return on assets despite a rise in the rate of losses on accounts because of new problems collecting from delinquent borrowers. The two North American credit card businesses provided nearly 20 percent of Citigroup's income from continuing operations in 2016.  Reporting by David Henry in New York; Editing by Cynthia Osterman"

"https://www.reuters.com/article/unilever-ma-kraft-idUSL8N1G23B0","Kraft Heinz bids $143 billion for Unilever in global brand grab","","February 17, 2017 /  12:20 PM / 5 months ago","","LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. food company Kraft Heinz Co made a surprise $143 billion offer for Unilever Plc in a bid to build a global consumer goods giant, although it was flatly rejected on Friday by the maker of Lipton tea and Dove soap.  A combination would be the third-biggest takeover in history and the largest acquisition of a UK-based company, according to Thomson Reuters data. It would bring together some of the world's best known brands, from toothpaste to ice creams, and combine Kraft's  strength in the United States with Unilever's in Europe and Asia.  The global packaged food industry is grappling with slowing growth, new competition from upstart brands, deflation in developed markets and more health-conscious consumers.  Although Kraft, which is controlled by U.S. billionaire Warren Buffett and private equity firm 3G Capital, said it looked forward to talking terms, Unilever said it saw no reason to discuss a deal without financial or strategic merit. Kraft approached Unilever earlier this week, according to people familiar with the matter, who declined to be identified because the approach was confidential. Kraft believes that investing in innovation would be an important part of the combined company, one of the people said. Kraft has also offered to keep three headquarters for the combined company in the United States, Britain and the Netherlands, the source added.  Credit rating agency Moody's characterized the bid for Unilever as credit negative as the combined company would be more highly financially leveraged. There would be offsetting benefits such as cost savings, an expanded geographic footprint and improved product diversification, the agency said. Kraft wants the combined company's credit rating to be investment-grade, according to the sources. Kraft has until March 17 to make a final bid for Unilever under UK takeover rules.  Unilever shares rose to a record following news of the offer, which analysts at Jefferies called a seismic shock, and  closed 15 percent higher, short of Kraft's $50 per share offer price, with the news lifting shares across the sector. Unilever said Kraft's proposal included $30.23 per share in cash, payable in U.S. dollars, and 0.222 of a share in a new enlarged entity per Unilever share and represented an 18 percent premium to its share price on Thursday. We believe Kraft will likely need to raise its offer substantially if it hopes to change the outcome, RBC Capital Markets analyst David Palmer said in a research note.  Kraft's move could flush out other bidders for Unilever, but of the potential rivals, U.S. consumer giant Procter & Gamble Co may face anti-trust hurdles, while pharmaceutical and consumer packaged goods company Johnson and Johnson would likely not be interested in household products. Unilever's Challenges A Heinz Ketchup bottle sits between a box of Kraft macaroni and cheese and a bottle of Kraft Original Barbecue Sauce on a grocery store shelf in New York City, New York, U.S. March 25, 2015.Brendan McDermidUnilever, which has struggled recently amid slowing growth and currency fluctuations, saw its shares tumble 4.5 percent on Jan. 26, its worst day in nearly a year, when the company reported lower-than-expected fourth-quarter sales. The share plunge encouraged Kraft to make an approach, another source familiar with the matter said, asking not to be named because the matter is confidential. Unilever has been hit by a slowdown in emerging markets, which it and other consumer companies have long relied on for growth, as well as in its home market, where consumers have been rattled after Brexit, Britain's decision to leave the European Union last year. Brexit pushed down the value of the pound, raising the cost of producing consumer goods in Britain and straining relations between the country's retailers and suppliers. For Kraft, its move comes as low interest rates and cheap debt have fueled big cross-border deals, making it the busiest start to the year for M&A; activity on record.  Still, investors will look at Kraft-Heinz's own track record of boosting sales when evaluating whether they can help Unilever cope with its own slowed growth. Kraft's sales fell 3.8 percent to $6.86 billion in the fourth quarter ending Dec. 31, and its U.S. sales, which account for more than 70 percent of total sales, fell 3.1 percent to $4.84 billion.  Kraft Heinz shares rose more than 10 percent in New York trading, helping lift the Nasdaq to a record high. 3g Ready to Deal  Although Kraft is smaller than Unilever, with a market value of $106 billion as of Thursday, it is 50.9-percent owned by Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc  and 3G Capital, which also controls Anheuser-Busch InBev.  3G, known for driving profits through aggressive cost cutting, has orchestrated a string of big deals rocking the food and drink industry, including Anheuser-Busch InBev's takeover of SABMiller and the combination of Kraft and Heinz.  A deal would offer opportunities to combine marketing, manufacturing and distribution in addition to cutting costs, but some industry analysts said Kraft might not want Unilever's household and personal goods brands and could spin them off.  This is cheap money meeting industrial logic, said Steve Clayton, manager of the HL Select UK Shares fund at Hargreaves Lansdown, which owns Unilever shares.  Kraft Heinz are attempting a massive push on the fast forward button ... To acquire the sheer scale of brands that Unilever represents through one-off acquisitions could take decades, Clayton added.  Britain's largest union, Unite, represents employees at Unilever, according to its website. Unite urged Unilever to continue fending off the takeover attempt to prevent job losses.  Unilever employs 168,000 people and generates roughly 17 percent of its revenue in the United States compared with Kraft-Heinz, which generates roughly 78 percent in America. A recent wave of cross-border deals in Europe is leaving British businesses vulnerable to possible job cuts. Pegeuot SA's proposed acquisition of General Motors Co's Opel business may eventually lead to heavy restructuring at the Vauxhall brands, which employ 4,500 people in Britain, sources said. Centerview and Morgan Stanley are working with Unilever alongside UBS and Deutsche Bank, who are also acting as corporate brokers. Kraft is working with Lazard.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/viacom-results-idUSL4N1FU408","Viacom puts its might behind six brands in turnaround push","","February 9, 2017 /  12:23 PM / 6 months ago","","(Reuters) - Viacom Inc (VIAB.O) will focus on five of its cable television brands and the Paramount movie studio, license less content to video streaming companies and consider selling assets as part of a turnaround plan, it said on Thursday. The New York-based media company, which has struggled with declining domestic advertising revenue and poor ratings, also reported stronger-than-expected quarterly results that benefited from growth in its domestic affiliate and theatrical revenues.  Shares of Viacom were up 3.8 percent at $43.67 in midday trading. The company said it was giving top priority to its BET, Comedy Central, MTV, Nickelodeon and Nick Jr channels as well as Paramount. It will reorganize other brands to support those six. The flagship six is essentially the strongest entertainment pack you can get in the market, new Chief Executive Officer Bob Bakish said in a call to analysts. Viacom is focused on improving its programming, but that takes time, Bakish said. More immediately, he said, it is making changes to improve affiliate relations, such as licensing only older content to Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) and other streaming services that compete with its cable and satellite TV affiliates.  Ultimately, we don't believe that those (streaming) players are a positive catalyst in terms of the evolution of the pay TV ecosystem, Bakish said in an interview. Viacom, which has long promoted its own data capabilities, is also looking to give its affiliates access to some information it uses to help advertisers better target viewers, Bakish said.  The company expects U.S. affiliate revenue to rise by a low- to mid-single-digit percentage rate this year, executives said on the call. Viacom is also reviewing its non-core assets, Bakish said, declining to elaborate. The new brand focus is the first major move by Bakish. The former head of Viacom's international business took over as permanent CEO in December after the Redstone family stopped exploring a merger of the company and CBS.  Sumner Redstone and his family own controlling stakes in Viacom and CBS through privately held movie theater company, National Amusements Inc. Bakish's plans come after a year of distractions for the company as the Redstones battled to maintain control, resulting in the departure of former CEO Philippe Dauman. The company said it would begin co-branding releases.  For example, Nickelodeon and Paramount will make four films together.  Next year, Viacom will rename its Spike network The Paramount Network, which will consist mainly of scripted content. Meanwhile, MTV will focus more on unscripted shows, music and live events.  In the first quarter ended Dec. 31, net income attributable to Viacom fell to $396 million, or $1 per share, from $449 million, or $1.13 per share, a year earlier.  Excluding special items, the company earned $1.04 per share, beating the analysts' average estimate of 84 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Revenue rose 5.4 percent to $3.32 billion. Analysts had expected $3.18 billion.  U.S. ad sales fell 3 percent, in line with industry expectations.

The maker of Winston, Gauloises and other cigarette brands said revenue and earnings per share were expected to be up strongly for the six months ending March 31, driven by a 13 to 14 percentage point benefit from currency translation. However, at constant currency rates, Imperial said it expected lower revenue and profit in the first half, hurt by the phasing in of a 300 million pound investment plan and a deterioration in industry sales volumes, as previously guided. Jefferies analysts said it would have been a big shock if Imperial had not stood by its forecast, given that it had already called for a particularly weak period, with organic earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) down by a high single-digit rate. To miss this would have raised serious questions, they said, adding that Imperial's current share price does not factor in the success of its new strategy and investment. Imperial said early results of its investment programme were encouraging with improved market share trends in many markets. We also see an increasing probability of a take-out over the next 12 months, Jefferies said. Imperial has long been seen as a target, particularly for Japan Tobacco International. British American Tobacco's recent deal to take over Reynolds American in the United States has reignited speculation about further industry consolidation.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/europe-migrants-refugees-retailers-idUSL8N1CT0LO","Fashion brands ignore endemic abuse of Syrian refugees in Turkey - watchdog","","October 24, 2016 /  11:01 PM / 9 months ago","","LONDON, Oct 25 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Big fashion brands are failing to protect Syrian refugees from endemic abuse in Turkish clothing factories supplying European retailers, a monitoring group said on Tuesday. Child labour, pitiful pay and dangerous conditions are among the risks facing undocumented Syrian refugees working in Turkey's garment industry, according to the Business and Human Rights Resource Centre. The London-based charity surveyed 38 major brands with Turkish factories in their supply chains on steps they are taking to protect vulnerable refugee workers from exploitation. A handful of leading brands, like NEXT and New Look, demonstrate it is a moral imperative, and commercially viable, to treat refugees with respect, Phil Bloomer, the watchdog's executive director, said in a statement. The great majority of brands are doing too little. They should learn rapidly from these leaders to outlaw abuse of refugees in their supply chains, and insist their suppliers provide decent work for all their workers. Almost 3 million refugees - more than half aged under 18 - have fled to Turkey to escape war in Syria. Many work illegally in Turkey's garment industry, which supplies $17 billion in clothing and shoes a year, mostly to Europe, especially Germany. A Reuters investigation this year found evidence of Syrian refugee children in Turkey working in clothes factories in illegal conditions. Turkey bans children under 15 from working. A BBC Panorama investigation broadcast on Monday found that Syrian refugee children had been working in factories making clothes for British high street retailer Marks & Spencer (M&S;) and online store ASOS. An M&S; spokesperson told Reuters before the BBC report aired: We had previously found no evidence of Syrian workers employed in factories that supply us, so we were very disappointed by these findings, which are extremely serious and are unacceptable to M&S.; An ASOS spokeswoman declined to comment. The Business and Human Rights Resource Centre said many brands justified inaction on labour exploitation by denying the existence of refugees of any age in their supply chains. In its survey, drawn up with trade unions and rights advocates, only nine brands reported that they had found unregistered Syrian refugees on factory floors. Those brands were ASOS, C&A;, H&M;, KiK, LC Waikiki, Primark, New Look, NEXT and Otto Group. Until this year, Syrians were not entitled to work permits, so many refugees worked informally. Turkey started to issue permits in January, but the Business and Human Rights Resource Centre said the vast majority of Syrian refugees continue to work without legal protections, making them vulnerable to abuse. It said ASOS, C&A;, Esprit, GAP, Inditex, LC Waikiki, Mothercare, New Look, Otto Group, Primark, Tesco, Tchibo and White Stuff all now expect suppliers to support unregistered refugees to get work permits. This is a positive shift given many brands previously cited a zero tolerance policy towards unregistered refugees working in factories, leading to their dismissal - the worst outcome for their welfare, the charity said in a report. It praised NEXT, New Look and Mothercare for having detailed plans for protecting refugees and for paying a minimum wage even when Syrians are employed without work permits. The monitoring group criticised standard methods used to make sure supply chains are free from labour exploitation, in which brands announce in advance audits of so-called first-tier suppliers. Rights groups say a lot of abuse occurs at the murkier ends of supply chains when suppliers subcontract production from third-party factories that are much harder to keep track of. The Business and Human Rights Resource Centre noted that Adidas, C&A;, Debenhams, LC Waikiki, Puma, Inditex, ASOS, H&M; and NEXT audited sub-contractors below the first tier. But it said much more needed to be done. The survey showed a minority of brands were taking collective action on exploitation in Turkey through the Ethical Trading Initiative, an alliance of trade unions, firms and charities promoting workers' rights, the group said. Disappointingly, six brands did not respond to the (survey) questions - Gerry Weber, Lidl, Mexx, New Yorker, River Island and Sainsbury's, it added in its report. Nobody was immediately available for comment at New Yorker, Mexx or Lidl. A River Island spokeswoman declined to comment. A Sainsbury's spokesperson told Thomson Reuters Foundation: We expect our suppliers, both in the UK and abroad, to follow our Code of Conduct for Ethical Trade, which incorporates the Base Code of the Ethical Trading Initiative. A spokeswoman for Gerry Weber said in an email: We have raised awareness with our suppliers for the issue and are furthermore on site with our own staff. Additionally we realise audits with independent third parties. Arcadia, Burberry, s.Oliver, SuperGroup, VF Corp and Walmart only provided short statements in response to the survey, the Business and Human Rights Resource Centre said.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/volkswagen-results-idUSL8N1I51FP","VW brand profit soars as cost cuts start to pay off","","May 3, 2017 /  7:16 AM / 3 months ago","","BERLIN (Reuters) - Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) said profit at its troubled core division soared in the first three months of the year, a sign that long-overdue cost cuts are having an impact as the carmaker seeks to move beyond its diesel emissions crisis. VW, Europe's biggest carmaker, is aiming to beat rivals for profitability rather than chasing sales volumes through aggressive pricing as it invests billions of euros in electric cars, new mobility services and self-drive technology. First-quarter operating profit at VW's largest division surged to 869 million euros ($948.9 million) from 73 million a year earlier, the carmaker said on Wednesday, even as its sales slipped 1.3 percent to 1.44 million vehicles. Investors have said a turnaround at the VW brand, which has long been saddled with high fixed and R&D; costs, is key to turning the German giant into a more attractive business. Despite the damage to its reputation from the dieselgate scandal, the VW group last year eclipsed Toyota (7203.T) as the world's biggest selling carmaker. It is facing cash outflows in the double-digit billion-euro range this year to pay for costs of the emissions cheating, CFO Frank Witter said. The quarterly profit gain reflects VW's improving operating performance and will help the carmaker cushion the financial blow from the scandal. VW has to date set aside 22.6 billion euros to cover the costs of dieselgate including fines and compensation payouts. Structural changes since the scandal broke in Sept. 2015 include streamlining vehicle development, cutting material costs by reducing complexity in parts, dropping unprofitable models and shifting more power to brands and regions to respond more quickly to market needs. Our efforts to improve efficiency and productivity across all areas of the company are also paying off, Chief Executive Matthias Mueller said. A man uses phone under a Volkswagen logo at the Shanghai Auto Show, in Shanghai, China April 20, 2017.Aly SongWitter backed that up by saying that the quarterly earnings yielded the first tangible results of cost savings. New Models Analysts hope improvements will be sustained as VW renews core models such as the Polo subcompact and Touareg SUV and implements a hard-fought turnaround plan with its unions. I can see all sorts of reasons suggesting that profit dynamics will stay high, said Bankhaus Metzler analyst Juergen Pieper who has a Buy recommendation on the stock. The operating margin at VW's core brand jumped to 4.6 percent in the January-to-March period from 0.3 percent a year ago, still lagging French rivals PSA Peugeot Citroen (PEUP.PA) and Renault (RENA.PA) but nearing its long-term 2025 target of 6 percent. Group operating profit jumped 40 percent to 4.37 billion euros in the three months to the end of March, one of the carmaker's highest-ever quarterly results, even as vehicle sales at the 12-brand group declined. Shares were trading down 1 percent at 143 euros as of 0939 GMT as VW stuck to its outlook despite the robust quarterly showing. The Wolfsburg-based group expects the 2017 return on sales to come in between 6 and 7 percent, after reaching 6.7 percent in 2016, and group revenue to exceed last year's record 217 billion euros by as much as 4 percent. Quarterly profit at luxury division Audi slipped to 1.2 billion euros from 1.3 billion euros a year earlier as VW's biggest earnings contributor grapples with falling sales in the core Chinese market while pushing new models and technologies.

Chief Executive John Martin said Wolseley, which started life in 1887 manufacturing machine tools and was involved in early motor car production, would keep its main market listing in London where it is a constituent of the FTSE 100 index. The renaming of the parent company, subject to investor approval, alongside news that Wolseley will switch to reporting results in dollars reflects its focus on U.S. growth as Britain and continental Europe remains challenging. We have decided to align the group's name with our most significant brand in our largest market, Martin said. We will continue to use the Wolseley name in the UK and Canada where it has strong local recognition, he added. Wolseley's shares gained over 8 percent to their highest since 2007 after the company said trading profit rose 25 percent to 515 million pounds ($646 million) in the six months to the end of January. Martin said Wolseley would make more of its group profit in the United States over the next five years, as continuing growth in the residential and commercial markets would push the company to hire more people and buy more assets there. I think we'll become more American over the short term, Martin said. Over the second quarter, U.S. like-for-like revenue growth accelerated to 6.7 percent year-on-year, the strongest percentage growth of all of Wolseley's regions. The Nordic region accounts for only 3 percent of trading profit and the company said there were few synergies with the rest of its business.  Martin said the company would negotiate with vendors in the UK to offset an expected 3-4 percent increase in its cost of goods sold later this year.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/yum-brands-results-idUSL4N1FU406","Yum Brands profit tops expectations as KFC, Taco Bell deliver","","February 9, 2017 /  12:17 PM / in 6 months","","(Reuters) - Yum Brands Inc (YUM.N) reported a better-than-expected rise in quarterly profit on Thursday, helped by refranchising efforts and strong sales at its KFC and Taco Bell restaurants. The company's shares rose as much as 2.1 percent to $67.98, its highest in more than a year. Same-store sales rose 3 percent at KFC and Taco Bell in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, helped in part by new items such as the $1 Double Stacked Tacos. Operating profit at Yum's three chains, which also includes Pizza Hut, grew in the double digits, helping the company top its own growth forecast. Helped by the refranchising of 232 stores in the quarter, core operating profit rose 13 percent, ahead of the 10 percent Yum had forecast in October. KFC and Taco Bell have gotten off to a good start this year, Chief Executive Greg Creed said on a call with analysts and forecast a high single-digit percentage rise in Yum's underlying operating profit.  The company expects a 2-3 percent rise in same-store sales for the full year. Pizza Hut Doesn't Deliver   In contrast to KFC and Taco Bell, Pizza Hut sales at established restaurants fell 2 percent in the quarter. This contributed to a modest 1 percent rise in same-store sales, missing analysts' average estimate of a 2.1 percent rise, according to Consensus Metrix.   The quarter's results (at Pizza Hut) disappointed and are not acceptable, Creed said. The lack of a single ordering system as well as Pizza Hut's reputation of being a sit-down restaurant rather than a delivery chain hurt sales. To turnaround the business, Yum has hired outside experts to address issues, such as delivery times, digital efforts and layouts of the restaurants, which have larger dining areas than those focused on delivery. Yum said in October it would reduce annual capital expenditure to about $100 million in 2019 from about $500 million in 2015 and planned to reduce general and administrative expenses by a cumulative $300 million by fiscal 2019.     Income from continuing operations fell to $285 million in the quarter from $290 million a year earlier. Earnings per share from continuing operations rose to 76 cents per share from 66 cents in the year-ago period. Excluding items, Yum earned 79 cents per share, topping analysts' expectations by 5 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Total revenue rose 2 percent to $2.02 billion, marginally below the average analyst estimate of $2.09 billion. The latest-quarter results are Yum's first since spinning off its China business in November. Reporting by Richa Naidu in Bengaluru; Edited by Martina D'Couto"
"https://www.reuters.com/article/india-garments-labour-idUSL4N1K52A3","Fashion brands bring hand-washing but little else to India's garment workers, say critics","","July 20, 2017 /  6:08 AM / in 8 days","","CHENNAI, India (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The agenda was to improve the conditions for tens of thousands of India's women garment workers who stitch everything from jeans to jackets for the world's leading fashion brands. But the strategy was flawed, say critics.  The Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI) aimed to gain access to often highly restricted factories in the southern textile center of Tamil Nadu with a hygiene awareness program and use that as a platform for promoting workers' rights. Five years and 485,000 pounds ($630,000) later, the ETI, which brings together labels like H&M;, GAP and Burberry with unions, factory owners and civil society groups, has done little more than teach workers hand washing, campaigners say. Trade unions and labor rights charities, some of them partners in the initiative, say its shortcomings show big stores are merely paying lip service to the rights of garment workers. It is like image management. Brands are using the ETI platform to safeguard themselves, said Nambi Chelliah of non-profit group the Centre for Social Education and Development that was part of the ETI's initial meetings. Workers' representatives say employees in textile mills and factories have not benefited, with fair wages, contracts and a workplace free of abuse still elusive for most. ETI has not been able to leverage any benefits for the workers from either the brands or the factories, both of whom are members of the alliance, said a trade union official who requested anonymity. The ETI denies the claims and says progress has been made in Tamil Nadu through community programs and peer groups at factories and mills that discuss rights beyond hygiene. This is the only large-scale initiative that is working within mills to address such issues and to build the trust of all concerned. We are showing such programs can work to the benefit of all, Alok Singh, ETI's South Asia head, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Suspicion While the ETI has been around since 1998 working on issues like child labor and workers' rights in countries including South Africa, Thailand and Peru, it began focusing on India's textile workers in Tamil Nadu in 2012. The region, often dubbed the Textile Valley of India - where 400,000 women work in around 2,000 spinning mills and factories - supplies to various European and American retailers. ETI officials said they knew addressing exploitation of textile workers - from long hours and little freedom of movement to low pay and poor healthcare - was not going to be easy.  The $40 billion textile and garment sector is a pillar of India's economy and moves aimed at improving workers' rights are often viewed with suspicion by authorities, politicians and management, who see it as a threat to the thriving industry. We...need to note that when the program started there was no appetite for transparency among the mills themselves, said Singh. The Nalam - meaning well-being in Tamil - program was ostensibly to teach women and adolescent girls workers about hygiene and sanitation and has been rolled out in more than 30 mills and factories. Armed with pamphlets, ETI staff infiltrated high-walled compounds where employees live and work, and went about asking women how often they brush their teeth, when they wash their hands and how much they spend on sanitary towels. Posters demonstrating the correct way to wash hands were put up near restrooms and adolescent girls were told to eat more greens and fruit. They were also taught how to deal with menstrual cramps with diet and medication. The initiative has contributed to an attitudinal shift within mill managers, who have seen the benefits of treating workers better, and allowing workers to be educated on their rights, Singh said. Failures But others have a different perspective. Freedom of association is in (the ETI's) code, so is assuring fair wages and making sure there is no exploitation. How will workers eat more fruits if they can't afford to buy it? said the trade union member who did not want to be named. Activists and labor rights charities say the ETI has failed to get brands to map and disclose information on supply chains - from the cotton picked in the fields to the buttons stitched on the garments - which is key to ending exploitation of workers. If they were more transparent about their supply chains, it would make it possible for global advocacy organizations to increase public pressure on companies to take action to ensure respect for labor rights, said Tim Connor, lecturer at Newcastle Law School in Australia and co-author of a 2016 report on the ETI's effectiveness. But the ETI's Singh said transparency would increase as the initiative progressed. As we move forward to the next five years, we expect that we will have access to clearer supply chain information from participating brands, he said.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/imperial-brands-jv-china-idUSL5N1F13SG","UK's Imperial Brands teams up in joint venture with China Tobacco","","January 11, 2017 /  5:47 PM / 7 months ago","","(Reuters) - Britain's Imperial Brands (IMB.L) has formed a joint venture with state-owned China National Tobacco (CNTC) in a move to gain a foothold in the world's largest cigarette market. The joint venture announced on Wednesday could boost Imperial's long-term earnings potential and competitive position in the growing e-cigarette market and increase the chances of the world's fourth-biggest tobacco company attracting takeover interest as the industry consolidates, according to analysts.  Big tobacco companies are facing shrinking markets due to health concerns and are all investing heavily in developing less harmful alternatives to smoking tobacco. Imperial's shares closed up 1 percent at 3,626.5 pence in London. We think today's news could make a bid more likely, said Jefferies analysts, citing speculation that Imperial could be swept up in a wave of consolidation brought on by British American Tobacco's (BATS.L) $47 billion bid for Reynolds American RAI.N. The joint venture, Global Horizon Ventures Limited (GHVL), will be based in Hong Kong and link Imperial with CNTC subsidiary Yunnan Tobacco, which controls over one-fifth of the Chinese market.  Imperial said the joint venture will expand Imperial's West and Davidoff brands in China, and Yunnan's Jade and Horizon brands internationally.  Further tobacco and next-generation product launches, as well as potential M&A; opportunities, will also be evaluated by GHVL in due course, it said in a statement.   China is by far the world's largest tobacco market, selling about 2.5 trillion cigarettes a year, or about one in every third cigarette smoked.  The market is dominated by state-owned monopoly CNTC, which struck partnerships with Marlboro maker Philip Morris International (PM.N) in 2005 and British American in 2013. A partnership with China Tobacco could give Imperial more capital and scale with which to expand in the growing market for cigarette alternatives. So far it has stuck to e-cigarettes, which heat nicotine-laced liquid into vapor, unlike Philip Morris and BAT, which also have tobacco-heating devices they say may be more appealing to smokers who can't quit. A successful initial partnership could pave the way for an all-out takeover bid down the road, Jefferies analysts said, noting it also makes Imperial more attractive to Japan Tobacco (2914.T), long seen as a likely suitor. Imperial was advised by Vermilion Partners and Allen & Overy on the transaction, whose financial terms were not disclosed. BAT is in talks with U.S. peer Reynolds about buying the 58 percent of the company it does not already own. Reynolds' next-generation technology is seen as a key driver for that move, as smoking declines in Western markets due to growing health consciousness.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-migrants-refugees-retailers-idUSKCN12O2RT","Fashion brands ignore 'endemic' abuse of Syrian refugees in Turkey: watchdog","","October 24, 2016 /  11:59 PM / 9 months ago","","LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Big fashion brands are failing to protect Syrian refugees from endemic abuse in Turkish clothing factories supplying European retailers, a monitoring group said on Tuesday. Child labor, pitiful pay and dangerous conditions are among the risks facing undocumented Syrian refugees working in Turkey's garment industry, according to the Business and Human Rights Resource Centre. The London-based charity surveyed 38 major brands with Turkish factories in their supply chains on steps they are taking to protect vulnerable refugee workers from exploitation. A handful of leading brands, like NEXT and New Look, demonstrate it is a moral imperative, and commercially viable, to treat refugees with respect, Phil Bloomer, the watchdog's executive director, said in a statement. The great majority of brands are doing too little. They should learn rapidly from these leaders to outlaw abuse of refugees in their supply chains, and insist their suppliers provide decent work for all their workers. Almost 3 million refugees - more than half aged under 18 - have fled to Turkey to escape war in Syria. Many work illegally in Turkey's garment industry, which supplies $17 billion in clothing and shoes a year, mostly to Europe, especially Germany. A Reuters investigation this year found evidence of Syrian refugee children in Turkey working in clothes factories in illegal conditions. Turkey bans children under 15 from working. A BBC Panorama investigation broadcast on Monday found that Syrian refugee children had been working in factories making clothes for British high street retailer Marks & Spencer (M&S;) and online store ASOS. An M&S; spokesperson told Reuters before the BBC report aired: We had previously found no evidence of Syrian workers employed in factories that supply us, so we were very disappointed by these findings, which are extremely serious and are unacceptable to M&S.; ASOS Chief Executive Officer Nick Beighton said in a statement: The issues Panorama raises aren't with our approved factories, who we audit. It's with unapproved outsourcing to factories we don't know about. This will continue to be a problem until we know where every garment is made and however difficult, that's what ultimately we’ve got to achieve. Work Permits The Business and Human Rights Resource Centre said many brands justified inaction on labor exploitation by denying the existence of refugees of any age in their supply chains. In its survey, drawn up with trade unions and rights advocates, only nine brands reported that they had found unregistered Syrian refugees on factory floors. Those brands were ASOS, C&A;, H&M;, KiK, LC Waikiki, Primark, New Look, NEXT and Otto Group. Until this year, Syrians were not entitled to work permits, so many refugees worked informally. Turkey started to issue permits in January, but the Business and Human Rights Resource Centre said the vast majority of Syrian refugees continue to work without legal protections, making them vulnerable to abuse. It said ASOS, C&A;, Esprit, GAP, Inditex, LC Waikiki, Mothercare, New Look, Otto Group, Primark, Tesco, Tchibo and White Stuff all now expect suppliers to support unregistered refugees to get work permits. This is a positive shift given many brands previously cited a zero tolerance policy towards unregistered refugees working in factories, leading to their dismissal - the worst outcome for their welfare, the charity said in a report. It praised NEXT, New Look and Mothercare for having detailed plans for protecting refugees and for paying a minimum wage even when Syrians are employed without work permits. The monitoring group criticized standard methods used to make sure supply chains are free from labor exploitation, in which brands announce in advance audits of so-called first-tier suppliers. Rights groups say a lot of abuse occurs at the murkier ends of supply chains when suppliers subcontract production from third-party factories that are much harder to keep track of. The Business and Human Rights Resource Centre noted that Adidas, C&A;, Debenhams, LC Waikiki, Puma, Inditex, ASOS, H&M; and NEXT audited sub-contractors below the first tier. But it said much more needed to be done.         The survey showed a minority of brands were taking collective action on exploitation in Turkey through the Ethical Trading Initiative, an alliance of trade unions, firms and charities promoting workers' rights, the group said. Disappointingly, six brands did not respond to the (survey) questions - Gerry Weber, Lidl, Mexx, New Yorker, River Island and Sainsbury's, it added in its report. Nobody was immediately available for comment at New Yorker, Mexx or Lidl. A River Island spokeswoman declined to comment. A Sainsbury's spokesperson told Thomson Reuters Foundation: We expect our suppliers, both in the UK and abroad, to follow our Code of Conduct for Ethical Trade, which incorporates the Base Code of the Ethical Trading Initiative. A spokeswoman for Gerry Weber said in an email: We have raised awareness with our suppliers for the issue and are furthermore on site with our own staff. Additionally we realize audits with independent third parties. Arcadia, Burberry, s.Oliver, SuperGroup, VF Corp and Walmart only provided short statements in response to the survey, the Business and Human Rights Resource Centre said.

Gucci, in double digit sales growth territory for the first time since 2012, accounts for more than 60 percent of Kering's operating profit. Analysts had expected its third-quarter sales growth to reach around 10 percent. Under the leadership of designer Alessandro Michele and chief executive Marco Bizzarri, the brand has been rolling out a new geek chic look, revamping its stores and offering leather bags with painted insects and animals that have proven popular.   Asked if the turnaround was sustainable, Kering Finance Director Jean-Marc Duplaix said: We have a plan for Gucci and we are not at the end of the plan yet.  He predicted more gains from the brand's new store concepts, product ranges and client loyalty programmes.  Yves Saint Laurent also surprised with a 33.9 percent jump in comparable third-quarter sales even though the French fashion brand parted ways with its star designer Hedi Slimane, replaced in April by Anthony Vaccarello.  Kering posted one of the strongest beats in memory in the luxury sector, with Gucci and Saint Laurent significantly ahead of expectations, Exane BNP Paribas analyst Luca Solca said.  Gucci is cashing in on a brilliant self-help programme, which has brought the brand back on the map.  But the group said its Italian tailor Brioni's sales were still declining. Brioni's creative director Justin O'Shea left after seven months in the job, having overseen an unexpected gothic makeover of the brand. Kering has been through an intensive reshuffle in the past few months. In October alone, it appointed new chief executives for Balenciaga, Christopher Kane and Bottega Veneta. Duplaix said Bottega Veneta's sales decline was mainly due to a drop in Chinese tourist spending in Japan and Europe, a pruning of its wholesale and retail network and fewer discounts.   It will take time and it will require investments, Duplaix said about the brand's turnaround, adding that it could possibly return to growth in 2017 but its ascent would be very progressive. Duplaix said Kering's watch trading remained challenging adding that he did not think there was a big difference between us and the market.  Overall, Kering's sales rose 10.5 percent while its Puma sports brand grew 10.8 percent during the period under review.

Beijing is trying to modernize its sprawling farm sector, the world's largest, and rebalance output away from basic grains towards foods such as meat, dairy and other value-added products increasingly in demand from its urbanizing population. But the policy document published late on Sunday suggested that local producers in the world's second-largest economy are struggling to compete with imports because of high production costs and inventory. Known as the number one document, the statement sets out Beijing's priorities in rural policy for the year. It reiterated earlier plans to modify the crop structure, encouraging farmers to grow less grain corn and more soybeans, as well as more corn silage and alfalfa for livestock. The reforms are designed to improve the quality of agricultural supply, to be market-oriented, optimize the supply structure, and keep up with changing consumer demand, Tang Renjian, deputy head of the Communist Party's rural policy group, told reporters at a briefing on Monday. But Tang said changes to the supply structure would depend on whether farmers could continue to increase their incomes.  Analysts said the document underlined the challenge facing the government as it seeks to boost farmers' incomes and ensure food supply for China's giant population while preventing over-production of grains as the pace of demand growth slows.

The document is significant, but effective implementation is the key, said Ma Wenfeng, analyst at Beijing Orient Agri-business Consultant Co Ltd. Farmers' incomes have fallen significantly in the past few years, the whole society is getting poorer and demand and consumption are down sharply. The government said it plans to promote new channels of demand for corn to help digest excess stocks, built up after years of buying from farmers to support their income.

Meanwhile it will promote local and specialty products and geographical indications as well as organic products, with favorable taxes for start-ups in rural areas and innovation centers to support high quality produce. It will also encourage exports, and support companies to set up overseas production bases, particularly in countries that are part of its Silk Road initiative. Beijing will also make use of anti-dumping and other measures to protect its producers, said the document.  It placed significant emphasis on making agriculture more environmentally sustainable, promoting major water-saving programs through technology such as drip irrigation, tackling overuse of pesticides and strict standards on handling manure as well as use of more technology such as large-scale biogas digesters. Reforms must however ensure that grain production capacity is not reduced, the income of farmers is not reversed and rural stability is not a problem, added the document.

The talks come after Reuters reported on Oct. 3 that Bai was exploring a sale, sending Dr Pepper Snapple shares lower on concerns that its distribution of Bai would be jeopardized if sold to a rival such as Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) and PepsiCo Inc (PEP.N). Dr Pepper Snapple is just one of the companies that the antioxidant drink brand is talking to ahead of bids being submitted in an auction for the company, and there is no certainty it will prevail with its bid, the people said. Dr Pepper Snapple may be willing to value Bai at more than $1.5 billion, one of the people said.  The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Dr Pepper Snapple declined to comment. Bai did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Bai, which means pure in Mandarin Chinese, sweetens its drinks with plant-based ingredients and infuses them with antioxidants from coffee fruit and white tea. It was founded in 2009 by entrepreneur Ben Weiss, who still owns a majority of the company.  Dr Pepper Snapple has not made a major acquisition since being spun out of Britain's confectionary company Cadbury Schweppes in 2008, but is now reconsidering its stance as the soft drinks industry grapples with increasingly health-conscious consumers.  Dr Pepper Snapple has owned a minority stake in Princeton, New Jersey-based Bai since last year. It is one of Dr Pepper Snapple's Allied Brands, which are healthy drink companies that it distributes through its network.  The young companies benefit from Dr Pepper Snapple's reach, while the Plano, Texas based-soda company benefits from a boost to its distribution network. Other Allied Brands of Dr Pepper Snapple include Fiji Water and Vita Coco.  Unlike some of its big soda competitors, Dr Pepper Snapple has traditionally not viewed its small equity investments as a path to an outright acquisition.  In 2007, one of Dr Pepper Snapple's minority investments, Vitaminwater-maker Glaceau, was sold to Coca-Cola for $4.1 billion. Dr. Pepper Snapple, however, has expressed concerns over how expensive such deals can be. Some of these (valuation) multiples out there are ridiculous. I love these young entrepreneurs, but they all want to have the next Glaceau deal, Dr. Pepper Snapple CEO Larry Young said in 2014. Reporting by Lauren Hirsch in New York; editing by Diane Craft"

The investigation, due to be broadcast on Monday evening, found Leicester-based Fashion Square Ltd and United Creations Ltd, where the clothes were made, paid their employees between 3 pounds ($3.74) and 3.5 pounds ($4.36) per hour. The hourly rate for the national living wage in Britain is 7.20 pounds ($8.97) for workers 25 years and older. A Channel 4 reporter who was employed by Fashion Square to label clothes for River Island for 3 pounds per hour, recorded one of the bosses saying competition with Asian exporters was the reason the company wasn't paying the minimum wage.     We don't get paid much for our clothes, and we need to compete with China and Bangladesh, Channel 4's Dispatches program quoted the man as saying. If we pay everyone 10 pounds or 6 pounds then we will make a loss. Fashion Square and United Creations denied to the program makers that anyone at their factories was paid below the legal minimum wage. River Island told Channel 4 it removed Fashion Square from their suppliers' list in February 2016 following two failed audits. The reporter also had a 3.50 pound per hour job at another Leicester-based factory which -- as a subcontractor -- was producing clothes for New Look, said Channel 4.  A New Look spokesperson told the Thomson Reuters Foundation the company reduced the number of U.K. suppliers by 80 percent since 2011 in an effort to address potential weaknesses in the supply chain. The company said it terminated their relationship with the company that subcontracted the orders. Channel 4 said the reporter was paid 3.25 pounds ($4.05) per hour by United Creations, Ltd., a factory making clothes for Boohoo and Missguided. Boohoo told Channel 4 it was in talks with United Creations to make sure workers were paid at least the minimum wage, while Missguided said it launched an internal investigation into the allegations.

Chief Executive Officer Nigel Travis told Reuters that some franchisees are putting new store plans on hold until after the Nov. 8 election, when the political landscape is more certain. Franchisees are uncertain which direction everything is going in terms of government, he said. Everyone is sick to death of the election ... Once we know the direction we're going in, they'll be able to deal with it and growth will resume, he added.       U.S. restaurants also are battling intense competition from upstart chains and meal-kit sellers, in addition to getting battered by falling grocery prices, which are encouraging more people to eat at home.  Franchisees could face problem no matter whether Republican Donald Trump or Democrat Hillary Clinton takes the White House. There is growing speculation that Trump's sinking poll numbers could influence elections on the federal and state level, which could affect tax, healthcare and minimum wage policies. If local elections are hit, policies covering construction and business regulation could shift. Clinton, among other things, has championed raising the minimum wage as well as paid family and medical leave. Trump takes a more pro-business stance with promises to lower taxes and slash regulations, but his erratic behavior during the campaign has raised concerns about how he would govern. Survey results from the National Federation of Independent Business found that uncertainty among small business owners is at a 42-year high. Political uncertainty is big. This is definitely not just restaurants, said Bill Dunkelberg, chief economist for NFIB, which counts 325,000 small business owners as member.  Visits to Dunkin' Donuts and Baskin-Robbins were down in the latest quarter. Sales of iced coffee and breakfast sandwiches helped overcome that weakness at U.S. Dunkin' Donuts outlets, where sales at established restaurants rose a better-than-expected 2 percent in the third quarter, according to results released on Thursday.  That was not the case at U.S. Baskin-Robbins ice cream shops, which reported a surprise 0.9 percent drop in same-store sales for the quarter.    Net income attributable to Dunkin' Brands rose to $52.7 million, or 57 cents per share, in the quarter from $46.2 million, or 48 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, the company earned 60 cents per share. Dunkin' said total sales fell 1.3 percent to $207.1 million,  due to the sale of company-operated stores to franchisees. Analysts had expected total sales of $214.4 million and earnings per share of 59 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Volkswagen Group denies that the kind of internal rivalry that it encouraged at the Le Mans 24 hour race is getting out of hand in the boardroom. But senior executives told Reuters that in-house conflict, particularly between VW and its premium brands, is intensifying over which factories will develop next generation cars while the German group has to cut costs elsewhere to pay for cleaning up its emissions cheating scandal. There is a cut-throat battle for resources. Every brand with engine-manufacturing capacity now wants a leadership role when it comes to electric motors, battery packs and battery-cell expertise, an executive at one of the VW divisions, who declined to be named, said. Since returning to top-line racing three years ago, Porsche has beaten Audi to the world championship for sportscars and at Le Mans for the past two seasons. Porsche will again seek to defend the titles in 2017 with its ultra-sophisticated petrol hybrids. But Audi, whose hybrid racers showcased the group's troubled diesel technology, has pulled out after winning the French race 13 times. In the broader competition, Porsche also appears in the ascendant as Audi - which since the 1990s has achieved rapid sales growth to rival Mercedes-Benz and BMW - now struggles with the Dieselgate fallout and a series of negative press leaks. Jobs are at stake as the group - whose brands also include Skoda, SEAT, Bugatti, Bentley and Lamborghini - moves to new technology and faces up to Dieselgate penalties and lawsuits which analysts say could cost as much as 30 billion euros ($32 billion). Because electric cars are far less complex to assemble than traditional combustion engine vehicles, manufacturers may not be able to guarantee the same level of employment in future - a thorny issue in an industry dominated by a workforce with multi-year collective wage agreements. Volkswagen and its unions agreed to cut 30,000 jobs at the core VW brand in exchange for a commitment to avoid forced redundancies in Germany until 2025. The executives at Audi, VW and Porsche, who all declined to be named, said conflict between group brands is not new and healthy internal competition can push them to greater technical and commercial achievements. However, some critics said the scramble has become more intense partly because the company last year lost a powerful central figure who controlled the balance of power between the brands, their managers and worker representatives. That balance is now being redefined, pitting Volkswagen, one of the group's least profitable mass market brands, against its highly profitable siblings Porsche and Audi. Volkswagen dismissed this analysis, and denied that an unhealthy power struggle was underway at all. This is pure speculation which lacks any kind of foundation and is something which we emphatically reject, spokesman Eric Felber said. Group chief executive Matthias Mueller has previously worked as Audi's head of product management and Porsche boss. But since getting the top job after the scandal erupted last year, he has yet to build the level of power once enjoyed by former chairman Ferdinand Piech, whose extended family controls the firm. Piech, who spent years cultivating ties to VW's powerful labor leaders, was an engineering genius who inspired fierce loyalty from staff because of his willingness to take risks. He masterminded the Porsche 917 racer, which starred alongside Steve McQueen in the 1971 movie Le Mans, as well as the legendary Audi Quattro rally car of the 1980s.

In May, brand owner and franchiser Inter IKEA, in connection with a spin-off of its investment operations, created a new holding firm chaired by IKEA veteran Anders Dahlvig, replacing the existing holding firm, which was chaired by Mathias for the last three years. Mathias is now a board member of the new holding firm, Inter IKEA Holding. IKEA confirmed the move, which was initially reported by Swedish daily Dagens Industri on Monday. Mathias has said he fully supports the appointments, Inter IKEA spokeswoman Josefin Thorell said in an email on Tuesday. He is pleased Anders Dahlvig and Hans Gydell, who both have solid IKEA experience, have accepted the roles as chairman for respective group. Gydell is the chairman of a new separate holding firm for the spun-off investment operations. Ingvar, 90, who resigned as CEO in 1986, gave up formal power over IKEA as late as 2013 when he resigned from and renounced the right to appoint members to the supervisory council of the Interogo Foundation which owns Inter IKEA. Many had expected his three sons to continue his firm grip on the company but they no longer have operational roles at IKEA, and the Kamprad family is in a minority on the boards of the foundations that control Inter IKEA and IKEA group. IKEA Group owns most IKEA stores worldwide. Middle brother Jonas is on the board of IKEA Group, while eldest brother Peter chairs the independent, family-owned Ikano Group, a mainly financial services group. In August, Inter IKEA bought range, supply and production subsidiaries from IKEA Group in a deal that has left Inter IKEA with even tighter control over strategy, and IKEA Group more streamlined on the retail business.

The company, which is spinning off its China division at the end of the month, now plans to expand its share buyback plan to $13.5 billion, including dividends. It already has bought back about $5.5 billion shares as part of a previously announced $6.2 billion capital return program that has reduced its share count by about 16 percent. Yum did not immediately have a breakdown on much of the extra returns would be from share repurchases and how much from dividends. Related CoverageYum China aims to triple restaurants as challenges loomExecutives say Yum Brands will be leaner and less exposed to the ups and downs of the restaurant business following the separation of Yum China and the sale of more company-owned restaurants to franchisees.  It's about delivering higher growth with lower risk, Yum Brands Chief Executive Officer Greg Creed told Reuters in a telephone interview. Yum said franchisees will own 93 percent of the nearly 36,000 Yum restaurants remaining in the company after the China unit is carved off. The combined company currently is 77 percent franchised, in part because Yum China owns most of its restaurants. The sign at a Pizza Hut location, which is owned by Yum Brands Inc, is pictured ahead of their company results in Pasadena, California U.S., July 11, 2016.Mario AnzuoniYum Brands aims to have at least 98 percent of its restaurants owned by franchisees by the end of 2018, which will lower costs and increase its dependence on more stable franchise and license fees.  Yum's China business will begin trading on Nov. 1 on the New York Stock Exchange with the ticker symbol YUMC. The new company, Yum China Holdings Inc, will become a licensee of Yum Brands in mainland China and will have exclusive rights there to KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell.  Yum China now accounts for 45 percent of Yum Brands' earnings, a contribution expected to fall to 14 percent after the spinoff, when Yum China will begin paying Yum Brands a license fee of 3 percent of restaurant system sales, Creed said. The company plans to reduce annual capital expenditures to about $100 million in 2019 from about $500 million in 2015 and cut general and administrative expenses by a cumulative $300 million by fiscal 2019. About half of that $300 million in new savings will come from shifting restaurant expenses to new franchisees, the remainder will come from job eliminations and tighter expense controls on things like travel, Creed said. Yum last week reported its first same-store sales drop in five quarters in China, blaming anti-U.S. protests after an international court rejected China's claim to historic rights in the South China Sea. Shares in Yum were up 1.1 percent at $88.31 after hitting a session high of $90.68. Up to Monday's close, the stock had risen about 20 percent since the start of the year.

The plans are part of a strategy announced on the opening of South Korean automaker's fourth Chinese factory, which will be followed by fifth plant next year. Hyundai and sister Kia Motors Corp, which together rank third in China sales, saw their combined market share fall to 8 percent this year, hitting their lowest since 2007 as domestic rivals won customers with cheaper sport utility vehicles (SUVs). To boost sales capability, Beijing Hyundai - a joint venture with domestic peer BAIC Motor Corp Ltd - replaced its head earlier in October as part of a reshuffle of China executives. Hyundai said its new plants will each have annual production capacity of 300,000 cars, raising total capacity in its biggest market by about half to 1.81 million cars. Including Kia's output, total capacity would be 2.7 million. We will accelerate our efforts to achieve a market share of more than 10 percent again with the (factory) opening, Hyundai said in a statement on Tuesday. China's passenger car market is projected to grow 1 percent in 2017 versus 10 percent this year, Hyundai Motor said, citing data from China's State Information Center (SIC). Tax breaks for small engine cars, which boosted 2016 sales, will expire at the end of December. Hyundai said its new plants will build models of varying sizes to compete with low-cost domestic rivals. It aims to sell a China-only SUV from as early as next year, with more SUV models planned. Reuters earlier this year reported that Hyundai and Kia plan to launch three low-cost SUVs in China from 2017. Not all SUVs will win - but the (makers) who localize the designs and features to Chinese tastes will be the winners, said James Chao, Asia-Pacific managing director at researcher IHS Automotive. He said SUVs will account for 40 percent of the passenger vehicle market by 2023, from 34 percent this year. Hyundai also said it aims to produce nine green vehicles - petrol-electric hybrid, plug-in hybrid, electric and fuel cell - in China by 2020, making up 10 percent of its sales in the country by that year. At present, green vehicles account for a fraction of Hyundai's China sales. China surpassed the United States last year to become the largest maker of electric cars following government subsidies aimed at curbing pollution.

Yum Brands' shares were up 1.2 percent at $88.45 before the bell on Tuesday.

Yum said it had bought back about $5.5 billion of shares as a part of its previously announced capital return program of $6.2 billion, reducing its share count by about 16 percent. The company also said it would reduce capital expenditure to about $100 million in 2019, from about $500 million in 2015.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/rbs-ringfence-idUSL8N1C60YR","RBS unveils brand changes, new structure in ring-fencing revamp","","September 30, 2016 /  6:31 AM / 10 months ago","","LONDON (Reuters) - Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L) is to separate its retail operations from its higher-risk businesses in a major overhaul to meet new ring-fencing rules in Britain, which also means the RBS brand will only be used in Scotland. Ring-fencing aims to avoid a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis, when banks' bad bets threatened ordinary depositors' cash, leading to big taxpayer-funded bailouts. The rules apply to all banks in Britain that have both retail and commercial or investment banking activities.  State-backed RBS said on Friday NatWest would become its main retail brand in England, Wales and western Europe, while its historic Royal Bank of Scotland name, which dates back to 1727, will be for Scotland only. The shake-up reflects RBS's latest effort to rebuild its reputation after the bank's reckless lending and a takeover spree on the eve of the financial crisis threatened to topple the UK financial system. Our proposed future structure under the ring-fencing legislation and our brand strategy are key elements of the bank we are becoming, Chief Executive Ross McEwan said in a statement. The future ring-fenced structure of the bank is not only designed to be in compliance with the new regulatory requirements and objectives but will better reflect who we are as a bank and what we stand for: a bank that is focused on its customers, he said. RBS's shares were down 1.8 percent at 173.9 pence at 0845 GMT amid a sell-off in banking shares across Europe. The logo of the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) is seen at an office building in Zurich March 27, 2015.Arnd Wiegmann/File PhotoNatWest has a better net promoter score - a measure of customer satisfaction - than RBS so it makes sense to use the brand with the better profile in England and Wales, Shore Capital analyst Gary Greenwood said. He said it would be harder to ditch the RBS name in Scotland where NatWest has never really been used. RBS, which is 73 percent owned by the British taxpayer, is the latest bank to announce how it plans to reform its business to comply with the ring-fencing changes, recommended by the Vickers Commission in 2011.  HSBC (HSBA.L) has outlined similar plans including the relocation of its UK business to Birmingham last year, while Barclays (BARC.L) has carved its business into two core divisions, including Barclays UK, to comply with the new rules. RBS said its new ring-fenced bank would be called NatWest Holdings, comprising its core NatWest, Royal Bank of Scotland, Coutts & Co, Ulster Bank Limited and Ulster Bank Ireland DAC brands.  The legal entity of its private bank, Adam & Company, will be renamed Royal Bank of Scotland Plc as part of the changes. Its Corporate and Institutional Banking business will be called NatWest Markets and will form the non ring-fenced bank, together with the bank's Channel Islands operations. The group holding company will remain Royal Bank of Scotland. Under the rules, banks' ring-fenced businesses, which will be funded and capitalized separately, must include UK retail banking and small business customers and most simple banking transactions.    Big global corporate customers and most investment banking activities must be held in a separate entity.     Editing by Jane Merriman"

Chinese automakers have invested billions in developing electric and petrol-electric hybrid vehicles at the direction of the government, which sees green cars as a way to leapfrog  global competitors more experienced in traditional petrol engines while also cutting heavy pollution. Five investors involved in the private placement of GAC Group A-shares are mainly controlled by the government in the southern metropolis of Guangzhou, Thomson Reuters' IFR reported on Tuesday. The automaker, like most domestic peers, is a state-owned enterprise. GAC Group said in an exchange filing that the proceeds would be used in 10 projects, with nearly a third of the funds to be spent on research and development of green energy cars and other technology. Other projects include factory expansion and improvement and developing a host of new models for its GAC Motor brand. The automaker's Shanghai-listed shares jumped 9.6 percent after resuming trading on Tuesday, closing the session up 6 percent. Trading had been halted on Oct. 18 pending the announcement. The newly issued shares account for roughly 10 percent of the automaker's outstanding stock.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/air-france-klm-strategy-idUSL8N1D4262","UPDATE 3-Air France-KLM seeks to fight back with cheaper, long-haul brand","","November 3, 2016 /  8:50 AM / 9 months ago","","* New unit to operate at lower costs, fleet of 10 long-haul jets * Group aims to grow long-haul capacity by 2-3 pct a year * Third-quarter results in line with expectations * Shares rise 5 percent   (Adds CEO quotes, background, updates shares) By Victoria Bryan and Cyril Altmeyer PARIS, Nov 3 (Reuters) - Air France-KLM will launch a new long-haul business with lower costs, the Franco-Dutch airline said on Thursday, aiming to regain market share from Gulf rivals and revive profits without further straining relations with staff. Like rival Lufthansa, Air France-KLM has been hit by the rapid growth of carriers such as Emirates and Turkish Airlines, which have used new planes and lower prices to lure passengers away from hubs in Europe and through Dubai and Istanbul instead. Air France-KLM has long been trying to cut costs at its Air France operations but has faced a series of strikes, notably over plans to expand low-cost arm Transavia across Europe. Changing tack, the company said Transavia would now focus on its home markets of France and the Netherlands. Meanwhile, the new long-haul business, set to have a fleet of 10 planes by 2020, will be staffed by pilots from Air France willing to move on a voluntary basis. Staff will be expected to work longer hours, and the company will aim to keep planes airborne for longer each day to cut costs. Air France-KLM said the new business, which is yet to be named, was not trying to be a budget brand. CEO Jean-Marc Janaillac said the group's higher ticket revenues - stemming from its hubs, alliances, market share and image - meant it did not need costs at the level of easyJet or Gulf carriers. But some analysts said the project, currently named Boost, was not bold enough, noting it would make up only a small fraction of a group which is aiming for a fleet of 435 planes, not including regional jets, by 2020. Plans at Air France-KLM look like change will still be slow and potentially thus too late, said RBC analyst Damian Brewer, arguing the company needed to go further to tackle its high debts and high unit costs. Brewer has a sector perform rating on the stock. Air France-KLM shares initially fell, but recovered to trade up 5 percent, helped by in-line quarterly earnings. Boost While rival IAG, whose boss Willie Walsh drove through deep cuts at Iberia and British Airways, reduced non-fuel unit costs by 2.4 percent in the first nine months of 2016 to 5.11 euro cents, Air France-KLM has cut its by just 0.9 percent to 6.08 cents. It predicts costs will come down by 1 percent this year. The group also slightly increased a longer-term target for cost cuts, saying it wanted to reduce unit costs by over 1.5 percent a year between 2017 and 2020. The company said the new long-haul business would help it return to profit on loss-making routes or reopen routes, especially to Asia, which it closed due to competition. On board, the planes will have a business class, but lie-flat seats without direct aisle access. The project is similar to Lufthansa's Jump project, which sees staff working longer to make long-haul Lufthansa-brand tourist routes more profitable and uses older A340 jets. But Janaillac said Boost was eventually looking to use new A350 jets, due to arrive in 2019. Air France-KLM also named Franck Terner, current head of its maintenance unit, as new CEO of Air France, replacing Frederic Gagey, who moves to the role of group chief financial officer. The group will also study a spin-off of its maintenance arm, although intends to retain control of the unit, it added. Group-wide, it said it was aiming for sales of 28 billion euros ($31 billion) by 2020, with 100 million passengers, compared with 90 million in 2015. $1 = 0.9013 euros

"https://www.reuters.com/article/europe-migrants-refugees-retailers-idUSL8N1CV4WO","Fashion brands ignore 'endemic' abuse of Syrian refugees in Turkey: watchdog","","October 24, 2016 /  11:59 PM / in 9 months","","LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Big fashion brands are failing to protect Syrian refugees from endemic abuse in Turkish clothing factories supplying European retailers, a monitoring group said on Tuesday. Child labor, pitiful pay and dangerous conditions are among the risks facing undocumented Syrian refugees working in Turkey's garment industry, according to the Business and Human Rights Resource Centre. The London-based charity surveyed 38 major brands with Turkish factories in their supply chains on steps they are taking to protect vulnerable refugee workers from exploitation. A handful of leading brands, like NEXT and New Look, demonstrate it is a moral imperative, and commercially viable, to treat refugees with respect, Phil Bloomer, the watchdog's executive director, said in a statement. The great majority of brands are doing too little. They should learn rapidly from these leaders to outlaw abuse of refugees in their supply chains, and insist their suppliers provide decent work for all their workers. Almost 3 million refugees - more than half aged under 18 - have fled to Turkey to escape war in Syria. Many work illegally in Turkey's garment industry, which supplies $17 billion in clothing and shoes a year, mostly to Europe, especially Germany. A Reuters investigation this year found evidence of Syrian refugee children in Turkey working in clothes factories in illegal conditions. Turkey bans children under 15 from working. A BBC Panorama investigation broadcast on Monday found that Syrian refugee children had been working in factories making clothes for British high street retailer Marks & Spencer (M&S;) and online store ASOS. An M&S; spokesperson told Reuters before the BBC report aired: We had previously found no evidence of Syrian workers employed in factories that supply us, so we were very disappointed by these findings, which are extremely serious and are unacceptable to M&S.; ASOS Chief Executive Officer Nick Beighton said in a statement: The issues Panorama raises aren't with our approved factories, who we audit. It's with unapproved outsourcing to factories we don't know about. This will continue to be a problem until we know where every garment is made and however difficult, that's what ultimately we’ve got to achieve. Work Permits The Business and Human Rights Resource Centre said many brands justified inaction on labor exploitation by denying the existence of refugees of any age in their supply chains. In its survey, drawn up with trade unions and rights advocates, only nine brands reported that they had found unregistered Syrian refugees on factory floors. Those brands were ASOS, C&A;, H&M;, KiK, LC Waikiki, Primark, New Look, NEXT and Otto Group. Until this year, Syrians were not entitled to work permits, so many refugees worked informally. Turkey started to issue permits in January, but the Business and Human Rights Resource Centre said the vast majority of Syrian refugees continue to work without legal protections, making them vulnerable to abuse. It said ASOS, C&A;, Esprit, GAP, Inditex, LC Waikiki, Mothercare, New Look, Otto Group, Primark, Tesco, Tchibo and White Stuff all now expect suppliers to support unregistered refugees to get work permits. This is a positive shift given many brands previously cited a zero tolerance policy towards unregistered refugees working in factories, leading to their dismissal - the worst outcome for their welfare, the charity said in a report. It praised NEXT, New Look and Mothercare for having detailed plans for protecting refugees and for paying a minimum wage even when Syrians are employed without work permits. The monitoring group criticized standard methods used to make sure supply chains are free from labor exploitation, in which brands announce in advance audits of so-called first-tier suppliers. Rights groups say a lot of abuse occurs at the murkier ends of supply chains when suppliers subcontract production from third-party factories that are much harder to keep track of. The Business and Human Rights Resource Centre noted that Adidas, C&A;, Debenhams, LC Waikiki, Puma, Inditex, ASOS, H&M; and NEXT audited sub-contractors below the first tier. But it said much more needed to be done.         The survey showed a minority of brands were taking collective action on exploitation in Turkey through the Ethical Trading Initiative, an alliance of trade unions, firms and charities promoting workers' rights, the group said. Disappointingly, six brands did not respond to the (survey) questions - Gerry Weber, Lidl, Mexx, New Yorker, River Island and Sainsbury's, it added in its report. Nobody was immediately available for comment at New Yorker, Mexx or Lidl. A River Island spokeswoman declined to comment. A Sainsbury's spokesperson told Thomson Reuters Foundation: We expect our suppliers, both in the UK and abroad, to follow our Code of Conduct for Ethical Trade, which incorporates the Base Code of the Ethical Trading Initiative. A spokeswoman for Gerry Weber said in an email: We have raised awareness with our suppliers for the issue and are furthermore on site with our own staff. Additionally we realize audits with independent third parties. Arcadia, Burberry, s.Oliver, SuperGroup, VF Corp and Walmart only provided short statements in response to the survey, the Business and Human Rights Resource Centre said.

The brands, which include Pilsner Urquell in Czech Republic and Tyskie and Lech in Poland, are worth more than 5 billion euros ($5.5 billion). They were offered for sale earlier this month as part of AB InBev's $100 billion-plus takeover of SABMiller, which recently closed. The portfolio has also drawn interest from private equity firm Advent International, which in March raised a $13 billion fund, the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Other parties looking at the assets but wanting to participate in a joint bid include U.S. buyout firm Bain Capital, Swiss investment firm Jacobs Holdings and London-based private equity house BC Partners, the sources said, as well as local investors.  Polish billionaire Sebastian Kulczyk told Reuters earlier this month that he may look to use some of the proceeds after the sale of his stake in SABMiller to buy the divested assets. Polish juice maker Maspex has also expressed interest in the brands and is seeking other investors to contribute to a bid, the sources said.   AB InBev recently invited a host of parties to the auction, led by Lazard, the sources said, adding that the world's largest brewer wants indicative offers in early November, hoping to nail down a buyer by Christmas, the sources said.   They described Asahi as the most motivated buyer, since it wants to build on its purchase of Peroni and Grolsch, SABMiller's former brands in western Europe.  But state-owned China Resources, which bought out the Chinese joint venture with SABMiller, is also keen to submit a competitive bid, they said, and is holding talks with potential partners including Chinese investment firms. The portfolio, which also includes beer brands in Hungary, Romania and Slovakia, may fit into the new strategy of Hungarian oil and gas group Mol MOLB.BU, which said last week that it wanted to diversify into new business areas including consumer goods, three of the sources said.  Officials for AB InBev, KKR, Advent, Bain, BC Partners and Mol declined to comment. Asahi, China Resources, Mid Europa and Jacobs could not be reached outside of normal working hours.

The brands, which include Pilsner Urquell in Czech Republic and Tyskie and Lech in Poland, are worth more than 5 billion euros ($5.5 billion). They were offered for sale earlier this month as part of AB InBev's $100 billion-plus takeover of SABMiller, which recently closed. The portfolio has also drawn interest from private equity firm Advent International, which in March raised a $13 billion fund, the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Other parties looking at the assets but wanting to participate in a joint bid include U.S. buyout firm Bain Capital, Swiss investment firm Jacobs Holdings and London-based private equity house BC Partners, the sources said, as well as local investors.  Polish billionaire Sebastian Kulczyk told Reuters earlier this month that he may look to use some of the proceeds after the sale of his stake in SABMiller to buy the divested assets. Polish juice maker Maspex has also expressed interest in the brands and is seeking other investors to contribute to a bid, the sources said.   AB InBev recently invited a host of parties to the auction, led by Lazard, the sources said, adding that the world's largest brewer wants indicative offers in early November, hoping to nail down a buyer by Christmas, the sources said.   They described Asahi as the most motivated buyer, since it wants to build on its purchase of Peroni and Grolsch, SABMiller's former brands in western Europe.  But state-owned China Resources, which bought out the Chinese joint venture with SABMiller, is also keen to submit a competitive bid, they said, and is holding talks with potential partners including Chinese investment firms. The portfolio, which also includes beer brands in Hungary, Romania and Slovakia, may fit into the new strategy of Hungarian oil and gas group Mol MOLB.BU, which said last week that it wanted to diversify into new business areas including consumer goods, three of the sources said.  Officials for AB InBev, KKR, Advent, Bain, BC Partners and Mol declined to comment. Asahi, China Resources, Mid Europa and Jacobs could not be reached outside of normal working hours.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/dunkin-brnds-results-idUSL4N1CQ3E5","Dunkin' Brands says U.S. election jitters slowing store openings","","October 20, 2016 /  10:18 AM / 9 months ago","","(Reuters) - Dunkin' Brands Group Inc (DNKN.O) on Thursday said franchisees are expected to open fewer doughnut and coffee shops this year due to uncertainty about the economy and regulations, which could be impacted by the outcome of U.S. elections next month. Shares in Dunkin' Brands, which are fueled by expectations that Dunkin' Donuts will expand aggressively in the United States, fell 3.2 percent to $49.38 on Thursday.             The group now expects net new U.S. Dunkin' Donuts openings to be at the low end of a previously provided range of 430 to 460 stores this year.         Chief Executive Officer Nigel Travis told Reuters that some franchisees are putting new store plans on hold until after the Nov. 8 election, when the political landscape is more certain. Franchisees are uncertain which direction everything is going in terms of government, he said. Everyone is sick to death of the election ... Once we know the direction we're going in, they'll be able to deal with it and growth will resume, he added.       U.S. restaurants also are battling intense competition from upstart chains and meal-kit sellers, in addition to getting battered by falling grocery prices, which are encouraging more people to eat at home.  Franchisees could face problem no matter whether Republican Donald Trump or Democrat Hillary Clinton takes the White House. There is growing speculation that Trump's sinking poll numbers could influence elections on the federal and state level, which could affect tax, healthcare and minimum wage policies. If local elections are hit, policies covering construction and business regulation could shift. Clinton, among other things, has championed raising the minimum wage as well as paid family and medical leave. Trump takes a more pro-business stance with promises to lower taxes and slash regulations, but his erratic behavior during the campaign has raised concerns about how he would govern. Survey results from the National Federation of Independent Business found that uncertainty among small business owners is at a 42-year high. Political uncertainty is big. This is definitely not just restaurants, said Bill Dunkelberg, chief economist for NFIB, which counts 325,000 small business owners as member.  Visits to Dunkin' Donuts and Baskin-Robbins were down in the latest quarter. Sales of iced coffee and breakfast sandwiches helped overcome that weakness at U.S. Dunkin' Donuts outlets, where sales at established restaurants rose a better-than-expected 2 percent in the third quarter, according to results released on Thursday.  That was not the case at U.S. Baskin-Robbins ice cream shops, which reported a surprise 0.9 percent drop in same-store sales for the quarter.    Net income attributable to Dunkin' Brands rose to $52.7 million, or 57 cents per share, in the quarter from $46.2 million, or 48 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, the company earned 60 cents per share. Dunkin' said total sales fell 1.3 percent to $207.1 million,  due to the sale of company-operated stores to franchisees. Analysts had expected total sales of $214.4 million and earnings per share of 59 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Hubertus Troska said the government's push, which involves tax breaks and other policy support, helped the number of NEVs sold last year surpass 300,000, making China the world's biggest market for electric, gasoline-electric and other such vehicles. The majority of those vehicles were priced under 250,000 yuan ($37,515) and offered mainly by Chinese automakers, Troska said at an analyst and investor conference in Beijing. Given factors including the government push - which falls under a broader drive to cut oil dependence and air pollution - Daimler is very confident NEVs will be an important factor of the Chinese market, Troska said. Hubertus Troska, China head of Daimler AG, attends the Global Automotive Forum in Chongqing, China, June, 6, 2016.Jake Spring/File PhotoMercedes-Benz is also going to play a role in China in NEVs, he said, referring to the planned cars.

Lincoln nearly tripled its China sales in the third quarter to 8,546 vehicles, the company said on Monday. Despite rapid growth, Lincoln sales distantly trail those of more established German competitors as well as American rival GM's (GM.N) Cadillac, all of which produce cars locally to avoid hefty taxes on imported vehicles. Lincoln is accelerating its entry into China with plans to have 65 Lincoln stores by the end of 2016, instead of previous plans of 60, with 80 planned for year-end 2017, Lincoln China President Amy Marentic told Reuters. Marentic said the company will also open five to 10 smaller sales branches to tap into fast-growing auto sales in lower-tier Chinese cities. The company is additionally studying the possibility of local production, she said. You're always looking for ways to optimize your business, Marentic said, declining to elaborate. In the first three quarters of the year, Lincoln sales in China leapt 191 percent to about 21,000, Ford said. Even with the surging sales, Ford's Lincoln lagged Detroit rival General Motors Co (GM.N) and its luxury Cadillac brand, which got a much earlier start. In September in China, GM sold about 12,500 Cadillacs, up 63 percent. In 2016 through September, GM has sold about 77,000 Cadillac vehicles in China, up 35 percent, more than three times Lincoln's sales. Ford said it hopes its China sales will be boosted by a new version of its flagship sedan, the Lincoln Continental, to go on sale at Chinese dealerships in the fourth quarter.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/hyundai-motor-china-idUSL4N1CO1KI","Hyundai to make China-only vehicles, green cars to battle local brands","","October 18, 2016 /  3:05 AM / 9 months ago","","SEOUL (Reuters) - Hyundai Motor Co on Tuesday said it aims to make more China-only and environment-friendly cars at two new Chinese plants, as it strives to fend off competition from Chinese rivals and slowing growth in the world's biggest auto market. The plans are part of a strategy announced on the opening of South Korean automaker's fourth Chinese factory, which will be followed by fifth plant next year. Hyundai and sister Kia Motors Corp, which together rank third in China sales, saw their combined market share fall to 8 percent this year, hitting their lowest since 2007 as domestic rivals won customers with cheaper sport utility vehicles (SUVs). To boost sales capability, Beijing Hyundai - a joint venture with domestic peer BAIC Motor Corp Ltd - replaced its head earlier in October as part of a reshuffle of China executives. Hyundai said its new plants will each have annual production capacity of 300,000 cars, raising total capacity in its biggest market by about half to 1.81 million cars. Including Kia's output, total capacity would be 2.7 million. We will accelerate our efforts to achieve a market share of more than 10 percent again with the (factory) opening, Hyundai said in a statement on Tuesday. China's passenger car market is projected to grow 1 percent in 2017 versus 10 percent this year, Hyundai Motor said, citing data from China's State Information Center (SIC). Tax breaks for small engine cars, which boosted 2016 sales, will expire at the end of December. Hyundai said its new plants will build models of varying sizes to compete with low-cost domestic rivals. It aims to sell a China-only SUV from as early as next year, with more SUV models planned. Reuters earlier this year reported that Hyundai and Kia plan to launch three low-cost SUVs in China from 2017. Not all SUVs will win - but the (makers) who localize the designs and features to Chinese tastes will be the winners, said James Chao, Asia-Pacific managing director at researcher IHS Automotive. He said SUVs will account for 40 percent of the passenger vehicle market by 2023, from 34 percent this year. Hyundai also said it aims to produce nine green vehicles - petrol-electric hybrid, plug-in hybrid, electric and fuel cell - in China by 2020, making up 10 percent of its sales in the country by that year. At present, green vehicles account for a fraction of Hyundai's China sales. China surpassed the United States last year to become the largest maker of electric cars following government subsidies aimed at curbing pollution.

operators)
    Oct 11 (Reuters) - Yum Brands Inc, owner of Pizza
Hut, KFC and Taco Bell chains, said on Tuesday it expects to
return as much as $13.5 billion to shareholders by 2019 as part
of a program started last year, sending shares up as much as 3.8
percent.
    Yum said it will increase franchise restaurant ownership to
93 percent from the current 77 percent when its China business
is spun off on Oct. 31. 
    The company aims to be least 98 percent franchised by the
end of 2018. Shifting to independent owners will enable Yum to
reduce risk and lower costs and move to a greater dependence on
more stable franchise and license fees. 
    The company said it had bought back about $5.5 billion of
its shares as a part of a previously announced $6.2 billion
capital return program, reducing its share count by about 16
percent.
    Yum also said it would expand the plan, resulting in a total
return of $13.5 billion to shareholders, including dividends.
    The company said it will reduce annual capital expenditure
to about $100 million in 2019 from about $500 million in 2015
and plans to reduce general and administrative expenses by a
cumulative $300 million by fiscal 2019. 
    Yum's China business will begin trading on Nov. 1 on the New
York Stock Exchange with the ticker symbol YUMC. The new
company, Yum China Holdings Inc, will become a licensee of Yum
Brands in mainland China and will have exclusive rights to KFC,
Pizza Hut and Taco Bell.
    Yum last week reported its first same-store sales drop in
five quarters in China, blaming anti-U.S. protests after an
international court rejected China's claim to historic rights in
the South China Sea. 
    Shares in Yum were up 2 percent at $89.15 after hitting a
session high of $90.68. Up to Monday's close, the stock had
risen about 20 percent since the start of the year.

L Brands' strong business profile is anchored by its two flagship brands,  Victoria's Secret (approximately 63% of sales and operating income including the  Victoria's Secret direct business) and Bath & Body Works (approximately 30% of  sales and 36% of operating income); a strong direct business (16% of total  revenue); and a growing international footprint.  The company's strong comparable store sales (comps) trends since the recession  have been driven by relevant and attractive product offerings and a loyal  customer base. Comps increased 5% in 2015, following a 2% increase in 2013 and  4% in 2014. In addition to positive operating leverage from strong comps growth,  the company has driven margin growth through efficient inventory and expense  management. EBITDA margins in the 20%+ range compare favorably to the broader  retail average in the low teens. The years 2016 and 2017 are expected to be affected negatively by the company's  recent actions at Victoria's Secret to streamline operations as well as  investments related to grow Victoria's Secret in North America and transition  China to a company-operated market (previously franchised). Notably, the company  is eliminating certain merchandise categories such as swimwear and certain  apparel categories representing a total of $525 million in volume (4% of total  sales) beginning mid-2016. Factoring in the swimwear/apparel volume loss, Fitch expects 2016 revenue growth  to be up modestly on flattish comps and 4% square-footage growth, while 2017  revenue is expected to be up in the 4% range on comps of 1%-2% and 2%-3%  square-footage growth. The combination of flattish comps, margin degradation on  inventory clearance activity and price investments to drive sales in key  categories, and investments in the China rollout is projected to yield a 3%-5%  decline in EBITDA in 2016 to the $2.6 billion range. However, EBITDA margin is  expected to remain in excess of 20% in 2016 and 2017.  The growth of PINK in the U.S., which could be a $3 billion business over the  next few years from our estimate of $2.5 billion currently, and the inclusion of  the full lingerie lines in expanded Victoria's Secret stores have led to  increased productivity per square foot over the past few years. PINK, a  collegiate-focused brand which offers intimate apparel, loungewear and related  products in vibrant colors and patterns, has expanded Victoria Secret's  demographic base by appealing to younger consumers. International expansion  provides a strong top-line and profit opportunity by allowing the company to  diversify outside of mall-based locations and reduce operational and execution  risks through its substantially franchised model (outside of the UK and Canadian  markets). KEY ASSUMPTIONS --Fitch expects L Brands to produce flattish comps (excluding its direct  business) in 2016, improving to the 1%-2% range in 2017, factoring in the loss  of apparel/swimwear business; --Square footage expansion, if executed successfully, could drive overall  top-line growth to modestly positive in 2016 and in the 3%-5% range thereafter; --Free cash flow (FCF) after regular dividends of negative $100 million to  breakeven after regular dividends over the next two to three years given  increased capex spend;  --Capex is expected to increase to approximately $950 million in 2016 from $727  million in 2015 reflecting new store constructions and square footage expansion  and stay in that range thereafter; --Leverage is expected to be in the mid-3x range with future debt-funded special  dividends or share buybacks potentially pushing leverage higher than 3.3x in  2015. RATING SENSITIVITIES A positive rating action would require both the continuation of positive  operating trends and a public commitment to maintain financial leverage in the  low 3x range. A negative rating action could be driven by a trend of negative comps and/or  margin compression from fashion misses, execution missteps or loss of  competitive traction. A larger than expected debt-financed share repurchase or  special dividend and/or leverage rising to 4x would be negative for the rating. LIQUIDITY AND DEBT STRUCTURE Liquidity is strong, supported by a cash balance of $1.3 billion as of July 30,  2016 and the company's $1 billion revolving credit facility. The company has a  comfortable maturity profile and Fitch considers refinancing risk low given L  Brands' strong business profile, favorable operating trends, and reasonable  leverage. Fitch expects FCF after regular dividends of negative $100 million to breakeven  after regular dividends over the next two to three years given increased capex  spend. Fitch assumes regular dividends will be increased by approximately 10%,  compared with the 10%-25% increase over the last few years. Capex is expected to  increase to $950 million in 2016 from the $700 million range annually in  2014-2015, reflecting new store constructions and square footage expansion to  primarily support PINK and international growth (square footage to grow by  approximately 4% in 2016). Lease-adjusted leverage stood at 3.3x as of Jan. 30, 2016. Fitch expects the  company to maintain a leverage profile in the mid-3x range, and fund dividends  and share repurchases with FCF and potential debt issuances. The company's  shareholder-friendly posture is a key constraint to the rating.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/fashion-berluti-idUSL8N1BE1O5","Berluti names designer Ackermann in bid to build fashion brand","","September 2, 2016 /  10:00 AM / in a year","","PARIS, Sept 2 (Reuters) - Berluti, the luxury shoe maker which parent LVMH is trying to turn into a fashion brand, has appointed French designer Haider Ackermann as creative director. Berluti said 45-year old Ackermann, a respected stylist who created his own brand in 2003, will present his first collection at men's fashion week in Paris in January. Citing sources close to the matter, Reuters had reported in July that Berluti was in talks to hire Ackermann to replace Alessandro Sartori who returned to previous employer Ermenegildo Zegna in February. This house represents for me the essence of what is luxury for man and I am inspired by the idea of joining it in this new adventure, Ackermann said in a statement. Ackermann is coming to Berluti after LVMH sank an estimated 100 million euros ($112 million) or more into the brand in recent years, opening dozens of shops in strategic cities, holding glamorous events and expensive fashion shows and developing a fully fledged website. On top of its trademark shiny shoes costing around 1,500 euros, Berluti sells leather goods, accessories and bespoke suits. LVMH Finance Director Jean-Jacques Guiony said at the group's half-year results in July that Berluti was still lossmaking and did not say when the group expected it to break even. Analysts estimate Berluti generates around 150 million euros in annual revenue. Back in 2013, LVMH boss and controlling shareholder Bernard Arnault said he expected Berluti to become profitable in 2016. Berluti is headed by Bernard's Arnault's oldest son Antoine.
