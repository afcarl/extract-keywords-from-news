Elliott, the largest Akzo investor with a 9.5 percent stake, was pursuing the case even after Akzo said on Tuesday that 70-year old Chairman Antony Burgmans would step down when his term expires next April. That will be too late for Elliott which is engaged in an increasingly bitter fight against Burgmans. Akzo and Pittsburgh-based PPG are in a six-month compulsory cooling off period which expires in December. Some analysts believe the departure of the two leading opponents of a deal, after Chief Executive Ton Buechner announced his immediate resignation on July 19 due to health reasons, could open the door for talks. In a preliminary ruling in May, Amsterdam's Enterprise Chamber rejected Elliott's bid to compel Akzo to convene an extraordinary meeting of shareholders to vote on dismissing Burgmans, saying it was an attempt to wrest control of the company's strategic direction from the board. Buechner's sudden departure left his successor, relatively new chemicals division chief Thierry Vanlancker, to deliver higher sales and margins promised when the Dutch paintmaker fended off PPG's takeover attempt. Akzo's second quarter results, announced on Tuesday, missed expectations. The company's shares traded at 75.57 euros on Thursday morning, far below PPG's final cash and share proposal of around 95 euros made in April. Akzo said that shareholders would have their say at an extraordinary meeting on Sept. 8, but Elliott responded furiously, saying Akzo had chosen yet again to flout fundamental shareholder rights by not allowing a vote on Burgmans too. On Thursday, the court will hear arguments by Elliott and York Capital Management, which is supporting the suit. They are seeking a summary ruling by the judges to call an extraordinary shareholders meeting to vote on Burgmans' position. Akzo would present counter arguments and a ruling was expected within two weeks. Editing by Keith Weir"

Emma Walmsley, who took over in April, said GSK would in future allocate 80 percent of its R&D; budget to respiratory and HIV/infectious diseases, along with two other potential areas of oncology and immuno-inflammation.  Thirteen clinical and around 20 pre-clinical programmes will be stopped, partnered or divested, and the group is considering options for its rare diseases unit after a strategic review. It also plans to stop selling the struggling diabetes drug Tanzeum and end a collaboration with Johnson & Johnson over experimental rheumatoid arthritis drug sirukumab, as well as divesting around 130 old drugs with limited sales. GSK has lagged behind rivals recently in producing multibillion-dollar blockbusters and has suffered a number of high-profile failures, undermining faith in its R&D; skills.  We've been too broadly spread, Walmsley told reporters, adding that the overhaul would not result in a lower R&D; budget because GSK had been investing too little in individual experimental drugs in the past. Indeed, spending could rise as Walmsley and her team go shopping for promising early-stage experimental drugs to bolster the pipeline in GSK's priority areas.  The announcement came as Britain's biggest drugmaker reported a 12 percent rise in adjusted earnings per share in sterling terms to 27.2 pence on sales up 12 percent at 7.32 billion pounds ($9.53 billion).  Analysts, on average, had forecast EPS of 26.2 pence and sales of 7.26 billion pounds, according to Thomson Reuters data. The group reiterated its outlook for 2020, first given in 2015, forecasting sales growth of low-to-mid single digits and adjusted earnings of mid-to-high single digits on a constant currency basis. For 2017, it now sees EPS growth of 3-5 percent, against 5-7 percent predicted previously, following investment in a priority review voucher to accelerate U.S. approval of a new HIV medicine.  FILE PHOTO: The GlaxoSmithKline building is pictured in Hounslow, west London June 18, 2013.Luke MacGregor/File PhotoShares in the group fell 1.3 percent by 1400 GMT, with some investors disappointed that Walmsley had not taken the opportunity to increase long-term financial targets. Given that she announced an extended cost-cutting programme to deliver an additional 1 billion pounds of annual cost savings by 2020, UBS analyst Michael Leuchten said the cautious approach suggests tougher underlying trends. Following Astrazeneca Walmsley, who previously headed GSK's consumer health unit after 17 years working for L'Oreal, is known for her focus on benchmarking business performance and had been expected to revamp pharma R&D.; Slideshow (2 Images)She had previously said she was considering the divestment of older antibiotics and planning to sell two UK nutritional brands. Overhauling GSK's R&D; machine is her biggest task, however, and she wants scientific and commercial teams to work closely together to pick winners.  The changes will take time to deliver results but Walmsley does have a window as GSK is not expecting its next wave of new drugs until after 2020. It also has no further major patent expiries until 2026. To some extent GSK is following in the footsteps of its smaller British rival AstraZeneca, which has divested a large number of non-core drug projects recently. Significantly, former AstraZeneca executive Luke Miels, who joins in September, will be a key lieutenant for Walmsley during the shake-up. GSK benefited once again in the quarter from a weak pound, after last year's Brexit vote, as well as strong demand for HIV medicines and the failure, so far, of generic firms to win U.S. approval for copies of its inhaled lung drug Advair. But HIV competition is set to increase next year and U.S. generics to Advair, which has generated more than $1 billion in annual sales for GSK since 2001, are likely by mid-2018. The company extended a commitment to pay its current 80 pence per share annual dividend through 2018.

Paulo reported on Wednesday. A JBS representative said Pilgrim's Pride is not for sale. Cargill declined to comment. The report by the Brazilian newspaper did not cite how it obtained the information. JBS, the world's largest meatpacker, purchased a controlling stake in Pilgrim's Pride in 2009 for $2.8 billion, backed by a $2 billion loan from state development bank BNDES [BNDES.UL]. JBS is now rushing to sell assets and raise cash in order to help its holding company, J&F; Investimentos SA, pay a big fine after becoming embroiled in sweeping graft probes that ensnared Brazilian politicians and executives. JBS said last month that its majority stake in Pilgrim's Pride is not for sale because it was critical to its long-term strategy of pursuing business opportunities that reduce volatility and enhance margins. JBS shares climbed about 7 percent to 7.47 reais, lifted in part by news late on Tuesday that the company reached a deal with banks to stabilize terms of debt owed by its JBS Brasil unit. In New York, Pilgrim shares closed up 2.1 percent to $24.00. Vertical Group analyst Heather Jones reiterated a recommendation to buy Pilgrim's shares, with a base target price of $33 per share. We view reports of Cargill's interest as credible given its M&A; activity in global poultry in recent years, Jones said in a note. JBS's willingness to sell is another matter.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/deutsche-bank-asset-management-idUSL5N1KH3B2","Deutsche Bank asset management listing seen in H1 2018 at earliest - sources","","Jul 26 2017","Deutsche Bank'splanned listing of its asset management arm is unlikely beforethe first half of next year and could be later, as it wants moretime to refine and sell the business's strategy to potentialinvestors, people close to the matter said.","FRANKFURT/LONDON, July 26 (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank's planned listing of its asset management arm is unlikely before the first half of next year and could be later, as it wants more time to refine and sell the business's strategy to potential investors, people close to the matter said. Germany's largest lender announced plans to list the unit, including its main DWS retail asset management brand, in March as part of a broader restructuring aimed at reviving the bank's fortunes following costly law suits and trading scandals. While it said at the time the share sale would take place at some point over the next two years, investors expected it the bank to move quickly to take advantage of buoyant equity markets and seal a deal that could raise 2 billion euros ($2.3 billion). But its so-called equity story for selling the business to investors is far from ready, and Deutsche is desperate to avoid another U-turn after it put retail business Postbank up for sale, only to decide later to keep it, the sources said. Some investors have also indicated they would prefer a stronger focus at Deutsche's asset management arm on so-called passive investments or exchange traded funds (ETFs), whereas its main business is currently with actively managed funds. The IPO story is not ready yet, one of the people said, adding that in his view the unit needed to invest in its ETF business to keep up with competitors. Deutsche, which will report second-quarter earnings on Thursday, declined to comment. Chief Executive John Cryan conceded in May it would take time to realise the benefits of the lender's latest efforts to plant and sow - or breathe new life into the Deutsche brand. ETFs Deutsche Asset Management currently has 723 billion euros invested worldwide, of which 540 billion are actively managed, 103 billion in ETFs and the rest in alternatives such as real estate. Concern around the scale of Deutsche's ETF offering comes as market leaders BlackRock and Vanguard continue to grow assets under management in Europe, with the latter flagging plans to expand its continental operations. Underpinning that is a belief the market for ETFs in Europe will continue to grow strongly over the coming years, fuelled in part by new regulations aimed at making the costs of investing more transparent. European ETF assets rose for the fifth straight year to hit a record 514.5 billion euros in 2016, data from Thomson Reuters Lipper show, up 15 percent but still just a fraction of the 9.4 trillion euros in total invested assets. But with asset managers under pressure from investors to cut fees, even in the already low-cost ETF market, a provider needs to have scale to succeed. European sales of ETFs during 2016 were led by BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street, the Lipper data show, with Deutsche Bank not even making the top-10. It still retained its position as the second-biggest ETF provider in Europe, behind BlackRock's iShares, with assets under management of 53.3 billion euros, the data show. But by May, Deutsche's ETF brand Xtrackers had fallen to third place behind BlackRock and Societe Generale's Lyxor unit. [tmsnrt.rs/2uwBywT ] An analyst at a top-50 shareholder in Deutsche Bank was more sanguine about the company's ETF market position, with a number six position globally leaving it probably at minimum efficient scale, but with clearly scope to build in the United States. Deutsche Bank is, however, making headway with the organisational work for listing the asset management division. Division head Nicolas Moreau said last month the bundling of the unit's businesses into one holding company would be done by October, as would the finalisation of distribution and service contracts between Deutsch asset management and its mothership. Investment banks vying for mandates to help organise the listing had expected Deutsche to pick a so-called global coordinator - which will work alongside Deutsche's own investment bank on the deal - before the summer break. That has slipped into the second half of the year, people close to the matter said, adding banks that helped Deutsche with its 8.5 billion euro capital raising earlier this year stood a good chance of securing roles on the deal. Deutsche hopes that by giving its asset management arm more operational independence the unit will attract more talent, and Cryan has said the bank will maintain a controlling and super-majority stake in the business. $1 = 0.8602 euros

The $16.5 billion New York-based firm, run by Daniel Loeb, gained 10.7 percent in the first half, making it one of a small number of hedge funds that beat the Standard & Poor's 500 index's 9.3 percent gain. The average hedge fund returned 3.68 percent in the first half, HFR data show. Calling Alibaba one of the best business models in the global internet sector and a clear winner in the consolidated Chinese ecommerce market, Loeb said the company stands to benefit from changes it made to its advertising platform. Reuters saw a copy of the letter. The company listed its shares in the United States two years ago and immediately attracted wide hedge fund ownership which quickly dwindled after the listing. As part of Third Point's focus on international investments, Loeb also underscored his bets on European stocks where the firm's exposure is now at its highest level since 2010. Third Point last month announced an investment in Swiss conglomerate Nestle, which makes food products from baby food to chocolate. Loeb adjusted the portfolio during the second quarter to focus more on companies that will benefit from low inflation while cutting his exposure to bank financials. He also exited reflationary macro trades. Third Point also made a new bet on BlackRock, the world's biggest asset manager with $5.7 trillion, calling it a misunderstood franchise that is just beginning to inflect. Demand for lower cost investments like ETFs, where BlackRock is a leader, is likely to pick up, benefiting the company, Third Point said. BlackRock said We are aware that Third Point has taken an ownership position and we welcome them as a shareholder.  During the quarter, the biggest winners for Third Point were Baxter International Inc, Nestle SA, Constellation Brands Inc, auction house Sotheby's and Honeywell International Inc. The biggest losers included JPMorgan Chase & Co and T-Mobile US Inc. Third Point also said it will stop taking in new money from new investors on Oct. 1, 2017. For years, Third Point turned away would-be investors but it had quietly opened up again for a brief time in the last year to replace money that had left.

Financial services companies need a regulated subsidiary in an EU country to offer products across the bloc, which could prompt some to move jobs out of Britain if it loses access to the European single market. Following are related stories about top banks (in alphabetical order): Association of Foreign Banks in Germany The association expects 3,000 to 5,000 new jobs in Frankfurt over the next two years as a result of Brexit, its head Stefan Winter, of UBS, told German newspaper Welt am Sonntag in June. He said he expected 12 to 14 major banks to expand their Frankfurt sites significantly or build new ones. Bank of America Corp Bank of America (BAC.N) became the first Wall Street lender to pick Dublin as its new base for its European Union operations as Britain prepares to leave the bloc. Bank of America said in August that its businesses and results could be adversely affected and it may have to incur additional costs if Brexit limited the ability of its UK entities to conduct business in the EU. Dublin is Bank of America's default option for a new base within the EU, but other centers are on the table and no decision has yet been made, an executive said on March 14. Barclays Barclays is talking with Irish regulators about extending its activities in Dublin, the British bank said. It already has a licensed bank in the Irish capital and is looking to expand that so it can act as its EU subsidiary.  Banks in Britain will start shifting some operations to continental Europe reasonably soon to avoid disrupting links with customers after Brexit, Barclays (BARC.L) Chief Executive Jes Staley said.  He added that obtaining a license to trade on the continent and changing financial contracts to another jurisdiction would take a year to 18 months. Staley previously told BBC Radio that Barclays would keep the bulk of its activities in Britain after Brexit and any changes to how the bank operates would be small and manageable.  Bnp Paribas BNP Paribas (BNPP.PA) may move up to 300 London investment bank staff because of Brexit, depending how clients adapt and the French bank's efforts to win new UK business, a source said. The company had 3,123 staff in its corporate and institutional bank in Britain at end-2016, down from 3,294 a year earlier, internal documents seen by Reuters showed. Citigroup U.S. bank Citigroup (C.N) said that it may need to create 150 new jobs in the EU to deal with the impact of Britain leaving the bloc, and confirmed it would headquarter its EU trading operations in Frankfurt. Citi, which has a large banking unit in Dublin, had previously said it would choose Frankfurt as its hub for sales and trading in the EU and move a couple of hundred jobs outside of London after Brexit. Separately, the bank's European chief said Citi would make a decision on Brexit contingency plans in the first half of the year and choose from a number of potential EU countries to relocate some investment banking business. Credit Agricole Credit Agricole (CAGR.PA), France's third-biggest listed bank, could relocate about 100 employees from its London hub to France out of 1,000 based there in the case of a hard Brexit, its chief executive said. Credit Suisse Credit Suisse's (CSGN.S) Chief Executive Tidjane Thiam said in September that his bank was relatively well placed to deal with Brexit and that only 15-20 percent of volumes in the investment bank would be affected. Daiwa Securities Group Japan's No. 2 brokerage Daiwa Securities Group (8601.T) said it will set up a subsidiary in Frankfurt, making it one of the first banks to publicly choose Germany to keep a foothold in the EU after Britain's exit. The group has said it would still keep staff in London even after Brexit. It has 450 staff working in the EU now, mostly in the British capital. The German city is Daiwa's favored destination, as London-based staff can easily be transferred to its investment banking branch in Frankfurt, Chief Executive Seiji Nakata had said previously. Deutsche Bank Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) is beefing up its presence in Frankfurt to deal with the impact of Britain leaving the EU. Chief Executive John Cryan said the German lender expected to add new jobs in Frankfurt, where it will replicate a structure that is interchangeable with its London operations and evolve as Brexit negotiations unfold. Deutsche Bank warned on April 26 that up to 4,000 UK jobs could be moved to Frankfurt and other EU locations - the highest potential move of any bank. European supervisors want Deutsche Bank to prepare a fallback plan, laying out how it could shift the clearing of trades from London, one person with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters. Euroclear Settlement bank Euroclear is looking at the option of setting up a branch or subsidiary to provide a route between its UK and Irish markets after Brexit, the head of its UK and Irish operation said. French Banking Federation French banks could shift about 1,000 jobs from London to Paris to keep staff in the EU, the French Banking Federation said. Goldman Sachs U.S. bank Goldman Sachs (GS.N) is considering moving up to 1,000 staff from London to Frankfurt because of concerns over Brexit, Germany's Handelsblatt newspaper reported in January, citing financial sources. Goldman will begin moving hundreds of people out of London before any Brexit deal is struck as part of its contingency plans, the Wall Street company's Europe CEO said in March. Three people familiar with the matter told Reuters in November that Goldman was considering shifting some of its assets and operations from London to Frankfurt. Hsbc HSBC (HSBA.L) sees the chances of a hard Brexit receding after Britain's shock election result, which could result in fewer jobs moving out of London, its investment bank chief said. Stuart Gulliver, CEO of HSBC, Europe's biggest bank, had previously said that the company would relocate staff responsible for generating around a fifth of its UK-based trading revenue, or about 1,000 people, to Paris.  Chairman Douglas Flint has told lawmakers that banks without operations elsewhere in the EU are likely to trigger migration plans immediately after EU divorce talks begin, estimating that tens of thousands of jobs are linked to EU passporting rights. Investec Investec (INVP.L) (INLJ.J) is considering converting its London bank's Dublin branch into a subsidiary to ensure it has continued access to the European single market after Britain leaves the EU, Chief Executive Stephen Koseff told British newspaper The Telegraph on May 18.  However, the Anglo-South African lender and asset manager was in no rush to secure the license needed for such a subsidiary and would see only a small part of its business affected by Brexit, the paper quoted Koseff as saying. (bit.ly/2qywZzY) Jpmorgan JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N), the biggest U.S. bank by assets, is planning to merge its UK-based private banking unit with its wider European wealth operation ahead of the UK's exit from the European Union, Sky News reported. JPMorgan said in July that the bank would probably use Frankfurt as the legal domicile of its European operations after Brexit, though jobs could be moved elsewhere as well. The U.S. bank has also agreed to buy a Dublin building with room for 1,000 staff in the first sign of a financial services company expanding significantly in Ireland since the government began a major campaign to attract businesses after Brexit.  However, the bank, which employs about 500 people in Dublin, did not say how many jobs would be created or whether any positions would be moved from the United Kingdom. Daniel Pinto, head of investment banking at the Wall Street bank, had told Bloomberg on May 3 that it planned to move hundreds of London-based bankers to expanded offices in Dublin, Frankfurt and Luxembourg. CEO Jamie Dimon had previously said the bank was not planning to move many jobs out of Britain in the next two years. Before the vote, Dimon said the bank would be forced to move 4,000 of its 16,000 Britain-based staff if the country loses access to the single market. Julius Baer Julius Baer, Switzerland's third-biggest private bank is moving its European hub from Frankfurt to Luxembourg but will continue to keep its options open in London, Boris Collardi, chief executive at Julius Baer has said.  Britain's planned departure from the EU opens the door for a UK-Swiss deal covering financial services, said Collardi. Lloyds Banking Group Lloyds Banking Group (LLOY.L), Britain's largest mortgage lender and the only major British retail bank without a subsidiary in another EU country, is close to selecting Berlin as a European base to secure post-Brexit EU market access. Morgan Stanley Morgan Stanley (MS.N) has chosen Frankfurt to be a new base for its EU operations as Britain prepares to leave the bloc, according to a source familiar with the matter. The bank is planning to use its Frankfurt subsidiary as the center for its EU trading operations. That means 200 new people will be coming to Frankfurt, the source said.  Morgan Stanley has identified many of the roles that will need to be moved from Britain after Brexit, sources involved in the processes had told Reuters. The U.S. bank, which bases the bulk of its European staff in Britain, will have to move up to 1,000 jobs in sales and trading, risk management, legal and compliance, as well as slimming the back office in favor of locations overseas, one source told Reuters.  Morgan Stanley could initially shift 300 staff from Britain after its EU exit and is scouting for office space in Frankfurt and Dublin, Bloomberg News reported in February. The bank plans to double the number of its bankers in Frankfurt to 400, German newspaper Welt am Sonntag reported in June. Mizuho Japan's Mizuho Financial Group (8411.T) said it would set up a subsidiary in Frankfurt, the latest Japanese bank to choose the German city as its new base in the European Union as Britain prepares to leave the bloc. Nomura Nomura Holdings Inc (8604.T) is applying for a license to operate a new entity in Frankfurt, as Japan's largest brokerage gears up for Britain's departure from the EU . Northern Trust Asset management company Northern Trust (NTRS.O) has said it will set up an EU banking base in Luxembourg. Continental Europe is a strategic area of focus for Northern Trust and the creation of our EU banking presence in Luxembourg highlights our commitment to growing our business in the region, said Teresa Parker, president of Northern Trust in Europe. Around a third of Northern Trust's institutional clients have asked it to ringfence British exposure from their broader European portfolios to protect them from Brexit-related risks. Societe Generale Societe Generale (SOGN.PA) could move 400 corporate and investment banking jobs from London, with most going to Paris, Chief Executive Frederic Oudea said in July. Oudea said the possible move of jobs after Brexit would affect 300-400 investment banking jobs out of 2,000 it has overall for that business in London. Standard Chartered Standard Chartered (STAN.L) is in talks with regulators about making Frankfurt its post-Brexit European base. Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc (8316.T) said its core banking unit, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp (SMBC), has decided to set up a subsidiary in Frankfurt. Ubs UBS (UBSG.S) is weighing up whether to move banking jobs in London to Frankfurt, Madrid or Amsterdam to cope with Britain's planned EU departure, Chief Executive Sergio Ermotti said in an interview with CNBC in July. The bank has estimated that it would need to move 1,500 people from London to the EU to retain full passporting rights, according to Chairman Axel Weber. That would be more than a quarter of its 5,500 staff in London. The world's biggest wealth manager has also set up a bank in Frankfurt to consolidate most of its European wealth management operations, after the Brexit vote dashed London's chances of being the host city.

Having your own software is a key driver of efficiency, Amundi's chief executive officer Yves Perrier was quoted as saying by Financal News on Wednesday. BlackRock's Aladdin operating system is used by asset managers to help manage the risk in their portfolios and assist them in trading, data management and other operations. BlackRock is the world's largest asset manager. An Amundi spokeswoman confirmed the change and said that migration of Pioneer to Amundi's system was expected to be completed by the beginning of the first quarter of 2019. Amundi bought Pioneer Investments from Italian lender Unicredit for 3.54 billion euros ($4.1 billion) this year. The French group expects the acquisition to deliver 150 million euros in cost synergies and 30 million euros in revenue synergies over a full year, starting from completion of the integration process, which will take two years. More than 200 institutions, including BlackRock, use Aladdin and its risk analytics, the world's largest asset manager with $5.7 trillion says. Growing Aladdin is a key priority for Blackrock's CEO Larry Fink, who has placed an emphasis on technology as the broader stockpicking business has come under pressure from lower cost index funds.

News of Daimler's (DAIGn.DE) strategic review spurred speculation on Wednesday about a break-up of the maker of Mercedes-Benz cars, trucks, buses and vans as it seeks to fund multi-billion euro autonomous and electric car investments.  We recommend taking this communication very seriously, analysts at Evercore ISI said in a note.  Separating Daimler's divisions could unlock value, with trucks and buses on their own worth 31 billion euros ($36 billion), analysts at Evercore ISI said in a note. The German company's total market capitalization is around 65.25 billion euros, according to Thomson Reuters data. Chief Financial Officer Bodo Uebber said Daimler does not intend to divest business divisions, but left open the question about a partial listing of some businesses. We have not decided to set up new legal structures within our group. We have decided to analyze this possibility. We had a small group in our company which was weighing this idea, Zetsche said in a call on second-quarter results. Internal deliberations within Daimler had now reached a stage where markets needed to be informed, he added. News of the strategy review comes as the auto industry faces a barrage of criticism over diesel pollution and allegations about anti-competitive behavior. The automotive industry is currently making headlines, and not good ones, Zetsche conceded. German magazine Der Spiegel reported on Friday that German carmakers Daimler, BMW (BMWG.DE), VW (VOWG_p.DE), Porsche and Audi (NSUG.DE) held meetings to discuss suppliers, prices and standards to the disadvantage of foreign carmakers. FILE PHOTO: The Mercedes-Benz logo is seen before the company's annual news conference in Stuttgart, Germany, February 4, 2016.Michaela Rehle/File PhotoThe European Commission said it was investigating the matter, although Daimler pointed out it was not subject to a formal probe. Companies found guilty of breaching EU cartel rules face fines of as much as 10 percent of their global turnover unless they gain whistle-blower immunity. In a call with journalists Zetsche declined to comment on whether German carmakers had colluded. We are well advised not to participate in speculation, Zetsche said, refusing to comment further. Asked whether such allegations could result in consequences for cooperation deals, such as a procurement agreement with BMW (BMWG.DE), Zetsche said: Since we obviously operated within the law, none.  Daimler's and Volkswagen's (VOWG_p.DE) supervisory boards met on Wednesday to discuss the allegations. Luxury Stars  Second-quarter results showed Daimler's star performer remained its luxury cars division which helped push up quarterly operating profit by 15 percent, slightly below consensus. Mercedes-Benz sold 595,200 cars thanks to a 28 percent rise in Chinese demand. Margins improved to 10.2 percent from 6.4 percent in the year-earlier period, mainly due to sales of a new E-Class limousine. Daimler said it expects strong sales in China in the second half, after its overall earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) rose to 3.74 billion euros in the second quarter, below the average forecast of 3.81 billion euros in a Reuters poll. The Stuttgart-based company also lifted the outlook for its trucks and vans divisions, saying it now expected EBIT to reach prior-year levels for both.

Singapore-listed Noble also said it struck a deal to sell its U.S. gas and power business to Mercuria for $248 million. These moves will generate significant cash proceeds and allow the group to retire the US$2 billion Noble Americas Corp secured borrowing base revolving credit facility and the US$1 billion Noble Clean Fuels Limited secured borrowing base revolving credit facility, the company said in a statement on Wednesday. Noble said it expected to report a loss in its second quarter and that it had seen significant challenges from markets and lenders and customers to manage and support its business after its first-quarter loss. It said negotiations with its lenders were continuing. Noble's troubles started two years ago when its accounts were questioned by Iceberg Research, sparking a dramatic collapse in its share price and ratings agency downgrades, forcing a sale of its assets and a fund raising to allay financing worries in a brutal commodities market. Noble has stood by its accounts. (Reporting by Anshuman Daga; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman)"

The stake, which is worth as much as $4.5 billion and held in a fund belonging to Macquarie's infrastructure business, will be put up for sale later this year, according to two of the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity as the information is private. The timetable for the sale is dependent on Puget's discussions with the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission about the electric and gas prices the utility will charge going forward. Puget has applied to increase prices to fund upgrades to its infrastructure and other expenses, while the regulator recommended in June that Puget cut charges based on readjusting the value of a coal plant and costs relating to storm damages. A decision, on what is known as a general rate case, is due by mid-December. Macquarie and Moelis declined to comment. Infrastructure businesses, such as utilities, have been highly prized in recent years by investors due to their steady, long-term revenue generation. Avista Corp, another Washington-based electric utility, said last week it had agreed to be sold to Canada's Hydro One [HYDRO.UL] for $5.3 billion including debt, while Berkshire Hathaway and Elliott Management are currently competing to acquire Texas' Oncor Electric Delivery Co [TXEFHO.UL] for around $18 billion. Macquarie was part of a consortium including three Canadian pension funds that bought Puget in 2009 for $7.4 billion. Bloomberg News reported in June that Macquarie was considering selling Puget, whose core business - Puget Sound Energy - is a regulated utility serving 1.1 million electric and 790,000 natural gas customers, primarily in Western Washington state.

The San Francisco-based investment firm, fresh off a  victory at Buffalo Wild Wings Inc, is now throwing its weight behind hedge fund Engaged Capital, which for months has been urging Rent-A-Center to sell itself, arguing that an overhaul of the company could be best achieved in the hands of private owners. In a sharply worded letter, dated Tuesday, Marcato said at least one unidentified party interested in buying Rent-A-Center might raise its offer if management was ready to negotiate and warned directors not to stall. Unless Rent-A-Center promptly commences a full sale process, Marcato plans to initiate and/or support efforts to remove all incumbent directors who are up for election at the 2018 annual meeting, read the letter, signed by partner Shawn Badlani. It was seen by Reuters. In June Engaged Capital won a proxy contest and now has three board seats at Rent-A-Center, but the company is still brazenly ignoring the will of the shareholders, Marcato wrote in the letter. Rent-A-Center has rebuffed takeover interest from private firms HIG Capital and Lone Star Funds and turned down an offer of $800 million from buyout company Vintage Capital this month. Marcato believes Vintage could pay more for the company if management negotiated, and that its $15 per share offer was an opening offer, not Vintage's best and final offer, according to the letter. The stock was up 2.5 percent to $12.68 on Tuesday. While Rent-A-Center's strategic plan is showing some early results, Marcato warned that it is laden with risks. Shareholders want the board to explore strategic alternatives, Marcato said, adding that failure to listen could constitute a breach of your duty as fiduciaries. We hope each of you has contemplated the personal, legal and financial consequences of this behavior, the letter said. Marcato's Encore Fund, which owns the Rent-A-Center stake, has gained 19.5 percent through the middle of July, making it one of the industry's best-performing hedge funds. In June Marcato won a bitter proxy contest at Buffalo Wild Wings, forcing the CEO to retire and winning board seats.

The partnership, called Kingfisher, will initially include 25 of Lightsource's British solar assets with a combined capacity of 156 megawatts (MW), which have already secured government subsidies for their power production. The tie-up comes amid growing demand from institutional investors to access so-called 'real assets' such as energy infrastructure, keen to tap the steady income streams on offer at a time of lower returns in some financial markets. We believe this market continues to present attractive opportunities for institutional investors, Rory O'Connor, Managing Director and Head of Renewable Power for Europe at BlackRock said in a statement. BlackRock, which manages $5.7 trillion in assets, currently invests $30 billion across a range of real estate and infrastructure assets. Falling costs have seen Britain's solar power industry expand over the past few years to around 12,000 MW of capacity, up from around 2,000 MW five years ago. Assets with a further 50 MW of capacity in Northern Ireland, which have also secured subsidies, will be added to the portfolio later in the year once they begin operation, and the venture is targeting a total capacity of around 1,000 MW. Solar power output in Britain hit a record high of 8,700 MW earlier this year, providing 24 percent of the country's electricity supplies at the peak.

Sybenetix will enable the exchange group to expand its current market surveillance technology offering to service buy-side firms, Nasdaq said on Tuesday. It did not disclose the amount it intends to pay, but said the purchase price would be funded with cash on hand.   Nasdaq Chief Executive Officer Adena Friedman has been vocal about investing more in innovative technologies such as cognitive computing. This deal is Nasdaq's first acquisition since her appointment in January. Other than running stock exchanges, Nasdaq has a large division that sells market technology to trading firms, exchanges and clearing houses around the world.  It runs a leading market surveillance software businesses, which includes a product called Smarts that helps brokers, exchanges and regulators identify potentially abusive trading across a range of markets. More than 45 marketplaces, 17 regulators and 140 market participants use its surveillance tools. Our primary goal with this is our entry into the buy-side market with a compliance solution, Valerie Bannert-Thurner, senior vice president and head of risk & surveillance solutions at Nasdaq, said in an interview. We talk to firms globally who are looking at how they can beef up their surveillance and improve their compliance. The acquisition will also enable Nasdaq to develop solutions that analyze data beyond trading records to better spot conduct risk, Bannert-Thurner said.  Sybenetix was founded in 2011. Its technology uses advanced analytics and behavioral science to help buy-side firms such as hedge funds spot patterns for compliance purposes, but can also be used to enhance their performance.  Investors have been growing more interested in the sector known as regtech: companies offering technology that helps banks and investors cope with an array of post-financial crisis regulations in order to avoid hefty fines. Regtech startups such as Sybenetix take advantage of technology to automate the analysis of vast amounts of data, helping financial firms improve the effectiveness of their compliance operations at lower costs.

The $66 billion deal, the last of three mega takeovers in the sector, has faced criticism from environmental and agricultural groups as well as lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic, concerned about the combined entity's market share. Avaaz said in a letter to European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestagerhad that more than one million people had signed its petition opposing the merger of the German and U.S. companies, which it said would have a major impact on farmers. It would control more than one-fourth of the combined global market for seeds and pesticides and lock farmers ever tighter into a supply chain for products that threaten biodiversity and food security by creating dangerous, genetically modified and pesticide-addicted monocultures, Avaaz lawyer Nick Flynn said in the letter. The European Commission, whose preliminary review of the deal will end on Aug. 7, did not immediately respond to a request for comment while Bayer said: The combination of Bayer and Monsanto will enable us to offer farmers more and better solutions through complementary technologies, products and geographic expertise. FILE PHOTO: A trader works at the post where Monsanto Co. is traded on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S., August 25, 2016.Brendan McDermid/File PhotoU.S.-incorporated Avaaz, which is funded by its members, is active in climate change, poverty, conflict and corruption issues.  Bayer has been bracing for a full-scale EU investigation. In May it said it expected to close the deal by the end of the year, suggesting it expects a four-month probe at the end of the EU's initial scrutiny. The company has agreed to sell its Liberty herbicide and LibertyLink-branded seeds businesses to address regulatory concerns. Both compete with Monsanto's Roundup weed killer and Roundup Ready seeds. Dow only secured regulatory clearance to acquire DuPont after pledging to sell key research and development activities and other major assets.

The pan-European STOXX 600 fell 0.2 percent as gains in heavyweight financials helped offset losses in other sectors. Euro zone bluechips ended flat. Gemalto dropped 19.7 percent after the digital security company on Friday warned on profit for the fourth time since October, citing continued weakness in its SIM-card and U.S. payments operations. We continue to see both these businesses with double-digit (sales) declines given our view of limited unit growth and pricing pressures, Credit Suisse analysts said as they cut their target price. Societe Generale and Natixis both reduced their recommendations on the stock following the warning. Shares in carmakers fell after EU antitrust regulators said they were investigating allegations of a cartel, with Volkswagen , Peugeot, Daimler, Renault and BMW between 1.3 and 2.8 percent lower. This brought the autos index to a seven-month low and made it the day's worst-performing sector, with a fall of 1.4 percent by the close. It's clearly bad for sentiment, which was already burned by the emissions scandal, Michael Punzet, autos analyst at DZ Bank said, adding that he expects high volatility related to the upcoming newsflow. Jefferies analysts said: One cannot rule out material fines should anti-competitive behaviour be confirmed, up to the maximum allowed under EU rules. That would be 10 percent of annual turnover, they added. Budget airline Ryanair fell 1.1 percent after it warned summer fares would face sharp cuts, though it said profit soared 55 percent in its first quarter. Wizz Air and EasyJet sank 1.3 and 2.8 percent, while Lufthansa rose 0.5 percent. Switzerland's third largest private bank Julius Baer rose 4.5 percent after reporting its biggest inflows since the financial crisis for its first half, helped by a push to recruit more private bankers. We expect the market EPS (earnings per share) estimates to go up by a mid-single digit figure and argue that Baer deserves higher price-to-earnings multiples reflecting stronger net new assets, Baader Helvea analysts said. Among leading gainers was B&M; European Value Retail , up 4.9 percent after a report that Asda, the British supermarket arm of U.S. retail giant Wal-Mart, was considering a 4.4 billion pound takeover bid. Shares in Dutch healthcare technology firm Philips also gained 4 percent after its profit rose 15 percent in the second quarter, helped by strong sales of consumer personal care products.

The $66 billion deal, the last of three mega takeovers in the sector, has faced criticism from environmental and agricultural groups as well as lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic, concerned about the combined entity's market share. Avaaz said in a letter to European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestagerhad that more than one million people had signed its petition opposing the merger of the German and U.S. companies, which it said would have a major impact on farmers. It would control more than one-fourth of the combined global market for seeds and pesticides and lock farmers ever tighter into a supply chain for products that threaten biodiversity and food security by creating dangerous, genetically modified and pesticide-addicted monocultures, Avaaz lawyer Nick Flynn said in the letter. The European Commission, whose preliminary review of the deal will end on Aug. 7, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. U.S.-incorporated Avaaz, which is funded by its members, is active in climate change, poverty, conflict and corruption issues. Bayer has been bracing for a full-scale EU investigation. In May it said it expected to close the deal by the end of the year, suggesting it expects a four-month probe at the end of the EU's initial scrutiny. The company has agreed to sell its Liberty herbicide and LibertyLink-branded seeds businesses to address regulatory concerns. Both compete with Monsanto's Roundup weed killer and Roundup Ready seeds. Dow only secured regulatory clearance to acquire DuPont after pledging to sell key research and development activities and other major assets.

Analysts and investors have speculated that Amazon is aiming to combine its expertise in order fulfillment with the grocer's facilities to build out delivery of fresh food, but the online retailer has not yet detailed its plans.   Amazon visited Georgia grass-fed meat producer White Oak Pastures in March, 2-1/2 months before announcing the $13.7 billion Whole Foods takeover, to discuss a possible distribution deal, White Oak owner Will Harris told Reuters. The retailer later asked the farmer to invite other U.S. livestock producers to discuss distribution of organic and grass-fed meat, Harris said.  Amazon declined to comment. We are excited about exploring possibilities with them, Harris said. It suggests that this niche in the market is becoming mainstream enough that they feel their delivery system might have traction with it. U.S. sales of organic meat and poultry, worth $991 million, climbed 17 percent last year, marking its fastest-ever annual growth, according to the Organic Trade Association (OTA). White Oak and some of the other meat producers invited to the Atlanta meeting already sell to Whole Foods, Harris said. A sign explains animal treatment standards in the meat department at a Whole Foods Market in Medford, Massachusetts, U.S., July 24, 2017.Brian SnyderThe meeting between producers and Amazon was confirmed by Carrie Balkcom, executive director of the American Grassfed Association.  White Oak workers pack frozen beef, duck and lamb into boxes at the Bluffton, Georgia ranch for couriers to pick up twice a day. I'm just certain that Amazon is better at it than us, Harris said. I'm a farmer and they're logistics people.  Slideshow (5 Images)The ranch sells about $2 million worth of meat online annually, making up its fastest-growing segment and 10 percent of total revenues. I sell a very niche product, Harris said. I think Amazon will add a whole other dimension. Amazon's expansion in organic products through Whole Foods bodes well for the sector, said Nate Lewis, farm policy director at OTA. If Amazon can apply its efficiencies of scale to the Whole Foods Market segment, and pass along those savings (to consumers), I would not be surprised to see more growth in the protein side, Lewis said. But some organic farmers worry that Whole Foods under Amazon might import meat from lower-cost producers rather than buy U.S. supplies. “It could be as bad as shutting us out or as good as expanding the market, said Mark Smith, whose Aspen Island Ranch is not involved in the meeting. Smith's ranch is part of a Montana co-operative that sells organic grass-fed beef to Whole Foods through a third party.

The maker of Ray-Ban sunglasses agreed in January to merge with Essilor, the world's biggest lens manufacturer, to create an industry leader with annual sales of more than 15 billion euros ($18 billion). Luxottica CEO Massimo Vian told Reuters on Monday the merger, which needs to clear antitrust hurdles in several countries, was progressing well. He also confirmed full-year guidance for a low-to-mid single digit percentage rise in sales at constant currencies and broadly similar operating and net profit growth, excluding one-off items. We stick by our outlook ... and we do so with a lot of positive energy, he said. Luxottica's sales grew 1.8 percent at constant exchange rates in the first half to 4.92 billion euros, roughly in line with estimates. Operating profit came in at 899 million euros net of one-off items, ahead of an average estimate of 873 million euros in a Reuters poll of analysts and up 1.9 percent year-on-year at constant currencies. It accounted for 18.3 percent of sales. An expanding retail network lifted European sales by 15 percent net of currency swings in January-June. But sales in North America, which account for about 57 percent of the total, fell 1 percent, hurt by Luxottica's efforts to curb discounts applied to its spectacles both online and at its Sunglass Hut and LensCrafters retail chains. A streamlining of the group's distribution network in China aimed at fighting counterfeiting and a parallel market for Ray Ban sunglasses drove Asia-Pacific sales down 5.6 percent. After cutting independent distributors last year to deal directly with retailers, Luxottica decided to focus on direct sales either online or through its Ray Ban shops while keeping only a few selected wholesale clients. We became even more convinced that our strategy was right ... and we decided to speak directly to consumers, Vian said. Following news last week of the departure of another senior manager at Luxottica, Vian said he was firmly committed to the group which he considered more as a family than as a company. Luxottica has been through several management changes since founder and top investor Leonardo Del Vecchio took back the reins of the company around three years ago. $1 = 0.8587 euros

Greece last ventured into international bond markets with two issues in 2014, a year before then newly elected Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras signed up to a new bailout, the country's third since 2010, after months of tense negotiations with the European Union and the International Monetary Fund. Last month Greece concluded a crucial bailout review and its lenders offered some detail on the measures that will be carried out, when its current bailout ends in 2018, to ease its debt mountain, which now stands at 180 percent of economic output. That development opened the way for Greece's market foray, which the Tsipras government says should be viewed as a test run and considered part of an overall strategy to ensure the country can fully return to markets next year. This decision is a significant step, part of Greece's strategy to regain viable and steady access to international markets, Tsipras's office said in a a statement, referring to the new five-year bond issue. Greece mandated BNP Paribas, Citigroup Global Markets, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, HSBC and Merrill Lynch as joint lead managers for the benchmark-size offering. It said the cash to be paid for outstanding bonds would be equal to 102.6 percent of the nominal amount of each bond. The pricing of the offering of new bonds is expected to occur on Tuesday, subject to market conditions. Settlement is expected on Aug. 1. Holders of outstanding bonds tendered in the switch offer will receive accrued interest. The switch and tender offer is conditional on the successful pricing and closing of the new notes offering in an amount, with pricing and on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Republic, Greece said in a statement. Yield The yield on the government bond maturing in 2019 fell on Monday to its lowest level since it was issued three years ago, as Athens prepared its market foray. It fell as much as 40 basis points to 3.42 percent {nL5N1KF35S]. Greece's European creditors are keen for the crisis-hit country to develop a strategy to gradually regain market access so that it will be able to stand on its own feet in 2018, but they have also urged Greece to stick to bailout reforms. European Union Economic Affairs Commissioner Pierre Moscovici was due to arrive in Athens on Monday and was expected to discuss Greece's market foray with Tsipras on Tuesday. The IMF last week approved in principle a $1.8 billion standby loan arrangement for Greece, making a conditional commitment to help underpin the country's bailout program for the first time in two years. But the fund will not make any money available until after it receives specific and credible assurances from Greece's European lenders to ensure the country's debt sustainability. Debt swaps that may improve Greece's maturity profile without increasing its overall load can ease forays into bond markets. Effectively the new issue is neutral as regards the debt sustainability of Greece, said Athens-based Eurobank economist Platon Monokroussos. Standard and Poor's rating agency revised Greece's outlook to positive from stable on Friday, while ratings agency Moody's upgraded Greece's rating to 'Caa2' from 'Caa3' last month. Reuters first reported last year that Greece was considering the possibility of two or three small bond issues before the expiration of the present bailout programme.

The contract involves installing long range integrated security systems at nine offshore sites in the Gulf, two sources said adding more tenders are expected as Aramco considers expanding its offshore oilfields and upgrading their security. Saudi Arabia, the world's largest crude oil exporter, said in June it had detained three Iranians who it said were members of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) approaching the kingdom's offshore Marjan oilfield on a boat. Iran said those detained were fishermen. Aramco declined to comment on the contracts or its security plans, but said in an emailed statement that it considers the security of its employees and facilities a top priority and are of the utmost importance. General Dynamics declined to comment, while Raytheon did not respond to an emailed request for comment and Rheinmetall could not be reached for comment.  Leonardo, the parent company of Selex, declined to confirm whether it was bidding for the contract but said it was pursuing growing commercial opportunities in the region. The company is following closely emerging security needs in the Gulf area, including in the oil and gas industry, a Leonardo spokeswoman said.

The Japanese drugmaker said on Monday it was particularly attracted by Neuroderm's Parkinson's disease drug that is in advanced clinical trials in the United States and Europe and is expected to go on sale in the 2019 financial year. It said the deal was intended to help it achieve its U.S. sales target of 80 billion yen ($722 million) by its 2020 financial year.  The deal will be the largest ever purchase of an Israeli firm by a Japanese company, surpassing internet retailer Rakuten Inc's (4755.T) $900 million acquisition of chat app Viber in 2014. It will also be the largest acquisition of an Israeli pharmaceutical company. Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma will pay $39 for each Neuroderm share, a premium of about 17 percent to its Friday close. The deal has the backing of Neuroderm's board and is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2017 following shareholder and regulatory approvals. The price is also a 79 percent premium to Neuroderm's share price on June 9, before the stock began climbing on media reports the company was considering a sale. Neuroderm's Nasdaq-listed shares were up 15.2 percent at $38.25 in pre-market trade. Given the significant premium offered and existing shareholder agreements, we regard a counter bid to perhaps be unlikely, Jefferies analyst Peter Welford said in a note to clients. Neuroderm is developing drug-device combinations for central nervous system disorders and its lead product is ND0612 for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. Neuroderm has said its goal is to submit regulatory applications for ND0612 in Europe by the end of 2018. Welford said if the drug was approved, peak sales worldwide could reach $1.7 billion.

Helios, a private equity firm, is to acquire 100 percent of Fertilizers and Inputs Holding B.V., a distributor of fertilizers, crop protection products, seeds and industrial chemicals in West Africa that has annual sales of around $300 million, Helios and Louis Dreyfus said in a statement on Monday. Financial terms of the transaction, which is pending regulatory approval, were not disclosed. Louis Dreyfus had said last year it was pursuing an outright sale for its African fertilizer activities, while looking for joint venture partners for its fertiliser businesses in other regions. Fertilizer is one of the areas, along with metals, juice and dairy, in which Louis Dreyfus has decided to seek partners while it focuses more on core activities like grains and oilseeds. Dreyfus is part of the so-called 'ABCD' quartet of trading giants alongside Archer Daniels Midland, Bunge and Cargill that dominate global flows of agricultural commodities. The trading giants have seen their margins crimped by large crop inventories, low prices and limited volatility, triggering restructuring efforts. An approach by diversified commodity group Glencore towards Bunge has also raised the prospect of larger-scale consolidation in agricultural commodity trading. Louis Dreyfus reported a second year of falling core profits in 2016 but said it expected to its restructuring to help its results this year. The exercising of a put option by minority family shareholders to sell nearly 17 percent of the group's holding firm has also fuelled speculation that Russian-born Margarita Louis-Dreyfus will seek a new shareholder for the 166-year-old firm she controls.

Burns and Guy Laurence, a British telecoms veteran who was chief executive of Canadian telecoms firm Rogers until last year were elected to VEON's new 11-seat board of directors. VEON has expanded the board to make a majority of directors independent of its two main investors, LetterOne Investment, controlled by Russian billionaire Mikhail Fridman and his partners, and Norwegian mobile operator Telenor. Last week VEON said it was making progress in a strategy to reinvent itself as an online player by introducing its messaging and mobile services app in four new markets, including its largest, in Russia and Pakistan.  It first introduced the service, designed to compete with the likes of WhatsApp or Viber, in Italy, where it has a joint venture with CK Hutchison to run the country's biggest mobile network operator. LetterOne Investment, which holds a 48 percent stake in VEON, is retaining three seats on VEON's board, while Norwegian government-controlled mobile operator Telenor holds just under 20 percent of shares and two seats.

Oaktree Capital Management LP, Tembec's top shareholder which earlier opposed the deal, and another shareholder Bennett Management agreed to vote for the revised offer, Rayonier said. Oaktree last week asked other shareholders to reject Rayonier's deal, terming it as a flawed sale process, and that there was a significant value gap between the offer price and the real value of Tembec. Oaktree and Bennett together own about 37 percent of Tembec's outstanding shares. Under the revised terms, Tembec shareholders could elect to receive either C$4.75 in cash or 0.2542 share of Rayonier common stock per Tembec common share, subject to proration so that about 67 percent of total consideration in cash and about 33 percent is paid in Rayonier common stock. Rayonier, which makes high-value cellulose specialties fibers, said in May it would buy Tembec for C$4.05 per share, to expand into packaging and forest products. Including debt of $487 million, the deal was then valued at about $807 million. The deal was already approved by Germany's federal cartel office in July. Rayonier's latest offer price is at a premium of 11.5 percent to Tembec stock's Friday close and a 61 percent premium to its pre-offer closing price on May 24. The revised terms were approved by the boards of both companies, Rayonier said late Sunday. Reporting by Sangameswaran S in Bengaluru; Editing by Gopakumar Warrier"

Another investor – ClearSky – is expected to join Blackstone in the deal as a secondary buyer for 10 percent, Calcalist said. An NSO spokesman said he could not confirm the report. Blackstone, a New York-based buyout firm, was not immediately available to comment. ClearSky did not immediately respond to a Reuters' request for comment. NSO has come under international scrutiny in recent months amid allegations the Mexican government has used NSO's Pegasus mobile spyware to target private citizens. Cyber researchers with Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto's Munk School of Global Affairs said last month the Mexican government tried to install Pegasus software on devices belonging to opposition lawmakers as well as private citizens including human rights lawyers and journalists. Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto has asked the attorney general's office to investigate the allegations about the use of Pegasus. He said he wanted to get to the bottom of the accusations, which he said were false. U.N. human rights experts on Wednesday called on the Mexican government to conduct an impartial investigation into allegations of illegal spying. NSO was founded in 2009 by Omri Lavie and Shalev Hulio. Private equity firm Francisco Partners paid $120 million to acquire a majority stake in NSO in 2014. Calcalist said Francisco Partners could achieve a partial exit via the deal four times bigger than its initial investment. A month and a half ago, NSO distributed a $230 million dividend that will not be included in the deal's value, the newspaper reported. Under the deal, Francisco Partners will own 40 percent of NSO, Blackstone and ClearSky together will hold 40 percent, the founders will have 6 percent each and the company's 500 employees will hold the remaining 8 percent.

DAE priced $500 million of 4 percent notes due in 2020, $800 million 4.5 percent bonds due in 2022 and $1 billion 5 percent bonds due in 2024, according to a company statement. DAE, the aircraft leasing and maintenance company controlled by the government of Dubai, will use part of the proceeds from the bond sale, together with cash on hand, to pay for the acquisition of Dublin-based lessor AWAS, announced earlier this year. Reuters reported on June 19 that DAE planned to raise up to $2 billion to finance part of the AWAS acquisition. DAE said in April it was acquiring AWAS from private equity firm Terra Firma Capital Partners and the Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB). The acquisition, subject to regulatory approval, is expected to close in the third quarter. DAE will emerge as one of the world's major aircraft lessors once the deal completes, increasing its fleet from 131 owned, managed and committed jets to 394 with a total value of over $14 billion. It will have more than 110 airline customers spread across 55 countries. DAE is to consider an aircraft order of more than 20 new aircraft once the acquisition completes, Chief Executive Firoz Tarapore has said. It is interested in buying narrow and wide-body jets from Airbus and Boeing, and turboprop aircraft from ATR which is co-owned by Airbus and Italy's Leonardo.

The lawmakers asked that the review include consideration of what effect the merger could have on access to healthy foods in less privileged areas, or food deserts, where residents may have limited access to fresh groceries. While we do not oppose the merger at this time, we are concerned about what this merger could mean for African-American communities across the country already suffering from a lack of affordable healthy food choices from grocers, the letter said. The letter was signed by U.S. Representative Marcia Fudge and 11 additional Democrats, including Senator Cory Booker. It was made public by the United Food and Commercial Workers union (UFCW), which represents many of the unionized grocery workers in America. Fudge's office confirmed it was sent by her. Amazon did not respond immediately to a request for comment. Amazon's plan announced in June to buy premium grocer Whole Foods for $13.7 billion roiled the grocery industry and sparked worries the deal could raise prices, reduce the quality of products and possibly hurt employment. Still, most antitrust experts expect the Federal Trade Commission to approve the planned merger. The letter asking for more scrutiny was praised by the UFCW union. “Political concerns about Amazon’s acquisition of Whole Foods are growing for good reason,” said Marc Perrone, President of the UFCW. “Amazon’s monopolistic desire to control the retail market and replace good jobs with automation is not only a direct threat to the hard-working men and women at Whole Foods, it’s also a direct threat to our economy and consumers.

Sprint Corp (S.N) acquired Clearwire in 2013 after a bidding war with Dish Network Corp (DISH.O) pushed the price to $5 per share, valuing Clearwire at about $14 billion.  After Clearwire shareholders approved the deal, an affiliate of Aurelius that had opposed the Sprint acquisition brought what is known as an appraisal action, asking a judge to determine fair value of the stock. The affiliate had sought $16.08 for each of its 25 million shares, or about $400 million. Vice Chancellor Travis Laster on Friday sided with Clearwire, which had said the fair price was $2.13 per share, or about $53 million for the fund's stock. Aurelius will also collect interest. The ruling stands out for a court that rarely finds fair value below deal price, let alone more than 50 percent below. The decision can be appealed.  A spokesman for Aurelius, which spent years battling Argentina over its defaulted debt, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Sprint, controlled by Japan's SoftBank Group Corp (9984.T), said it was pleased the court recognized Clearwire shareholders received a significant premium. Wall Street dealmakers have urged Delaware judges and lawmakers to discourage appraisal, which has been become an investment strategy for hedge funds. Minor Myers, a professor at Brooklyn Law School who studies appraisal, called the ruling unusual. Typically, each side presents extreme valuations and the judge finds fair value somewhere in the middle. Instead, Laster took Clearwire's valuation and rejected Aurelius's. I think it's a message to litigants to be sure the arguments they put in front of the court are reasonable, said Myers.  The court has been criticized by dealmakers for not deferring to the negotiated deal price when a company ran a proper marketing and sale process. Laster found the Clearwire sale was fair to minority investors, but only after Dish intervened and the price was driven to $5 per share.  The Delaware court has ruled in the past year that computer maker Dell Inc and DFC Global Corp, a lender, were both sold below fair value despite properly run mergers. Those cases are on appeal.

Amazon has long had a presence in Washington, lobbying on a broad range of topics ranging from taxes, immigration, trade and mobile payments. But their decision, announced in June, to buy premium grocer Whole Foods for $13.7 billion roiled the grocery industry and has sparked some opposition on Capitol Hill and among unions and other Amazon critics. That said, most antitrust experts expect the Federal Trade Commission to approve the planned merger. Complicating the company's status in the nation's capital, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos bought The Washington Post - a newspaper that has drawn the public ire of Donald Trump. Candidate Trump famously said in May 2016 that Amazon has a huge antitrust problem. Amazon is on pace to spend more than $12 million this year, if they keep up their lobbying efforts at the same rate. In 2016, the online retailer spent $11 million on lobbying in Washington. The company's lobbying effort more than doubled in 2015 compared with prior years, spending $9 million that year compared with $4.7 million the year before. Amazon added a new firm to the lobbying army in the second quarter of 2017, hiring McGuireWoods Consulting to handle work on drones, among other matters. In addition to consultants, Amazon also employs in-house lobbyists. Their latest filing lists some 15 employees who lobby on behalf of the company on a long list of topics and issues ranging from drone policy to trade regulations and immigration to food stamp programs. Amazon also employs firms to lobby on its behalf on a range of topics. In the second quarter of this year, Amazon paid lobbying megafirm Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld $80,000 to lobby, primarily focused on the Marketplace Fairness Act - a bill that would allow state government to collect sales tax from online retailers. Amazon Prime Air, a subsidiary of the company, also paid Akin Gump to lobby on drone policy. They also filed a termination, indicating they won't be doing work for the subsidiary in future.

Volkswagen, whose Audi (NSUG.DE) division controls Ducati, has received several tentative bids with the Benetton family's investment vehicle Edizione Holding valuing the Monster motorbike maker at $1.2 billion, one of the sources said. Based in the Borgo Panigale district of the northern Italian city of Bologna, Ducati was launched in 1926 as a maker of vacuum tubes and radio components and its factory remained open during World War Two, despite several bombings. Volkswagen, Europe's largest carmaker, is reviewing several assets including a possible sale of its majority-owned transmissions maker Renk (ZARG.F) in a bid to move beyond a diesel emissions-cheating scandal that has left it facing billions of dollars in fines and settlements. As well as Edizione Holding, U.S. buyout fund Bain Capital, which owns a stake in Ski-Doo snowmobiles maker BRB, and two Indian motorbike firms, Eicher Motors (EICH.NS) and Bajaj Auto (BAJA.NS), have also bid for Ducati, the sources said. Indian carmaker Eicher controls Royal Enfield, a motorcycle brand established in 1893 which ranks as one of the oldest. Strategic bidders also include U.S. automotive firm Polaris Industries (PII.N), which earlier this year said it would wind down its struggling Victory Motorcycle brand. A shortlist of bidders for a second stage of the auction could be selected as soon as Saturday, two of the sources said. Volkswagen adviser Evercore has a long list of bidders including private equity funds such as Ducati's previous owner Investindustrial, CVC Capital Partners, Advent and PAI, all hoping to outbid industry players, the sources said. If it gets to the second round, Edizione Holding could seek to form a consortium with a financial investor, two of the sources said, in a bid to secure control of Ducati, whose racers have won the Superbike world championship 14 times, with Carl Fogarty and Troy Bayliss its most successful riders. Audi, Edizione Holding, Investindustrial, Advent and PAI declined to comment, while the other interested groups were not immediately available for comment. Pricing Challenges For some buyout funds, Ducati's valuation of up to $1.4 billion -- which sources said is based on a multiple of more than 10 times its core earnings of roughly 100 million euros - is a tall order as they lack the synergies that some motorbike makers could achieve. But Investindustrial founder Andrea Bonomi, who sold Ducati to Audi for about 860 million euros in 2012, is serious about a comeback, one of the sources said. China's Loncin Motor (603766.SS) was among a group of industry players that initially showed interest in Ducati, alongside Harley-Davidson (HOG.N).  The latter has, however, decided against making a bid due to Ducati's price tag, while it could not be established if Loncin Motor (603766.SS) had carried on bidding. Harley Davidson and Loncin were not immediately available for comment. A successful deal for Ducati, which last year had revenues of 731 million euros, would show Volkswagen boss Matthias Mueller is serious about reversing the company's quest for size. But offloading Ducati will need the blessing of Volkswagen's powerful labor unions, which control half the seats on the carmaker's 20-strong supervisory board, and recently repeated their opposition to a sale. Volkswagen is expected to base its final decision on several factors other than just price, one of the sources said, including being able to sign a straightforward transaction and getting positive feedback from its unions.

Bunge, the smallest of the listed global grains traders, rebuffed a bid from Glencore in May but its admission on Wednesday that second quarter earnings would disappoint has opened up the possibility that Glencore might make another approach, analysts said. To the extent that they underperform expectations, it's more likely that someone will look to acquire them or do some sort of transaction with them, John Rogers, senior vice president at Moody's, told Reuters. If Glencore, whose market capitalization is more than five times Bunge's $11 billion, does make a second attempt and is successful, it would be the industry's largest shake-up in decades and redraw the global food supply chain. The Glencore bid has made companies across the agribusiness space look at their assets in a new light, with a focus on return on invested capital, said Farha Aslam, analyst with Stephens Inc. Global grains trading has long been dominated by Bunge and its three main rivals - Archer Daniels Midland Co, Cargill Inc and Louis Dreyfus Corp. - who typically make money by buying crops locally from farmers and shifting them to global buyers. They own capital-intensive assets like warehouses, ships, barges and processing plants. But the landscape has changed dramatically in the last four years as bumper harvests have kept grain prices low and crimped trading profits. The big four traders - known as the ABCDs - have taken steps to diversify, selling underperforming assets and buying businesses which offer higher margins. Stepping Up Pace Glencore's move has stepped up the push for change and could herald a shake-up similar to the transformation of the agrichemicals industry, where six leading players are merging into three giants in deals totalling around $240 billion. Dow Chemical Co and DuPont are merging, China's ChemChina will buy Syngenta AG and Bayer AG has snapped up Monsanto Co. It was Bunge's own chief executive, Soren Schroder, who in May suggested consolidation among the grain traders was coming - and even said his company could lead it. Glencore, best known in metals and energy trading, has so far been one of the most active players, setting its sights on expanding its agricultural commodities business. It pursued Louis Dreyfus' grains business in recent years, but failed to strike a deal. The ABCDs are are also facing stiffer competition from players such as China's COFCO Group, which recently scooped up the agribusiness of Singapore-listed Noble Group and Dutch grain trader Nidera, and Japanese trading house Marubeni Corp , which bought U.S. grain handler Gavilon in 2012. COFCO, however, is likely to sit out the industry consolidation as it integrates recent acquisitions. Privately-held Cargill, the C of the big four, is two years into a restructuring and confident it can take part in the shake-up to come. It launched a restructuring effort in late 2015 and has already sold $700 million of assets and made strategic investments of $1 billion, including fish feeding and chocolate. Its latest quarterly profit was sharply higher than a year ago, suggesting the changes are bearing fruit. If our profitability continues to perform well, we just create more room for acquisitions, Marcel Smits, Cargill's chief financial officer told Reuters.

Payments firms have become targets for credit card companies and banks seeking to capitalize on a switch from cash transactions to paying by smartphone or other mobile devices. Ingenico shares jumped 10 percent shortly after the opening of the Paris stock exchange. The stock was up almost 8 percent at 88.82 euros at 0915 GMT. The acquisition of Bambora, which had gross revenues of 202 million euros in 2016, would lift Ingenico's earnings and lead to other benefits, Ingenico said in a statement on Thursday. Ingenico's takeover of Bambora follows a move this month by credit card processor Vantiv (VNTV.N) to buy Worldpay (WPG.L) for 7.7 billion pounds ($10 billion). French payments company Worldline (WLN.PA) also said this month it had agreed to buy Swedish peer Digital River World Payments. Bambora will enhance our customer-centric approach and will reinforce our online and in-store positioning through a perfect complementarity, said Ingenico Chairman and Chief Executive Philippe Lazare.  Private equity firm Nordic Capital launched Bambora in 2015 after acquiring a number of separate payment companies over the previous year.  The deal will increase Ingenico's availability online and in stores in the Nordics, North America and Australia, said Bryan Garnier analyst Richard-Maxime Beaudoux said, who has a Buy recommendation on the stock. Ingenico said the deal would be financed through available cash and debt. Its financial leverage would remain below 3 times EBITDA leaving Ingenico flexibility for future M&A.; Lazare told analysts on a call future M&A; targets might concern payments through Android phones.     Ingenico, which also reported higher first-half profits and sales on Thursday, expected the Bambora takeover to boost its earnings per share by around 5 percent by 2018 and said it hoped to close the deal by the end of 2017.

Under Chinese ownership since being bought by Zhejiang Geely Holding Group from Ford in 2010, Volvo has taken on larger rivals such as BMW and Daimler's Mercedes-Benz with new premium models. Volvo Car Group, one of Sweden's biggest companies by revenue, posted operating earnings of 6.8 billion Swedish crowns ($820 million) for the six months to June 30, against 5.6 billion crowns in the same period last year. Revenues rose to 99.1 billion crowns, up from 84.2 billion crowns, and the company said it remained confident sales this year would exceed the record high set only last year. The company aims to reach sales of 800,000 cars within the next few years. It sold 277,641 Volvos in the first half, up 8.2 percent from a year ago, as strength in China and Europe offset a lingering U.S. slump. Delivery problems have dogged Volvo in the United States this year, contributing to a 7 percent drop in first-half sales there. It does not have a manufacturing base in North America but is building a U.S. plant to boost supply. Volvo said it expected an upturn in the second half of the year and aimed to deliver solid full-year growth in the United States as tight global supply of its XC90 model eased and its new XC60 mid-size SUV hit the U.S. market. The demand from customers is really there, Samuelsson told Reuters. In the second half, we will have the XC60 launched and that is really for the U.S. market an even bigger car. Technology Sharing In a step towards closer ties with other brands controlled by its Chinese owner, Volvo said it was creating a joint venture with Zhejiang Geely to share technology.  Volvo, Geely Auto and LYNK & CO, a brand established last year and positioned between Volvo and Geely in price, would share vehicle architecture and engine technology via cross licensing arrangements managed by the venture.  We will unlock significant benefits across our portfolio by sharing both technologies and next-generation vehicle architectures, Zhejiang Geely Chairman Li Shufu said in a statement. I am confident these synergies can be achieved while preserving the separate identities and strategic autonomy of our different automotive brands, he said. Samuelsson said the deal would provide Volvo with greater development resources and speed up introduction of new technology in areas such as components for electric vehicles.  And, maybe most importantly, we can lower the material cost because we will have a higher volume for the common components and will source them jointly, he told Reuters. With earnings and sales rising, speculation has been growing that an initial public offering (IPO) is on the cards. Last year, Volvo took a step towards listing, raising 5 billion crowns from Swedish institutional investors through the sale of newly issued preference shares. But it said it had no immediate plans for an IPO. We try to act as a listed company, but currently we are not planning an IPO, Samuelsson said.

Light and Renova are owned by state-controlled Companhia Energética de Minas Gerais (CMIG4.SA), which recently announced a divestment plan aimed at reducing debt. The plan announced by the company, known as Cemig, may entail the full sale of both Light and Renova. Cemig declined comment. The Chinese investors could also be willing to inject capital into both companies to continue ongoing projects, advisory firm CIRI International Technology Co said in the letter dated July 10. CIRI said it was representing groups including PowerChina  which are seeking to buy renewable energy generation assets in Brazil. PowerChina wants to globalize operations and counts on CIRI's technical and financial support to execute these projects, the letter said. Interest in Brazil's renewable power industry is growing, especially among foreign investors, who see potential despite declining electricity consumption and a harsh recession.  CIRI's letter was sent shortly before Light, which partly owns Renova, said it had signed an agreement with Canada's Brookfield (BAMa.TO) to exclusively discuss a bid for Renova for 60 days. That suggested the assets of both Light and Renova may be sold together. Light distributes electricity in metropolitan Rio de Janeiro and owns about 900 megawatts of power generating capacity.

Mexico's Federal Telecommunications Institute (IFT) said in March that America Movil, controlled by the Slim family, must separate part of its network infrastructure into a new entity. The move ratcheted up antitrust measures against America Movil, which has long been dominant in Mexico and is Latin America's largest telecommunications company by number of subscribers.    Talks between America Movil and regulators on the details of the separation are ongoing, Chief Executive Daniel Hajj said on a conference call after company's second-quarter results, but he said a deal could be hashed out as soon as the fourth quarter of 2017 or during the first three months next year.   Hajj said the discussions have not touched on whether America Movil will be granted a license to offer pay television in Mexico, something the company has long sought. America Movil has also become Latin America's biggest pay TV provider.   Mexico is the only place where there is a limitation, Hajj said. It doesn’t make any sense. The restriction creates an imbalance between America Movil and competitors such as Mexican media company Grupo Televisa (TLVACPO.MX), which can sell bundles of landline, Internet and TV service to consumers, analysts said. What they are arguing is that because they already opened up their network for competitors, then the market should open up for them, said Carlos de Legarreta, an analyst at GBM.   In addition, the Supreme Court is considering whether to wipe away parts of a 2013 reform of the telecom sector that tilted the playing field against America Movil. A ruling could come as soon as August.  America Movil's lawyers maintain that legislators did not have the right to create asymmetrical rules meant to help smaller players.

Staff at Rasgas were told earlier this year that they would be laid off in June, with the job cuts following last year's decision to merge RasGas with Qatargas, the two liquefied natural gas divisions of Qatar Petroleum [QATPE.UL]. But in a company email last month staff were informed that the job cuts had been delayed, two Rasgas employees said. It was not immediately clear whether the delay meant the  entire merger had been postponed. The move comes as Qatar works to cope with sanctions imposed by Saudi Arabia and other Arab states, striking trade deals and cancelling the leave of foreign expatriate workers in essential government sectors to help cope with the crisis.        The layoffs were postponed. No reason was given, said one of the employees, who declined to be named. A Rasgas spokeswoman was not available to comment. Qatar Petroleum's chief executive said at the end of last year the merger of RasGas and Qatargas would help to cut operating costs by hundreds of millions of dollars at the world's largest LNG producer, and another group official familiar with the plan said hundreds of people would be laid off. An official working at a Gulf energy company said Doha was apparently postponing the layoffs because it needed to focus the attention of leaders and managers on the diplomatic crisis, which has disrupted some imports into the country. I still think the job cuts will happen in the long run, as the Rasgas-Qatargas merger will go ahead and many of the jobs are duplicated across both organizations, said the official.  This seems to be a case of 'we currently have bigger fish to fry than a fast merger'. Last month Qatar announced plans to expand its LNG production capacity by 30 percent and build infrastructure to bolster its role as a major global supplier amid rising LNG output from Australia and the United States. With the political crisis and this output expansion, it is all hands on deck, said a Qatar Petroleum official.   RasGas currently has a production capacity of about 37 million tonnes a year of LNG, according to its website. It is a 70/30 percent joint venture between Qatar Petroleum and Exxon Mobil Editing by Andrew Torchia, Greg Mahlich"

The 100-year old Chicago-based bank services asset managers has operations in London's Canary Wharf financial district. Continental Europe is a strategic area of focus for Northern Trust and the creation of our EU banking presence in Luxembourg highlights our commitment to growing our business in the region, Teresa Parker, president of Northern Trust in Europe, said. A base in Luxembourg will allow Northern Trust to continue serving customers across the bloc, irrespective of what sort of financial services trading terms Britain negotiates with the EU. Northern Trust's acquisition of UBS Asset Management's fund administration services in Luxembourg and Switzerland, is expected to close this year. Northern Trust said it had appointed David Wicks to the new role of head of continental Europe to set up the EU banking presence. Nicolas Mackel, chief executive of Luxembourg for Finance, said Northern Trust's decision was further recognition of the cross-border expertise and crucial strategic position of Luxembourg for non-EU financial services companies. The Grand Duchy is one of the EU's biggest centres for listing funds and has already attracted M&G; Investments, part of UK insurer Prudential, which plans to launch a range of Luxembourg-based funds.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/akzo-nobel-ceo-idUSL5N1KA0JE","UPDATE 3-Akzo Nobel CEO quits, successor must deliver merger defence promises","","Jul 19 2017","* Vanlancker has to deliver on performance promises(Adds analysts saying PPG unlikely to bid again soon)","AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - The chief executive of Akzo Nobel, Ton Buechner, has stepped down for health reasons, leaving his successor to deliver the higher sales and margins promised when the Dutch paintmaker fended off a U.S. takeover attempt this year. Chemicals division chief Thierry Vanlancker, 52, who joined in 2016, replaces Buechner, who repelled a 26.3 billion euro ($30.35 billion) bid by U.S. rival PPG Industries with promises to produce better investor returns alone. A chunk of the Dutch firm's shareholders, including hedge fund Elliott Advisors, were open to a PPG buyout and frustrated by Buechner's defense. PPG cannot swiftly launch a new bid after the change of CEO as Dutch market rules mean it must wait until November at the earliest. PPG may also be reluctant to try again as its bid was equally opposed by Akzo Chairman Antony Burgmans, who remains. Akzo shares traded flat at 77.96 euros in mid-morning trade. Vanlancker, a Belgian, now has to deliver the stronger sales growth and margin improvements that Buechner and Burgmans promised in their struggle to avoid a merger. Analysts say those targets will be tough to achieve. In his resignation statement, Buechner said: For me this was an extraordinarily difficult decision to make but my focus must now be on my health. Burgmans declined to elaborate on details of Buechner's illness, saying he regretted only that he has decided to step down. Buechner felt that if he continued to subject himself to the pressures of his office, that would endanger his health, Burgmans told reporters on a conference call. Buechner told Akzo's board about his decision on Tuesday, Burgmans said. Vanlancker was previously identified as the person who would take Buechner's job as part of emergency contingency planning. In his current post, Vanlancker was expected to oversee the sale or initial public offering (IPO) of Akzo's specialty chemicals division. Vanlancker previously worked for Chemours, which was spun off from DuPont in 2015. Buechner's surprise announcement means his tenure at Akzo Nobel has ended almost as it began. In September 2012, a half year after he took the top job, Buechner stepped down on his doctor's advice, suffering from what the company described as over-tiredness. He resumed work in December the same year. Buechner's tenure was mostly regarded as successful. Buechner has been responsible for overseeing the successful transformation of the business, including portfolio reshaping ..., de-risking of the pension funds, cutting costs and driving efficiency gains that have raised both margins and returns, Morgan Stanley analyst wrote in a note. But the firm faced a minor shareholder rebellion after it rejected talks with PPG, leading to a shareholder lawsuit still in progress seeking to have Burgmans ousted. Faced with opposition from Akzo's board, many employees and Dutch politicians, PPG walked away from its bid for Akzo on June 1. Baader Helvea analysts said changing the CEO was neither an indication that a renewed PPG bid with a higher success chance might occur nor that the activist investors were successful. Repeating a sell rating, they said Akzo Nobel's supervisory board was the main obstacle to a merger and said the company's operations have likely been suffering from higher raw material prices for key paint ingredients.

Some of these agreements are yet to be implemented, and there has been little evidence of progress on thornier issues, such as excess capacity in China's steel and aluminum sectors.     A looming Trump administration decision on whether to impose broad steel tariffs based on national security concerns is casting a cloud of uncertainty over the talks, which have been rebranded this year as the U.S.-China Comprehensive Economic Dialogue            Ross acknowledged that the dialogue has become more challenging as U.S. and Chinese officials grapple with more sensitive issues. Our objective, however, will continue to be specific deliverables by specific dates so that everyone on both sides can measure the results on a continuing basis, he said. U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross looks up while addressing the SelectUSA Investment Summit, National Harbour, Maryland, U.S., June 20, 2017.Kevin LamarqueChina trade experts said they expect new announcements on small openings of China's markets or specific purchases of U.S. goods, but these will not substantially alter the bilateral economic relationship. It would be more beneficial for U.S. interests if China would agree to end subsidies for state-owned enterprises and stop the theft of intellectual property, said Derek Scissors, a China trade expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute in Washington. But such larger reforms are unlikely to come before China's 19th Party Congress this autumn, where senior officials will want to preserve economic stability, Scissors added.           The annual bilateral talks, launched in 2006 and expanded by former President Barack Obama to include strategic and security issues, have been pared back under Trump to focus on trade and economic issues.  Chinese Demands China has concerns of its own to be addressed in the bilateral talks, Chinese Vice-Premier Wang Yang told the U.S.-China Business Council lunch, including outdated U.S. export controls for high-technology products. According to a translated text of his remarks, Wang said allowing such sales to China would help reduce the U.S. trade deficit, noting that China imported $227 billion worth of integrated circuits last year, but only 4 percent of that came from the United States. He said that the United States and China had no choice but to cooperate economically even if they wanted to buy and hire locally. It is important that both sides come to realize with cool heads that given the depth of our business cooperation, neither Chinese nor Americans can do without goods from the other country, Wang said.

SLS Management LLC said Abercrombie was not being aggressive enough in efforts to turn itself around amid falling sales at most of its brands. SLS owned 0.84 percent of Abercrombie's shares outstanding as of March 31, according to Thomson Reuters data. New Albany, Ohio-based Abercrombie operates around 700 stores in the United States and nearly 200 more internationally. SLS, in a letter to the company's board, laid out two ways for Abercrombie to buy back shares. The retailer could buy back $200 million of stock while slashing its annual dividend to 18 cents from the current 80 cents, SLS said. Alternatively, Abercrombie could sell its real estate assets that make up a substantial portion of its market value and use the proceeds from the sale to buy back shares, the investor added. A repurchase of almost 30 percent of Abercrombie's shares would be an important illustration of management's confidence in the turnaround and the attractiveness of the stock at current prices, SLS said. A spokeswoman for Abercrombie said the company maintains open dialogue with and regularly considers the views of its shareholders, including SLS Management. Abercrombie last week ended talks over a potential sale, dealing another blow to the retail sector that has struggled to cope with low mall traffic and changing consumer tastes. It had announced in May it was in preliminary discussions with several parties regarding a potential transaction, after having received expressions of interest.  Abercrombie received interest from both private equity firms and other retailers, a source familiar with the situation said, requesting anonymity because the conversations were confidential.  Mergers and acquisitions in the retail sector are difficult because cost savings can be counterproductive if it means squeezing money out of marketing and design, and buyers are taking a risk on a style that can easily go out of favor. Retailers including Aeropostale, Wet Seal and BCBG Max Azria Group LLC have filed for bankruptcy over the past two years. Shares of Abercrombie were up 2.3 percent at $9.49 in after-hours trading. Through Tuesday, the stock had fallen nearly 23 percent so far this year. Reporting by Aishwarya Venugopal in Bengaluru; editing by Sai Sachin Ravikumar"

AMC's shares dived over 10 percent on Monday after sources said regulators in China had told banks to stop providing funding for several of Dalian Wanda's overseas acquisitions amid broader curbs on companies moving funds overseas. The curbs on Wanda, announced at a meeting in June, focused on six overseas deals, four of which have already been completed, an internal bank document seen by Reuters showed. AMC said deals for Starplex Cinemas, Odeon & UCI Cinemas, Nordic Cinema Group and Carmike Cinemas Inc completed between 2015 and earlier this year were fully funded by the firm's own funds and loans from U.S.-based banks. At no time was Wanda ever a source of funding for any of these acquisitions or individual theatre purchases, AMC said in a statement. Wanda bought AMC for $2.6 billion in 2012, part of a broader push by the Chinese company firm into cinemas. The cinema chain added it had also never never received committed financing from any bank headquartered in mainland China for any purpose, including for acquisitions. The most recent four deals were funded by loans from syndicates of U.S. banks taken out by AMC and from AMC's own cash reserves. Beijing is on a major drive to control risks in its financial system, including firms taking on excessive levels of debt to fund overseas deals. Chinese authorities clamped down on capital outflows and overseas acquisitions last year. Rooted in property, Wanda is one of a handful of Chinese conglomerates that have expanded aggressively abroad over the past few years, into areas beyond their original business. It is controlled by one of China's richest men, Wang Jianlin. AMC's chief executive Adam Aron said in the statement that Wanda does not actively participate in the day-to-day running of AMC beyond its three seats on the company's board. AMC is an American company run from its Leawood, Kansas, headquarters by our management teams located in the U.S. and Europe, he said. AMC is the top cinema chain in the United States, and has around 1,000 theatres around the world. (Reporting by Adam Jourdan; Editing by Eric Meijer)"

Crown Castle, which has been looking to further diversify  from its traditional tower business, said it was buying the company from a group of investors including Berkshire Partners LLC and Pamlico Capital.  The deal doubles Crown Castle's fiber assets to about 60,000 route miles and gives it an opportunity to deploy small cell network in top northeastern metro markets, including Boston, New York and Philadelphia, the company said on Tuesday. Small-cell towers are increasingly in demand by wireless carriers as they try to boost coverage and increase capacity, especially in urban areas. Reuters reported last week that Crown Castle had made an offer for Lightower. Crown Castle said it expects the deal to add about $465 million to $485 million to adjusted funds from operations  before financing costs in the first full year of ownership and boost its annual dividend of $3.80 by 15 cents to 20 cents per share.  The company also said it expected Lightower to contribute $850 million to $870 million in site rental revenue. Crown Castle said it has received financing commitments from Morgan Stanley Senior Funding Inc and BofA Merrill Lynch of about $7.1 billion for new unsecured bridge facility. Morgan  Stanley & Co LLC was Crown Castle's financial adviser, while Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP provided legal counsel.

Hellman & Friedman, BC Partners and Apax have made it to the final stages of an auction process which was launched earlier this year by Swiss investment bank UBS (UBSG.S), they said. The three private equity investors are putting the finishing touches to their rival offers ahead of a July 19 deadline, the sources said, cautioning that price expectations might be hard to match. The company's 3 billion pound price tag and its exposure to the consumer credit market, which is facing tighter regulation and a possible spending slowdown after Britain leaves the European Union, have raised concern among prospective bidders that final offers may fall short of expectations, the sources said. Shop Direct, Hellman & Friedman, BC Partners and Apax declined to comment. The Barclay brothers have backed the British retailer for almost 15 years. They first acquired Littlewoods, one of the company's main brands, in 2002 from the Moores family and went on merging it with home shopping firm, ARG Equation - part of former retail group GUS - to create what now ranks as one of the largest online retailers in Britain. Based in Speke, near Liverpool in north west England, Shop Direct has a number of brands which include shopping sites Very.co.uk, VeryExclusive.co.uk and Littlewoods.com and generates overall annual sales of about 1.9 billion pounds. Last year, the business increased its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) by 18 percent to 230.5 million pounds and its owners are aiming for a valuation that represents at least 13 times its EBITDA, the sources said. The sales process initially drew interest from a large number of private equity investors who later walked away amid pricing challenges and growing concern over the future of Shop Direct's large stream of consumer credit revenues, the sources said.

Deutsche Boerse said that it was reviewing the matter, adding it continues to believe the allegations made are unfounded in all respects. Deutsche Boerse's board will spend some days reviewing the offer, outlined in a 10-page document that is not publicly available.

The plaque of the Deutsche Boerse AG is pictured at the entrance of the Frankfurt stock exchange February 1, 2012.Alex Domanski/File PhotoInsider trading goes against everything I stand for, he told shareholders in May.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/california-calpers-privateequity-idUSL3N1K923D","CalPERS says considering making own private equity investments","","Jul 18 2017","The California PublicEmployees' Retirement System (CalPERS) on Monday said it wasconsidering making direct investments in private companies, apotential major shift in strategy that would be the first suchaction by a U.S. public pension fund.","MONTEREY, Calif., July 17 (Reuters) - The California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS) on Monday said it was considering making direct investments in private companies, a potential major shift in strategy that would be the first such action by a U.S. public pension fund. The change, discussed at a meeting of CalPERS board in Monterey, would be closely watched by other U.S. public pensions as they look to improve returns on their investments, in part by cutting fees. The $323 billion pension fund, the largest in the country and a trend setter, has been under increasing pressure to achieve returns closer to the fund's assumed rate of return of 7 percent by 2020. In the fiscal year ended June 30, private equity investment returned 13.9 percent, the second best performer behind public equities, or stock portfolio. The asset class helped to boost the fund's total year-end returns to 11.2 percent, exceeding expectations for the first time since 2014. Private equity has been CalPERS' best performing asset class in the past two decades and accounts for about $26 billion of its portfolio. But CalPERS mainly invests in private equity funds and has been criticized for accepting the high fees and limited disclosures typically associated with the asset class. The shift in strategy, if adopted, is likely to require a considerable investment in staff and expertise in the years ahead to handle the strategic shift. CalPERS Chief Investment Officer Ted Eliopoulos told Reuters he would recommend CalPERS explore setting up a separate vehicle for direct investments and expand the current co-investment program. Eliopoulos suggested CalPERS focus on opportunities that do not compete with its current private equity investments, such as owning companies for longer than 10 years, and investing in technology and life science companies. CalPERS has a unique opportunity to be a leader in the co-investment space, Sandra Horbach, U.S. buyouts co-head at The Carlyle Group, told the board on Monday. CalPERS' massive size would make it a formidable player and allow the fund to dictate some investment terms, Horbach said. Most U.S.-based funds shy away from such investments, while Canadian pension funds are considered leaders in the strategy. By its own account, CalPERS has developed somewhat of a negative image among private equity firms as being difficult to work with and slow to make decisions, John Cole, CalPERS investment director, told the board at Monday's meeting. A number of funds have told us that we have become too unpredictable to do business with, and many larger general partners are cutting back the amounts that they are willing to allocate to us in their new funds, Cole said.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/snapdeal-ma-flipkart-idUSL3N1K91Z1","UPDATE 2-Indian e-tailer Flipkart ups odds of buying Snapdeal with raised bid -sources","","Jul 18 2017","* Flipkart ups Snapdeal offer by $100 mln to $900 mln-$950mln","MUMBAI (Reuters) - Indian e-commerce firm Flipkart's sweetened takeover offer of  up to $950 million for Snapdeal has improved the chances of a deal between the two rivals, though some sticking points are still being hashed out, two sources familiar with the matter said. Leading homegrown online retailer Flipkart has revised its offer for SoftBank-backed Snapdeal to between $900 million and $950 million, said the sources, adding the new proposal is being evaluated by Snapdeal's board. Reuters previously reported that Snapdeal had earlier this month rejected Flipkart's initial bid of between $800 million and $850 million as its board was unsatisfied with the offer and the payment terms.   Flipkart's revised offer was made for Snapdeal's marketplace and its e-commerce solutions provider Unicommerce, but does not include its logistics arm Vulcan Express and digital payments unit FreeCharge, which may be sold separately, said the sources, who did not want to be named as the discussions are not public. One of the sources said Flipkart may withhold $150 million of the deal price for 12-24 months after the consummation of a deal. Both sources said negotiations to address the concerns of Flipkart and Snapdeal shareholders were continuing. Japan's SoftBank (9984.T) is Snapdeal's biggest shareholder.  Flipkart plans to absorb Snapdeal's employees, but it has not given any assurances around levels of employee retention, said one of the sources, noting that this was a sticking point in the talks. Snapdeal currently employs about 1,500 staff.  FILE PHOTO: A private security gurad stands at a gate of Snapdeal headquarters in Gurugram on the outskirts of New Delhi, India, April 3, 2017.Adnan Abidi/File PhotoThe Snapdeal board is also, however, mulling listed e-commerce player Infibeam's (INFC.NS) proposal to acquire the company, the sources said, adding that the odds of a merger with Infibeam are slim. Details on Infibeam's offer were not immediately available.  Snapdeal is expected to make a decision on the two offers in the next 10 days, one of the sources said. SoftBank is keen to see Snapdeal folded into Flipkart and wants to financially back the biggest home-grown e-commerce provider as it battles Amazon.com (AMZN.O) for a larger share of India's booming online retail market. Flipkart's revised offer should settle the deal with Snapdeal in a few weeks time, said Satish Meena, senior analyst at research firm Forrester. There is nothing for SoftBank if Snapdeal goes and makes a deal with Infibeam. Shares in Infibeam were trading 3.6 percent higher on Tuesday afternoon. Flipkart, Snapdeal and some of its main backers were not immediately reachable for comment. SoftBank and Infibeam declined to comment. Axis Bank (AXBK.NS), India's third-biggest private sector lender, top digital payments firm Paytm and a few others are in talks to buy FreeCharge which was likely to be sold for between $70 million and $80 million, one of the sources said. Axis Bank did not respond to requests for comment while Paytm declined to comment. Reporting by Sankalp Phartiyal; Editing by Euan Rocha and Muralikumar Anantharaman"

The firm's Vice President of Public and Government Affairs Erwin Maryoto told Reuters in an email the decision was taken after completing a technology and market review.  Exxon's exit likely means further delays in developing a field that was first discovered in the 1970s. Difficulties with the field have included contract disputes and the remoteness of the block, which is on the southern edge of the South China Sea. The East Natuna field holds approximately 46 trillion cubic feet of recoverable gas resources, according to Exxon, although it comes with a carbon dioxide content of more than 70 percent - which also increases the cost of extracting useable fuel. State energy firm Pertamina had expected to sign a production sharing contract with ExxonMobil and Thailand's PTTEP for the project last year.  Syamsu Alam, Pertamina's upstream director, said the company has not been informed directly of Exxon's decision, but that it was committed to developing the East Natuna field, once a partner is found. Surely Pertamina wouldn't be able to develop the block alone, we need a partner, Alam told Reuters in a text message. Indonesia's government has received a letter from the U.S. oil major on its decision to pull out of the gas block, Wiratmaja Puja, director general of oil and gas at the energy ministry, told reporters.  In the letter, Exxon said developing the block would be uneconomical for the company under current terms, but it offered to help with technology and technical assistance for the project if needed, according to Puja.      Puja estimated that developing the project under current terms would make its gas too expensive, at about $10-15 per million British thermal units (mmBtu). That compares with spot prices for liquefied natural gas (LNG) in Asia that are currently less than $6 per mmBtu.      The government plans to invite Exxon to discuss the project again, saying it might offer a special incentive to make it economically viable, Puja said.  Malaysia's Petronas and France's Total were previously involved with the East Natuna project, but they have both pulled out.  In the past, Pertamina's official has said that developing the East Natuna project could cost up to $40 billion.  Reporting by Wilda Asmarini; Writing by Gayatri Suroyo; Editing by Tom Hogue"

The union, which does not represent Whole Foods employees but 800,00 clerks and other workers at other grocery chains, asked the Federal Trade Commission to carefully scrutinize the $13.7 billion deal but did not ask for it to be stopped. Amazon arguably poses a greater threat to our retail economy than any other online or traditional brick and mortar grocer, UFCW International President Marc Perrone wrote in a letter to the FTC. The deal's announcement last month sent grocery store share prices reeling because of the possibility that Amazon would move into food sales in a big way. Beset by online competition, retail bankruptcies this year have included big names like Radio Shack. Perrone argued that the proposed transaction would hurt consumers by giving Amazon such power over suppliers that prices could go up while the quality and variety of products could be reduced. Perrone also argued that automation would lead to reduced employment. Amazon's acquisition of Whole Foods is not about improving customer service, products or choice. It is about destroying Whole Foods jobs through Amazon-style automation, he wrote. Amazon has said previously that it has no plans to automate the jobs of Whole Foods cashiers and plans no job cuts.

The move represents the biggest shakeup in the 41-year-old firm's history since KKR's other co-founder, Jerome Kohlberg Jr, left it in 1987. It positions Bae and Nuttall to take over from Kravis and Roberts when the 73-year-olds decide to step down. Having joined the firm together over 20 years ago, Joe and Scott have a strong foundation of trust, professional respect and personal friendship that is critical for success, Kravis and Roberts, who will continue to serve as co-chairmen and co-chief executives, said in a statement. Unlike publicly listed peers such as Blackstone Group LP (BX.N), Carlyle Group LP (CG.O) and Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), KKR has never before named a president or someone with an equivalent title, a job that could serve as a stepping stone to eventually leading the entire firm. This was partly because of Kravis' and Roberts' concerns about alienating other members of their senior leadership team, sources inside the New York-based firm, who had identified Bae and Nuttall as frontrunners in the succession race, told Reuters in 2014. Those concerns were proven right on Monday as Alexander Navab, KKR's private equity chief in the Americas who was also hoping to succeed Kravis and Roberts, disclosed he would leave the firm following an orderly transition.   KKR's chief administrative officer Todd Fisher, another possible successor, also announced on Monday his intention to depart from KKR at the end of the year to pursue a career not related to investments. KKR said Fisher's decision was unrelated to KKR's move to appoint co-presidents. Bae, 45, was previously managing partner of KKR Asia and the global head of KKR's infrastructure and energy businesses. In his new role, he will focus on KKR’s global private equity businesses as well as its energy, infrastructure and real estate business, the firm said.  Nuttall, 44, served previously as head of KKR's global capital and asset management group. In his new role, he will concentrate on KKR's corporate and real estate credit, capital markets, hedge fund and capital raising businesses, together with KKR's corporate development, balance sheet and strategic growth initiatives, according to the firm.  Both Bae and Nuttall joined KKR in 1996. Nuttall had previously spent less than two years at Blackstone, while Bae had a similarly short stint at Goldman Sachs Group Inc's (GS.N) principal investments group.  Nuttall rose to become head of KKR's financial services investment team and also became involved early on with the firm's diversification into debt investments, which started in 2004. He also played a key role in taking KKR public, a process that involved merging the firm with an Amsterdam-listed fund in 2009 and then moving the listing to New York in 2010.  Bae was sent to Hong Kong in 2005 at the age of 33 to kick-start the firm's business in Asia, a diverse and fast-growing region whose capital markets are, for the most part, less developed, and in which several private equity firms accustomed to Western-style leveraged buyouts have struggled.  The Korean-American dealmaker's team launched its first Asian private equity fund in 2007, raising $4 billion from investors. Its success led to KKR raising a successor fund that amassed $6 billion, making it the largest private equity fund dedicated to Asia.  KKR last month announced it had completed raising a third private equity fund for Asia, amassing $9.3 billion. Day-to-Day Operations Bae and Nuttall will now be jointly responsible for the day-to-day operations of KKR, as Kravis and Roberts, who each have a net worth of $5.1 billion according to Forbes, focus more on cultivating relationships with investors and mentoring young talent. Kravis and Roberts, who are cousins, pioneered leveraged buyouts through the eponymous firm they created in 1976 alongside Kohlberg, with an initial investment of $120,000.  By attracting money from some of the world's largest institutional investors such as pension plans and sovereign wealth funds, the firm grew from a single $30 million fund in 1978 to around $140 billion in assets under management currently, spanning private equity, credit and real estate. KKR gained widespread recognition early on through its $25 billion leveraged buyout of tobacco and food conglomerate RJR Nabisco in 1988, a battle that was immortalized in the bestseller 'Barbarians at the Gate.' With a market capitalization of $15.7 billion, KKR has seen its shares soar 53 percent in the last 12 months, as the wider market rally buoyed the value of its assets.  Still, the stock is seen by many investors as undervalued compared to big asset managers such as BlackRock Inc (BLK.N). Activist hedge fund ValueAct Capital Management LP unveiled a 4.9 percent stake in KKR in April, arguing KKR's shares have the potential to reach $37.  KKR shares rose 1 percent to close at $19.44.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/sodastream-strategy-idUSL1N1K406A","SodaStream targets organic growth, hopes to employ more Palestinians","","Jul 17 2017","SodaStream International, whose stock has risen by more than 300 percent in 18months, is aiming to boost sales of its fizzy drink-makinghousehold devices in existing markets.","LONDON, July 17 (Reuters) - SodaStream International , whose stock has risen by more than 300 percent in 18 months, is aiming to boost sales of its fizzy drink-making household devices in existing markets. The Israel-based company, which used to market SodaStream with flavours, has switched to focus on turning tap water into sparkling water, which it says is more on trend with young, health-conscious consumers. SodaStream is marketing itself as an environmentally friendly rival to the bottled water businesses of Nestle , Coca-Cola and PepsiCo. It has a relatively strong presence in Nordic countries like Sweden, where about 24 percent of households have one of its namesake devices. But other big markets still offer a lot of room to grow, like Canada where penetration is only about 5 percent and the United States, which is around 1.5 percent. Our focus is to grow our own core business organically because we're just at the beginning, Chief Executive Daniel Birnbaum told Reuters in London on Monday. The company has also developed another device called SodaStream Ultimate, which can make single servings of hot and cold drinks using purified water. The product was developed in case Keurig Kold -- a project by Keurig and Coca-Cola -- took off, but that product's failure last year means SodaStream Ultimate has not yet had to launch. It's ready to launch but we have enough growth right now in our existing business model that we chose to wait on that machine right now, Birnbaum said. I think the market is not ready for it yet. I don't think single-serve is what consumers need. Palestinian Permits While the main focus is on organic growth, SodaStream is open to possible acquisitions, and could gain scale by adding other appliances or water-related devices, Birnbaum said. We're young in the process. It's not like we're on an aggressive hunt, he said. SodaStream was in the spotlight several years ago when critics were calling for a boycott over a factory it had in the West Bank. The company has since closed that factory, relocating to a new, much larger facility in southern Israel. The new factory employs some 80 Palestinians, who were given Israeli work permits and Birnbaum said he will ask the government for more permits as the business expands. It depends on how quickly we grow the business. It's a matter of need, he said, but estimated SodaStream could employ 150 Palestinians by the end of 2018. The company's 2017 forecast calls for annual revenue to grow 10 percent to about $524 million, excluding currency moves. (Reporting by Martinne Geller; editing by Alexander Smith)"

"https://www.reuters.com/article/kkr-succession-idUSL8N1K80CG","KKR names Bae, Nuttall as co-presidents in step towards succession","","Jul 17 2017","KKR & Co LP, the private equityfirm founded and headed by Henry Kravis and George Roberts, saidon Monday it had appointed Joseph Bae and Scott Nuttall asco-presidents and co-chief operating officers, setting them upas its future leaders.","July 17 (Reuters) - KKR & Co LP, the private equity firm founded and headed by Henry Kravis and George Roberts, said on Monday it had appointed Joseph Bae and Scott Nuttall as co-presidents and co-chief operating officers, setting them up as its future leaders. The move represents the biggest shakeup in the 41-year-old firm's history since KKR's other co-founder, Jerome Kohlberg Jr, left it in 1987. It positions Bae and Nuttall to take over from Kravis and Roberts when the 73-year-olds decide to step down. Having joined the firm together over 20 years ago, Joe and Scott have a strong foundation of trust, professional respect and personal friendship that is critical for success, Kravis and Roberts, who will continue to serve as co-chairmen and co-chief executives, said in a statement. Unlike publicly listed peers such as Blackstone Group LP , Carlyle Group LP and Apollo Global Management LLC , KKR has never before named a president or someone with an equivalent title, a job that could serve as a stepping stone to eventually leading the entire firm. This was partly because of Kravis' and Roberts' concerns about alienating other members of their senior leadership team, sources inside the New York-based firm, who had identified Bae and Nuttall as frontrunners in the succession race, told Reuters in 2014. Those concerns were proven right on Monday as Alexander Navab, KKR's private equity chief in the Americas who was also hoping to succeed Kravis and Roberts, disclosed he would leave the firm following an orderly transition. KKR's chief administrative officer Todd Fisher, another possible successor, also announced on Monday his intention to depart from KKR at the end of the year to pursue a career not related to investments. KKR said Fisher's decision was unrelated to KKR's move to appoint co-presidents. Bae, 45, was previously managing partner of KKR Asia and the global head of KKR's infrastructure and energy businesses. In his new role, he will focus on KKR’s global private equity businesses as well as its energy, infrastructure and real estate business, the firm said. Nuttall, 44, served previously as head of KKR's global capital and asset management group. In his new role, he will concentrate on KKR's corporate and real estate credit, capital markets, hedge fund and capital raising businesses, together with KKR's corporate development, balance sheet and strategic growth initiatives, according to the firm. Both Bae and Nuttall joined KKR in 1996. Nuttall had previously spent less than two years at Blackstone, while Bae had a similarly short stint at Goldman Sachs Group Inc's principal investments group. Nuttall rose to become head of KKR's financial services investment team and also became involved early on with the firm's diversification into debt investments, which started in 2004. He also played a key role in taking KKR public, a process that involved merging the firm with an Amsterdam-listed fund in 2009 and then moving the listing to New York in 2010. Bae was sent to Hong Kong in 2005 at the age of 33 to kick-start the firm's business in Asia, a diverse and fast-growing region whose capital markets are, for the most part, less developed, and in which several private equity firms accustomed to Western-style leveraged buyouts have struggled. The Korean-American dealmaker's team launched its first Asian private equity fund in 2007, raising $4 billion from investors. Its success led to KKR raising a successor fund that amassed $6 billion, making it the largest private equity fund dedicated to Asia. KKR last month announced it had completed raising a third private equity fund for Asia, amassing $9.3 billion. Day-to-Day Operations Bae and Nuttall will now be jointly responsible for the day-to-day operations of KKR, as Kravis and Roberts, who each have a net worth of $5.1 billion according to Forbes, focus more on cultivating relationships with investors and mentoring young talent. Kravis and Roberts, who are cousins, pioneered leveraged buyouts through the eponymous firm they created in 1976 alongside Kohlberg, with an initial investment of $120,000. By attracting money from some of the world's largest institutional investors such as pension plans and sovereign wealth funds, the firm grew from a single $30 million fund in 1978 to around $140 billion in assets under management currently, spanning private equity, credit and real estate. KKR gained widespread recognition early on through its $25 billion leveraged buyout of tobacco and food conglomerate RJR Nabisco in 1988, a battle that was immortalized in the bestseller 'Barbarians at the Gate.' With a market capitalization of $15.7 billion, KKR has seen its shares soar 53 percent in the last 12 months, as the wider market rally buoyed the value of its assets. Still, the stock is seen by many investors as undervalued compared to big asset managers such as BlackRock Inc. Activist hedge fund ValueAct Capital Management LP unveiled a 4.9 percent stake in KKR in April, arguing KKR's shares have the potential to reach $37. Shares closed trading on Friday at $19.25.

Volkswagen (VW) is working with Citi (C.N) to decide on the future of Renk, which may result in a sale of the maker of transmissions and bearings used in ships to wind turbines, the sources said. If a formal decision to sell Renk is taken, an auction could be kicked off as early as this autumn and the company could be valued at 600-800 million euros ($687-$916 million), they added. VW and Citi declined to comment.  VW is reining in spending, including cutting thousands of jobs at its core passenger-car brand, to help pay for a multibillion-euro shift to embrace electric cars and new mobility services.     It has already launched a sale of motorcycle brand Ducati.     Renk is 76 percent owned by VW unit MAN (MANG.DE) and had 390 million euros in equity and 214 million in cash, according to its 2016 annual report.  Last year, Renk posted profit before taxes of 65 million euros and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of about 80 million euros on sales of 496 million.      Bidders are expected to value the business at about 8-9 times its expected core earnings, a slight discount to peers such as Timken (TKR.N), Rexnord (RXN.N) and Allison Transmission (ALSN.N), which trade at 9-10 times.     Renk may be worth 10 times. But a buyer will need to offer minority shareholders a small premium. That could mean that Volkswagen will get slightly less for its stake, one of the people said.     Renk is expected to attract interest from private equity groups such as KKR, CVC, Cinven, Carlyle and Advent, the sources said.     Separately, some Renk peers are expected to look at the asset. However, Renk's exposure to the defense industry will make it hard for non-NATO buyers to acquire Renk, the sources said.      Japanese groups such as Sumitomo Heavy (6302.T), Kawasaki (3045.T) or Mitsubishi (7011.T) may take a look. But U.S. groups like Rexnord or Timken who would mainly be interested in the non-defense related products are unlikely buyers, another person close to the matter said.     Renk, founded in 1873, currently employs 2,200 staff. VW has said repeatedly in the past that it wanted to keep the business. Additional reporting by Jan Schwartz; Editing by Mark Potter"

Belgium-based ADB Safegate supplies visual guidance solutions from landing to parking for airplanes, including lighting systems for airport runways as well as docking and tower systems.  Private equity group PAI Partners bought ADB from peer investor Montagu in 2013 for 208 million euros and last year acquired docking guidance systems specialist Safegate International for an undisclosed sum. It merged the two groups to form ADB Safegate.  The sale values the company whose products are installed at 2,500 airports globally at more than 10 times its expected 2017 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of 70-80 million euros, one of the sources said. ADB was founded in 1920 by Belgian businessman Adrien de Backer, initially as a supplier of flood lights for theaters and sports grounds. It diversified into airfield lighting from 1947 and was acquired by Siemens in 1987, which eventually sold the company on to Montagu in 2009. Credit Suisse and Rothschild advised PAI on the deal while Citi and Lazard advised Carlyle. Carlyle, PAI and the banks declined to comment or were not immediately available for comment.

However, a CNBC report said Softbank was not in discussions to buy stock in the ride-hailing service. Uber, Softbank and Benchmark did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  The reports came after the Wall Street Journal earlier in the day said Uber's biggest rival in Southeast Asia, Grab, was posed to raise as much as $2 billion in funding from SoftBank and China's top ride-hailing firm Didi Chuxing. Uber has been facing a number of setbacks, including  accusations of a sexist work culture and driver protests, that culminated in the departure of co-founder and Chief Executive Travis Kalanick last month.

The deal announced in June marks the biggest acquisition for the world's largest online retailer. Amazon has not said what it would do with Whole Foods' stores and other assets, but analysts and investors worry the deal could upend the landscape for grocers, food delivery services and meal-kit companies.  U.S. Representative David Cicilline requested the hearing on Thursday in a letter to the chair of the House Judiciary Committee and the subcommittee chairman. Amazon and Whole Foods declined to comment. Amazon shares closed up 0.1 percent at $1,001.81. Whole Foods rose 0.3 percent to $42.10.  Amazon's proposed purchase of Whole Foods could impact neighborhood grocery stores and hardworking consumers across America, the Rhode Island Democrat said in a statement. Congress has a responsibility to fully scrutinize this merger before it goes ahead. The deal must be approved by U.S. antitrust enforcers, most likely the Federal Trade Commission. Congress plays no formal role in that process but hearings often highlight the possible impact of deals on consumers. The hearing is unlikely to happen without Republican support. FTC members are named by the president. A wild card in the review is the view of President Donald Trump, who famously said before his election that Amazon has a huge antitrust problem. Trump was unhappy about coverage of his campaign by the Washington Post, owned by Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos. Amazon.com's logo is seen at Amazon Japan's office building in Tokyo, Japan, August 8, 2016.Kim Kyung-Hoon/File PhotoCicilline's district includes most of the city of Providence, home to United Natural Foods Inc (UNFI.O), which is Whole Foods' primary supplier. The company, whose supplies account for roughly one-third of Whole Foods sales and has a contract with the retailer through 2025, said it did not ask the lawmaker to intervene. Prior to the Amazon bid, activist investor group Jana Partners had criticized Whole Foods for high costs associated with its United Natural Foods contract.  U.S. Representative Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, said in a podcast this month that Amazon's size and clout could hurt small retailers and eventually lead to higher prices. This week, hedge fund manager Douglas Kass from Seabreeze Partners Management Inc said he was shorting shares of the retailer after hearing rumblings on Capitol Hill about Amazon's size and clout. I am shorting Amazon today because I have learned that there are currently early discussions and due diligence being considered in the legislative chambers in Washington, D.C., he wrote in a note to investors on Wednesday. If I am correct, word of this could lower Amazon's shares by 10 percent overnight. Kass said in emailed comments to Reuters on Friday that he has what he called a core short position in Amazon, meaning a sizeable bet based on a long-term outlook.  This has the potential of being the biggest business news story of year, he said. Kass declined to comment when asked for more details about pressure from Capitol Hill. Kass is followed for his bets on declines in companies' share prices. He shorted Marvel Entertainment in 1992 when its shares were in the high $60s, and the company went bankrupt 1-1/2 years later. He also bet against big U.S. banks leading into the 2007-2009 financial crisis, shorting Bank of America, MGIC, Citigroup and several other financials that ultimately averaged a 98 percent price decline by the time they bottomed in 2009.  While antitrust experts have said they expected Amazon's bid to win regulatory approval, some critics argue the deal should be blocked because it would give the retailer a big head start towards domination of online grocery delivery.

Negotiations are focused on the two sides settling on a price, said the sources, who declined to speak publicly on the matter. A deal could be announced within weeks, they said. Trade in Dominion shares was halted on the Toronto Stock Exchange minutes after the stock rose 4.74 percent, following Reuters' report on the talks. U.S.-listed shares, which peaked at $13.60 after the report, closed at $13.48 in New York, up 5.6 percent. It was unclear how much Washington had increased its initial unsolicited cash proposal, of $13.50 a share, the catalyst for Dominion to formally put itself up for sale in March. At $13.50 a share, the acquisition would be worth nearly $1.09 billion (C$1.38 billion). Dominion, which owns a majority stake in the Ekati mine and minority share of the nearby Diavik mine in Canada's Northwest Territories, rejected Washington's initial advance, saying it undervalued the company. In a statement Friday afternoon, Dominion said it has not made any decisions related to strategic alternatives and there is no assurance that its review will result in a transaction or change in strategy. Washington, which declined to comment, is a group of privately held North American mining, industrial and transportation businesses founded by industrialist and entrepreneur Dennis Washington. Washington and other interested parties signed confidentiality agreements to review company data, Dominion said May 1. The sales process, a rarity in the tightly-controlled global diamond industry, attracted the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB), sources told Reuters. CPPIB, Canada's biggest public pension fund, was joined in the data room by small Canadian producer Stornoway Diamond , which held merger talks with Dominion earlier this year. It was unclear if either had submitted formal bids. CPPIB looked at Dominion's books in 2015, sources said, when the miner worked with investment bank Rothschild & Co to consider ways to boost shareholder value, including a potential sale. There has been ongoing market speculation that global miners Rio Tinto  and Anglo American were also eying Dominion. Rio operates and holds a 60 percent stake in Diavik, while Anglo's De Beers unit operates the Gahcho Kue diamond mine in the Northwest Territories. Dominion hired Toronto-Dominion Bank earlier this year to run the sales process. (1 Canadian dollar = $0.7898) (Susan Taylor)"

As part of Italy's rescue of Banca Marche, Banca Etruria, CariFerrara and CariChieti in November 2015, gross bad debts from the four banks worth 10.3 billion euros were spun off into a separate vehicle, dubbed REV-Gestione Crediti. REV, which is being advised by KPMG, has shortlisted the three U.S. funds after receiving more than two dozen expressions of interest in the portfolio, which is mainly backed by property assets, the sources said.  The three funds will have to submit binding proposals in October, the sources said, adding that a fourth bidder, Starwood Capital Group, may still be allowed to join the race. All interested parties either declined to comment or were not immediately available for a comment. Italian banks are under regulatory pressure to shed soured debts that rose to a total of 349 billion euros during a harsh recession and international investors have increasingly set their sights on a market that is still underdeveloped. Consultancy PWC said bad loan sales in Italy could top 60 billion euros this year, driven by balance-sheet clean-ups at Monte dei Paschi di Siena (BMPS.MI) and UniCredit (CRDI.MI). The two lenders alone are set to offload 44 billion euros in bad debts. UniCredit has been able to tap markets to offset the hit from the disposal but Monte dei Paschi failed to raise capital from investors and is being bailed out by the state. Mid-sized regional lender Creval (PCVI.MI) said late on Thursday it had sealed a 1.4 billion euro bad loan sale, sending its shares higher.

ZZ Capital, which is listed on the Growth Enterprise Market of the Hong Kong stock exchange, is making an initial payment of $582 million, with up to $230 million more if Alerian meets certain revenue targets for the years ending 2018-2021, the company said in a securities filing.  ZZ Capital shares have fallen 26 percent since the start of the year, giving it a market capitalization of $218.3 million. The company plans to raise $286 million with the issue of new shares in a rights offering to make the initial payment, with an undisclosed amount also from debt financing and from internal cash. It also plans to raise another $230 million with a second rights offering to meet its future commitments based on Alerian's performance. The Listing Committee of the Hong Kong exchange viewed the deal as an extreme very substantial acquisition and requested additional information similar to that required of companies going public, ZZ Capital said in the filing. ZZ Capital HAS hired Haitong International Capital as financial adviser to conduct due diligence of Alerian. Dallas-based Alerian is controlled by billionaire brothers Gabriel and Daniel Hammond, who will earn $485 million in cash for their combined 85 percent stake. Alerian's Chief Executive Kenny Feng, who owns the remainder 15 percent of the company, will earn $21 million in cash and $64 million in units of the special purpose vehicle ZZ Capital set up to buy Alerian. The company has built a niche in the energy industry by providing an index that tracks so-called master limited partnerships (MLPs), which build the pipelines and storage tanks and are a common corporate structure in the oil and gas infrastructure sector. There are about $17 billion of assets linked to Alerian  indices, including the Alerian MLP index .AMZ. Alerian posted $58.6 million in profit in 2016, down 4.3 percent from 2015, ZZ Capital said.

The agreement will fund the growth of an additional 300 American Family Care urgent care franchises throughout the United States, more than doubling its existing footprint of more than 170 clinics, according to the company.  American Family Care will remain owned by its founders. It will continue to invest its own capital in new franchises and wholly owned clinics.  American Development Partners will finance the acquisition and development of land for the urgent care centers, and will purchase equipment and provide working capital. It will recoup its investment by collecting lease payments from franchisees.  This isn't a private equity infusion per se, said William Koleszar, chief marketing officer at American Family Care in an interview.  It's private capital working with small business owners to make healthcare more accessible to local communities.  The new facilities will be primarily focused in states that American Family Care considers likely to have strong uptake of urgent care centers, ranging from Florida, to Illinois, to Texas.  Birmingham, Alabama-based American Family Care was founded by Bruce Irwin and now serves more than 3 million patients per year.  Urgent care has benefited in recent years by a drive by insurers and health providers to cut costs. Based on the same principles as retailers, urgent care centers aim to offer a cheaper and more efficient alternative to visting a doctor's office or emergency room. They typically promise to service patients on a walk-in basis and accept payments for services like x-rays or stitches from people with or without health insurance.  Earlier this year, buyout firm Warburg Pincus LLC acquired a majority stake in urgent care provider CityMD, valuing it at around $600 million, Reuters reported.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/glp-ma-idUSL4N1K52CM","UPDATE 2-Chinese buyout group wins $11.6 bln bid to buy Global Logistic Properties","","Jul 14 2017","* Group offers S$3.38/shr cash, 25 pct premium over lastprice","SINGAPORE/HONG KONG (Reuters) - A leading Chinese private equity consortium backed by senior executives from Global Logistic Properties (GLP) (GLPL.SI) won a bid to acquire GLP for S$16 billion ($11.6 billion), marking Asia's largest private equity buyout in a buoyant sector. GLP, which is Asia's biggest warehouse operator and boasts a $41 billion portfolio of assets spread across China, Japan, Brazil and the United States, is benefiting from rising demand logistics facilities driven by a boom in e-commerce from clients such as Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and JD.com Inc (JD.O). The winning bid of China's Hopu Investment Management, Hillhouse Capital Group, real estate developer Vanke Group (000002.SZ) (2202.HK) and the financial service investment arm of Bank of China was backed by GLP CEO Ming Mei, which trumped an offer by a Warburg Pincus-led consortium - the only other short-listed bidder. The group is offering S$3.38 in cash per share, representing an 81 percent premium over its 12-month volume weighted average price and a 25 percent premium over its last full trading day before the announcement. Surprisingly, the acquisition is not conditional on getting antitrust approvals or a green light from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), among others, at a time when regulators are vetting takeovers more closely. Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC [GIC.UL], which owns 37 percent of GLP and is its biggest shareholder, is supporting the transaction but is free to accept an unmatched superior offer. GIC played hard to get a decent offer, said a person with direct knowledge of the deal. There's a good premium with very few strings attached. Related CoverageVanke says deal to buy out GLP will help its logistics property businessLast year, GIC nudged GLP to start a strategic review of its business after its shares tumbled over a period of two years starting in 2015. GLP then hired JPMorgan as its financial adviser and Allen & Gledhill as its legal adviser to work on the review. The seven-month auction for GLP was marred by complaints from some potential bidders about a lack of transparency and the perceived advantages of the Chinese consortium through their business ties. GLP then formed a committee of independent directors and said it took measures to alleviate potential conflicts of interest. It said on Friday that it chose the Chinese consortium because it had more deal certainty and limited conditionality, reducing execution risk. GLP shares soared 22 percent on Friday to a record high. Before Friday's jump, the shares had surged nearly 50 percent since late last year when GIC requested the strategic review.    Booming Sector Investors including Carlyle Group LP (CG.O), Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) and Warburg Pincus [WP.UL] have splashed more than $12 billion on the logistics sector in China since 2013, betting a surge in online shopping will spur demand for delivery and warehousing services. Analysts said GLP, which earns the majority of its revenue from China, was especially well positioned to benefit from the e-commerce boom.  Their substantial footprint in some of the largest global economies make them well positioned to leverage improving global industrial trade and services, including the rapidly rising share of e-commerce in global retail, said Priyaranjan Kumar, regional executive director of Cushman & Wakefield's Asia Pacific capital markets group. To build a similar platform would take many years and present its own set of economic challenges, he said.  The bid for GLP stands out at a time when China's outbound M&A; volumes nearly halved in the first six months of 2017 following Beijing's crackdown on capital outflows, data showed, and its new scrutiny of acquisitive groups is set to dampen Asian deal flow further. The proposed acquisition will be done by way of a scheme of arrangement and the Chinese group plans to delist and take the Singapore-listed firm private. Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were the lead joint financial advisers for the consortium and are providing the financial resources confirmation related to the purchase. DBS Bank and China International Capital Corporation also advised the consortium. Goldman and Citi are putting up $5 bln to help fund the deal, sources said. Goldman and Citi declined comment.

Common Cause, Consumer Federation of America, Consumers Union, Public Knowledge and other groups echoed other critics of the deal, including some lawmakers, who say that the $85.4 billion deal would give AT&T; (T.N), owner of DirecTV, the ability to withhold Time Warner's (TWX.N) content from other outlets and hurt the move to show television shows and movies on the Internet. The groups argued that after buying Time Warner, owner of HBO and TNT, AT&T; would have the incentive to restrict sales of that programming to cable and online channels. That could hurt DirecTV's rivals as well as AT&T;'s competitors in providing video online, the letter said. The groups also worried that the deal would create incentives for AT&T; to refrain from showing independent programmers. The groups said that the deal poses ... grave dangers to consumers and creators in mature and emerging markets and urged the government to consider stopping it. If you conclude, as appears to us from the available information, that conditions and piecemeal divestitures will not be sufficient, then we hope you will challenge the merger in its entirety, the groups said in their letter to Sessions. Aside from the Justice Department's antitrust review, the deal is at the center of a controversy over allegations that White House advisers considered using the probe as political leverage.

Caixa Econômica Federal SA, Banco Santander Brasil SA, Banco do Brasil SA and Banco Bradesco SA are urging larger rival Itaú Unibanco Holding SA to join the plan, under which JBS would get a 12-month repayment extension in exchange for a 2 billion-real upfront payment and extra collateral, two of the people said. In principle, banks would not adjust the borrowing cost of those loans because the risk of JBS failing to honor them remains very small, according to one of the people, who asked for anonymity because the plan remains private. Bloomberg News reported on July 12 that a definitive accord had been struck. São Paulo-based JBS said in a statement that the company remains engaged in a long-term relation with financial institutions, with which it has so far maintained productive and constructive talks. The banks declined to comment. A refinancing deal is key to stem concerns of a potential liquidity strain at JBS, whose borrowing costs surged in the wake of the Batista family's decision to enter plea and leniency deals related to their involvement in a bribery and graft ring. Shares (JBSS3.SA) of the São Paulo-based meatpacker and food processor have tanked 18 percent since brothers Wesley and Joesley Batista agreed to a plea deal in mid-May. The company's 7.75 percent bond due in Oct. 2020 46611DAA3= shed up to 20 percent in the same period, sending yields on the security to an all-time high. Chief Executive Officer Wesley Batista, the elder of the two brothers who control JBS, is personally negotiating the debt refinancing deal and asset sales to raise cash, the people said. JBS's private-sector banks remain skittish about their state peers' push to remove Batista, two of the people said. Itaú fretted about refinancing loans to JBS in early talks, demanding immediate repayment of a 1 billion-real credit facility due within weeks, the people said. Itaú is not participating in any of JBS's planned asset divestitures, one of the people said. Bribing Politicians Removing Batista has become common ground between government lenders BNDES and Caixa Econômica Federal, Reuters reported on June 22. BNDES owns 22 percent of JBS through investment arm BNDES Participações SA.  Caixa, Brazil's largest mortgage lender, is JBS's largest creditor. The refinancing underscores the challenge facing the Batista brothers, who over a decade transformed JBS from a mid-sized slaughterhouse in Brazil's Midwestern plains into a global behemoth that operates in four continents, with the help of political relations and low-cost government loans. In May, the brothers admitted to bribing 1,893 politicians to facilitate the growth of JBS through BNDES loans. In a plea deal with prosecutors, both implicated President Michel Temer, unleashing a political crisis that threatens to derail the passage of key spending-cutting bills. JPMorgan Securities analyst Natalia Corfield estimates that JBS's total bank debt reached 24.3 billion reais at the end of March, of which about 17.5 billion reais would mature within the next 12 months. The company's total debt, including bond obligations, was almost 59 billion reais. ($1 = 3.2959 Brazilian reais) Editing by Chizu Nomiyama"

Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA.O) was dealt a blow last month when Britain's media secretary, Karen Bradley, said she was persuaded that the deal could give the Murdochs too much influence over the media, after regulator Ofcom assessed the impact of the transaction. Murdoch also owns the Sun and Times newspapers in Britain.  Bradley said she would make a final decision on July 14, giving some investors hope that Fox could avert a full investigation if it offered concessions to protect the editorial independence of Sky's 24-hour TV news channel, Sky News.  A person familiar with the deal said however the company was unlikely to offer any new remedies, opting instead to let the competition watchdog examine the deal.  Murdoch, 86, and his family have long coveted full control of Sky, despite the damaging failure of a previous attempt in 2011 when their British newspaper business became embroiled in a phone-hacking scandal which forced them to abandon that bid. Britain's political leaders have long sought the backing of Murdoch and his newspapers and any attempt to expand his media empire in the country sparks intense political scrutiny. Rupert's son James, who is chief executive of Fox and chairman of Sky, said in March that worries about his family exerting too much power were unfounded in an era of online providers such as Facebook, Buzzfeed, Netflix and Google. Fox has said any referral for an in-depth probe could mean the deal would not close before next June. Both Sky and Fox declined to comment. Reporting by Kate Holton; Editing by Elaine Hardcastle"

In a statement on Thursday, JBS said it had learned that Brazil's Regional Federal Court of the 1st Region overturned a ruling blocking the $300 million sale of a South American unit to rival Minerva SA (BEEF3.SA). Newspaper O Estado de S. Paulo reported the news earlier in the day. The regional court also removed any lingering restrictions on JBS to negotiate sales of any assets or operations. On June 21, federal Judge Ricardo Leite blocked JBS's sale of plants in Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay, saying it could harm a probe against the billionaire Batista family. Efforts to obtain the ruling from the court's media office were not immediately successful. With permission to sell assets, JBS has gained flexibility to downsize amid talks to restructure 18 billion reais ($5.6 billion) in looming loan maturities, which Reuters reported last month. Asset sales could make up for smaller access to credit from state lenders after the scandal involving brothers Wesley and Joesley Batista. Cheap state loans helped fuel growth over the past decade at J&F; Investimentos SA, the Batistas' holding company, which was able to keep control of JBS while expanding into fashion, pulpmaking and banking. Through takeovers, JBS grew from a mid-sized slaughterhouse in Brazil's Midwest into the world's No. 2 food processor in that time. Record Leniency  Wesley Batista, the older brother, is chief executive officer of São Paulo-based JBS. State development bank BNDES, whose investment arm is JBS's No. 2 shareholder, is demanding his removal. In May, Prosecutor-General Rodigo Janot reached a plea deal with both brothers, who agreed to turn in 1,893 politicians they bribed.  Leite sits on the court that will also review a separate leniency deal that the Batistas reached with prosecutors over their participation in a bribery and graft scheme. The agreement requires the family to pay a record 10.3 billion-real fine over 25 years.  The Batistas have been selling assets to help raise cash to reduce a heavy debt load and pay the fine.  J&F; sold control of the globally popular Havaianas flip-flop brand maker Alpargatas SA (ALPA4.SA) to the investment firms of Brazil's most prominent banking families for 3.5 billion reais ($1.1 billion) late on Wednesday.

Former Chicago Alderman Edwin Eisendrath and the group of investors beat out Tronc Inc., the owner of the Chicago Tribune as well as the Los Angeles Times and Baltimore Sun, for the tabloid, the Chicago newspapers reported on Wednesday. It's a great town as you know and it will continue to have two great newspapers, Eisendrath said on Twitter in announcing the deal. The U.S. Department of Justice’s Antitrust Division opened an investigation in May into the possible sale of the Sun-Times to Tronc and monitored the bidding closely. The department said in a statement on Wednesday that it closed its investigation with the paper's sale to ST Acquisition Holdings LLC, the investor group. The terms of the deal between ST Acquisition Holdings and Sun-Times parent Wrapports LLC were not made public. Corporate restructuring expert William Brandt, the Chicago Federation of Labor, local labor unions and about a half-dozen other individuals make up the investor group, the Sun-Times reported. Labor unions in the city applauded the sale, which also included the Chicago Reader, a weekly. The little guy won here, said Chicago Federation of Labor President Jorge Ramirez to the Sun-Times. This is about fair, honest and balanced reporting. The Sun-Times has a rich history of that. Wrapports has an annual $25 million contract with Tronc to print and distribute the Sun-Times.

GLP has a market value of around $9.2 billion and the deal will rank as the largest buyout in Asia by private equity firms, which are increasingly targeting bigger takeovers after raising record funds. After months of negotiations, a special committee of GLP's independent directors is aiming to finalize a deal this week with the Chinese consortium, which is led by Hopu Investment Management and Hillhouse Capital Group and is backed by GLP CEO Ming Mei, the sources said. The sources declined to be identified as they were not authorized to speak about the deal. GLP and the Chinese consortium declined to comment. Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC [GIC.UL], which owns a 37 percent in GLP, also declined to comment. GLP, which owns a $41 billion portfolio of industrial assets spread across China, Japan, Brazil and the United States, is benefiting from a boom in e-commerce that has fueled demand for modern logistics facilities. It counts Amazon (AMZN.O) and JD.com (JD.O) among its clients. Concerns over the transparency of the sale process and business ties of the Chinese consortium had forced some potential bidders to re-evaluate their interest, sources have said, making the auction a two-way race with Warburg Pincus and its logistics partner e-Shang Redwood. GLP has said it had taken measures to alleviate potential conflicts of interest. GIC last year nudged GLP to start a strategic review of its business. JPMorgan was then hired by GLP as its financial adviser. GLP's shares have since soared nearly 50 percent to their highest levels in more than three years. Hopu's founder Fang Fenglei, one of China's best known dealmakers, is a GLP board member and Hopu partly owns GLP's China business. The warehouse operator garners two-thirds of its revenue from China, where it has a dominant market position.

The U.S. Federal Trade Commission filed a lawsuit in June aimed at stopping the merger, arguing that the combined company would control more than 90 percent of the U.S. market for paid daily fantasy sports contests. The lawsuit was the latest setback for the two companies, which have faced regulatory challenges in several states. They announced the deal in November 2016 as a merger of equals that would cut their legal bills. The companies said in similar filings that the FTC lawsuit reflected an unnecessarily rigid and uninformed application of the antitrust laws to an underdeveloped, nascent industry, and largely ignore rigorous economic analysis that has revealed consistently, no matter which way it is analyzed, that prices are not likely to increase as a result of the transaction.  The companies also said their deal would be good for consumers and argued that they competed for players against larger, more powerful companies in the broader and longer- running fantasy sports businesses, like ESPN (DIS.N) and Yahoo (VZ.N). DraftKings admits that fantasy sports include, but are not limited to, both season-long fantasy sports (SLFS) and DFS (daily fantasy sports), but specifically denies the characterization that SLFS and DFS are distinct, the company said in its filing.  Modern fantasy sports started in 1980 and have mushroomed online. Participants typically create teams that span an entire season in professional sports, including American football, baseball, basketball and hockey. Daily fantasy sports, which focus on single-day contests, have developed over the past decade into a multibillion-dollar industry. The FTC has asked the court for a preliminary injunction to prevent the companies from closing the deal while it proceeds with an internal review to determine if the merger is legal. If the FTC wins a preliminary injunction, companies normally give up because deals cannot be held together during the lengthy internal process. The FTC has won a long list of court fights in recent years. The agency stopped food distribution giant Sysco Corp from buying US Foods Inc and prevented office supplies retailer Staples Inc from acquiring Office Depot Inc.

Blumenthal told reporters on Capitol Hill that he requested the meeting with Makan Delrahim in the wake of a New York Times report that White House advisers battling television news station CNN mulled using a government review of AT&T;'s merger plans as leverage. Delrahim was nominated to be the assistant attorney general for antitrust at the Justice Department and is awaiting Senate confirmation. The department's Antitrust Division will decide whether the deal is legal under U.S. law. (The White House) is ethically and morally barred from intervening, said Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat. The mere threat of it is a very serious potential violation of ethics. On Tuesday, Bob Quinn, a spokesman for AT&T;, declined to discuss the report. Quinn said that AT&T; believes it can complete regulatory reviews and close the deal by the end of the year. Blumenthal also said that he had written to the CEOs of AT&T; and Time Warner about the report. Blumenthal's remarks echo those of Senator Amy Klobuchar, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee's antitrust panel, who said last week in a letter to Attorney General Jeff Sessions that any political interference in antitrust enforcement is unacceptable. Trump himself has not commented publicly on the deal since the election but during his campaign he said it was an example of a power structure that was rigged against him and too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.

(Reuters) - An attorney for Elliott Management on Wednesday complained to a bankruptcy court judge that the owner of Texas's largest power distribution business did not provide the investment fund with information needed to line up financing for its offer of more than $18 billion to buy the company. Instead, Energy Future Holdings Corp, the bankrupt majority owner of Oncor Electric Delivery Co, struck a deal this month to sell its ownership of the business to Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) for $9 billion in cash, valuing the company at $18.1 billion.  A lawyer for Elliott Management, which spent years battling Argentina over its defaulted debt, told the court that the fund has enough debt in Oncor's parent, Energy Future, to block the Berkshire deal.  The fund has argued that its own $18.5 billion Oncor deal would be better for creditors. Gregg Galardi, Elliott's lawyer, said potential sources of financing for a rival bid had contacted Elliott, a $32 billion fund led by billionaire Paul Singer, but Energy Future had ignored requests for information to help structure a deal. We need actual cooperation, he said. Galardi also noted that Energy Future had not run an auction. Chad Husnick, who represents Energy Future, countered that Elliott had not signed a non-disclosure agreement with Oncor and said Energy Future would not shop its Oncor stake when Elliott had no committed financing. My response is, show me the money and we’ll consider it, he said. Husnick also told the hearing in Wilmington, Delaware, that the Berkshire plan could be confirmed. Two previous deals for Oncor, with Hunt Consolidated Inc and another with NextEra Energy (NEE.N), were rejected by Texas's Public Utility Commission after the plans were confirmed by the bankruptcy court. Husnick said the Berkshire proposal has already been discussed with PUC staff. He said Energy Future anticipates quick regulatory approval and then confirmation of the plan by the bankruptcy court, an approach that Judge Christopher Sontchi said he supported. Elliott has estimated creditors will be repaid around 24 cents on the dollar under the Berkshire proposal, compared to 80 cents under the deal NextEra Energy that was blocked by Texas regulators. A hearing on the schedule for reviewing the Berkshire plan was set for July 26. Energy Future has been in bankruptcy since 2014, filing after a consortium of private equity firms bought it for about $44 billion.

The European Union's sanctions, painfully negotiated by all 28 EU governments in 2014 and so far renewed every six months, are the bloc's toughest response to Russia's annexation of Crimea and its support for separatists in eastern Ukraine. But it is up to each EU government to enforce them and they do not apply to companies' Russian subsidiaries, making any possible wrongdoing very hard to prove. Reuters reported on July 5 that two electricity turbines made by Siemens were shipped to the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea, which is subject to EU sanctions that ban EU firms from supplying energy technology there. Siemens said the turbines were transferred to Crimea without its knowledge and against its will. Implementation and enforcement of EU restrictive measures rests with the member states, a spokesman for the European Commission said in response to the Siemens case. The Commission is in touch with the German competent authorities on this particular case, the spokesman said, referring to Siemens. Still, economic sanctions on Russia, including those on Crimea, have deterred many EU firms from doing business there. EU exports to Russia fell by 40 percent between 2013 and 2016 to 72 billion euros ($82.09 billion), according to the EU's statistics office Eurostat. Direct investment by the European Union's 28 countries into Russia fell 18 percent to 162 billion euros between 2013 and 2015, the latest data available. The reputational damage of a potential sanctions breach can be enormous, said Maya Lester, a London-based barrister and author of a European sanctions website. One practical effect of imposing sanctions can be about sending a message, as well as the restrictions themselves, and compliance is a big issue too. Overall, the European Union has imposed sanctions banning most EU business with Crimea, has frozen the assets and prohibited travel for Russians linked to the Ukraine crisis and has limited EU investment in Russia's defence and energy sectors. Financing to Russian banks is severely restricted. Unlike the United States, which has robust economic and trade sanctions enforcement through its Office of Foreign Assets Control at the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the European Union has no single such agency. While the EU's institutions in Brussels are instrumental in drawing up the legal language for the punitive regime and drumming up diplomatic support for them, the few dozen experts who help design them do not have the resources to enforce them. Theatrical rhetoric is not matched by enforcement, said Tom Keatinge, director of financial crime studies at RUSI think-tank in London. They have become symbolic, he said, saying not enough was done to update sanctions to avoid both EU and Russian companies circumventing them. A Sept. 2016 investigation by Reuters showed that at least two European retailers, Auchan and Metro, were active on the Crimean market through Russian subsidiaries, shipping there from Russia via a ferry and port that are subject to EU sanctions. Furthermore, France last year granted Russian Agriculture Minister Alexander Tkachev a visa even though he has been banned from entering the EU since 2014 because of Crimea. No Database In April, Britain moved to a U.S.-style enforcement policy to allow civil fines of at least 1 million pounds ($1.28 million) on breaches of financial sanctions. However, Britain has not so far prosecuted any company for any potential breach of sanctions, Lester said. It was not immediately clear if other EU countries have brought criminal proceedings because no public database exists of sanctions breaches. Many EU countries rely on different agencies, from the central bank to the export licensing authority, to enforce measures. Refusal of licenses can be challenged in court, while customs offices and the public prosecutor are responsible for violations of export controls. EU officials have designed sanctions to be as specific as possible to avoid hurting the wider population, making loopholes easier to find. EU companies are expected to adhere to what EU officials call the spirit of the sanctions regime but it does not apply directly to their subsidiaries incorporated in Russia. If the sanctions are too wide ranging, they may be too disruptive to the EU, or contribute to a financial crisis, said Erica Moret, chair of the Geneva International Sanctions Network at the Graduate Institute Geneva. The human costs of blanket sanctions have been too great in the past. EU governments also want the measures to be able to be lifted quickly in case of a rapprochement with Russia. Defence, energy and financial sanctions could be removed if all sides implement the Minsk peace deal involving the withdrawal of troops and weaponry from eastern Ukraine. Russian denies any direct involvement in the conflict that has killed more than 10,000 people since April 2014. (Additional reporting by Alissa de Carbonnel; editing by Philippa Fletcher)"

The fund will try to connect startup companies with its corporate investors, which include big automotive suppliers BorgWarner Inc and Autoliv Inc, and two unidentified automakers, Autotech founders Quin Garcia and Alexei Andreev told Reuters ahead of Wednesday's announcement of the fund. The fund already has investments in ride service company Lyft; Outdoorsy, which enables users to share recreational vehicles; and Work Truck Solutions, which designs software to help owners of commercial truck fleets track their vehicles.  Older transportation companies are looking for ideas on how to make money from vehicles after the initial sale, such as through sharing services. They also are interested in startups that could help them use data acquired from vehicles to sell insurance or locate and pay for parking, Garcia and Andreev said. The new Autotech Ventures fund comes as vehicle manufacturers and suppliers are scouring the technology sector for talent and ideas but are wary of overpaying.  General Motors Co's estimated $1 billion acquisition of self-driving vehicle company Cruise Automation and Uber Technologies Inc's [UBER.UL] purchase of self-driving truck startup Otto have accelerated this trend. In the self-driving vehicle arena, the Autotech Ventures fund will focus on companies developing specific technology, “rather than a jack of all trades,” Garcia said.

Talks with a Japanese government-backed group chosen by Toshiba as a preferred bidder for its chip business have stalled due to what sources say are proposals by SK Hynix that its financing be done via convertible bonds. In the first public acknowledgement that it wants a stake in the world's No. 2 NAND producer, SK Hynix chief executive Park Sung-wook told reporters that it is continuing to negotiate the purchase and will not drop its equity plan. The preferred bidder group also includes the state-backed fund Innovation Network Corp of Japan, the Development Bank of Japan and U.S. private equity firm Bain Capital. But the stand-off resulted on Tuesday in Toshiba saying it was again talking with suitors Western Digital Corp (WDC.O) and Foxconn (2317.TW) due to the lack of progress. The embattled conglomerate does not want its South Korean rival to have an equity or management influence in the chip unit - a stance it has taken to satisfy a government that wants the technology to remain under domestic control. Some Japanese officials had hoped SK Hynix may back down from its demand for a stake, sources have said.  Hit by massive cost overruns at its now bankrupt U.S. nuclear unit Westinghouse, Toshiba needs billions of dollars in fresh loans to tide it over before it can complete the $18 billion sale of the memory chip unit. It sold its medical equipment business to Canon Inc for $6 billion last year and its Landis+Gyr smart meters unit aims to raise up to $2.5 billion, but that will not be enough to plug the hole in its balance sheet. And although Japanese banking sources said on Tuesday that Toshiba has regained access to a $6 billion credit line, lenders have also imposed tough conditions.  Toshiba has told creditors it will need 1 trillion yen in fresh loans during the current financial year through March, banking sources have said previously. Sources said Toshiba's banks, which include Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp (8316.T) and Mizuho Bank (8411.T), allowed it to withdraw 100 billion yen ($880 million) in loans late last month but must seek permission every week to extend the loan, despite a previously-agreed commitment line of 680 billion yen. Another obstacle in the chip unit auction has been Toshiba's strained ties with Western Digital, which bought SanDisk, Toshiba's memory chip business partner, in May last year.  Last month, Western Digital sought a U.S. court injunction to prevent Toshiba selling the chip unit without its consent. A hearing on that request is scheduled for Friday. The banking sources said they were worried the conflict could end up scuppering the sale as well as the chip business' long-term prospects. One said he hoped that Toshiba and Western Digital would work to resolve their conflict.

Mighty Corp, which has been charged with avoiding 37.88 billion pesos in tax payments, has offered to pay the Philippines government 25 billion pesos.  It will fund the tax settlement with a 45 billion peso sale of its assets to JT International Philippines, a local subsidiary of Japan Tobacco, the Philippines' Department of Finance said in a statement, quoting a letter from Mighty President Oscar Barrientos. A Japan Tobacco spokeswoman in Tokyo confirmed the company was in talks with Mighty to buy its manufacturing and distribution assets, but declined further comment.  Officials at Mighty, the second-largest tobacco company in the Philippines, were not immediately available for comment. Japan Tobacco, the world's third-biggest tobacco company, said in May it was looking for mergers and acquisitions in emerging markets such as southeast Asia, Africa and Latin America, as it diversifies away from its home market. It is also widely seen as a potential suitor for Britain's Imperial Brands (IMB.L), and Jefferies analysts said on Wednesday the purchase of Mighty did nothing to change that, given the small size of Mighty.  This further highlights their appetite for a deal and perhaps the urgency with which JT knows it needs to act to address structural pressures and close the gap on peers, Jefferies said.   The potential acquisition by Japan Tobacco, which sells the Winston, Mild Seven and Camel brands in the Philippines, would help it to challenge the dominance of PMFTC Inc, a joint venture of the Philippines unit of Philip Morris International (PM.N) and unlisted Fortune Tobacco Corp, in the southeast Asian country's cigarette market.

The deal includes an initial consideration of $947 million and additional payments of up to $285 million between 2018-2025, subject to gas price and production, Shell said on Wednesday. The Anglo-Dutch company is on track to sell assets of about $30 billion by 2018 to cut debt following its $54 billion acquisition of BG Group. Shell has also been working to mitigate climate change risks that have upset some investors. The development of the Corrib gas field, discovered in 1996, has faced protests since 2005 by residents concerned that the laying of a high-pressure pipeline to bring gas onshore could pollute their water supply. CPPIB, Canada's biggest public pension fund, and Vermilion Energy Inc will become the new operator of the gas field off the north-west coast of Ireland. For CPPIB, the deal is another step in its pursuit to diversify beyond domestic markets. The fund's most recent deal in the energy sector was to invest up to $1 billion to acquire U.S. oil and gas assets.     The transaction will result in an impairment charge of around $350 million in Q2 2017, Shell said. The transaction, which is subject to partner and regulatory approval, is expected to complete in the second quarter of 2018, the company said. Norway's Statoil, which owns a 36.5 per cent stake in the Corrib gas field venture, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Shares in Shell were up 1.3 percent at 2071 pence at 1157 GMT.

Acquisitions and joint ventures are becoming more difficult for Chinese firms, Hu Zhijian, president of the Chinese Academy of Science and Technology for Development (CASTED), told reporters in Beijing on Wednesday. It is not wise for the U.S. to close its doors in industries that are declining in profit ... the United States should step forward and develop new technology areas, said Hu.   U.S. regulators have called for heightened scrutiny of Chinese chip acquisitions leading to a chill in overseas M&A; activity by Chinese chip firms, with a number of high-level deals failing to gain approval. In December the Obama administration blocked China's Fujian Grand Chip Investment Fund (FGC) from completing the acquisition of German semiconductor firm Aixtron (AIXGn.DE) over national security concerns related to Aixtron's U.S. assets. In March China-backed buyout fund Canyon Bridge Capital Partners LLC resubmitted a $1.3 billion bid for U.S. chip firm Lattice Semiconductor Corp (LSCC.O) to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) after the initial review period expired. More than 20 U.S. Congress members signed a letter to the U.S. Treasury in December calling for a block on the Lattice deal, saying it could disrupt the U.S. military supply chain and increase reliance on foreign chipmakers. The United States should not be afraid of other countries catching up, Hu said, adding that China is seeking technologies the United States has already developed in the past two decades and Chinese investment could boot profitability in the sector. Washington recently sought to strengthen the role of CFIUS, the inter-agency committee that reviews foreign acquisitions of U.S. companies on national security grounds. U.S. politicians and lawmakers have called for the committee to increase deal scrutiny in areas where China is seeking to build world-leading technology, including artificial intelligence.  China will release a national artificial intelligence plan in the coming months, following a similar roadmap released by the United States, Hu said.

S&P; Dow Jones Indices and MSCI Inc (MSCI.N), which together manage a set of industry definitions called the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS), propose renaming the sector .SPLRCL and including a host of companies not considered pure telecoms, they said in a statement. The proposed Communication Services Sector could include telecom companies as well as some media, entertainment, consumer internet and digital services companies that currently belong to the consumer discretionary and information technology sectors. They did not disclose which companies could be moved into the new index. Those other industry groups currently include corporate titans, such as Facebook Inc (FB.O), Google parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), eBay Inc (EBAY.O) and Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O). You're looking at everything in there, and it could also lead to new sub-industries within existing ones. The existing groups could be totally changed, said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P; Dow Jones Indices. Nothing has been predetermined and set. After years of consolidation and diversification, today's telecom sector is vastly different from when the index was created in 1996, a time when cellphones were a luxury and the internet was not ubiquitous. The consultation will start on Tuesday and potential changes to take effect in 2018 will be announced in November, the statement said. S&P; Dow Jones Indices is a venture of S&P; Global Inc (SPGI.N) and CME Group Inc (CME.O). Reuters reported in May that the index providers were considering restructuring the once-hot index, which has shrunk to just four companies from 14. Telecom companies are desperately trying to diversify away from the competitive cellphone and internet industry by adding TV and home security services. Regional telecom operator CenturyLink Inc (CTL.N) plans to buy fiber network operator Level 3 Communications Inc LVLT.O later this quarter, which would leave the S&P; 500 telecom index with just three companies.  Mergers will further shrink the percentage of revenue from traditional telecommunications as AT&T; Inc (T.N) - the sector's biggest company - is merging with media company Time Warner Inc (TWX.N). Unlike the other 10 GICS sectors, the S&P; 500 telecom segment is so small there is not a single exchange-traded fund to mirror it, given that a fund holding just a few stocks would fall short of regulatory requirements. Instead, telecom ETFs include smaller companies outside the S&P; 500 and other industries. Since slow-growing telecom operators are notable for their high dividend yields, some investors argued they should be added to the utilities index. Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T; Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama, said it doesn't seem realistic to include big tech names with telecom firms.     You could make a more rationale case for putting some of the media companies in with telecom.

Toshiba is scrambling to sell its flash memory business and Western Digital is among the bidders. In a sign of high tensions around the deal, Toshiba threatened to lock Western Digital out of shared databases and quit sending chip samples. Western Digital sued Toshiba in San Francisco County Superior Court saying that its joint venture with Toshiba means Toshiba must get its consent for a sale. It asked the court for two separate orders: An injunction to stop the sale, and a temporary restraining order forcing Toshiba to give its workers access to shared databases. A judge granted the temporary order for access to the shared databases Tuesday and set a further hearing on July 28.  We welcome the decision of the court, which we believe validates our position, Western Digital said in a statement. Toshiba plans to appeal the ruling, which it believes essentially provides Western Digital access to technical information until the July 28, the company said in a statement. This is a proceeding with many rounds and many rulings, and while we are disappointed with the judge's ruling, it doesn't forecast the outcome of this proceeding or those to come, Toshiba said in the statement. A hearing on the injunction to stop the sale is set for Friday. Despite the legal tensions between them, Toshiba and Western Digital resumed talks this week. Toshiba also returned to talks with a group led by Taiwan's Foxconn.

Court documents seen by Reuters listed state firm Technopromexport (TPE) as a defendant, along with Siemens Gas Turbine Technologies LLC (SGTT), a St Petersburg-based turbine-making joint venture in which Siemens has a majority stake. TPE is the firm that originally bought the turbines, saying it intended to install them in a power station in Taman, southern Russia.  It is also building two power stations in Crimea for which the Siemens-made turbines are intended, according to three sources close to the project.

The deal with privately held Bruin E&P; Partners LLC focuses Halcón on the most-active area in the U.S. oil industry and marks a stunning turnaround for Chief Executive Floyd Wilson, who formed the company in 2011 before having to usher it through bankruptcy in 2016 after oil prices plunged. The news sent Halcón shares up more than 35 percent in morning trading. The deal also highlights the ability of U.S. shale producers to survive and reinvent themselves, despite sliding crude prices in the past two years. The sale of our Williston Basin operated assets transforms Halcón into a single-basin company focused on the Delaware Basin where we have more than 41,000 net acres, Wilson said in a statement. Houston-based Halcón will sell its operated North Dakota assets, which produce about 29,000 barrels per day (bpd). Halcón will keep its non-operated interest in wells across the state and said it may sell them in the future. After the sale, Halcón will produce about 7,500 bpd and run two drilling rigs in the Permian. By the end of the year, Halcón expects to pump about 13,000 bpd. The deal is expected to close by August. If it collapses, Halcón would pay Bruin $42 million. Bruin E&P; Partners, which is backed by private equity firm Arclight Capital Partners LLC, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Halcón entered the Permian in January in several deals worth more than $1.2 billion, acquiring acreage in the western part of the region known as the Delaware Basin. Focusing on the Permian could help Wilson achieve his long-held dream of selling Halcón to the highest bidder. Investors and analysts have been eager to see if Wilson can replicate the feat he pulled off in 2011 when he sold Petrohawk Energy to BHP Billiton Plc for $12.1 billion, a 65 percent premium over the share price before the sale was announced. Wilson had predicted in 2012 that a sale of Halcón would take place by 2015.

Yellen's semi-annual monetary policy testimony before Congress will be on Wednesday and Thursday. San Francisco Federal Reserve President John Williams said on Tuesday in Sydney that it was a reasonable view to expect one more rate hike this year, and his own view was to start adjusting the central bank's balance sheet in the next few months. Most Gulf currencies are pegged to the dollar and any monetary policy change in the United States is usually mimicked by Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Qatar. In Doha, the majority of the listed banks were firm with the largest of them, Qatar National Bank adding 1.2 percent. The index rose 0.4 percent. In the United Arab Emirates, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank added 1.6 percent and Union National Bank inched up 0.4 percent, helping take the index 0.2 percent higher. In neighbouring Dubai, Dubai Islamic Bank added 1.4 percent and the index rose 0.6 percent. Saudi Arabian banks were mixed as some investors turned their focus to upcoming second quarter results. Heavyweight National Commercial Bank edged up 0.2 percent after rising as much as 1.4 percent earlier in the day. Analysts at Riyad Capital expect net income for the sector to be flat in the second quarter from the year ago period as provisions may continue to weigh on performance - which they have been for the last several quarters - and because of a dip in credit demand. Nevertheless, they predict operating margins to witness some improvement. While SAIBOR (the interbank lending rate) has been flat in the quarter, we believe cost of funds have declined given rising non-interest bearing deposits combined with some growth in advances, said the note by Riyad Capital. Mobile phones and home appliances retailer United Electronics Company (Extra) surged 8.1 percent in heavy trade to its highest close since November 2015 after its chief executive, Mohamed Fahmy, told financial news website, Argaam, on Monday that Extra aims to boost sales through its online portal, and strengthen partnerships with suppliers and brand offerings. Its shares soared by their 10 percent daily limit on Monday after reporting a near quadrupling in second quarter net income from a year earlier and a 15 percent growth in sales. The index added a small 0.1 percent. In Egypt, the index gained 1.5 percent to 13,684 points, reclaiming the all-time high hit on June 8. Shares of private equity firm Qalaa Holding jumped 5.2 percent in high volumes. On Saturday the company reported a narrowing first quarter net loss of 384 million Egyptian pounds ($21.54 million). Analysts at Naeem Brokerage expect positive operating trends in the coming quarters, although they still anticipate losses mainly because of higher debt servicing costs. Orascom Telecom, the most traded stock of the day, jumped 5.9 percent, its second straight session of strong gains. On Monday the company reported a huge leap in its first quarter net profit.

The Japanese conglomerate confirmed it was in talks with suitors, but did not name them, noting it had been unable to reach an agreement by a self-imposed June 28 deadline with its preferred bidder - a group that includes state-backed fund Innovation Network Corp of Japan (INCJ), the Development Bank of Japan (DBJ), U.S. private equity firm Bain Capital and South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix Inc (000660.KS). A representative for Western Digital declined to comment, and a representative for Foxconn, the world's largest contract electronics maker, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry (2317.TW), was not immediately available for comment. Talks with the preferred consortium have stalled over what sources say are proposals by SK Hynix that it helps fund a deal through convertible bonds - a step that could eventually give it an equity interest in the world's second-largest maker of NAND flash memory chips. Toshiba doesn't want its South Korean rival to have an equity or management influence in the chip business - a stance it has taken to satisfy a Japanese government keen to keep Toshiba's technology under domestic control. Toshiba told its creditor banks at a meeting on Tuesday that it had begun talks with alternative bidders because talks with the consortium had stalled, the banking sources said. They didn't want to be identified as they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter. FILE PHOTO: A Western Digital Corporation hard drive is pictured here in Encinitas, California April 19, 2011.Mike Blake/File PhotoToshiba had no option but to say it's in talks with other suitors because the preferred consortium is falling through, said another official involved in the talks, who also requested anonymity as those negotiations are sensitive. Toshiba needs to sell its chip business to plug a hole in its balance sheet by the fiscal year-end in March, to avoid an automatic delisting of its shares from Tokyo's stock market. The 140-year-old laptops-to-nuclear conglomerate was still recovering from a $1.3 billion accounting scandal in 2015 when it was hit by billions of dollars of cost overruns at its now bankrupt U.S. nuclear unit Westinghouse in December.  Sources have said that INCJ and DBJ, said to be wary of SK Hynix, could back a deal with Western Digital. Toshiba executives, though, have been reluctant to consider a deal with Western Digital, with sources saying ties between the two companies have been strained since Western Digital bought SanDisk, Toshiba's memory chip business partner, in May last year. Last month, Western Digital sought a U.S. court injunction to prevent Toshiba selling the chip unit without its consent. A hearing on that request is scheduled for Friday. In July 7 court documents, Western Digital said it matched rival bidders' offers to buy the flash memory unit - though the actual dollar figure of the bid was redacted.

Abercrombie & Fitch Co, the teen brand with a 125-year heritage, became the latest to demonstrate that on Monday, ending talks about a potential sale after failing to agree terms with potential suitors. Successful deals in the mercurial world of U.S. fashion are rare, and now look even less likely to succeed as sales dip across the board. Cost savings can be counterproductive if it means squeezing money out of marketing and design, and buyers are taking a risk on a style that can easily go out of favor. As a result, established brands like Abercrombie are having problems finding a savior. Often, as well as spending the money to buy the brand or business, you then have to spend more to do something strategic that will propel growth, and that means paying out twice before getting a return, said Neil Saunders, managing director of market research firm GlobalData Retail. Five of the 20 companies involved in the biggest private equity apparel deals of the last decade have been restructured or gone bankrupt. All struggled under the debt load of a leveraged buyout. The biggest acquisition, Apollo Global Management's roughly $3.1 billion leveraged buyout of Claire's Stores Inc, restructured in 2016. The second-largest acquisition, J. Crew Group Inc, which TPG Capital and Leonard Green & Partners bought for about $3 billion, is now being restructured. Gymboree Corp filed for bankruptcy last month, seven years after Bain Capital's $1.8 billion purchase. Mounting Pressure Many U.S. fashion bosses are finding they have no option but to consider a sale as pressure mounts from more affordable fast-fashion chains from Europe such as Zara and H&M; , and customers abandon malls in favor of Amazon.com Inc and other online retailers. Outerwear brand Eddie Bauer, for example, is exploring a sale while also seeking relief from its debt load, sources have told Reuters. Teen brand American Apparel explored a sale last year before ultimately filing for bankruptcy. As Abercrombie's experience shows, finding a willing buyer at the right price is difficult. Public company board members are reticent about green-lighting large-scale mergers and acquisitions because it's hard to find a good example of a business that has been rewarded by the equity market for doing so, said Rohit Singh, who specializes in retail at UBS Investment Bank, not speaking specifically about Abercrombie. Struggling retailers are a tough sell to potential acquirers. Merging with another company risks double the trouble – more brands falling flat and more stores bereft of customers. Most fashion retailers are locked into store leases, and as landlords watch their malls empty out, they are increasingly unwilling to give their tenants an easy path out. Perhaps the reason the Abercrombie deal didn’t get done was that they’ve got way too many stores in way too many malls that don’t make any money, and the cost to unwind those pieces and get out of those stores is just too great to compensate for the upside, said Mark Belford, a retail specialist at KPMG Corporate Finance. After failing to strike a deal, Abercrombie now has no choice but to go it alone. On Monday, the New Albany, Ohio-based retailer said it will focus on its growing surf-wear brand Hollister and try to reposition its flagship brand, which has reported falling quarterly sales since 2014. Sinking Rocks The most successful acquisitions have been those of younger brands, which have room for growth and have yet to develop expensive supply chains and costly, little-used store bases. Gap Inc's $150 million purchase of athletic and yoga clothing line Athleta Inc in 2008, for example, gave it a foothold in a growing fashion trend. The acquisition helped save Gap when sales of its jeans slowed as shoppers shifted to leggings. Apparel retailers that bought rivals in the hope of finding growth or eliminating competition have found little payoff. “Oftentimes, the companies themselves aren't growing, so it doesn't solve the underlying challenge, said Josh Chernoff, managing director, retail at consultant Parthenon-EY. If you tie two rocks together, they sink just as fast or faster. The changing winds of fashion derailed Wolverine Worldwide’s $1.2 billion acquisition of boat shoe maker Sperry and other brands in 2012, several of which Wolverine tried to sell this year. Shoppers’ addiction to discounting crushed Men's Wearhouse Inc's $1.8 billion acquisition of rival Jos. A. Bank, the value of which was almost written off. The suit retailer's sales plunged after it abandoned its famous buy-one-get-three-free specials in the wake of the 2014 merger. Ascena Retail Group Inc, one of the few serial acquirers in U.S. apparel, has been laid low by its roughly $2.1 billion acquisition of Ann Inc, parent of work-wear line Ann Taylor. The 2015 acquisition was meant to give it a full portfolio of womenswear brands and enable it to cut $150 million over three years in costs as it centralized the different lines’ internet infrastructure, distribution and manufacturing. But sales for all its brands have dropped, most recently a combined 8 percent in the third quarter of 2017. Ascena's market value is now $400 million, roughly 85 percent lower than before the deal. Fashion is not something you can solve with math, said Belford. Fashion – you either get it or you don’t, and it either sells or it sits on the shelf.

The deal would mark EQT's second major investment in the U.S. healthcare sector, and highlight the continued appetite for companies that help drugmakers with their research and development processes. The negotiations are advanced and a deal could be announced as soon as this week, the people said, asking not to be identified because the discussions are confidential. EQT and Certara declined to comment. Arsenal did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Princeton, New Jersey-based Certara provides technology and consulting services aimed at helping pharmaceutical companies obtain approval for their treatments. It offers a novel technology that allows drugmakers to model the performance of drugs, in some cases reducing the need for costly and potentially dangerous clinical testing. Certara also operates a consulting arm aimed at assisting drug makers with submissions to regulators. There has been a flurry of private equity investments in the pharmaceutical services sector in recent years, as the sector benefits from pharmaceutical companies' drive to cut costs, reduce clinical trial times and expand their research and development presence around the world. Recent deals include INC Research Holdings Inc's $7.4 billion merger with inVentiv Health Holdings and Quintiles Transnational Holdings Inc's $17.6 billion merger with IMS Health Holdings Inc. Last year, Stockholm, Sweden-based EQT made its first major U.S. healthcare investment, buying Press Ganey Holdings Inc, a provider of patient satisfaction surveys, for around $2.35 billion. EQT has made more than $8 billion in healthcare investments in the past three years, including in companies such as prosthetics maker Ottobock and Sivantos Group, one of the world's leading manufacturers of hearing aids.

Hit by a sharp downturn in its biggest markets, Pearson has sold off some of its best known assets in recent years including the Financial Times and the Economist to enable it to invest in its core business of education.  The 173-year-old group said on Tuesday it would now reduce its stake in the world's biggest consumer book publisher to 25 percent from 47 percent, enabling it to free up cash to return to shareholders and bolster its balance sheet. Shares in the group initially jumped more than 3 percent on the news but were down 6 percent by 0900 GMT as analysts processed what the deal would mean for future dividends, with many estimates coming in below expectations.  Today's deal enables us to realize a significant amount of the value that we've helped to create (at Penguin Random House) whilst continuing to be part of what is the world's biggest and best trade publisher, said Chief Executive John Fallon. Related CoverageBertelsmann has no plans to buy remaining 25 percent of Random HouseWe'll be using the proceeds to maintain our strong balance sheet, to invest in the ongoing digital transformation of Pearson and return 300 million pounds in excess capital to shareholders.  Established as a joint venture between Pearson and Bertelsmann in 2013, Penguin Random House has an enterprise value of $3.55 billion and a list of authors including John Grisham, Arundhati Roy and Paulo Coelho. Bertelsmann CEO Thomas Rabe said the company had achieved its goal of securing a 75 percent majority holding, with Pearson pledging to retain its 25 percent stake for at least 18 months. As part of the deal, Pearson will receive $968 million plus future dividends including a payout of $66 million in April 2018. The two shareholders will take further dividends in future by increasing the book publisher's leverage to two times net debt to core earnings. Analysts said Pearson had extracted a good price without overly diluting its future earnings. However the sale did not change the underlying pressures facing the group's sprawling education business.  Employing 35,000, Pearson provides everything from textbooks to school testing, college courses and online degrees around the world. Having grown rapidly for years, it started to lose its way in 2015 when the U.S. economy recovered, encouraging more people to take jobs rather than go into higher education. Since then, students have moved to ditch expensive text books for second-hand copies and digital services, hammering Pearson's income and forcing it to cut costs across the business after it reported five profit warnings in four years. This is the last piece of the family silver to be sold off, after the FT and the Economist, so there's not much scope for Pearson management to pull any more rabbits out of the hat, said Roddy Davidson, media analyst at Shore Capital. Pearson's shares, down 30 percent in the last year, fell a further 6 percent after the company suggested its future dividend would be in the mid-teens, below market expectations of nearer 27 pence. Since this would give just over a 2 percent dividend yield, that is likely to mean the stock loses its appeal to income funds, which had held it because of its formal dividend yield (from 2016), said Liberum analyst Ian Whittaker, a long-time critic of the company with a sell rating on the stock.  That could put pressure on the stock moving forwards. Additional reporting by Helen Reid in London and Georgina Prodhan in Frankfurt; Editing by James Davey and Mark Potter"

Western Digital, in court documents filed July 7, said it has made six proposals since February, including a proposal on June 27 matching the best offer. On June 21, Toshiba said its preferred bidder was a consortium of Bain Capital and Japanese government investors offering $18 billion. Since February, Toshiba has been scrambling to sell its memory chip business, the second largest in the industry after Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, to cover losses from its ailing nuclear reactor division.  But suitor Western Digital sued Toshiba in San Francisco County Superior Court for an injunction to stop the sale, arguing that a joint-venture it has with Toshiba at a plant in Japan means the chipmaker cannot sell without its consent. In a filing on July 7, Mark Long, the chief financial officer of Western Digital, said the company's most recent offer on June 27, made with private equity firm KKR, is in line with the highest competing bids for (Toshiba's chip unit) that have been reported in the press.  The actual dollar figure of Western Digital's offer is redacted from the document. Western Digital declined to comment. A Toshiba spokeswoman declined to comment on deal details, but said Western Digital has not participated in the bid processes since early this year. Western Digital says the bid processes violate their joint venture contracts, and has been making bid offers separately from the processes. Toshiba has asked the court in San Francisco to dismiss Western Digital's attempt to stop the sale, arguing that the U.S. court does not have proper jurisdiction over a business that is based primarily in Japan and that an injunction would cause it irreparable harm. A hearing is scheduled for Friday. Aaron Rakers, a managing director with Stifel, said in a note to clients on Sunday that the new filings suggest the two parties could reach a deal before the court hearing. Given that some negotiations between (Western Digital) and Toshiba on proposed acquisition terms started over the past month, we think a resolution could be possible prior to the (July 14) hearing, Rakers wrote.

Profit rose to $75.3 billion from $73.9 billion a year earlier, its annual report showed on Tuesday. Total investment income was $83 billion in 2016, compared with $76.7 billion in 2015. Its accumulated annualized investment return rose to 4.76 percent last year. The increase was bolstered by portfolio adjustment and high returns on stock markets in Europe and the United states, Li Wenping, managing director of CIC's financial department, told a news conference. The fund is seeking to increase direct investment in the United States with its newly-established New York office, spokeswoman Liu Fangyu told Reuters. That includes direct investments in infrastructure and property. Presently, 42 percent of CIC's total overseas portfolio is in the United States, but mostly in public markets, she said. We established the U.S. office with the mandates to explore the opportunities and…establish close relationships with local partners, with the local government agencies and the local regulatory agencies, she added.  CIC, headquartered in Beijing, was founded in 2007 to help China earn a higher return on its foreign exchange reserves. The fund reported a 6.22 percent return on its overseas investments in 2016, compared with a negative 2.96 percent in 2015. Eight years following the global financial crisis, major economies' rounds of easing policies and developed countries' sluggish economic recovery led to intensifying competition among global funds, adding pressure on investment returns, CIC Vice Chairman and President Tu Guangshao said in the report. Potential risks are the rising uncertainties of global politics and policies, he said, referring to the outlook for 2017. CIC invests overseas through two subsidiaries, CIC International Co and direct investment vehicle CIC Capital Corp. CIC Capital, launched in 2015, signed 16 deals worth $5 billion last year. Last month, CIC signed the buyout of European warehouse firm Logicor Ltd [IPO-LOG.L] from Blackstone Group LP for 12.25 billion euros ($13.95 billion), Europe's biggest private equity real estate deal. Earlier this month, CIC joined a consortium led by TIAA Private Investments and Antarctica Capital LLC to buy InterPark LLC, the largest owner-operator of parking infrastructure in the United States from Alinda Capital Partners LLC. CIC started with initial funding of $200 billion. By the end of 2016, its assets had surpassed $813.5 billion. Profit and loss from fair value changes recorded an increase of $23.5 billion over last year, primarily due to the reversal in fair value of financial assets, Li said. Through its Central Huijin Investment Ltd subsidiary, CIC is a shareholder in 18 Chinese state-owned financial institutions, including the country's largest banks such as China Development Bank Corp, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd, China Construction Bank Corp and Agricultural Bank of China Ltd, according to its annual report.

The duo spent nearly a year in consolidation talks only for the Kansas Corporation Commission in April to rule against the transaction, insisting the deal as it stood was not in the best interests of the companies' 1.6 million customers in Kansas and Missouri. State regulators have become more proactive in recent months toward utility mergers and acquisitions, intervening in deals as they seek to protect local markets amid tough operating conditions for the power industry. Regulatory considerations are also a big part of the $18 billion-plus battle for Texas' Oncor Electric Delivery Co, which is subject to competing interest from Berkshire Hathaway and Elliott Management. I'm okay admitting that we were disappointed with the order in April, but the order was specific in what [the regulator] wanted changed and that they were open to us working together to reach a solution, Mark Ruelle, chief executive officer of Westar Energy, told Reuters in a phone interview. The companies are working with all stakeholders including regulators to gain necessary approvals, with the aim of closing the merger in the first half of 2018, according to a joint statement. Balancing Act Under the revised terms, the two firms will approach the tie-up as a merger of equals, with a holding company created, in which Westar Energy shareholders will get one share for each of their current shares, and Great Plains stockholders getting 0.5981 shares for each they own. Previously, Great Plains had proposed buying Westar and making it a subsidiary, using around $8 billion of borrowing: a level of debt with which the Kansas regulator was unhappy. The ultimate structure of merger of equals was the only way to meet the interests of both (shareholders and consumers), Terry Bassham, chief executive officer of Great Plains, told Reuters. The duo have proposed a one-off pool worth upwards of $50 million, which would be distributed to consumers in 2018, while Westar shareholders should expect a 15 percent increase in dividend payouts to match the payout Great Plains stockholders currently receive. The combined company will also buy back around 30 million shares in both 2018 and 2019, Bassham added. Annual cost savings generated by the merger, rising to $140 million to $170 million in 2021, from $35 million to 45 million next year, would help finance these measures, while also allowing the company to achieve the profit level allowed by a regulated utility without increasing customer rates. U.S. power firms are battling the financial impact of greater consumer efficiency on demand, making mergers which help cut costs attractive. Goldman Sachs, Barclays and Lazard were financial advisers to Great Plains, with Guggenheim Securities advising Westar. Bracewell and Baker Botts were the respective legal advisers.

In a Monday conference call with investors, Chief Financial Officer Adezio Lima said Cemig had decided to fully dispose of a majority, 43 percent stake in Rio de Janeiro utility Light SA and focus on in-house generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity. Cemig, Brazil's No. 3 power utility, is making headway on efforts to cut capital spending this year after losing the licensing rights for several hydropower dams and seeing a surge in fresh capital needs from some subsidiaries, Lima said. There are 13 interested parties in the Light stake, he added. Reuters first reported Cemig's plans to exit Light in March. The state-controlled utility wants to ease creditor concerns over how it will repay debt by downsizing after growing too big, too fast in the past decade. A federal government decision that scrapped power contracts brought about a decline in the value of Cemig's power assets, tripling its debt since 2012. What's clear is that Cemig's cash generation is not enough to honor looming maturities, said Raul Grego Lemos, an analyst with Eleven Financial Research. Lima expects banks to agree on terms for longer Cemig maturities within 20 days. Every percentage-point decline in Brazil's benchmark overnight rate cuts Cemig's debt-servicing costs by 125 million reais, he said. Cemig's preferred shares rose 1.3 percent to 8.43 reais on Monday afternoon trading. Subpar Returns Cemig's divestiture plans have taken longer than those of rivals, demonstrating the difficulties of trimming a company that expanded beyond power into fiber optics, information technology and gas distribution in recent years. Most of those takeovers have delivered subpar returns. Proceeds from the sale of a stake in power transmission firm Taesa Transmissora Aliança de Energia SA could be used to facilitate the Light exit, Lima said. The process to conclude the sale of Cemig's stake in Renova Energia SA could take up to 60 days, Lima said. On Friday, Reuters reported that Brookfield Asset Management Inc proposed buying out the stakes that Cemig and Light have in Renova. Lima said negotiations to exit the Santo Antônio hydropower dam are near conclusion and pending regulatory approval. $1 = 3.2702 reais

Last month Canada's fifth-biggest lender completed the $5 billion acquisition of Chicago-based PrivateBancorp, its biggest ever, as it diversifies from its home market.  Geneva Advisors, which focuses on high-net-worth clients, has $8.4 billion in assets under management and a staff of about 100. This investment will add scale in key markets where we can offer clients differentiated, high-touch service, said Larry Richman, CIBC's group head, U.S. region. CIBC will pay an initial $135 million and a further $65 million if performance conditions are met, with 25 percent in cash and the rest in shares. Coming almost immediately off the heels of the PrivateBancorp purchase closing, this could raise some concerns that CIBC could be back on the acquisition trail too soon, said Barclays analyst John Aiken.  CIBC Chief Executive Officer Victor Dodig said last month that the bank would focus for the next two years on integrating PrivateBancorp but could make some acquisitions in wealth management.

Loeb's Third Point hedge fund revealed a $3.5 billion stake in Nestle on June 25, making it the eighth-largest shareholder, urging the world's largest packaged food maker to more aggressively improve returns. Three days later, Nestle addressed some of the New York-based fund's points with a 20 billion Swiss franc ($21 billion) share buyback coupled with a plan to increase leverage and prioritise acquisitions in some high-growth areas. Loeb met Nestle CEO Mark Schneider on June 2, the source said on Monday, adding that no other meetings were currently planned before a Sept. 26 investor seminar by the Swiss maker of Nescafe, Perrier and Gerber baby food. Third Point generally agrees with the direction Nestle is heading in under Schneider, the first outside CEO in nearly a century, said the source, who declined to be identified. But it wants to see the company act with greater urgency, including by setting a margin growth target like peers including Unilever and Danone have recently done. Loeb's Ultra fund, which is invested in Nestle, is doing well this year. It gained 0.9 percent in June, taking its year-to-date performance to 17.2 percent, said the source. Nestle has not publicly addressed Loeb's call for it to sell its 23 percent stake in French cosmetics giant L'Oreal , which is worth about 23 billion euros ($26 billion). But behind closed doors, Nestle's board does not seem keen to divest the stake, which it has owned for more than four decades, the source said, confirming what other sources have previously told Reuters. Third Point, which has not yet commented publicly on Nestle's plans, may give an update in its quarterly letter to shareholders due later this month, the source said, adding that its current plan of campaign was to keep sharing its views and talking to the company. Last month, Third Point said that it owned roughly 40 million Nestle shares in its funds and a special purpose vehicle raised especially for the move on the company. It started buying Nestle shares earlier this year when the stock was trading above 70 Swiss francs per share, the source said. The shares jumped 4 percent to a record high the day Third Point's letter was disclosed, but have since pared much of those gains. The stock was trading at 83.05 francs per share at 1012 GMT on Monday, up 1.5 percent. ($1 = 0.8785 euros) (Editing by Alexander Smith)"

Russian-produced turbines are indeed being installed in Crimea, assembled from Russian components, Peskov told reporters on a conference call. Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. EU sanctions bar European individuals and companies from providing energy technology to Crimea or from taking any actions designed to circumvent those rules due to the bloc's view that the peninsula was illegally stolen from Ukraine.

The Sunday Times reported that American investment firm Iconiq Capital had held talks with a number of buyout firms about a possible move for the club known as Spurs. It said the San Francisco fund manages the wealth of several Silicon Valley billionaires, including the founder of Facebook. In 2001 Bahamas-based Joe Lewis bought Tottenham through investment vehicle ENIC, which owns 85.55 percent of the club. Tottenham finished second in the Premier League last season behind London rivals Chelsea to again qualify for the lucrative Champions League, European soccer's elite club competition. Spurs are building a 61,500-seat stadium on their existing White Hart Lane site for 800 million pounds and will use the national stadium at Wembley this season while the new ground is constructed for the club to use from the 2018-19 campaign. Tottenham said on their website (www.tottenhamhotspur.com) on Sunday: The club engaged Rothschild to secure the funding for the new stadium. As expected many proposals came forward including bank debt and equity investment. The club announced on 31 May 2017 the completion of the bank debt financing for the new stadium with a consortium of banks involving Bank of America Merrill Lynch International Limited, Goldman Sachs Bank USA and HSBC Bank plc. The Board believes this was the optimum solution in the interests of fans, employees and shareholders and for the continued development of the club. The Board is not in any discussions relating to a takeover offer for the club. Tottenham announced on May 31 that the club had signed a 400 million pounds, five-year loan to help finance the cost of building the new stadium, which is being purpose-built to also stage National Football League (NFL) games. $1 = 0.7764 pounds Editing by Andrew Both"

Investors were told about VW's systematic emissions test cheating using illegal software on Sept. 18 2015, when the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) informed markets. The Sunday newspaper Bild am Sonntag reported that Oliver Schmidt, a VW executive who was arrested in Miami in January this year, told the then CEO Martin Winterkorn about possible financial implications at an Aug. 25, 2015 presentation.  German securities law requires firms publish any market sensitive news in a timely fashion. A probe by German prosecutors includes investigating whether VW disclosed details promptly. The newspaper said Schmidt informed Winterkorn about the maximum possible penalty at the meeting that was also attended by Heinz-Jakob Neusser, VW's development chief at the time, and Herbert Diess, who still works as VW's brand chief. Bild am Sonntag cited U.S. investigation documents. A VW spokesman said the firm would not comment on the report because of ongoing legal and regulatory investigations. It has previously said it did not violate disclosure rules. The VW spokesman also said Diess had no comment. Lawyers for Winterkorn, who stepped down as VW CEO in September 2015, could not immediately be reached for comment. Annette Voges, the lawyer for Neusser who also left his position in September 2015, declined to comment on behalf of her client saying she had not seen the statements by Schmidt. A lawyer for Schmidt declined to comment.      VW admitted using a defeat device, the name used to describe software to deceive regulators about the real extent of diesel pollution, to the U.S. EPA and California's Air Resources Board on Sept. 3 2015, according to VW's annual report for 2016. In the annual report, VW said its management did not make details of the scandal public before Sept. 18, 2015 because board members considered costs would be controllable overall with a view to the business activities of Volkswagen Group. German prosecutors are investigating Diess, Winterkorn and VW's current chairman Hans Dieter Poetsch, as part of a wider probe into market manipulation. The executives have denied wrongdoing. German prosecutors conducting the investigation into market manipulation declined to comment on Sunday. Bild am Sonntag also reported that Winterkorn and Diess were informed VW had used a defeat device at a meeting on July 27, 2015. Diess had joined VW just weeks earlier.

Analysts at Naeem Brokerage said in a note that the market might witness a slight temporary correction, adding that banks might benefit because they expected higher investment income to offset delinquencies and slower credit growth. The largest listed lender, Commercial International Bank added 1.4 percent on Sunday. Gulf Shares of Advanced Petrochemical , the first Saudi company to report second-quarter earnings, lost 0.7 percent after only a 1 percent year on year increase in second-quarter net profit. Eight of the other 14 listed petrochemical makers declined, helping drag the index 0.5 percent lower. Riyad Capital expects net earnings for the petrochemicals sector to shrink 13 percent year on year. We expect margins to be lower as product spreads continue to weaken while shutdowns could constrain already impacted sector, it said in a note. Qatar's index edged down 0.2 percent in the lowest daily traded volume since Saudi Arabia and three other Arab states cut diplomatic and trade links with Doha on June 5. Twenty shares rose while 15 shares. In their statement late on Thursday, the four Arab states said the initial list of 13 demands they had put to Qatar was now void and they pledged further political, economic and legal steps against the emirate. Gulf funds not including Qataris were net buyers by a tiny margin for the first time since the crisis erupted, bourse data showed. They made up a little over 5 percent of the total market turnover on Sunday. Locals made up a little under three-quarters and were net buyers. The Abu Dhabi index added 0.3 percent, as shares of Dana Gas, which made up a little half of the total market turnover on Sunday, rebounded 1.5 percent. On Thursday Dana fell 1.4 percent after sources told Reuters that London's High Court planned to hold a full hearing in September on efforts by the company to restructure $700 million of Islamic bonds. In neighbouring Dubai shares favoured by short-term retail investors were the most active, with builder Arabtec jumping 7.4 percent to 3.47 dirhams. The trend shall remain bullish towards the next barrier at 3.56 dirhams, where it may attract profit taking, but a break over shall ignite aggressive buying until the previous highs of 4.00 - 4.20 dirhams, said a note by NBAD Securities.

It would be one of the first major structural changes in Gambia following the end of President Yahya Jammeh's more than 20-year rule in January. State-owned China Communications Construction Company (CCCC) (601800.SS) says one of its subsidiaries has made a bid for a  140 million euro ($159.91 million) contract Gambia has launched to redevelop the port. France's Bollore Group (BOLL.PA) has also submitted an offer to develop the port for hundreds of millions of dollars, sources told Reuters, and was part of a recent delegation of French investors to the country. The port was run by a state agency during Jammeh's rule. It is considered to have strategic potential thanks to its easy access to Atlantic shipping lanes.  Abdoulie Tambedou, managing director of the Gambia Ports Authority said there had already been several offers. The Chinese are interested in investing in the infrastructure for an overall envelope of 140 million euros, he told Reuters in an interview. We hope to agree the financing in the next six months. An official at CCCC confirmed that one of its subsidiaries was bidding for the contract, without specifying which. In a sign of their interest, a witness saw a Chinese delegation visiting the port last week. Tambedou confirmed Bollore's offer, without giving the price, and said this included both infrastructure costs and the rental concession. Chinese interest in the project follows China's resumption of diplomatic ties with former Taiwan ally Gambia last year under the one China policy, which states that self-ruled Taiwan is part of China. President Adama Barrow's new government reaffirmed that position in February.  Workers in Gambia's main port of Banjul cheer from the top of a vessel, June 29, 2017. Picture taken June 29, 2017.Emma FargeChina is also a major market for Gambia's exports, which globally are mainly peanuts, wood, cashews, fish and fruit.   Upgrading the port will take 30-36 months to complete, Tambedou said. Struggling Gambia is poor. It ranks 173 out of 189 countries on the U.N. Human Development Index, below Haiti. It is badly in need of key infrastructure development. There is not a single bridge across its eponymous 1,120 km (695 mile)-long river that wiggles up the length of the country, for example. People and goods have to be shipped across on ferries - or go around. Gambia is nonetheless seen as a key transit country for reaching remote areas of Guinea, Mali and Senegal that are easier to access from Banjul than from the countries' own ports and capitals. Space constraints at the port, however, mean that arriving cargo ships often have to wait at anchorage before entering.  Since the departure of Jammeh, Tambedou said that trade was picking up, with shippers sending imports such as sugar in bigger volumes than before.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-ftc-idUSL1N1JR1UN","Trump missing chance to steer antitrust as key FTC slots go unfilled","","Jul 07 2017","The White House is passing upa chance to steer policy on everything from mergers toadvertising as it delays choosing from three front-runners toname a permanent chair for the Federal Trade Commission.","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House is passing up a chance to steer policy on everything from mergers to advertising as it delays choosing from three front-runners to name a permanent chair for the Federal Trade Commission. The FTC, which shares the work of antitrust enforcement with the Justice Department and pursues companies accused of deceptive advertising, is currently headed by acting Chairman Maureen Ohlhausen, who was named on Jan. 25. Even without a permanent chair and missing key staff, in the past month, the FTC has forced Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (WBA.O) to scrap a plan to buy Rite Aid Corp (RAD.N), sued to stop daily fantasy sports companies DraftKings and FanDuel from merging and filed a complaint aimed at stopping a North Dakota hospital system from buying clinics. The Trump administration has not named a permanent chair. For the past several weeks, Ohlhausen, a Republican, has been the leading candidate, according to a person familiar with her candidacy. Also under consideration are Joe Simons of the law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton and Garrison LLP, according to the trade publication MLEX; and Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes, according to a source close to the situation. Both Ohlhausen and Simons would be traditional Republican enforcers, meaning that few enforcement decisions would change and the pro-business approach with a slant toward approving big mergers would likely continue. That said, as a commissioner, Ohlhausen dissented on an FTC decision to sue Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) for allegedly using its market power to maintain a monopoly on key semiconductors. Depending on who is named to the agency, this lawsuit could potentially be dropped. Google's critics in Silicon Valley tend to support Reyes, who has little background in antitrust issues, since he and the District of Columbia attorney general wrote a letter in 2016 urging the FTC to consider re-opening a probe of Google (GOOGL.O) that the agency had closed in early 2013. The wide-ranging probe had touched on everything from search bias to Google's practice of scraping third-party content for its sites to the licensing of standard essential patents. Because Ohlhausen is only acting as FTC head, she cannot hire a permanent head of the FTC's Bureau of Competition or fill other key posts. The chair sets the priorities. It's important to have that person in to set the direction and pursue initiatives, said Deborah Garza, who served in the Bush administration and is at the law firm Covington and Burling LLP.  Nominations for the FTC will come sometime this summer because potential nominees are in the process of being cleared, according to a White House official, asked about the delay. The Trump administration has identified who the individuals will be for certain positions, said the official, who asked not to be identified. Lots of Empty Offices Beyond lacking a permanent chair, the agency is thin at the top. Rather than four commissioners working with Ohlhausen, she has just one, Democrat Terrell McSweeny. This means that Trump may name two Republicans but the third person must be a Democrat or independent since by law no more than three commissioners can be from the same political party.  Leading candidates for the two Republican seats are Bilal Sayyed of the law firm McDermott Will & Emery and Noah Phillips, an aide to Senator John Cornyn, according to the person familiar with the nomination process. For the open Democratic commission seat, Senator Chuck Schumer has backed consumer advocate Rohit Chopra but the White House has also spoken with others, including agriculture expert Lillian Salerno. The agency has plenty of work on its plate including the merger of Linde (LING.DE) and Praxair (PX.N), which would create a $73 billion global industrial gases leader in a highly consolidated market. A second is Canada's Potash Corp's (POT.TO) purchase of Agrium Inc (AGU.TO) in the consolidated fertilizer sector. The president has his hands full with a lot of different issues. The FTC is a major fill for any administration, and he needs to get to that, said Carl Hittinger, an antitrust expert with the law firm Baker and Hostetler LLP. Once a commissioner is named to the independent FTC the president has no say in what decisions are made, so commissioners must be chosen carefully, added Hittinger.

The two companies are at loggerheads after Haldex's board last week unexpectedly withdrew its support for the German group's 4.86 billion Swedish crown ($577 million) all-cash bid, citing concerns that regulatory approval was unlikely. Rather than publicly commenting on premature conclusions of Haldex about the status of specific discussions with competition authorities, Knorr-Bremse will continue its cooperation with the authorities to assist them in reaching an informed decision on the merits of this transaction, the firm said on Friday. Haldex said earlier on Friday that feedback from U.S. authorities reinforced its view, as the U.S. Department of Justice's (DOJ) concerns affected six of its eight product areas and would hit all but one manufacturing facility. The divestments will consequently be too extensive to procure competitive solutions that the authority would approve, saying the only reason for Knorr-Bremse to continue pursuing a deal was to dismantle and eliminate a competitor. Knorr-Bremse said the DOJ's feedback was completely expected and affirmed it was prepared to offer significant remedies to obtain regulatory clearance for the deal, without providing details on which assets it has offered to divest.

If the all-cash purchase wins approval from federal and state regulators and a bankruptcy judge, Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Energy unit will assume control of one of the largest U.S. electricity transmission companies. Buffett views infrastructure bets as a good long-term investment, said Steven Check, president of Check Capital Management Inc in Costa Mesa, California, which invests $300 million of the $1.4 billion it oversees in Berkshire. With the relatively limited opportunities available to a company of Berkshire's size, investments such as Oncor that are likely to yield 8 to 10 percent annually are acceptable, Check added. The acquisition also highlights the growing prominence of Greg Abel, 55, Berkshire Hathaway Energy's chief executive. Investors consider him a top candidate to succeed Buffett, 86, at the Omaha, Nebraska-based parent company's helm. Abel and other Berkshire Hathaway Energy executives were not available on Friday for interviews. Buffett's office did not respond to separate interview requests. 'Recession Resistant' Dallas-based Oncor delivers power to more than 3.4 million homes and businesses through roughly 122,000 miles (196,000 km) of transmission and distribution lines. It is 80 percent owned by Energy Future Holdings Corp, the company Berkshire has agreed to buy out of bankruptcy. Oncor posted $431 million of profit in 2016, and similar sums in the prior three years. Buffett values such consistency, telling Berkshire shareholders in February that utilities generate recession-resistant earnings because they offer an essential service that generates remarkably steady demand. Meanwhile, Abel said in a statement the companies share a common goal of providing exceptional customer service and a commitment to invest in critical infrastructure. Abel has also been deepening his commitment to renewable energy, including wind, generating tax credits that bolster Berkshire's balance sheet. His unit also owns HomeServices of America, a big residential real estate brokerage. Berkshire Hathaway Energy typically generates nearly 10 percent of its parent's profit, contributing $2.29 billion to an overall $24.07 billion in 2016. Buffett has always had a lot of confidence in Greg Abel, and wouldn't mind putting a nearly unlimited number of businesses under his watch, Check said. Texas Regulator The Oncor purchase requires approval by the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT), which in 2016 and 2017 scuttled takeover bids by privately held Hunt Consolidated Inc and NextEra Energy Inc (NEE.N). Regulators had asked for Oncor to be ringfenced so it would not assume excess debt from any acquirer, and also not pay out too much cash as dividends. Unlike NextEra, Berkshire might be more willing to leave the ringfence in place and allow restriction on dividends, making the approval process a little less cumbersome, Cowen & Co analyst Amer Tiwana wrote in a research report. The PUCT is required by law to rule on Berkshire's bid within six months of receiving an application. A spokesman declined to comment on Berkshire's prospects. But Buffett wrote last year that regulators like Berkshire Hathaway Energy because it operates safely and efficiently and has unlimited capital to fund whatever projects make sense, without the need to pay dividends to its parent.  Berkshire expects to complete the Oncor purchase in the fourth quarter. It said the transaction implies an equity value of about $11.25 billion for Oncor. Kirkland & Ellis, a law firm representing Energy Future, said the transaction's enterprise value was about $18.1 billion. Energy Future was created from the $45 billion leveraged buyout in 2007 of the former TXU Corp by KKR & Co, TPG Capital Management and Goldman Sachs Group Inc's (GS.N) private equity arm. The buyout was a bet that natural gas prices would rise, allowing for higher electricity prices. Natural gas prices plunged instead, and Energy Future went bankrupt in 2014. Undoing an 'Unforced Error' Buffett had invested with Energy Future a decade ago, buying $2 billion of high-yield bonds. But he threw in the towel six years later, with an $873 million pre-tax loss. He has called that investment a major unforced error. Buffett entered the energy sector in 2000 when he led a group that bought Des Moines, Iowa-based MidAmerican Energy Holdings Co, later renamed Berkshire Hathaway Energy. He has since expanded in the central and western United States, such as with the Oregon-based PacifiCorp and Nevada-based NV Energy utilities. Berkshire has also forayed outside the United States, now owning the AltaLink electricity transmission company in Alberta, Canada and Northern Powergrid in Newcastle upon Tyne in England. Such bets have enabled Buffett to diversify Berkshire away from its traditional focus on insurance and stock-picking. Berkshire now owns more than 90 businesses including the BNSF railroad, Geico car insurance, Lubrizol chemicals and Dairy Queen ice cream. Assuming the Oncor transaction closes, Oncor CEO Bob Shapard would become executive chairman and be replaced by general counsel Allen Nye, under a previously announced plan.

The previously undisclosed details on the negotiations show how Amazon used its deep pockets and brand as leverage to convince Whole Foods to accept a sale process that would not result in a bidding war. Whole Food shares traded above Amazon's $42-per-share deal price for the first few days after the agreement was announced on June 16, on investor expectations of a higher bid. They have since traded slightly below that price, as such hopes dampened. The regulatory filing shows that Whole Foods agreed to forgo an auction process after it received expressions of interest from two other companies and four private equity firms. None of these parties are identified by name. The filing refers to a 'company X,' which proposed a merger of equals that valued Whole Foods at between $35 and $40 per share. U.S. supermarket chain owner Albertsons LLC is company X, a source familiar with the matter said. Albertsons did not respond to a request for comment. Nevertheless, Austin, Texas-based Whole Foods agreed not to pursue this, or solicit any other bids, in part because Amazon was very sensitive with respect to confidentiality and did not want to compete in a broader sale process, the filing said.  Whole Foods said in the filing it sought $45 per share from Amazon but settled for $42 per share, which the ecommerce giant called its best and final offer. Amazon had offered $41 in May, according to the filing. Amazon had also told Whole Foods it was considering other opportunities in case its final offer was turned down. The filing added that Amazon reserved the right to terminate the talks if there was any leak or rumor of its interest in Whole Foods.  The other company that expressed interest in Whole Foods, referred to in the filing as 'company Y,' had an interest in exploring a commercial relationship, such as a supply arrangement, and did not discuss any merger or acquisition, according to the filing. Whole Foods' management, under pressure from activist hedge fund Jana Partners LLC to explore a sale of the company, decided not to solicit proposals from the four private equity firms as the price proposed by Amazon likely exceeded the amount a private equity buyer could be expected to pay, according to the filing.

Stada's management is now reviewing the new offer, which is at the same price as the previous 5.3 billion euro ($6 bln) bid  but lowers the shareholder approval threshold to somewhere below 65 percent, the sources said. The private equity firms' previous offer of 66 euros a share, launched in April, secured the support of 65.52 percent of Stada's equity but failed to go through because the threshold was 67.5 percent. Stada's management had backed the original takeover and Bain and Cinven will launch the new offer once the Stada board and  Germany's financial watchdog have cleared it, the sources said. That could be as early as next week, they added.  The first bid missed the threshold despite the 49 percent premium offered by the buyout groups to trump a rival offer from private equity duo Advent and Permira. Some shareholders, mainly hedge funds, held back some of their shares, speculating on securing a higher price for any remaining stock after a successful initial tender offer. Bain and Cinven have set the acceptance threshold at below 65, although financing banks had given them room to reduce it to as low as 60 percent, the sources said.  The bidders obtained firm commitments for their new offer from significantly more than 15 percent of Stada's voting rights, giving them confidence that the offer will go through, the sources said. Activist investor Elliott Management's move to buy a Stada stake has delayed the board's review of the offer, the people added.  Stada wants to be extra cautious not to make any mistakes that could draw any litigation, one of the people said.  The size of the stake Elliott has bought remained unclear. It will have to be disclosed shortly, if the regulatory 3 percent or 5 percent thresholds have been crossed.  Elliott, which has not expressed a view publicly on the takeover bid, has not met with Bain and Cinven and has not made any specific proposals regarding the potential new bid, the sources said.  Stada's chief executive and its head of finance resigned on Tuesday ahead of the expected new bid, adding a note of uncertainty to the takeover process, which has proven to be more complex than the private equity firms anticipated after launching their blow-out offer.

Nearly three-quarters of all syndicated loans in the first six months were used to refinance existing debt, driving total fees to a record, even though refinancing is less lucrative than new loans backing mergers and acquisitions (M&A;) . “There were simply a lot of low-fee repricing and refinancing deals. These transactions boost the volume numbers, but don’t have the same impact on arrangement fees as new-money, acquisition finance loans,” said Jeff Nassof, a director at Freeman Consulting Services. Issuance by ‘junk’ rated companies refinancing or repricing to cut borrowing costs and lock in cheap debt before interest rates rise pushed US leveraged lending to a first-half record of about US$732bn, Thomson Reuters LPC data shows. Bank fees of around US$6.3bn from underwriting leveraged loans in the first half set a new half year record and were 65% higher than the same time last year, according to Freeman Consulting, which has been tracking this income since 2000. The jump in fees for leveraged loans offset falling fees on the US$854m of investment-grade loans arranged during the first half, which is the lowest half year issuance since the second half of 2013. The volume of loans backing mergers by higher-rated companies slid 3.5% from the same period last year as the market awaits details of new highly anticipated US tax and trade policies. “On both the leveraged and investment-grade side, M&A; has been fairly weak compared to 2015 and 2016, when there were more large-scale deals that relied on the capital markets for debt financing,” said Nassof. “For leveraged deals, private equity acquirers have been priced out of the market,” he said. “On the investment-grade side, major corporate acquirers are still on the sidelines as they digest the transformational deals they made last year, and wait for clarity on tax reform.” In the second quarter, only one acquisition loan supporting an investment grade merger topped US$5bn – the US$15.7bn bridge loan for US medical supplier Becton Dickinson’s purchase of medical technology company C R Bard, Nassof noted. This is the lowest number since the start of 2014 as there are usually an average of 3.5 deals of at least this size per quarter, he said. Home of the Brave The dip in M&A; dealmaking is due to the absence of detail on new tax and trade policies, rather than a lack of lender or investor appetite, said executives, strategists and bankers, as debt market conditions remain positive. The timing of legislative changes pledged by the Trump administration was pushed back after efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, failed earlier this year. “Clearly it’s not a lack of capital, that’s not the constraint,” said Ravi Saligram, chief executive officer of Ritchie Bros., a global auctioneer of industrial equipment. The companies that are venturing into large takeovers are those expecting less regulatory pushback, or are eager to grow by acquisition when organic growth is stunted, bankers and strategists said. Antitrust rulings have also curbed M&A; business after scuttling two major tie-ups in the insurance industry earlier this year. The pace of corporate mergers is widely expected to pick up once there is more evidence that planned tax and trade changes are gaining traction. The possibility that guidelines curbing leveraged lending could be rolled back could also mean more new issuance, and fee income for banks going forward. In the meantime, the heavy wave of refinancing is helping to boost banks’ profits while new-money lending remains light.

The stake sale will test the interest of some of the largest consumer food companies, which are looking to revitalize their sales as consumers turn to novelty and healthier alternatives.  A deal could also give thirteen-year old Kind, which has developed a brand known for its use of ingredients people can see and pronounce, its first corporate partner to expand both in the United States and abroad. New York-based Kind, which has $727 million in annual sales according to Euromonitor, is working with investment banks BDT Capital Partners and Centerview Partners Holdings LLC on the stake sale, the sources said. BDT is also a minority investor in Kind. The process could attract large food companies such as Kellogg Co (K.N), General Mills Inc (GIS.N), Campbell Soup Co (CPB.N) PepsiCo Inc (PEP.N) and Mars Inc, the sources said. Kind is not offering the right to buy out the entire company down the line as part of the deal, one of the sources added. The sources requested anonymity because the process is confidential.  Kind is solely focused on becoming the foremost health and wellness leader to provide our consumers with delicious and healthy products so they can do the kind thing every day, a Kind spokesman said, declining to comment specifically on the stake sale process. BDT declined to comment and Centerview could not be immediately reached for comment. Kind, founded in 2004 by Daniel Lubetzky, the Mexican-American son of a Holocaust survivor, sells nut bars, breakfast bars, clusters and fruit bites. It was one of the first popular food snacks to eschew artificial flavors and  preservatives, a trend that larger food companies are now embracing as they seek to woo back customers. In the United States, the world's biggest packaged food market, upstart brands such as Kind could account for 15 percent of a $464 billion sector in a decade's time compared with 5.0 percent now, according to Bernstein Research. In search of growth, food companies have turned to acquisitions, such as General Mills' $820 million deal for organic food maker Annie’s Inc in 2014. Still, minority investments in established brands such as Kind have been less frequent.  Private equity firm VMG group bought a stake in Kind in 2008. It later sold back its share to Lubetzky in 2014 in a stake sale that valued the company at $728.5 million. Reporting by Lauren Hirsch in New York"

The lender plans to launch a new wealth management unit in Japan at the start of the business year beginning April 2018, and targets 50 billion yen ($439.95 million) in annual operating profit within four to five years, Muneaki Tokunari told Reuters. MUFG's foray into wealth management comes as profitability at Japan's banks is pressured by negative interest rates and tepid corporate demand for cash during a period of weak economic growth. The new wealth management business will operate under the MUFG brand leveraging the expertise of U.S. bank Morgan Stanley, of which the Japanese lender is the single largest shareholder with a 23.4 percent stake, Tokunari said. We would introduce some wealth management knowledge and expertise from Morgan Stanley, because they have successfully expanded their wealth management business (in the United States), he said. We have seconded many young recruits to Morgan Stanley to get some hints, to get some expertise from their wealth management business. MUFG and Morgan Stanley already have a flourishing brokerage joint venture in Japan, stemming from a $9 billion lifeline the Japanese lender provided the Wall Street bank at the height of the financial crisis at the end of the last decade. The venture, Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley, was ranked second for Japanese mergers and acquisition advisory in 2016, and third for equity capital market underwriting, according to Thomson Reuters data. Tokunari said the new wealth management business would mainly target MUFG's existing small and mid-sized corporate clients, offering investment products and solutions. Private wealth rose 1.1 percent last year in Japan to $14.9 trillion, and is likely to reach $16.2 trillion by 2021, showed consultancy BCG's latest Global Wealth Market report. Of the total, 59 percent is in the form of cash and deposits representing significant opportunity for wealth managers to channel dormant funds into investments, analysts said. Tokunari also said MUFG would change the name of core banking unit Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ (BTMU) to MUFG Bank from April 1 to simplify the brand as it looks to expand overseas to offset slowing growth at home. MUFG's overseas operations currently account for 40 percent of revenue, and the executive said this could rise to 50 percent in the next five years as it looks for growth opportunities in the United States and the rest of Asia.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/gambia-economy-idUSL8N1JX5U0","China, France eye Gambian port upgrade to rival Dakar","","Jul 07 2017","Chinese and French companies arebidding to help Gambia build up its Atlantic port Banjul to bewhat officials hope will rival  neighbouring Senegal's Dakar.","BANJUL, July 7 (Reuters) - Chinese and French companies are bidding to help Gambia build up its Atlantic port Banjul to be what officials hope will rival  neighbouring Senegal's Dakar. It would be one of the first major structural changes in the country following the end of President Yahya Jammeh's more than 20-year rule in January. State-owned China Communications Construction Company (CCCC) says one of its subsidiaries has made a bid for a 140 million euro ($159.91 million) contract Gambia has launched to redevelop the port. France's Bollore Group has also submitted an offer to develop the port for hundreds of millions of dollars, sources told Reuters, and was part of a recent delegation of French investors to the country. The port was run by a state agency during Jammeh's rule. It is considered to have strategic potential thanks to its easy access to Atlantic shipping lanes. Abdoulie Tambedou, managing director of the Gambia Ports Authority said there had already been several offers. The Chinese are interesting in investing in the infrastructure for an overall envelope of 140 million euros, he told Reuters in an interview. We hope to agree the financing in the next six months. An official at CCCC confirmed that one of its subsidiaries was bidding for the contract, without specifying which. In a sign of their interest, a witness saw a Chinese delegation visiting the port last week. Tambedou confirmed Bollore's offer, without giving the price, and said this included both infrastructure costs and the rental concession. Chinese interest in the project follows Gambia's endorsement in March 2016 of the one China policy, which states that Taiwan is part of a unified China. President Adama Barrow's new government reaffirmed that position in February. China is also a major market for Gambia's exports, which globally are mainly peanuts, wood, cashews, fish and fruit. Upgrading the port will take 30-36 months to complete, Tambedou said. Struggling Gambia is poor. It ranks 173 out of 189 countries on the U.N. Human Development Index, below Haiti. It is badly in need of key infrastructure development. There is not a single bridge across its eponymous 1,120 km (695 mile)-long river that wiggles up the length of the country, for example. People and goods have to be shipped across on ferries - or go around. Gambia is nonetheless seen as a key transit country for reaching remote areas of Guinea, Mali and Senegal that are easier to access from Banjul than from the countries' own ports and capitals. Space constraints at the port, however, currently mean that arriving cargo ships often have to wait at anchorage before entering. Since the departure of Jammeh, Tambedou said that trade was picking up, with shippers sending imports such as sugar in bigger volumes than before.

The deal is a bold bet by Buffett that he can win approval for the acquisition from Texas regulators, after they blocked two earlier attempts to sell Oncor, one of the largest U.S. power-transmission networks, to other companies. It also represents a return to a previously soured investment for Buffett, who in 2013 lost $873 million on a $2 billion bond investment in Oncor's bankrupt parent, Energy Future Holdings Corp. Berkshire Hathaway's deal, which could be announced by Friday, would value Oncor at slightly less than a previous $18.4 billion bid by Florida utility NextEra Energy Inc - which Texas regulators rejected - making it Buffett's third biggest acquisition ever, two people said. The Wall Street Journal, which reported on the acquisition earlier, said the deal could be valued at more than $17.5 billion. The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. A spokesman for the Public Utility Commission of Texas, which would have to approve the deal, declined to comment. Oncor did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Berkshire declined to comment. Any deal for Oncor, considered the most valuable among Energy Future's assets, would also have to be approved by the judge overseeing the bankruptcy. Energy Future has been stuck in bankruptcy since it filed for Chapter 11 protection in 2014 as plans to sell Oncor, repay creditors and fund its exit have collapsed under regulatory scrutiny. KKR & Co LP, TPG Capital LP and Goldman Sachs Group Inc's private equity arm took Energy Future private in 2007, in the biggest ever leveraged buyout with a total deal size of $44 billion. In the deal, the private equity firms also acquired Energy Future's retail and power generation businesses, the largest in Texas, which also then later filed for bankruptcy. Earlier this year, the Public Utility Commission of Texas rejected NextEra's deal for Oncor, deeming it not to be in the public interest. Another deal for Oncor led by privately held Hunt Consolidated Inc of Texas fell through in 2016 after regulators also put up roadblocks. Berkshire Hathaway had been among the leading bidders for Oncor. It is unclear what concessions Berkshire is prepared to make to meet the requirements of Texas regulators. Prized Asset Investors have prized regulated utilities such as Oncor for their steady cash flow. Adjusted operating cash flows rose 12.6 percent year-on-year in 2016, according to securities filings. Berkshire's energy division, Berkshire Hathaway Energy, owns several other utilities, natural gas pipelines and electricity transmission businesses, including the PacifiCorp and NV Energy utilities in the western United States. The energy unit contributed $2.29 billion in profit last year, while Berkshire overall made $24.07 billion. A deal for Oncor would also help Buffett utilize some of Berkshire's unused pile of cash, which totaled $96.5 billion at the end of March. The biggest creditor of Energy Future, activist investor Elliott Management Corp, filed a lawsuit against the company in May, asking it to pursue alternatives beyond the deal with NextEra. According to the lawsuit, Elliott wanted to lay the groundwork for a standalone plan of reorganization for Energy Future, allowing the utility to exit bankruptcy as an independent company, or find another buyer.

The Calgary-based energy company plans to buy Apache Canada Ltd, and fund the deal with cash on hand and no debt. The deal requires regulatory approvals and is expected to close in August. A sale of Apache Canada would mark the Houston-based company's exit from the country, the latest international oil firm to sell Canadian operations in favor of concentrating on U.S. shale plays.  Apache has said it planned to streamline and focus on its operations in the United States, North Sea and Egypt.  Apache said with the sale to Paramount and two earlier deals signed in June involving Canadian assets, total proceeds from the three sales would amount to about $713 million. It plans to use the funds finance a portion of Apache's 2017-18 capital expenditures, reduce debt and improve the liquidity of the company. The sales will enable Apache to reduce significant liabilities associated with asset retirement obligations in Canada. Separately, Paramount also said it entered into an agreement with petroleum and natural gas company Trilogy Energy Corp (TET.TO), in which the company would buy the remaining 85 percent of the common shares and non-voting shares of Trilogy.

The government rescinded the contract for the proposed 1,134-kilometer (705-mile) pipeline in January after the consortium led by Odebrecht missed a financing deadline amid a growing graft scandal. Proinversion director Alvaro Quijandria said the project's design might change following a feasibility study under way now based on the original plan. The next operator will have the option of buying the assets that the Odebrecht consortium had invested in the project, the value of which will be determined by an audit that has not yet started, said Quijandria. The Odebrecht consortium said the pipeline was about a third finished when work on it stopped in mid 2016. Peruvian builder Grana y Montero , Odebrecht's junior partner on the project, has said that the consortium invested about $2 billion in the project. Odebrecht once played a large role in building Peru's public work projects but the company has been barred from bidding on new contracts since acknowledging late last year that it distributed millions of dollars in bribes across Latin America. We think we can diversify the origin of investments a bit, Quijandria said on the sidelines of an auction for a project to dredge and maintain a navigable waterway in the Amazon. The $95 million waterway project was awarded to a consortium formed by a subsidiary of China's state-run Power Construction Corporation of China and Peruvian builder Construccion y Administracion SA.

The state-owned carrier notified American Airlines last month that it was interested in buying up to 10 percent of its shares but would not exceed 4.75 percent without the approval of American's board. We will be able to start buying shares in the open market soon, depending of course on what is the share value, al Baker told reporters in Dublin, where he was launching a new Qatar Airways route.  The share purchases will start as soon as Qatar receives regulatory approval, he said.  However, American said in a regulatory filing dated June 22 that company rules prohibit anyone from acquiring 4.75 percent or more of the company's shares in issue without prior board approval. Shares in American were up 0.5 percent at $51.53 at 1342 GMT on Thursday, valuing the company at over $25 billion. The move by Qatar Airways would expand its investments to North America at a time when Qatar is embroiled in the region's worst diplomatic crisis in years and is locked in an airspace rights row with three other Gulf states. Qatar has no intention of going above 10 percent, al Baker said.  Al-Baker said American's CEO Doug Parker told him at an airline conference in Mexico last month that he was against Qatar's planned investment and that he would not recommend that the board approve the purchase of a stake of over 4.75 percent. He categorically told us that he was not interested, that he would not suggest to his board to allow us. However, I told him we can still take 4.75 percent and we will do that, al Baker said.  Air travelers stand at an American Airlines check-in gate at LaGuardia Airport in New York, U.S., March 14, 2017.Shannon StapletonMaybe once we have taken that 4.75 and they see the value that Qatar Airways brings to the table for them that they will reconsider, he said. Anti-Gulf Stance He said he had no ambition to influence American's management or soften what he said was its anti-Gulf stance. Along with United Continental Holdings Inc (UAL.N) and Delta Air Lines (DAL.N), American has pressed the U.S. government to curb U.S. flights by Qatar Airways and rival Gulf carriers Emirates [EMIRA.UL] and Etihad Airways. The U.S. carriers charge that their Gulf rivals have received billions of dollars in unfair state subsidies, allegations the Gulf carriers deny. A stake in American Airlines would add to Qatar Airways' investment portfolio. The Middle East's second biggest airline also has a 20 percent stake in International Airlines Group (ICAG.L), the owner of British Airways, Iberia, Aer Lingus and Vueling, and a 10 percent stake in Chile's LATAM Airlines LAN.SN. Qatar Airways, American Airlines, British Airways, Iberia and LATAM are all members of the oneworld airline alliance. British Airways and Qatar Airways have a revenue-sharing partnership between their respective hubs in Doha and London, and Qatar Airways plans to launch flights to LATAM's base in Santiago, Chile. Al-Baker made repeated digs at American, saying it wanted to keep out the Gulf carriers from the U.S. market so it could swindle their customers. My dear friend Doug Parker, a big supporter of oneworld ... is now frightened of a oneworld carrier wanting to take a stake, he said. Editing by Greg Mahlich"

The Saudi government said it was cancelling all export duties on steel for two years to encourage local industries, and would halve cement export tariffs. Analysts said top-line growth of cement and steel companies was not expected to get a huge boost, but the news was positive for a building materials sector that has been hit hard by the government's austerity policies in the past couple of years. Despite some companies having obtained a licence to export six months ago, competition from other Asian markets is stiff and the demand outlook is relatively subdued, said a Riyadh-based cement sector analyst. Any rise in exports will still do little to reduce the supply glut in the local market. Najran Cement, one of the companies with an export licence, rose 2.6 percent in its heaviest volume since February and three other stocks among the top 10 gainers were also from the cement industry. Al Yamamah Steel Industries climnbed 1.7 percent. The Riyadh index, however, fell 0.9 percent, its third straight session of losses. The banking sector was the main drag with heavyweight National Commercial Bank dropping 0.6 percent to 50.50 riyals, pulling further away from a 22-month intra-day high hit of 58.00 riyals on Sunday. Elsewhere, Qatar's index edged down 0.1 percent as 21 shares rose and 12 declined. Foreign funds, which have been net buyers of Qatari shares this week, were neutral on Thursday while non-Qatari Gulf investors were net sellers, bourse data showed. Four Arab states decided in a meeting in Cairo on Wednesday not to slap fresh sanctions on Qatar for now, but voiced disappointment at its negative response to their demands and warned of the possibility of further action against Doha. The index is down 10.1 percent since June 5, when the diplomatic crisis erupted. Fund managers believe further sanctions, such as a pull-out of bank deposits, remain quite possible in coming days or weeks, but they may hurt the Qatari economy rather than cripple it. In Abu Dhabi, Dana Gas fell 1.4 percent after sources told Reuters that London's High Court planned to hold a full hearing in September on efforts by the company to restructure $700 million of its Islamic bonds. A High Court judge upheld an interim injunction there blocking holders of the sukuk, due to mature in October, from enforcing claims against Dana. But he also ordered Dana to cancel an injunction in a court in the emirate of Sharjah and seek a stay of its proceedings there. The Abu Dhabi index edged down 0.4 percent. In Dubai the index lost 0.5 percent in very low volumes, hit by a 1.4 percent drop in blue chip Emaar Properties and a 1.8 percent fall in peer DAMAC Properties . Cairo's stock index rose 0.3 percent in quiet trade as 16 blue chips advanced and 13 declined.

Elliott bought 237,800 shares of BEA at an average price of HK$32.569 each, increasing its stake in BEA to 8 percent, according to a July 4 filing to the Hong Kong stock exchange.  Elliott's stake was last publicly disclosed in December 2015, when it crossed the 7 percent mark. Under Hong Kong regulations investors only have to disclose stakes when they move through a whole percentage level. Elliott filed a lawsuit in Hong Kong in July last year against BEA, the majority of the bank's directors and its CEO and chairman over a share placement the lender made to Japan's Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp (SMBC). The lawsuit is the latest in a long-running and escalating dispute between the New York-based hedge fund and the tycoon-owned Hong Kong bank. As a long-term shareholder, we continue to believe that there is the potential for significant shareholder value to be unlocked at BEA, when there are fundamental and substantial improvements to corporate governance and the overall management of the bank, an Elliott spokesman said. BEA declined to comment on the increase in Elliott's stake. BEA has said previously it will vigorously oppose Elliott's lawsuit, saying it went against the interests of the bank and its shareholders. The dispute pits the $33 billion fund founded by billionaire Paul Singer against BEA's flashy chairman and former politician David Li, whose grandfather founded the bank nearly 100 years ago and whose family is among the city's best connected. The two sides met in the Court of First Instance of Hong Kong's High Court in April and are due to return on July 17.

Inbound merger and acquisition (M&A;) volumes total $4.6 billion in 2017, almost triple the $1.6 billion seen for the same period in 2016 and the highest for the same period since 2012, with Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) the top adviser across Russian M&A.;   Bankers say the increase is an indication that Western banks and companies are more willing to deal with Moscow, despite the sanctions imposed by the United States and the European Union over the annexation of Crimea. This, along with weak energy prices have hurt Russia's economy although a weakening of the rouble RUB= to above 60 a dollar in the last quarter, close to the level it was at the start of the year, has made Russian assets more attractive. There has been a pickup. I think it was largely on the back of (an) improved economic outlook, rather than (an) easing geopolitical environment. People have got used to the sanctions, Alexei Yakovitsky, global CEO at Russia's VTB Capital (VTBR.MM) said. VTB Capital is in third place in the adviser rankings, behind U.S. bank Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and Deutsche. Deals by overseas buyers in Russia make up more than half of all transactions done so far, with a slowdown in domestic M&A; pushing the total value down to $7.5 billion from $10.3 billion in 2016. Last year's figure was boosted by state gas company Gazprom (GAZP.MM) buying its own shares from state development bank VEB for $2.02 billion. [nL8N19L22M]     Deutsche Bank's leading position was thanks to its role in the biggest Russia M&A; deal so far this year, the proposed $1.85 billion purchase by Austria's OMV (OMVV.VI) of a 25 percent stake in oil and gas group Severneftegazprom from Uniper (UN01.DE). [nFWN1GG0U1]  Germany's largest bank heads the tables despite having faced recent problems in Russia.

Some had hoped Trump's election would be a step towards sanctions being lifted, but last month the U.S. government added 38 individuals and organizations to its list of those sanctioned over Russian activities in Ukraine.  It's reached a new normal. I don't necessarily expect there will be tremendous growth to pre-crisis levels, a senior banker at a major investment bank based in Moscow told Reuters. Austria leads the countries buying into Russia, with China in second position driven in part by a $887 million deal to sell a 10 percent stake in gold producer Polyus (PLZL.MM) to a Fosun International (0656.HK) led consortium. [nL8N1IX4LW] Polyus' (PLZL.MM) sale of $879 million worth of shares in Moscow and London became the biggest Russian equity markets transaction on the final day of the second quarter, with British investors snapping up around half of the shares.

Symantec is paying an undisclosed sum for the Tel Aviv-based company of about 40 employees. Fireglass specializes in an area of security called browser isolation, a technology that creates virtual websites allowing users to browse any content without having viruses touch their network. Browser isolation is an area that Symantec had been looking to enter for some time, Chief Executive Greg Clark said in an interview. He cited a Gartner report that projected that 50 percent of enterprises would adopt browser isolation by 2021. Healthcare companies, financial institutions, government and telecommunications firms have been early adopters of the technology, he said. While it's what I would call a 'tuck-in' acquisition, it will be very valuable to us as we bring it to our customers, Clark said. FILE PHOTO - The Symantec booth is seen during the 2016 Black Hat cyber-security conference in Las Vegas, Nevada, U.S. August 3, 2016.David Becker/File PhotoSymantec has been one of the most serial acquirers in security companies in recent years, gobbling up Lifelock Inc for $2.3 billion earlier this year and Blue Coat Inc for $4.65 billion in 2015. The deal will also increase the company's footprint in Israel, a hotbed for cybersecurity, where Clark said Symantec has been looking to expand. Israel, which has more than 400 cybersecurity startups, attracts about 20 percent of private global cyber investment, Reuters has reported. Large U.S. technology companies often go shopping in Israel when they are looking for acquisitions and engineering talent. Last month, Microsoft (MSFT.O) agreed to acquire Hexadite, a U.S.-Israeli provider of technology to automate responses to cyber attacks for an undisclosed sum. The deal is expected to close in the third quarter of the calendar year. Fireglass, founded in 2014 by a former Check Point Software Technologies (CHKP.O) executive, was backed by investors such as Lightspeed Venture Partners and Norwest Venture Partners. It had raised $20 million in early 2016 and competes with Menlo Security. (This version of the story corrects Symantec's CEO surname from Brown to Clark throughout) Reporting by Liana B.

The deal is the largest ever for the photocopier maker, which has been seeking to diversify away its office equipment business. It pulled out of cameras about a decade ago. Konica Minolta said its advanced imaging technology complemented privately held Ambry's genetic testing capabilities, with initial applications for combining the technologies seen in diagnosing hereditary cancer.

Yet since Modi arrived on Tuesday, military ties -- for decades the secretive bedrock of India-Israel relations -- have taken a back seat. The governments have instead spent time discussing companies that sell medical devices, hi-tech and water systems. Rather than making the visit, the first by a sitting Indian prime minister, all about the value of deals signed, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Modi appear intent on playing up shared culture and values, in the hope this will give commercial ties deeper roots. Under Arab pressure, India kept its distance from Israel for  decades but is now seeing advantages in a complementary relationship with Israel. There is interest on both sides in building a broad economic base, rather than merely a contractual exchange based around defense. The timing reflects a diplomatic shift toward Israel being more accepted in the region. Modi, who is acutely conscious of the need to adopt innovation and new technology to update India's infrastructure has always had a personal affinity for Israel and came to learn more about the country before he became premier. India and Israel are walking hand in hand into the future as partners, Modi and Netanyahu wrote in a joint editorial this week. From start-ups to space, communications to cybernetics, Israel's technological capabilities are merging with India's. The two men are spending 48 hours together with Modi, accompanied by Indian business leaders, getting a political and business tour that covers Israeli history, culture and innovation, as well as the signing of economic agreements. Hopes for More Deals What's it going to take to get Israeli money to take India seriously? Just open their eyes, Jon Medved, CEO of Israeli equity crowdfunding group OurCrowd said. The problem is their eyes are ... blinded by the China opportunity, he added. There have only been a handful of Indian investments in Israel over the past decade, as opposed to the $16.5 billion received from China in 2016 alone. OurCrowd just closed three deals with India, joining with Reliance Industries (RELI.NS) for a hi-tech incubator that helps to grow young companies in Jerusalem, bringing Israeli technology to India with Reliance Capital (RLCP.NS), and collaborating with India's Lets Venture to invest in start-ups. During Modi's visit, Zebra Medical Vision, a company from a kibbutz near Tel Aviv, and Bangalore-based Teleradiology Solutions will sign a partnership to use analytics in 150 health-care centers. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi hugs with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as they deliver joint statements during an exchange of co-operation agreements ceremony in Jerusalem July 5, 2017.Amir CohenLooking to reorient Israel's economy toward Asia, Netanyahu hopes more deals will follow, setting a goal of increasing exports to India by 25 percent in the next four years. But it may take a while before the Modi-Netanyahu relationship sparks a serious expansion in investment and trade, both of which remain relatively negligible. In many respects export-dependent Israel and India, which is focused on supplying its huge population, are complementary. Israel is a global leader in water and food systems, two critical fields India needs to upgrade. India wants to strengthen its manufacturing base and is looking to do so with technologies coming from Israel. Both countries host major diamond trading and polishing hubs. Diamond Trade Sparkles Slideshow (9 Images)Israeli exports to India last year totaled $1.15 billion, excluding diamonds, just 2.5 percent of total exports. Bilateral trade was less than $2 billion, which jumped to $4.13 billion including diamonds. Israel's foreign direct investment in India totals only $100 million. It's nothing, it's a blip. Why hasn't the relationship grown to the level it should have? said A. Didar Singh, secretary general of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce. Singh said more needed to be done to ease regulations, lower non-tariff barriers and solve licensing problems. Incentives and lifting of red tape could help overcome what diplomats, lobbyists and business owners say is a cultural divide between the breakneck pace of Israel's start-up scene and India's more gradual approach. It can take time to cement negotiations in India, where building trust and a relationship is paramount, said Elias Ghosalkar, a former investment banker from Mumbai who is director of corporate development for OurCrowd after moving to Israel last year.  Israelis on the other hand are quite direct and lack patience in their business approach, he told Reuters. Israel's ambassador to India, Daniel Carmon, said it is becoming easier to do business between the two countries, even if there may remain some differences in practice. It could be that the Israeli businessman arrives on a Monday flight and wants to return on Thursday with a deal in hand. I say to him 'forget it'. It's not going to happen. There are processes, the processes take time, not four days, he said. Editing by Luke Baker and Peter Millership"

U.S. District Judge Paul Oetken in Manhattan dismissed McAfee's September 2016 lawsuit and a countersuit by Intel on Wednesday, five days after a settlement agreement was signed. McAfee said he sued after Intel warned him that using his name, including by renaming his digital gaming and cybersecurity company MGT Capital Investments Inc (MGTI.PK) as John McAfee Global Technologies Inc, would infringe its trademarks. Intel countered by accusing McAfee of trademark infringement and unfair competition, and sought unspecified damages. Under the settlement, McAfee agreed not to use his name, trademark his name or the phrase John McAfee Privacy Phone, or use John McAfee Global Technologies in connection with cybersecurity- and security-related products and services. He retained the right in other contexts to use his name in advertising, promotions and presentations, including with regard to his role at McAfee Associates, which he sold to Intel for $7.7 billion in 2010. Neither McAfee nor Intel admitted wrongdoing in agreeing to the settlement, which was amicable, according to court papers. McAfee's lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A spokesman for Intel said the Santa Clara, California-based company was pleased to settle. Intel spun off its cybersecurity division, now called McAfee LLC, in April, after agreeing to sell a 51 percent stake to private investment firm TPG Capital. TPG later accepted a minority investment in the business from private equity firm Thoma Bravo. Intel retained a 49 percent stake in McAfee, which the spinoff valued at $4.2 billion including debt.

The two companies facilitate payments by linking stores to customers' bank and credit-card accounts.  It's a pretty sticky product, said Thad Peterson, an analyst at Aite Group. Once merchants find a processor that works for them, they are unlikely to change. Merchants aren't in the business of payments, they are in the business of selling stuff.  Vantiv started as a project inside of Cincinnati-based regional lender Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB.O) during the Nixon era. Worldpay, headquartered in London, was launched by a British lender in 1989 and absorbed into Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L).  Both companies were spun out of their banks after the financial crisis and thrived on their own continents. Now they are poised to become the singular middleman for more sales globally than any other wholly-owned merchant payments processor based on the $1.3 trillion worth of transactions they handled in 2016, according to data from The Nilson Report.  The next largest, JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), had looked at Worldpay but ultimately did not put in a bid, a spokesman said. Buying Worldpay would have helped JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, expand outside of its home country where it has been getting about four-fifths of its merchant business.     Infographic ID: '2sN7LvJ'     The Vantiv-Worldpay deal comes at a time when more purchases are being made online, and the payments industry - long considered a backwater of banking - is facing fresh competition.  PayPal Holdings Inc's (PYPL.O) Braintree, Amsterdam-based Adyen and San Francisco-based Stripe Inc are among the newcomers trying to disrupt the way merchants get paid. They have managed to secure deals with high-profile technology companies including video-on-demand platform Netflix Inc (NFLX.O), ride-hailing app Uber and streaming music service Spotify.  Despite the buzz surrounding these companies, they represent a small slice of the market.  In the United States, for example, the top 10 processors account for about 90 percent of transactions, according to estimates from Mizuho Securities. They are mostly big banks or companies like First Data Corp (FDC.N), which also grew out of the banking industry.  Even with that much concentration, big players want to get bigger to gain economies of scale, said one investment banker to the industry who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The banker predicted more traditional companies will combine, while newcomers remain independent because their stocks are much more highly valued.  Once processors have the scale of big banks, the real competitive advantage comes from allowing merchants to sell products through any channel to customers anywhere in the world, analysts and executives said.  Future mergers could be driven by a need to access new geographies or improve digital offerings, similar to the rationale behind Vantiv buying Worldpay, the banker said.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/eqt-corp-janapartners-idUSL3N1JW4AZ","UPDATE 3-Jana says EQT can save $4.5 bln by scrapping Rice Energy deal","","Jul 05 2017","* Fund sees current Rice deal costing $1 bln EQT shareholdervalue","(Reuters) - Jana Partners LLC stepped up its criticism on Wednesday of U.S. natural gas producer EQT Corp's (EQT.N) deal to buy Rice Energy Inc (RICE.N), arguing that EQT could save as much as $4.5 billion if it separated its pipeline assets instead. Jana founder and managing partner Barry Rosenstein wrote in a letter to EQT's board of directors that the company was overpaying for Rice Energy and that the activist hedge fund's proposal would deliver more value. Jana disclosed a 5.8 percent stake in EQT on Monday, saying that it believed EQT shares were undervalued and it would vote against the Rice Energy deal.  EQT announced on June 19 that it would buy Rice for $6.7 billion in cash and stock, which would create the largest U.S. natural gas producer at a time when American energy firms are pumping in money to develop facilities in gas-rich states like Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio. A Rice acquisition would result in EQT paying away more than the value of the transaction synergies, the majority of which are questionable, Rosenstein said in the letter, which was disclosed in a securities filing. The Rice deal would give away $1 billion in EQT shareholder value, according to the hedge fund, which also questions the assumed $2.5 billion of cost synergies in the Rice Energy deal that EQT envisions can be achieved. When asked about the Jana letter, EQT said it stands by its Monday statement that the company seeks to maintain an open dialogue with investors and respects their opinions. Rice declined to comment.  EQT has also said that there is a sum-of-the-parts discount associated with the company's valuation, which could be addressed by separating its pipeline operations. EQT said it has committed to evaluating options and devising a plan to address this discount by the end of 2018. Under the Rice Energy deal, EQT's pipeline arm, EQT Midstream Partners LP (EQM.N), would ultimately assume Rice Energy's pipelines. Analysts at Mizuho Securities estimate these Rice Energy pipeline assets to be worth around $1.3 billion. Among Jana's concerns is that extracting the maximum amount of value from the Rice combination would take too long.  If EQT were to consummate this (Rice Energy) transaction, the company would potentially be required to put off a separation for two years to avoid 'built-in' tax gains for certain Rice assets that would be part of a spinoff, Rosenstein wrote in the letter. U.S. tax rules penalize companies that acquire assets and then spin them within a two-year window.

Braskem, whose stock market quotes are being given separately as a result of the delay, has until June 22 to formally present a defense. The case will be ruled on this week and could result in the suspension of the company, the bourse said. If the problem persists, at the end of the process Braskem may be compulsorily delisted from Level 1 trading, the bourse said. Level 1 trading requires companies to maintain a free-float of at least 25 percent of capital. The deadline to cure delays in the submission of financial statements is 30 days, B3 said. Braskem did not immediately reply to an email seeking comment on a report on Wednesday in the newspaper Valor Economico, which said a ruling on the suspension would be made this week. The newspaper said that until now Braskem had only submitted unaudited statements for the first quarter, the fourth quarter of 2016 and the full 2016 result. According to Valor, Braskem said the delay was due to a pending analysis by independent auditors related to internal controls and procedures after the company signed plea deals with federal prosecutors in Brazil, the United States and Switzerland in connection with a massive graft scheme known as Operation Car Wash. Brazil-based construction firm Odebrecht SA and Braskem agreed to pay at least $3.5 billion in the leniency deal it signed to resolve some international charges involving payoffs to former executives at Brazil's state-controlled Petroleo Brasileiro SA, politicians and others. Braskem is jointly owned by Odebrecht and Petroleo Brasileiro. The decision to suspend the company from Level 1 trading could come as early as this week, Valor reported. Braskem's shares rose 1.48 percent in midmorning trading at the São Paulo Stock Exchange to 34.86 reais. (Reporting by Ana Mano; Editing by Jonathan Oatis)"

A deadline for Qatar to comply with a list of demands made by the states expired overnight. Doha has submitted replies to mediator Kuwait that have not been disclosed. Doha has shown no sign of acquiescing to major demands, which raises the possibility of the four states imposing more sanctions. But it is not clear that any fresh steps - such as the withdrawal of deposits from Qatar's banking system - would be crippling, given Doha's large financial resources. Qatar's index added 0.4 percent as 10 traded shares rose, including ones favoured by foreign funds such as Islamic lender Masraf Al Rayan, which added 1.0 percent. Foreign funds were net buyers of Qatari stocks by a very narrow margin, bourse data showed; local funds were also net buyers, while Gulf funds were sellers. Twenty-seven stocks declined. Saudi Arabia's index fell a further 0.5 percent, taking its losses over the last two sessions to 3.0 percent. Second-quarter earnings announcements are due to start around mid-July, and Alrajhi Capital predicted in a note that consumer-related sectors would do well because of the reinstatement of civil servants' allowances and the month of Ramadan, which traditionally sees strong consumer spending. Mobile phone and computer retailer United Electronics added 3.0 percent. Earnings momentum for the broader market, however, is expected to be weak, according to a note by EFG Hermes. Upside is limited for most of our coverage, it said, adding that it preferred banks over petrochemicals, and secular growth stories such as the insurance and supermarket industries. In Dubai, builder Arabtec fell 1.2 percent on profit-taking to 3.19 dirhams. Earlier in the day it hit a high of 3.37 dirhams after announcing its subsidiary Target Engineering had been awarded four projects worth 289 million dirhams ($79 million). Fifteen other shares fell and 11 advanced as the Dubai index closed near flat. The banking sector helped take Abu Dhabi's index 0.5 percent higher with bellwether First Abu Dhabi Bank adding 1.0 percent. In Cairo the blue-chip index closed near flat. The most heavily traded stock of the day was private equity firm Qalaa Holding, which jumped 6.9 percent. Earlier this week its mining subsidiary ASEC Co for Mining reported that first-quarter net profit jumped to 232.4 million Egyptian pounds ($13.0 million) from a year-earlier loss 8.9 million pounds.

While stricter legal scrutiny related to the corruption scandal helped slow second-quarter M&A;, bankers said funds and multinational firms were still seeking Brazilian assets. Despite economic and political headwinds, merger activity could be reignited by falling borrowing costs and an increasingly stable currency.  Pressure from creditors could also speed up asset sales by companies restructuring almost 180 billion reais ($56 billion) of debt, bankers said.  M&A; is relatively resilient to the macroeconomic and  political environment as strategic players seek opportunities with long-term potential, said Patricia Moraes, head of Brazil banking for JPMorgan Chase & Co, which topped Thomson Reuters local advisory rankings last quarter. Uncertainty surrounding the timeframe for an economic recovery from Brazil's worst recession on record, as well as concerns about the stability of President Michel Temer's administration, have deterred some buyers and sellers from committing to deals. Companies announced $7.052 billion worth of Brazil-related mergers last quarter, down 76 percent from the prior quarter, the rankings showed. A year earlier, when tougher due diligence procedures were implemented, announced M&A; deals totaled $6.861 billion. Last quarter, the number of announced deals fell to 132 from 141 in the prior three months and 135 a year earlier. Brazilian markets tanked in mid-May after members of the billionaire Batista family accused Temer of seeking to obstruct the massive corruption probe known as Operation Car Wash. The market turmoil compounded the impact of Brazil's recession, keeping buyers and sellers at odds over valuations. Temer has called a corruption charge filed against him by Brazil's top prosecutor a fiction as he faces possible removal from office.     Fallout from Operation Car Wash has led to increased due diligence concerning companies ensnared in the scandal, such as building group Odebrecht SA. Usual timeframes for such proceedings have doubled over the past year, to up to six months. Deals are going though an adjustment, said Alessandro Farkuh, head of M&A; for Banco Bradesco BBI SA. There's a lot of work but, because of the country's situation, M&A; negotiations are taking place in an unusual way.  Consolidation More assets are on the block as companies seek to cut debt or improve their capital and tax structures, said Eduardo Miras, co-head of Brazil investment banking at Morgan Stanley & Co, Brazil's No. 1 M&A; bank this year.  Some companies are being forced to sell, Miras said. Opportunistic buyers and strategic players with a long-term view find themselves with a flurry of good Brazilian assets. Car Wash-related M&A; deals include J&F; Investimentos SA's planned sale of a dairy producer and the maker of the popular Havaianas flip flops, Alpargatas. Members of the Batista family, which controls J&F;, admitted to bribing 1,893 politicians.  Roderick Greenlees, global head of investment banking at Itaú BBA SA, said he expected deals to pick up in the third and fourth quarters amid growing interest from multinational firms and buyout funds, which are more likely to meet buyers' prices for attractive companies. Some premium assets are being sold because of the current situation, which in general keeps us excited about the dealflow ahead, Greenlees said. JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley topped value rankings for the second quarter and the first half, respectively. JPMorgan worked on Itaú's $2 billion purchase of a minority stake in brokerage XP Investimentos SA. Itaú BBA led the rankings for the number of deals after working on seven transactions last quarter and 18 this year. In the first six months, the total of 273 Brazilian M&A-related; transactions was worth $36.177 billion, more than three times the amount recorded in the same period of last year, the data showed.   For years, investment banks have derived nearly half of their annual Brazil revenues from M&A; advisory. As dealmaking suffers, banks have turned to structured lending, transactional banking or, in some cases, securities trading. Following is a table with Brazil M&A; ranking for the second quarter and the first six months. Numbers are expressed in U.S. dollars, unless specified. Editing by Phil Berlowitz"

The proportion of stocks on the main U.S. benchmark equity index now managed passively has nearly doubled since the 2008 crisis to 37 percent while ETF trading accounts for about a quarter of the daily volume across U.S. exchanges, BofA-ML, said. ETFs and index-tracking funds offer investors a cheaper way to access financial markets than their active fund management peers which aim to beat the benchmark and charge higher fees for doing so. Steadily rising U.S. equity markets, currently in the ninth year of a bull market, and the proliferation of ETFs that mimic complex quantitative strategies and investment trends and themes at a lower cost, have sparked a rush of inflows into such products as more investors shift to passive investments. BofA-ML clients have bought a net $160 billion worth of ETFs since 2009 while selling $200 billion worth of single stocks since, the broker said. The growing influence of ETFs is likely to alter some long-standing fundamentals across financial markets, analysts and investors have said, with the main issues for stock investors revolving around positioning, liquidity and valuation.  The actual shares available for investors to trade, or the true float, may be grossly overestimated, if the shares held by passive funds, which do not trade in and out of stocks based on fundamentals or events, are excluded. Vanguard, one of the world's largest asset managers and which manages a roughly $70 billion S&P; 500 ETF (VOO.P), now owns 6.8 percent of the top U.S. equity benchmark. The firm owns stakes of more than 10 percent in over 80 stocks in the S&P; 500, BofA-ML estimated. Large cap US equity managers have had the luxury — and curse — of a liquid, efficient market, said analysts at BofA-ML. That liquidity is slowly being called into question by the 'ETF-ization' of the S&P; 500. The broker cited Japan, where nearly 70 percent of assets under management at Japan-focused stock funds are now passive, partly due to the Bank of Japan's ETF-buying as part of its quantitative easing programme. The victim in Japan has been active equity managers, the broker said. For investors looking to sidestep any potential pitfalls, BofA-ML, recommends avoiding stocks with very high passive ownership which tend to be more volatile than broader markets and can also see valuations get detached from fundamentals.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/pepper-group-ma-kkr-idUSL3N1JW03I","UPDATE 2-KKR bids $500 mln for Australian mortgage lender Pepper","","Jul 05 2017","* Deal comes amid early signs of property market slowdown(Recasts; adds industry context, fund manager quote, shares)","SYDNEY (Reuters) - U.S. private equity giant KKR & Co LP moved to bolster its presence in Australia's lucrative mortgage market on Wednesday, joining a rush of players hungry for a slice of a property boom even as the sector shows early signs of slowing. KKR Credit Advisors LLC made a $500 million bid for non-bank lender Pepper Group Ltd at an indicative price of A$3.60 per share, a 4 percent discount to Tuesday's close. Pepper shares sank 7.2 percent to A$3.48 on Wednesday. Australia's A$1.7 trillion ($1.30 trillion) mortgage market is highly profitable with very low delinquencies and lucrative commissions. Last week, publisher Fairfax Media Ltd followed rival News Corp with plans to enter the mortgage broking business which generates A$2 billion ($1.53 billion) a year in commission. The bubbling interest comes as regulators grow increasingly worried about debt levels and the capacity of ordinary households to pay back big loans on expensive houses. Property price rises, particularly in Sydney and Melbourne, are also showing early signs of easing as authorities tightened restrictions on speculative investor lending. As banks back off risky lending, Pepper's Australian loan book jumped 36 percent in 2016, far outpacing the banking sector's 6.5 percent credit growth. Experts question whether this growth is sustainable.  Credit growth is falling as we speak and the housing market is running out of steam, said Hamish Chalmers, who helps manage A$1 billion at Watermark Funds Management. It seems realistic to think it probably peaked some time in the first or second quarter of this year. KKR's bid comes more than two years after it bought General Electric Co's Australia and New Zealand consumer lending arm for an equity value of A$1.2 billion. Since renamed Latitude Financial Services, the company offers a similar suite of low-document home lending and credit cards to Pepper. Industry players said the two firms together will boost KKR's portfolio and create a stronger brand, making it easier for the private equity giant to then offload them at a higher value. A KKR spokesman in Australia declined to comment. Pepper trades at a relatively low multiple to the major banks, with a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 9 compared with 14.6 for top mortgage lender, Commonwealth Bank of Australia. Pepper said in a statement to the Australian Securities Exchange that it had granted KKR exclusive rights to conduct due diligence, and that negotiations were incomplete. While Pepper is seen exposed to a housing correction and its delinquency rates are already well above the major lenders at 1.6 percent, Australians are seen as good creditors who will cut back elsewhere to meet their mortgage payments. If you were to look at the possibility of increased defaults, you'd have to see something to precipitate that, something that we're not seeing on the horizon: For example a sharp rise in the unemployment rate, said Jo Horton, a senior economist at St George Bank.

Automakers, tech shares and banking stocks were among Wednesday's winners as the dollar was back above the 113.00 yen level in the afternoon, lifting overall sentiment. Toyota Motor Corp rose 1.6 percent, Nissan Motor Co gained 1.7 percent and Hitachi Ltd advanced 1.3 percent. Mizuho Financial Group rose 1.3 percent and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group added 1.2 percent. Investors were picking up cyclical stocks, particularly automakers as they have laggard behind the rises of the overall market, said Yoshihiro Okumura, general manager at Chibagin Asset Management.

But gains were limited, with U.S. market closed for the Independence Day holiday on July 4 while investors remaining cautious over geopolitical tension in the Korean Peninsula. U.S. Secretary of State (Rex) Tillerson mentioning North Korea's intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) early this morning has caused the market to remain cautious, said Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist t Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management. At the same time, the domestic market is retaining a fair degree of calm regarding the situation, while waiting to see how the United States responds to North Korea's actions. Tillerson called for global action after North Korea tested a newly developed ICBM, calling it a new escalation of Pyongyang's nuclear threat. However, on Wednesday, investors wasted no time in taking profits from defence industry-related firms, which surged the previous day in response to Pyongyang's ICBM launch. Ishikawa Seisakusho Ltd, a maker of defence equipment including landmines, fell 3.9 percent after rallying roughly 20 percent the previous day. Defence system equipment maker Nippon Avionics Co shed 2.5 percent following the previous day's rise of 5.6 percent. The broader Topix rose 0.6 percent to 1,618.63. (Editing by Sam Holmes)"

After its own $2.4 billion acquisition spree since 2014, Vocus issued a profit warning in May, sending its shares tumbling. KKR's indicative offer soon after, of A$3.50 ($2.66) per share, was two-thirds below its price a year earlier, prompting investors to reject it as opportunistic. On Wednesday, however, Vocus Chairman David Spence said the company would let KKR conduct due diligence to explore whether a potential whole of company proposal is available that takes into account the benefits that the plan delivers. The company already has its own plan in place to deliver value for shareholders both in the short and medium term, Spence added in a statement. Vocus shares rose 2.4 percent to A$3.39, still below KKR's indicative price, as investors put the chances of a buyout as slightly higher but not a certainty. The broader market was down 0.4 percent. It's worth at least having private equity look at them and see what their assessment is and hopefully realize a slightly higher price, said a fund manager with Vocus shares, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation. Granting due diligence showed that the company was recognizing that there is difficulty in getting these obviously difficult, culturally-misaligned businesses together. While Telstra Corp Ltd dominates Australia's telecommunications and internet markets, smaller rivals such as Vocus are jostling for exposure to a government-led A$40 billion ($30.44 billion) broadband network that is being built around the country. Though Vocus runs some retail internet brands, such as iPrimus, it has been expanding its physical assets, including the $650 million takeover of a firm building a 4,600 km (2,900 mile) undersea fiber cable between Singapore and the city of Perth.

Vocus had received an indicative, non-binding proposal from KKR for A$3.50 per share in cash on June 7. The stock has taken a hit since May after the firm slashed annual profit guidance.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/europe-stocks-idUSL8N1JV4AB","Worldpay, M&A; in focus as European shares consolidate; Italy banks up","","Jul 04 2017","* Italy banks rally as EU clears Monte Paschi plan(Adds details, closing prices)","LONDON (Reuters) - A spate of dealmaking news swept European stocks on Tuesday, with Worldpay (WPG.L) soaring after bid approaches, helping mitigate a broad based pull back from the previous session's strong gains.     The pan-European STOXX 600  fell 0.3 percent, in line with a dip in euro zone stocks .STOXXE and Britain's FTSE .FTSE index. On Monday, European shares had their strongest day since April 24, when Emmanuel Macron won the first round of France's presidential election.  The closure of the U.S. market for the July 4 national holiday also meant volumes were lower than usual. Today is a consolidation day after gains yesterday, as we don't have a U.S. market, said Angelo Meda, head of equities at Banor Capital. But dealmaking was back with a vengeance as a key driver of individual share moves. Payments company Worldpay shares soared 27.7 percent to a record high after it received rival takeover approaches from credit card tech firm Vantiv (VNTV.N) and JPMorgan (JPM.N).  This came after Danish rival Nets (NETS.CO) said on Monday it had received offers. Nets and another German rival Wirecard (WDIG.DE) rose more than 4 percent. This is one of the most intriguing sub-sectors in the financials space. There are a lot of companies still, and we are probably going to have only one or two big leaders in the payments space, said Meda. EDP (EDP.LS) was a top gainer, up 1.6 percent after Spain's Gas Natural (GAS.MC) was re[ported to have approached the Portuguese utility for a $40 billion merger which would create Europe's fourth biggest utility by market capitalization.     Gas Natural shares fell 0.6 percent. EDP denied negotiations were taking place.  Shares in French rival EDF (EDF.PA) also dropped 4 percent after HSBC downgraded the stock to reduce.  Clariant (CLN.S) shares gained 3 percent after two activist investors upped their stake in the Swiss chemicals firm in opposition to a planned merger with U.S. firm Huntsman (HUN.N). Baader Helvea analysts said the move could make a counterbid more likely. And the prospect of suitors Bain and Cinven getting regulatory approval for a renewed offer for Stada (STAGn.DE) sent the generic drugmaker's shares up 2.2 percent. Italian stocks outperformed as banks .FTIT8300 rallied more than 1 percent to a 15-month high after the country's ninth-biggest lender Carige (CRGI.MI) approved a 500 million euros cash call to beef up its balance sheet. This was the last piece of the puzzle which we needed to fix, in order to have a recovery in credit and profitability in banks... It's not yet in the prices, because the market still wants to see non-performing loans problems being solved, said Meda.	 A further boost to the sector came from news that the European Commission gave its blessing to a state bailout of  Monte dei Paschi di Siena (BMPS.MI), paving the way for a deep restructure of the troubled lender.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/stada-arzneimitt-ma-idUSL8N1JV0MM","UPDATE 3-Stada executives quit as Bain, Cinven prepare new bid","","Jul 04 2017","* Shares rise 2.3 percent to top of MDAX(Adds sources, background, link to Breakingviews)","FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Stada's (STAGn.DE) chief executive and its head of finance resigned on Tuesday ahead of an imminent new takeover bid for the German generic drugmaker by buyout groups Bain Capital and Cinven. Chief Executive Matthias Wiedenfels, who was appointed just over a year ago, will be replaced by Engelbert Tjeenk Willink, a former board member of privately held German drugmaker Boehringer Ingelheim, Stada said in a statement. Bernhard Duettmann, previously finance chief at Nivea owner Beiersdorf (BEIG.DE) and then chemicals group Lanxess (LXSG.DE), will succeed Stada's Chief Financial Officer Helmut Kraft. Willink and Duettmann have been appointed until the end of 2017, Stada said. The move came only hours after Stada said that private equity firms Bain and Cinven were considering seeking regulatory clearance to make a new takeover offer for the group after their 5.3 billion euro ($6 billion) bid fell through, driving Stada's shares higher. Investors representing 65.52 percent of Stada's equity had signed up for their last bid, missing a 67.5 percent threshold, despite the 49 percent premium offered by the buyout groups to trump a rival offer from private equity duo Advent and Permira. A renewed approach would need to be approved by both German financial watchdog Bafin and Stada itself because a suitor is normally not allowed to make another offer for at least a year. Should further takeover offers be made, we will examine and evaluate them impartially, Stada supervisory board Chairman Ferdinand Oetker said. Sources told Reuters last week that a new bid could be launched as early as this week. The private equity firms are expected to bid at the same price but lower the acceptance threshold to 65 percent, the sources said at the time. Support Several people close to the matter had said Bain and Cinven were talking to investors to drum up support for a potential new offer. The bidders wanted to secure irrevocable commitments to tender from shareholders representing more than 15 percent of Stada's voting rights.  Some shareholders - mainly hedge funds, who currently own more than 30 percent of the stock - held back some of their shares, speculating on securing a higher price for any remaining stock after a successful initial tender offer. Others meanwhile have signed commitments to try and secure the renewed offer's success as it promises a more certain deal than a potential third-party bid from funds such as Advent and Permira or Shanghai Pharma, which had shown interest in Stada. Kepler Cheuvreux analyst Oliver Reinberg raised his recommendation on Stada shares to hold from reduce on Tuesday, saying he assumed a new bid by Bain and Cinven would reach its mark. Given the low margin of failure in the first bidding process - note they only fell 2 percent short of the outstanding shares tendered - we assume that the deal will ultimately succeed, he said in a note. Shares in Stada rose 2.1 percent to 63.87 euros by 1530 GMT on Tuesday, making them the biggest gainers on Germany's MDAX index of mid-sized companies .MDAXI. Stada said that Wiedenfels and Kraft had told its supervisory board they were stepping down for personal reasons. People close to the matter said, however, that relations between the executives and the supervisory board had become increasingly strained due to their handling of the takeover process. It was clear from the beginning that Wiedenfels would be replaced. But the timing of the move was not ideal as it creates insecurity around the deal, one of the sources said.

In late June, before a one-week Eid-al Fitr holiday, the Saudi market surged after index compiler MSCI said it would consider upgrading Riyadh to emerging market status and economic reformer Prince Mohammed bin Salman was promoted to the post of crown prince. But many fund managers consider Riyadh close to fully valued, leaving it open to profit-taking. On Tuesday, the index fell 2.6 percent, its biggest drop since last October, in thin trading volume. Selling accelerated towards the close. A purchasing managers' survey released on Tuesday showed Saudi business conditions remained tough, with growth of the non-oil private sector slowing to an eight-month low in June. Banking stocks, which were among the top gainers in late June, were the biggest losers on Tuesday. National Commercial Bank, the largest lender, plunged 7.9 percent. Miner Ma'aden slipped 4.9 percent. Falling stocks outnumbered gainers by more than two to one. Wafa Insurance rose 2.6 percent after the central bank said it would let the company accept new subscribers in vehicle insurance, lifting a suspension on this activity. Qatar's stock market rose in early trade but the index closed 0.5 percent lower in moderate volume. Foreign investors, who had been net buyers of stocks for the last several days, were roughly neutral, exchange data showed. A deadline set by the four Arab states imposing sanctions on Qatar was to expire late on Tuesday, and there was no clear sign that Doha was willing to acquiesce in enough of their demands to avoid further economic sanctions. However, some fund managers do not think the additional sanctions would be crippling for Qatar's economy, while they believe there is value in the market after its 10 percent plunge in the past month. Qatar National Bank, the biggest bank, sank 3.1 percent on Tuesday. But companies linked to Qatari gas production were strong as the chief executive of Qatar Petroleum outlined plans to raise output and capacity in coming years. Gulf International Services, the most heavily traded stock, surged 4.0 percent and Qatar Gas Transport (Nakilat) soared its 10 percent daily limit. Dubai's index fell 0.3 percent as blue chip Emaar Properties slid 1.3 percent. GFH Financial, the most heavily traded stock, rose sharply in early trade after saying it had obtained approval from the central bank of Bahrain to buy back up to 5 percent of its issued treasury shares. But it closed 0.9 percent lower; the stock had already surged 6.3 percent on Monday. Builder Arabtec soared 10.6 percent after saying it had won a 353 million dirham ($96 million) contract to build the United Arab Emirates pavilion at the Expo 2020 world's fair in Dubai - a vote of confidence in the company by authorities in Abu Dhabi.

Under the previous framework, global ratings agencies could only have minority stakes in joint-venture operations in the country and could not issue ratings on local bonds. Foreign credit rating agencies must now be registered under the PBOC, have a certain level of experience, have sound corporate governance and be generally accepted by qualified institutional investors, according to the notice, which was published on the central bank's website on Monday evening. To qualify, the foreign credit ratings agency must not have been involved in any  major illegal acts in the past three years and not be subject to any investigations for illegal activity, the notice added. We are strongly committed to playing a part in the development of China's domestic bond market, Standard & Poor's said in an emailed statement.

The pan-European STOXX 600 fell 0.4 percent by 0720 GMT, in line with a dip in Euro zone stocks and blue-chips. Britain's FTSE was 0.5 percent lower. European shares had their strongest day since the first round of the French presidential election on Monday, buoyed by a rally in crude prices and strong banking stocks. But basic resources and banks were among the worst performers on Tuesday, while oil and gas stocks fell 0.3 percent. Dealmaking returned with a vengeance as a key driver of individual share moves. EDP was a top gainer, up 3.8 percent after Spain's Gas Natural approached the Portuguese utility for a $40 billion merger which would create Europe's fourth biggest utility by market capitalisation and could spur further consolidation in the utility sector. Gas Natural shares, meanwhile, fell 0.6 percent at the open. Shares in French rival EDF also dropped 2.5 percent. Clariant shares gained 3.9 percent after two activist investors upped their stake in the Swiss chemicals firm in order to ramp up pressure on shareholders to oppose a planned merger with U.S. firm Huntsman. Baader Helvea analysts said the move could make a counterbid more likely. And the prospect of suitors Bain and Cinven getting regulatory approval for a renewed offer for Stada sent the generic drugmaker's shares up 3 percent. Elsewhere, Worldpay jumped 7.1 percent. Its rival Nets confirmed on Monday it had been approached by potential buyers. (Reporting by Helen Reid, Editing by Kit Rees)"

Such a move would need to be approved by both German financial watchdog Bafin and Stada itself because a suitor is normally not allowed to make another offer for at least a year. Stada is currently assessing whether the company would give its consent to the exemption from the exclusion period, the pharmaceutical company said in a statement. The Financial Times had reported late on Monday that Bain and Cinven could unveil a fresh bid within 48 hours. Bain and Cinven would offer an unchanged price of 66 euros per share but would lower the minimum acceptance threshold to 65 percent or less, it said. Investors representing 65.52 percent of Stada's equity had signed up for the last bid, missing a 67.5 percent threshold, despite the 49 percent premium offered by the buyout groups to trump a rival offer from private equity duo Advent and Permira. People close to the matter had told Reuters last week that Bain and Cinven were talking to investors about a potential new offer for Stada. $1 = 0.8797 euros

The $5.5 billion deal, which already has won approval in Europe and Japan, is the latest in the chip industry as companies bulk up in response to growing demand for chips in connected devices and cars. As a condition of approval, Broadcom agreed to build a firewall to prevent the merged company from using information it gains as Cisco System Inc's (CSCO.O) supplier to compete in selling the switches as Cisco's competitor, the FTC said. Broadcom supplies Cisco, and Brocade competes with Cisco, in making fiber channel switches that transfer large amounts of data between servers and other devices, the FTC said. Broadcom agreed that the business group which supplies Cisco would work from separate facilities and that a firewall would prevent the use of Cisco's information for any purpose other than supplying Cisco, the FTC said. Broadcom had no immediate comment. Brocade did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The deal was announced in November. Singapore-based Broadcom, formerly Avago Technologies, is known for its connectivity chips used in products ranging from mobiles to servers, while California-based Brocade makes networking switches, software and storage products.

NordLB had said in April it hoped to complete a deal by the end of June, following about a year of negotiations. The failure to reach a deal is a blow to German banks trying to offload billions of euros in shipping loans as a sale of NordLB's portfolio would have been seen as an indicator for interest in such types of debt.  Other banks, including fellow state owned HSH Nordbank, have also had limited success in selling shipping loans in recent months. Earlier this year, financial sources told Reuters that KKR had already put the deal on the back burner, partly due to a lack of progress in talks over pricing for the assets. NordLB also said on Monday that a sale of individual ship loans was more profitable than a sale of portfolios. It added that even without the KKR deal it would meet its goal of reducing its shipping loan exposure to 12 to 14 billion euros by year-end, a year ahead of target.  KKR declined to comment. NordLB remains in contact with KKR about potential cooperations, the public-sector bank said. Reporting by Arno Schuetze, Alexander Hübner and Jonathan Saul; Editing by Maria Sheahan"
"https://www.reuters.com/article/airbus-reorganisation-idUSL8N1JU0RA","UPDATE 2-Airbus unveils leaner structure and sales shake-up","","Jul 03 2017","* Sources warn against resurgence of national rivalries(Recasts, adds reaction, background)","PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus (AIR.PA) rolled out a leaner new structure on Monday, completing a recent merger between its parent company and its dominant planemaking arm, and including a shift in the reporting line for its key commercial sales team to group CEO Tom Enders.  That move, which confirmed a Reuters report, raised concerns among some insiders and customers about a possible power struggle with long-standing airplanes boss Fabrice Bregier, though Airbus denied any tensions.  Cementing changes first outlined last year, the one Airbus reorganization involves a single headquarters in Toulouse, France, with Bregier confirmed as group-wide chief operating officer and president of commercial aircraft. We need to become more integrated, more collaborative and less bureaucratic for speedier decision-making and execution, Enders said in a letter to employees. The revamp, which saves hundreds of millions of euros in overheads, is designed to complete a decade-long drive to turn the former European consortium - with a history of strong French and German government influence - into a more normal company, and prepare for digital innovations sweeping through industry. But in an unexpected adjustment reported by Reuters on Friday, Airbus said its commercial sales team, best known for contesting leadership of the jet market with Boeing (BA.N), would now report directly to Enders and by-pass Bregier.      That decision is seen as sensitive because it revisits a power-sharing deal between the German Enders and Frenchman Bregier that initially gave the latter responsibility over all planemaking activities. Enders said in his commercial aircraft role, Bregier would lead programs, support and services, engineering, manufacturing, procurement and quality.  However, due to the heavy operational challenges in our largest revenue-driving business, and to slightly rebalance our internal burden-sharing, I will lead sales and marketing, he said in his letter. The decision sent tremors though the commercial arm and raised questions over the future of Bregier, an industrial and marketing heavyweight whose ties to Enders are seen as key to Airbus's ability to smooth output and face a resurgent Boeing. People are very surprised. There is no doubt that this is an important step, a person close to the company said. A jet financier expressed surprise at the move, given well-established relations between many airlines and Bregier. Other critics said the sudden move reflected a heavy-handed new management style or risked being perceived as a weakening of French interests. It is creating a culture in which people will go back to 'Germans versus French' and people having to choose which camp they are in. It is not good for morale or the culture of the company, said a person with detailed knowledge of the group. An Airbus spokesman called it a routine internal matter of reporting lines, as with any normal company. Political Test The new structure comes almost 10 years to the day after leaders of France and Germany agreed in Toulouse to abolish a system of dual control over the company, with the CEO role shared between two people, one French and one German. Enders had to wait another five years to become sole CEO of the group and another year beyond that to reduce the political influence of French and German government shareholders. Both now own 11 percent but their power is limited under a 2013 overhaul. Analysts say Paris and Berlin have generally had their attention elsewhere during the euro zone crisis but that their hands-off approach remains to be tested against a recently softening market for jets, with thousands of jobs at stake. Airbus also faces a raft of politically charged decisions, such as how long to keep building its slow-selling A380 or its response to corruption probes in Britain, France and Austria. Despite resisting interference, Enders appeared to recognize the significance of French politics to Airbus by writing a letter of support in the familiar 'tu' form to then-presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron, which many in Paris saw as a gaffe. Enders is, however, convinced Airbus has to find a new agility to cope with the way 'Big Data' and simultaneous breakthroughs in other technologies are creating opportunities for newcomers such as U.S. rocket maker SpaceX. He acknowledged the new reorganization, which unions say could affect over 1,000 jobs, would be uncomfortable for some. But he told staff Airbus was waving goodbye to an era in which a return to 'stability' was a realistic aspiration.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/toshiba-accounting-idUSL3N1JU2TL","UPDATE 1-SK Hynix convertible bond proposal clouds prospects for Toshiba chip deal","","Jul 03 2017","* Toshiba has said SK Hynix will not have equity in chipunit","SEOUL/TOKYO (Reuters) - SK Hynix Inc (000660.KS) has proposed that its financing for a consortium picked as preferred bidder for Toshiba Corp's (6502.T) chip unit be done via convertible bonds, two sources said, providing it with a path towards an equity interest in the world's No.2 NAND chip maker.  But such an arrangement would fly in the face of Toshiba's assertions that its South Korean rival will have no equity or management influence in the $18 billion chip unit - a stance it has taken to satisfy a government that wants the business to remain under domestic control and for key technology to be kept out of the hands of foreign rivals. The potential for SK Hynix to hold equity would also only harden already trenchant opposition from Western Digital (WDC.O), Toshiba's chip business partner, which is claiming breach of contract and seeking to an injunction to prevent any deal that does not have its consent. The South Korean chipmaker is part of a Japan government-led consortium that also includes Bain Capital and which was hastily cobbled together last month by Japan's trade ministry. While it has the government's implicit stamp of approval, the unusual structure of the offer has raised questions over whether can feasibly clinch a deal. New details coming out through the media such as the convertible bonds suggest there may be some flaws in the scheme. Toshiba must now explain its exact structure, said Masahiko Ishino, an analyst at Tokai Tokyo Research Center. Reaching a deal is now looking difficult, he added.  Sources familiar with the matter have said a state-backed fund, the Innovation Network Corp of Japan (INCJ), would hold the biggest equity interest despite putting up only 300 billion yen ($2.7 billion) of the planned 2 trillion yen. Bain plans to put up 850 billion yen - half of that amount to be provided by SK Hynix in the form of financing, the sources have said.    The South Korean chipmaker plans to buy convertible debt in a special purpose company being created by Bain for the Toshiba acquisition, said one of the sources who spoke on Monday, adding that terms were still being negotiated. SK Hynix was unlikely to convert the debt into equity in the near term, the source said.  SK Hynix declined to comment while representatives for Bain could not be immediately reached for comment. A Toshiba spokesman said the company cannot comment on the specifics of the deal. The sources declined to be identified as the talks were confidential. Toshiba is scrambling to get a deal done as fast as possible as it needs funds to cover billions in cost overruns at now-bankrupt unit Westinghouse. But last week, the Japanese conglomerate missed a self-imposed deadline of having a signed agreement for the chip business in hand, saying more time was needed to smooth out opinions between members of the preferred bidder consortium. Officials within Toshiba's board and INCJ are also concerned about the potential for technology leaks and are demanding the final contract specify that the South Korean firm's financing will never be translated into equity, separate sources have said. SK Hynix has only briefly explained its rationale for being part of the consortium, saying that it sees further business opportunities with Toshiba. It is relatively weak in NAND memory chips although it is the world's No. 2 maker of DRAM chips, which help electronic devices multitask. Toshiba said separately it had made a filing outlining its arguments to Western Digital's request for a preliminary injunction to block the sale of the chip business sale. A hearing on the issue is scheduled for July 14 and Western Digital has said it believes a decision will come on the same day.

Such an arrangement would likely hurt the consortium's efforts to clinch a deal, despite being named the preferred bidder last month with an offer of around 2 trillion yen ($18 billion).

India, like other nuclear nations, has been closely watching the fate of Japanese-owned Westinghouse, which filed for Chapter 11 in March after an estimated $13 billion of cost overruns at two U.S. projects, casting a shadow over the nuclear industry. There has been debate over potential U.S. support for the reactor maker since owner Toshiba (6502.T), the laptop-to-chips conglomerate, announced the blow-out at Westinghouse last year. Some form of U.S. backing or involvement, industry experts say, could avoid a Chinese or Russian buyer unpalatable to Washington, which would prefer to keep Westinghouse's advanced nuclear technology out of the hands of its foreign rivals. The White House declined comment. We were told that, by the end of the year, Westinghouse would really rework its situation and really be back in business, India's foreign secretary, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, told a briefing, referring to an exit from bankruptcy. Civil nuclear cooperation has been a cornerstone of U.S.-India relations, and the proposed construction of six Westinghouse AP1000 reactors in India's Andhra Pradesh, announced in 2016, crowned more than a decade of diplomatic efforts. The achievement was left in limbo by Westinghouse's troubles.   Graphic on nuclear power plants in India: tmsnrt.rs/2tGjv8e The project, however, found specific mention in the Indian government's joint communique from Prime Minister Narendra Modi's first meeting with President Donald Trump in Washington a week ago. (bit.ly/2tsyEdb) The two leaders looked forward to conclusion of contractual agreements between Westinghouse Electric Company and the Nuclear Power Corporation of India for six nuclear reactors in India and also related project financing, the communique said. Sources familiar with the matter said the statement was backed by U.S. guidance that Westinghouse would be sold to a U.S. investor after emerging from Chapter 11 proceedings, in turn paving the way to close the reactor deal in 2018. Elaborating, one industry source with direct knowledge of Westinghouse's talks with India said: Both sides are engaged and once Westinghouse comes out of bankruptcy we would look to conclude the contract. The source, who was not authorized to speak to media, requested anonymity. A diplomat involved in preparations for the Modi-Trump meeting corroborated this timeline, saying: The bankruptcy is on track and should wrap up by year end. Massively Important Westinghouse and India's Department of Atomic Energy did not respond to emailed requests for comment. The state-owned Nuclear Power Corporation of India could not be reached for comment.

Georgia Power/Handout viaFile PhotoToshiba said it wasn't in a position to predict when Westinghouse would emerge from Chapter 11. Because the bankruptcy court has not yet approved a restructuring plan, no decision has been taken on searching for a buyer, it said. U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry, whom diplomats say plans to lead a business delegation to India in October, last week left the door open to a potential deal. This is a lot bigger issue than just allowing the United States a couple of plants in the southern part of the United States, he told reporters. This is a massively important issue for the security of America and the security for America's allies. Perry declined to elaborate on potential acquirers. FILE PHOTO: India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi hugs U.S. President Donald Trump as they give joint statements in the Rose Garden of the White House in Washington, U.S., June 26, 2017.Kevin LamarqueBut former Westinghouse executives have told Reuters that they have been approached by private equity funds to help them assess a possible deal to buy the company.  Paving the way for a deal, Toshiba has agreed on a liability cap on one of the U.S. projects, the unfinished Vogtle power plant in Georgia that is being led by Southern Co (SO.N). If a similar agreement can be reached for the VC Summer plant in South Carolina, which is co-owned by SCANA Corp (SCG.N), that would clear the path to an exit from Chapter 11, say people familiar with the matter. The administration is hoping that the reconfigured company will be back in operation later this year - with a U.S. buyer - and the deal with India can be closed next year, said Washington-based analyst Ashley Tellis, an authority on nuclear policy and former Republican official. Tellis, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, was instrumental in negotiating a civil nuclear accord with India during the George W. Bush administration although, more than a decade on, it has yet to yield actual nuclear deals. Trump's pick for U.S. ambassador to India, Kenneth Juster, helped lay the ground for the talks on the civil nuclear accord. He would play a critical role in bringing the project to completion, added Tellis. Ahead of Modi's visit, a U.S. official had said the United States was looking forward to U.S.-built nuclear reactors contributing to India's energy security.   We very much support continued negotiations between Westinghouse and its Indian partners, recognizing that deals on this scale can take time, the official said.     Westinghouse has said it will concentrate on reactors only - and not construction - meaning it would require partners for its Indian and other projects. In India, its favored partner would be Larsen & Toubro (LART.NS), industry sources say. We are capable of doing this, but of course the technology transfer has to happen, said S.N. Roy, head of L&T;'s nuclear business, who confirmed L&T; had been approached by Westinghouse about being the general contractor.

Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani said at the weekend that the demands were made to be rejected. He insisted Qatar would not close a Turkish military base or shut Doha-based satellite channel Al Jazeera. The four Arab states have warned they may impose further sanctions if Qatar does not comply; they did not give details, but bankers believe, for example, that Saudi, United Arab Emirates and Bahrain banks might receive official guidance to pull deposits from Qatar. Doha's stock index retreated 2.3 percent to 8,822 points, erasing most of the 2.9 percent gains it made on June 22, its last trading before it closed for a week-long Eid al-Fitr holiday. In the final hour of trade on Sunday the index hit an 18-month intra-day low as local traders - which made up a little under three-fifths of the daily traded value on Sunday - were net sellers by a tiny margin for the first time since the crisis erupted on June 5. Foreign funds, however, took advantage of the recent price dips and were net buyers by a wide margin for a second consecutive session. This suggested some funds are willing to bear the heightened geopolitical risk because some companies offer attractive dividend yields. Nevertheless, on Sunday 43 shares dropped and only two rose. Qatar Islamic Bank lost 5.8 percent. The index is now down 11.1 percent since June 5. Kuwait's stock index lost 2.2 percent to 6,613 points in very thin trade, heading towards its immediate technical support at the mid-May low of 6,545 points. Telecommunications operator Zain lost 1.7 percent. In the United Arab Emirates, Abu Dhabi's index rose 0.4 percent on the back of strong gains in some large cap banking shares;  Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank climbed 2.6 percent. In neighbouring Dubai, Dubai Islamic Bank fell 1.2 percent, helping take the index 0.3 percent lower. Outperformers Saudi Arabia's index extended its strong winning streak for a third session after being shut for a week for Eid al-Fitr and added 0.8 percent. Daily traded volumes shrank by about a half from the average of the previous two sessions. The index is now up 6.2 percent since June 20 when index compiler MSCI said it would add Riyadh on a watch list for an emerging market upgrade. The rally has also been supported by the announcement that the kingdom made the architect of the economic reforms, Prince Mohammed bin Salman, next in line to be king at around the same. Shares of heavyweight National Commercial Bank jumped 6.3 percent on Sunday to a fresh 21-month peak. The majority government owned lender is expected to benefit both from MSCI's decision and the expectation that the ambitious economic agenda may translate to higher future earnings. Petrochemical shares were also strong with Saudi Kayan Petrochemical adding 1.9 percent. In Egypt, the index rose 0.7 percent as shares of private equity firm Qalaa Holdings, the most heavily traded stock, climbed 3.8 percent.

Earlier this week BNDES Chief Executive Officer Paulo Rabello de Castro said BNDES Participações SA [BNDESP.UL] wants JBS board members to explain how they will address dwindling access to credit and assess losses caused by executives and their involvement in a corruption scandal. BNDESPar has a stake of about 21 percent in JBS. The two sources could not speak for attribution because they were not authorized to talk to the media about the ongoing negotiations.  The deadline for the meeting had been Friday - but was extended so JBS could put together more detailed financial information to present to minority shareholders.  Currently, family patriarch José Batista Sobrinho has a board seat on JBS, like his son - Chief Executive Officer Wesley Mendonça Batista. Reuters first reported BNDESPar's plans on June 22. Minority shareholders aligned with BNDESPar want the Batistas to compensate them for a recent plunge in shares of JBS, people familiar with the matter told Reuters on June 22. According to the sources, the company's image and reputation have been deeply hurt by the admission of crimes by Wesley and his brother Joesley. Last month, Prosecutor-General Rodrigo Janot reached a plea deal with the brothers, whose family owns 42 percent of JBS, to avoid prosecution if they turned in 1,893 politicians involved in a bribery scheme. Their testimonies ensnared President Michel Temer, whom Joesley accused of obstructing a major corruption probe. Temer has repeatedly denied the Batistas' accusations.     Shares of São Paulo-based JBS have fallen more than 35 percent since mid-May.  For over a decade, both brothers helped transform JBS from a mid-sized slaughterhouse in Brazil's midwestern high plains into the world's largest meatpacker. JBS has operations in five continents and a global payroll of over 200,000. Part of that expansion was financed with loans and capital injections from BNDES. The Batistas and their family holding company J&F; Investimentos SA have taken full responsibility for any illegal acts, in a bid to clear JBS from any wrongdoing.

Struggling under the weight of risky property assets, Popular was taken over by Spain's largest bank for the symbolic price of one euro after European authorities stepped in to prevent its collapse. Following a review of the banks assets, the new chair of the board of directors Rodrigo Echenique said in a statement that Popular would seek partners for assets with a total gross book value of about 30 billion euros. He also announced plans to replace board members of companies in which Popular holds stakes. Meanwhile, Popular said it would buy back 51 percent of Aliseda Servicios, which carries out real estate servicing, from the funds Varde Partners and Kennedy Wilson by the third quarter of 2017. The agreed price for the stake was 180 million euros and will entail a capital consumption for Banco Popular of 302 million euros, the bank said. Morgan Stanley will advise Popular as new owner Santander attempts to meet its declared goal of reducing the volume of bad assets by half in 18 months and completely in three years. Popular said earlier on Friday that normal business operations have been restored in branches and other customer contact centers following last month's takeover.

An internal investigation found McClure had inappropriate interactions with women in the tech community, according to a blog post published Friday by Christine Tsai, 500 Startups co-founder, who said the decision to demote him was made a few months ago.  His behavior was unacceptable and not reflective of 500’s culture and values, she said. I sincerely apologize for the choices he made and the pain and stress they’ve caused people.   McClure will assume a limited role at the firm and is attending counseling, Tsai said. McClure on Friday said in a text message to Reuters that he and Tsai are still on good terms and she has my full support.  The firm made the change public on Friday following a report by the New York Times that named McClure, along with well-known investor Chris Sacca, as perpetrators of sexual harassment toward women who were applying for jobs or seeking fundraising. The report said McClure was no longer in charge of day-to-day operations. Sarah Kunst, founder and chief executive of fitness startup Proday, told the New York Times that McClure had sent her an inappropriate Facebook message after she discussed a potential job at 500 Startups.  Before the New York Times article, Dave had already been demoted because of his harassment of women, however no one outside of 500 Startups had been made aware of this fact, Kunst told Reuters on Friday.  Women did not know to avoid him. The lack of disclosure is part of the problem. Women don't know who is a bad actor when the funds cover it up. McClure referred a request for comment on Kunst's statement and other questions to a spokeswoman, who declined to comment beyond the blog post.  500 Startups invests in early-stage startups around the world and offers an accelerator program for entrepreneurs. Its investments include the ride-hailing company Grab and personal finance company Credit Karma.  McClure is well known throughout the tech industry because of his contrarian attitudes, which include criticizing venture capitalists, his political statements and his frequent public appearances. He is known to make many investments around the world and far beyond Silicon Valley, in places like Turkey and sub-Saharan Africa. Sacca, who gained prominence with early investments in Twitter and Uber, on Thursday published a blog post apologizing for his behavior. I now understand I personally contributed to the problem, Sacca said. He had announced in April that he was retiring from his VC firm, Lowercase Capital. Several women spoke to the New York Times after news site The Information published a report last week detailing inappropriate behavior toward women by investor Justin Caldbeck of Binary Capital. He has since resigned and apologized publicly.  In February, former Uber engineer Susan Fowler wrote a blog post detailing the company's culture of sexual harassment, which prompted a months-long investigation that culminated with the resignation of chief executive Travis Kalanick. The events have brought new focus to what many in the industry say is a long-standing culture of entrenched sexual harassment and discrimination that has made it difficult for women and racial minorities to raise funds and assume leadership positions.

An acquisition offers a chance for bidders to grab control of Asia's biggest warehouse operator, which counts Amazon (AMZN.O) among its clients and is benefiting from rising demand for modern logistics facilities, driven by a boom in e-commerce business. Friday marked the deadline for parties to submit binding offers for GLP. Reuters was not able to confirm if more than two bids were submitted. At current valuations, a successful transaction will rank as the largest Asian buyout by private equity groups, which are  increasingly targeting bigger takeovers after raising record funds, according to Thomson Reuters data. Singapore-listed GLP was thrust into the spotlight late last year after sovereign wealth fund GIC, which owns a 37 percent stake, nudged it to start a strategic review of its business. JPMorgan was then hired by GLP as its financial adviser. GLP's shares have since soared nearly 50 percent to the highest in more than three years. After months of negotiations with a special committee of GLP's independent directors, the race has narrowed to between a group led by Chinese private equity firms Hopu Investment Management and Hillhouse Capital Group, with the support of GLP CEO Ming Mei, and a rival consortium headed by Warburg Pincus and its logistics partner e-Shang Redwood, the sources said. GLP, GIC, Warburg Pincus, Hopu, Hillhouse and a spokeswoman for the consortium declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. The sources declined to be identified as they were not authorized to speak about the deal. Hopu's founder Fang Fenglei, one of China's best known dealmakers, is a GLP board member, and Hopu, partly owns GLP's China business. The Chinese consortium has also brought in co-investors such as property developer China Vanke (000002.SZ) and Ping An Insurance Group of China (2318.HK) for a bid for GLP, sources have said.    The management group and Warburg Pincus are the most serious bidders. Some other parties are keen on picking up specific assets and not the entire company, said one source.    Concerns over the transparency of the sale process and business ties of the management-backed consortium have forced some potential bidders to re-evaluate their interest and sparked complaints to GIC, sources said.    Last week, GLP said it was in discussions with shortlisted bidders and had taken measures to alleviate potential conflicts of interest following a Financial Times report that almost all the potential bidders were dropping out due to concerns an insider bid will make other submissions pointless.    Some of the potential bidders such as Blackstone Group (BX.N) and Asian buyout firm RRJ Capital were unlikely to submit individual bids, sources said. Blackstone declined to comment. RRJ did not respond to an emailed request for comment.    GLP owns and operates a $41 billion portfolio of industrial assets spread across China, Japan, Brazil and the United States. It gets two-thirds of its revenue from China, where it has a dominant market position.

The removal of the restriction allows foreigners to take part in the IPO of Vodacom Tanzania Plc, a subsidiary of South Africa's Vodacom Group. The restrictions on participation of non-Tanzanian investors in the initial public offers of telecommunication companies have been removed, the Capital Markets and Securities Authority said in a statement sent to Reuters. The issuer is expected to announce soon how it will conduct the IPO and provide information on the listing date, it said. The Vodacom IPO was launched in March and initially only open to local investors, but take-up was slow. Vodacom Tanzania extended the offer period for its IPO in April by three weeks amid concerns about adequate liquidity in the local market. The delayed results of the IPO have not been announced but Friday's announcement could mean the initial share sale was undersubscribed although more than 40,000 local retail investors bought shares. Tanzania's telecom operators are required by law to have 25 percent local ownership via IPOs at the Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange (DSE). The government hopes the listings will bring more transparency and offer the public a share in the industry's profits. Two other major telecoms operators, Millicom subsidiary Tigo and a local unit of India's Bharti Airtel , have also submitted prospectuses to the regulator and are awaiting approval for their IPOs. Tanzania posted a 0.9 percent annual increase in the number of mobile phone subscribers in 2016 to 40.17 million. As in other African countries, mobile phone use has surged over the past decade, helped by the launch of cheaper smartphones. Foreign-owned mining companies are also required to list a 30 percent stake on the local stock exchange by Aug. 23. However, investors may be wary of a set of new laws expected to be passed by Tanzania's parliament next week that let the government tear up and renegotiate natural resources contracts. The introduction of the draft laws on Thursday follow months of wrangling between President John Magufuli and mining companies, which produce 3.5 percent of Tanzania's gross domestic product.

Bayer, which is bracing for the EU Commission to go into an in-depth antitrust assessment of the merger, said in a statement on Friday it would work closely with the authorities, reaffirming its goal to wrap up the transaction by the end of 2017. We can confirm receipt of the notification. The provisional deadline for the Commission to take a decision is 7 August, an EU Commission spokeswoman said. Bayer, whose request for U.S. approval is pending, last month pledged to make major asset sales to see the deal through, putting the Liberty herbicide and LibertyLink-branded seeds businesses on the auction block. BASF said it was hoping for a bargain among antitrust-related selloffs and might overcome its traditional reluctance to expand into the seeds industry, while Switzerland's Syngenta is keen to bolster its sub-scale seeds operations. Bayer warned on Friday it would have to adjust its full-year outlook, citing high inventory levels at crop protection customers in Brazil and a weaker-than-expected consumer health business.

Privately held mySugr offers a logbook for mobile devices to help people track their blood sugar, medications and activity levels. It has been working with Roche since 2014 and previously got funding from Roche's Venture Fund. With the acquisition, Roche aims to strengthen a diabetes diagnostics business that has faced fierce price pressure in recent years, cutting sales growth and prompting rumors it wants to unload the business. Roche has said it wants to expand the unit, not sell it. The investment reflects our commitment to our diabetes care business and to improving the lives of people with diabetes, a Roche spokeswoman said on Friday. The takeover also underscores the push by medical device makers seeking to harness wireless technology and big data. Another diabetes tech startup, U.S.-based Glooko, has lured cash from Medtronic and others for a similar platform. The tech push goes well beyond diabetes: Last year, Roche rival Novartis joined Qualcomm to make an internet-enabled inhaler for its emphysema drug Onbrez due out in 2019. [reut.rs/1S8CEFu] We will be able to offer seamlessly accessible patient solutions within an open platform to better respond to the unmet needs of people with diabetes, said Roland Diggelmann, Roche's diagnostics head.  Free Meters MySugr has more than a million users, co-founder Frank Westermann said. The company, with U.S. offices in San Diego, has 47 employees. Its app is available in 52 countries. With Roche's diabetes expertise and global network, mySugr will become an indispensable companion, Westermann said. The companies cite one study showing high-risk Type 1 diabetes patients -- whose bodies do not produce insulin -- who use a mobile health app reduced their average blood glucose by nearly 20 percent. With mySugr's app, diabetes sufferers who use glucose meters to analyze their blood sugar levels can automatically upload data via a Bluetooth connection to their smartphones. From there, the information can be shared usually via email with doctors. Following the deal, MySugr's apps will still be accessible for other manufacturers' devices, Roche said.  But those who download the app in markets including Germany can get Roche's Accu-Chek-brand glucose meters for free, as the Swiss company seeks to capture more customers for its glucose test strips that diabetics must purchase indefinitely.

HSBC's partnership is with the state-backed Qianhai Financial Holdings Co and is majority-owned by the British bank, in contrast with most other Sino-foreign investment banking partnerships where the Chinese partner retains control. The partnership is a key part of the bank's ambition to grow annual profits in the fast-growing southern region of China, allowing it to trade as well as underwrite stocks and bonds for Chinese firms more freely than other foreign rivals. The bank announced in 2015 it would hire 4,000 new staff and invest billions to make the southern Pearl River Delta region its gateway to China, an expansion since delayed by China's slowing growth. The establishment of this joint venture is an important step for HSBC to deliver on our strategic commitment to invest in and grow our business and operations in mainland China, HSBC Chief Executive Stuart Gulliver said in the statement on Friday, following the approval by Chinese regulators.. HSBC announced the venture on Nov. 2, 2015, and has since been waiting for the approval to begin operations. Approval for the venture had been widely expected, but the long wait has potentially reduced the advantage that HSBC could have stolen over rivals with more restrictive licenses, as China relaxes rules on foreign banks.

The EU competition enforcer had voiced concerns about the merged company's ability to squeeze out rivals and hike prices when it kicked off its investigation.  One worry is the company's ability to bundle its products, excluding rivals in baseband chipsets and near field communication (NFC) chips. Other concerns include reduced competition in semiconductors used in cars. U.S. antitrust enforcers cleared the deal unconditionally in April.

The Barnett assets produced 11,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boed) in 2016, of which about 55 percent was natural gas and 45 percent was natural gas liquids, ConocoPhillips said in a statement on Thursday. The oil producer said last month it would sell natural gas-heavy assets in San Juan basin to privately held Hilcorp Energy Co for about $3 billion and earlier agreed to sell oil sands and western Canadian natural gas assets to Cenovus Energy Inc (CVE.TO) for C$17.7 billion. ConocoPhillips has also marked other gas-weighted assets for sale, including some assets in the Anadarko basin and the Gulf of Mexico. The company said the Barnett shale deal, expected to close in the third quarter, may reduce its 2017 production forecast by less than 5 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBOED). ConocoPhillips said it does not expect any material impact to 2017 cash flow or its forecast as a result of the transaction.

Cemig's debt has tripled since 2012, following a series of acquisitions that failed to yield expected returns, due in part to government-led renegotiation of power contracts.

Domain, the real estate classifieds section of Fairfax, will form a joint venture (JV) with Sydney-based start-up Lendi in what Domain's CEO Antony Catalano said was a very important strategic announcement. The JV, Domain Loan Finder, will be launched in early July, offering services from more than 30 lenders including the four major banks - Commonwealth Bank, Westpac, ANZ Banking Group and National Australia Bank. Mortgage lending and broking are highly lucrative businesses, with Australia's home loan broking market alone generating A$2 billion ($1.53 billion) a year in commissions. However, the nation's biggest lenders have been forced to slow down lending, mainly to speculative property investors, as regulators fret over financial stability risks amid rising housing prices and record-high household debt. Policy makers are worried excessive debt in the property market will hurt spending elsewhere in the economy and lead to financial stability risks as the household debt-to-income ratio has climbed to an all-time peak of 189 percent. Earlier this week, Domain's biggest rival REA Group - owned by News Corp - said it had spent A$67 million to buy an 80 percent stake in mortgage broking franchise Smartline. Fairfax is subject to two takeover proposals from U.S.-based private equity firms, Hellman & Freidman and TPG Capital.

Corvex, a $5.5 billion hedge fund run by activist investor Keith Meister, had reported a 5.5 percent stake in Energen last month and called on it to explore a sale of the company. Energen said on June 19 that it launched a sales process and decided to stick with its business plan. Corvex, in a follow-up letter disclosed in a securities filing on Wednesday, said Energen's strategic alternatives process was hastily done and conducted without a formal process to solicit shareholder views. (bit.ly/2tlmPV8) Energen announced a status quo business plan less than 3 weeks after we sent our letter to the company, Meister wrote in the letter, dated June 27. At best this represents a poorly run process and at worst it is misleading and emblematic of corporate entrenchment. Energen responded on Wednesday by saying that it conducted a review of its business with the help of two financial advisers and input from shareholders and concluded that its best option was to continue with its present business execution. Energen has recently spoken to many of the company’s top shareholders and met with them and others in one-on-one settings and at industry conferences, the company said in a statement. We continue to remain open to value creation opportunities. Corvex's newly disclosed 7.6 percent stake makes it Energen's fifth-largest shareholder, according to Thomson Reuters calculation. Energen has a large concentration of assets in the Permian Basin, which has become a hotbed of merger and acquisition activity as a recovery in oil prices spurs energy firms to make strategic investments. Birmingham, Alabama-based Energen's shares were up 2.5 percent at $49.15, giving the company a market value of about $4.80 billion.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/italy-broadband-race-idUSL8N1JJ4DY","'It makes little sense': view from frontline of Italy's broadband war","","Jun 28 2017","* Echoes Australian overspend where operators took biglosses","* Telecom Italia and Enel division race to wire up nation * Battle driving up costs, infrastructure duplicated * Echoes Australian overspend where operators took big losses * Italy has among the slowest internet speeds in Europe * Graphic-Global broadband speeds: tmsnrt.rs/2oqZDQV By Stephen Jewkes and Agnieszka Flak PERUGIA, Italy, June 28 (Reuters) - In Perugia, crews from Telecom Italia (TIM) and Enel's rival broadband divisions have been working side by side, digging cable trenches along the same roads, sometimes inches apart. At times, hundreds of workers vied for space across the medieval Umbrian city, the first battleground between the corporate heavyweights as they race to roll out superfast broadband networks across Italy. The contest to install fiber-optic cables across a country with among the lowest internet speeds in Europe is still in its early stages, but it is already shaping up to be one of the fiercest European telecom battles for years. This is likely to benefit domestic and business customers by keeping down prices, but it is testing the financial commitment and muscle of both companies, which are being forced to expand their original rollout ambitions, driving up costs. Since being launched last year, Open Fiber (OF), the broadband unit owned by Enel and state lender CDP, has more than doubled its planned investments to 6.5 billion euros ($7.4 billion), added more cities to its rollout and also included rural areas under a state-subsidised scheme. Phone group TIM said in March it would reach 95 percent of Italy's population with ultrafast broadband by mid 2018 - almost two years ahead of its original schedule. The concern, according to industry experts, is that the race to get there first, in Perugia and beyond, could lead to a mutually damaging war where both firms lose money and infrastructure is duplicated across the country. It's house by house combat and we're all rushing to plant the flag first, said a person involved in one of the rollouts, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter. It makes absolutely no sense: we are digging and opening up buildings twice and all we needed was some sort of collaboration. The battle mirrors one of the most infamous overspends in telecoms history. During the 1990s internet boom in Australia, dominant carrier Telstra and new rival Optus rolled out separate networks, often wiring up the same homes. By duplicating the Optus network, Telstra's defensive move effectively killed the economics of its rival's plan but it was a Pyrrhic victory: Telstra and Optus both took heavy losses, writing a total of more than $2 billion off their investments. The duplication of infrastructure in Perugia might serve commercial and competitive purposes, though not a practical one given fiber-optic cable, unlike copper wire, has practically unlimited capacity. We're happy because we now have a choice but I realise having two parallel networks doesn't make much sense, said city manager Francesco Calabrese, part of a team that traipsed around Italy for a year to campaign for companies to digitalise Perugia. It was that effort that made Perugia OF's first port of call. Ruled Roost The Rome government has long been pushing for an all-fiber optic network to be rolled out to boost productivity across a country with the lowest take-up of fixed broadband in Europe. For years it had accused TIM of acting too slowly to upgrade its ageing copper network to fiber and publicly backed state-controlled Enel to do the job instead. TIM's reluctance was premised on the belief that the demand was not there to justify over-ambitious investments. It has focused more on cabling fiber to street cabinets - junction boxes - rather than homes, which is less costly and faster, and using alternative technologies over the last mile of copper. The struggle goes beyond corporate Italy as TIM's biggest shareholder is French media conglomerate Vivendi, which has made no secret of its desire to use the Italian firm to help it create a southern European media empire. TIM has much at stake: it owns almost all of Italy's wholesale market - selling access to retail telecom operators, who sell it on to consumers - and has ruled the roost for years. This business brings in about 2 billion euros a year - a significant chunk of its overall Italian revenues of 15 billion, and one which the heavily-indebted group can ill afford to lose. Morgan Stanley estimates TIM could lose a third of the 2 billion euros by 2022 as a result of the competition from OF. Retail operators such as Vodafone, Wind Tre and Tiscali are already warming up to the new infrastructure entrant. Like all other telecom operators, we want to wean ourselves off TIM, gain full control of our customers and boost our profitability, said Riccardo Ruggiero, CEO of Tiscali. Stakes Rising In Perugia, the population is already benefiting from jumping from the web slow lane to the expressway. IT specialist Luca Braconi is now able to stream Netflix movies without any hiccups after Enel cabled up his home with a new super-fast link. TIM will soon be laying its own 1 gigabyte cable under the cobbled streets of Perugia's centre, but Braconi says his loyalties are with Enel for now. Enel got there first and I like what I've got. I'm not going to change for the sake of saving a few euros, he said. With the stakes rising and no obvious winner, the gloves are off. TIM is running more fiber past street cabinets into homes. OF is wooing banks to address concerns about its ability to stay the course. Both are competing to secure critical permits first. The row ratcheted higher last week when the government said TIM had gone back on its word not to invest in rural areas, undermining Rome's efforts to tender them out using state subsidies and threatening the economics of OF's project there. Industry and political sources said the two companies might ultimately have to join forces if losses become too painful, suggesting TIM could potentially spin off its network and merge it with OF or else buy out its smaller rival. Rome is already using its sway to get the two companies to reach a compromise, one industry ministry source said. They need to agree to build just one network or otherwise it'll turn into a battlefield and the only thing battlefields throw up are dead, a person involved in the roll-out said.

Alibaba's announcement comes as its rivals such as Chinese e-commerce firm JD.com Inc are expanding operations in Southeast Asia and amid media reports that Amazon is eyeing an entry into the region of 600 million people where only a fraction of total retail sales are currently conducted online. (tcrn.ch/2mSzlop) The region may be the first market where Amazon and Alibaba will go head-to-head, if the U.S. firm confirms the plans.  It is a clear signal from (Alibaba) that, now having learned the market better, that they really believe in the opportunity of ecommerce in southeast Asia, Lazada Chief Executive Maximilian Bittner told Reuters in an interview.  The move doubles Alibaba's investment in Lazada after last year's deal to buy a controlling stake in it for about $1 billion and is a part of its efforts to boost its global sales. Alibaba had the option to buy the remaining stakes from some Lazada investors, 12-18 months after the deal closed. Besides financial support, Alibaba's investment has provided Lazada with several benefits, including access to a wider range of merchants and improving its logistics capabilities.  Lazada has been expanding its offerings over the last year, buying Singapore-based online grocer RedMart and tying up with companies such as Netflix and Uber [UBER.UL] for a membership program.  Bittner said having Alibaba as a backer was very helpful in distinguishing itself from Amazon and other competitors. The Singapore Lazada website is seen in this illustration photo June 20, 2017.Thomas White/IllustrationIt will be easier to take on one 800 pound gorilla when you have the other 800 pound gorilla behind you, he said, when asked about a potential Amazon entry. On Wednesday, Alibaba said it will purchase the shares from certain Lazada shareholders at an implied valuation of $3.15 billion. Germany's Rocket Internet and Sweden's Kinnevik confirmed in separate statements that they were among the selling shareholders.  Last year's deal had included partial stake sales by investors, including British supermarket operator Tesco Plc, Rocket and Kinnevik. Bittner said Lazada management and Singapore state investor Temasek Holdings [TEM.UL] were the only other remaining shareholders, besides Alibaba. Lazada, founded in 2012, is headquartered in Singapore and also operates in Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam. In the twelve months ended March 31, 2017, Lazada had about 23 million annual active buyers, according to Alibaba's annual report.  The e-commerce markets in the region are still relatively untapped, and we see a very positive upward trajectory ahead of us, Daniel Zhang, CEO of Alibaba, said in a statement. We will continue to put our resources to work in Southeast Asia through Lazada to capture these growth opportunities.   Alibaba shares were down 0.4 percent in pre-market trading, while Rocket shares were 2.3 percent lower.  Amazon did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment on its plans for the region.

Spectranetics uses techniques including lasers and tiny drug-covered balloons to clean the insides of veins and arteries that have become clogged due to heart disease. Philips will pay Spectranetics shareholders $38.50 per share, a 27 percent premium to their closing price on June 27. Philips Chief Executive Frans van Houten has transformed the former conglomerate into a focused maker of healthcare equipment over the past five years, spinning off its lighting division (LIGHT.AS) and selling most of its remaining consumer products business. Philips said Spectranetics, which expects sales of around $300 million this year, will continue to grow revenues at double-digit rates and will begin adding to Philips' earnings in 2018. The deal strengthens Philips' position in heart disease therapy following its acquisition of vascular imaging company Volcano in early 2015, van Houten told reporters. A Philips logo is seen at Philips headquarters in Amsterdam, January 28, 2014.Toussaint Kluiters/United Photos/File PhotoAfter the acquisition we will have quite a nice lineup of devices for both heart, coronary, peripheral, vascular therapies, he said. In combination with our image-guided systems which enable doctors to see inside the body and use these tools, we have a very compelling market position.  Philips shares dipped 1.35 percent to 32.1 euros in morning trading in Amsterdam. Analysts from Berenburg, which rates the shares 'Hold', said the acquisition was a good strategic fit but would not increase Philips' return on invested capital for five years. In our view, this is a nice technology-rich company and adds scale and breadth to Philips’ existing portfolio of mechanical atherectomy and intravascular ultrasound – but clearly this is a punchy price to pay, they said in a note.      Separately on Wednesday, Philips announced a new 1.5 billion euro share buyback program that will begin in the third quarter and run for two years.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/toshiba-accounting-idUSL3N1JP030","UPDATE 2-Toshiba misses self-imposed deadline for chip unit sale, sues Western Digital","","Jun 28 2017","* Talks with some members of preferred bidder group takingtime","CHIBA, Japan (Reuters) - Japan's Toshiba Corp (6502.T) has pushed back its timeline to clinch a sale of its prized flash memory chip unit, saying the $18 billion deal was being held up due to differences of opinion within the consortium chosen as preferred bidder. The delay came as the conglomerate sued its chip business partner Western Digital Corp (WDC.O) for interfering in the sale, one day after the U.S. firm resubmitted a bid for the unit. The lawsuit pushes acrimony between the two to new heights and further complicates prospects for a deal. Scrambling to cover billions of dollars in cost overruns at its bankrupt Westinghouse nuclear unit, Toshiba had pledged to have a signed agreement for the sale of the unit - the world's No. 2 producer of NAND chips - by Wednesday, the day of its annual shareholders meeting. The hotly contested auction has seen a consortium, led by Japanese government investors and including U.S. private equity firm Bain Capital, chosen as preferred bidder but the group's offer was only hastily and awkwardly put together this month. That bid has been largely orchestrated by Japan's trade ministry, which is keen to keep semiconductor technology under domestic control. Chief Executive Satoshi Tsunakawa said the firm was now aiming for an agreement with the preferred bidder consortium as early as possible and a completed transaction by the end of the financial year in March. It is taking time to smooth out differences in opinion among members of the consortium, he said, after apologising for a string of humiliating setbacks that include Toshiba's demotion to the second section of the Tokyo bourse. Related CoverageToshiba says chip unit pact delayed as talks with preferred bidder ongoingThere appears, however, to be little likelihood of a quick and smooth conclusion to the deal. Western Digital, which jointly runs Toshiba's main semiconductor plant, claims that its partner is breaching joint venture contracts and is seeking a U.S. court injunction to prevent any deal that does not have its consent - actions that prompted Toshiba's lawsuit on Wednesday. Toshiba executives continued to offer a string of mixed messages on their willingness to resolve the spat with the California-based firm. On one hand, Tsunakawa lambasted the Western Digital at the shareholders meeting, saying it had been interfering in the sale. But the head of Toshiba's chip unit also said the Japanese company was prepared to make concessions and hoped to resolve the dispute as soon as possible. Staff members greet shareholders as they arrive at Toshiba Corp.'s annual shareholders meeting in Chiba, Japan June 28, 2017.Issei KatoToshiba argues that Western Digital's bid for the memory unit presents anti-trust issues and is too low in price. Western Digital has said it offer meets the 2 trillion yen  ($18 billion) minimum demanded by Toshiba - a figure that appears to match the amount offered by the preferred bidder. Western Digital Tries Again It is not clear if the terms of the bid that Western Digital resubmitted on Tuesday with partner U.S. private equity firm KKR & Co LP (KKR.N) had significantly changed. Slideshow (5 Images)Western Digital said it will provide debt financing to facilitate a sale. Sources with knowledge of the matter have said a state-backed fund, the Innovation Network Corp of Japan (INCJ), and the Development Bank of Japan (DBJ) which are currently part of preferred bidder consortium - would be invited to join the resubmitted offer. While it was not immediately clear what parts of Toshiba's talks with the preferred bidder consortium were taking time, sources have said some Toshiba board members are concerned about technology leaks to South Korean chip rival SK Hynix Inc (000660.KS), which is part of the consortium and will provide Bain with financing. Western Digital has also said it is strongly opposed to SK Hynix's participation and has threatened further legal action. Toshiba's lawsuit, filed with the Tokyo District Court,  seeks around $1 billion in damages. The Japanese firm also said it had shut out Western Digital employees based outside their Yokkaichi chip plant from accessing information relating to the two companies' joint venture - a move that threatens to impede R&D; work on next-generation NAND memory chips. Western Digital declined to comment on the lawsuit. It said in statement it had reiterated its concerns about the sale process and SK Hynix's participation to Toshiba.  The U.S. court hearing for its injunction request is scheduled for July 14.

In a letter to the board, the San Francisco-based hedge fund said Deckers management has long ignored shareholders' suggestions to improve performance and is worried that Deckers' current review to sell itself may not result in the best deal for shareholders. Marcato owns nearly 6 percent of Deckers, the maker of UGG boots and apparel, and is its fifth largest investor. We will be prepared to seek significant board change at the company’s next annual meeting by nominating a slate of director candidates to replace the entire board, Marcato's portfolio manager, Mick McGuire, wrote. Deckers said in April that it was exploring a sale as part of a review of strategic options.. On Tuesday, the company said in a statement: As always, our board of directors will continue to take actions that are in the best interests of the company and all stockholders. McGuire, fresh from winning board seats and ousting the long-serving chief executive officer at Buffalo Wild Wings Inc (BWLD.O) this month, laid out management's missteps and underscored the unhappiness of other large investors. A least six shareholders have urged the company to sell itself but their suggestions have been consistently ignored, McGuire said, adding that there has been a total collapse in shareholders’ confidence in the company’s board of directors and management team.  Although Deckers has engaged an investment bank to explore a sale, the process has been too secretive for Marcato. The fund manager also criticized the company's board, citing its lack of any big investors, lack of expertise in mergers and acquisitions and lack of meaningful stockholder representation. While the company has promised to cut $100 million in costs, McGuire said the savings should be at least twice that and said Marcato lacks confidence that current management and the board can get the job done. Investment management firm Red Mountain Capital Partners LLC in March pushed Deckers for a sale, saying its stock had underperformed due to management's consistently poor capital allocation decisions. Deckers' shares, which have climbed 22 percent this year,  closed up 1.17 percent at $67.72 on Tuesday. Marcato's main fund has returned 8 percent through the middle of June while its Encore International fund is up 18.3 percent.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/takata-bankruptcy-usa-idUSL1N1JO1NW","U.S. plaintiffs' lawyers warn of automaker role in Takata bankruptcy","","Jun 27 2017","Lawyers for peopleinjured by exploding Takata Corp air bags told a U.S.bankruptcy court judge on Tuesday that the company'srestructuring plan is being skewed to benefit automakers overvictims.","WILMINGTON, Del. (Reuters) - Lawyers for people injured by exploding Takata Corp (7312.T) air bags told a U.S. bankruptcy court judge on Tuesday that the company's restructuring plan is being skewed to benefit automakers over victims. TK Holdings Inc, the U.S. business of Takata, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Sunday due to tens of billions of dollars of liabilities from recalls and lawsuits over its air bags, along with 11 Mexican and U.S. subsidiaries. Most of Takata's obligations are owed to automakers for recalling and replacing millions of its air bags, and the Japanese supplier's restructuring plan relies heavily on financial support from its customers. Several personal injury lawyers told U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Brendan Shannon that Takata had made too many concessions to automakers, without investigating the value of their claims. Lawyers for TK Holdings and General Motors Co (GM.N) argued the need for financing outweighed the need to investigate the protections granted to the automakers, which could be investigated later. I will figure that out in due course, but I’m not doing that today, Shannon said. Authorities have linked 16 deaths, mostly in the United States, and more than 180 injuries to explosions of Takata air bag inflators made with ammonium nitrate that became volatile with age and prolonged exposure to heat. Around 100 personal injury and wrongful death cases have been filed in the United States and the company has set aside $125 million for individual claims related to its air bags. Kevin Dean of the Motley Rice law firm urged Shannon to ensure current and future personal injury plaintiffs get an official committee, which includes a budget for lawyers and advisers. You’ll see 10 years from now these inflators involved in a volume of injuries over time, said Dean. We’re dealing with horribly injured plaintiffs.  Shannon acknowledged the role of the plaintiffs and said a committee could be appointed.   The U.S. case, and parallel foreign proceedings, opens the door to the acquisition of Takata's viable operations by Key Safety Systems (KSS), a Michigan-based parts supplier owned by China's Ningbo Joyson Electronic Corp (600699.SS). Ningbo Joyson acquired KSS in 2016 in a $920 million deal. The remaining operations will be reorganized to churn out millions of replacement inflators for cars that are subject to recalls. Takata in February pleaded guilty in a U.S. federal court to a felony charge as part of a $1 billion settlement that included compensation funds for automakers and victims of its faulty inflators.

In a securities filing, Vale said shareholders approved all seven items on the corporate reorganization agenda, which is a first step toward giving the company dispersed share ownership - where no shareholder controls decision making at the firm.  The change represents a milestone in a country long hobbled by corporate governance abuses and reorganizations that hampered minority investors in most cases. Reuters reported the plan on Jan. 19, citing people familiar with it. The plan also puts a limit to the meddling of politicians in Vale - an aspect that weighed on the company's stock during former President Dilma Rousseff's five years in office. Still, the government will keep a golden share, allowing it to fend off hostile takeover attempts and shape strategic decisions. Investors expect Tuesday's vote to improve investors' perception of Vale, translating into a faster convergence of Vale's share prices to those of rivals, and a decline in the Brazilian miner's cost of capital. In the filing, Vale said the proposed conversion of preferred shares into a single, common stock was approved with the equivalent of 68 percent of preferred shares that participated in the ballot, well above the 54 percent threshold set when the plan was first announced in February. 'Encouraging'  Preferred shares gained 2.4 percent to 26.36 reais, while Vale's common shares added 2.5 percent to 28.15 reais in mid-afternoon trading on Tuesday. Under terms of the conversion, holders of Vale's Class A preferred shares will receive 0.9342 of common stock. Investors have 45 days to convert their shares, needing the equivalent of at least 54.09 percent of preferred shares in circulation to go ahead, the filing said. In addition, minority holders voted to allow controlling shareholders grouped under holding company Valepar SA to keep control of Vale for another three and a half years. Vale will eventually absorb Valepar, facilitating the stock conversion. A simpler shareholder structure in which Vale's board, and not Valepar, will decide strategy, and higher liquidity stemming from the end of the Valepar lockup period could trigger a sharp rise in Vale's market capitalization, analysts said. Results were encouraging with the proposal approved and while there are other important steps ahead ... we are encouraged to see progress on this front, and believe this will be well received by the market, said Leonardo Correa, a senior analyst with Banco BTG Pactual in São Paulo. To ensure completion of the plan, Vale would pay owners of Valepar a 10 percent premium for their shares, implying a 3 percent dilution for all shareholders.

The deal comes at a time when the bank is recovering from a sales scandal last year that damaged its reputation. Wells Fargo has doubled its cost-cutting target after expenses soared in the aftermath of the scandal. The sales abuses in the bank's branch banking operation led to a $190 million regulatory settlement, launches of other government probes, the firing of several bankers and the departure of CEO John Stumpf. Wells Fargo plans to reduce expenses by another $2 billion through the end of 2019, on top of a $2 billion cost-cutting target the management previously announced.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/stada-arzneimitt-ma-idUSL8N1JN4EG","UPDATE 4-Bain, Cinven discussing new offer for Stada - sources","","Jun 27 2017","* CEO sees vote as mandate to remain independent(Adds buyout groups mull new offer)","FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Buyout groups Bain Capital and Cinven are talking to investors about a potential new offer for German generic drugmaker Stada (STAGn.DE) after their 5.3 billion euro ($6 billion) bid fell through, people close to the matter said. Investors representing 65.52 percent of Stada's equity signed up for the bid, below a 67.5 percent threshold, despite the 49 percent premium offered by the buyout groups to trump a rival offer from private equity duo Advent and Permira. The new offer is unlikely to see the price increased, but may come with a lower acceptance threshold, the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity as the matter isn't public.      Before launching a new bid, however, Bain and Cinven want irrevocable commitments from investors that they will tender their shares, the sources said.     Any new bid launched within a year would need recommendation from Stada's executive and supervisory boards and approval by financial watchdog Bafin, as German takeover rules otherwise bar Bain and Cinven from amending their offer a second time. The buyout groups made an initial proposal of 58 euros per share before tabling their 66 euros per share bid in April. The sources said investors such as hedge funds held back some of their shares, speculating on securing a higher price for any remaining stock after a successful initial tender offer. But the buyout groups also struggled to galvanize non-professional, often elderly investors, many of whom the bidders feared were ignoring or forgetting letters from their custodian banks. A relatively large 27 percent of shares are held by retail investors. Index tracking funds that cannot tender initially but only after a successful deal hold about 12 percent of the stock. Lowering the acceptance hurdle too far under any new offer would complicate the buyers' efforts to get debt financing for the deal because the German takeover code requires at least 75 percent ownership for full access to a target company's cash, which could then be used to back the borrowing. Cinven declined to comment, while Bain was not immediately available for comment.  Stada shares, which touched a record high last month, fell to 56.51 euros, their lowest level since April, but later trimmed their losses to trade around 3 percent lower. Bain and Cinven had offered 66 euros per share. While former counterbidders Advent and Permira remain interested in Stada, they are not expected to take immediate action to put together a new bid, but will wait to see if Bain and Cinven launch a second attempt, people close to the matter said. Advent and Permira declined to comment. We had been expecting the deal to go through as we had viewed the offer as a great deal for shareholders, so we view this as a significant setback, Jefferies analyst James Vane-Tempest wrote, who has a hold rating on Stada shares. Many buyout firms are flush with cash after recent divestments and amid cheap borrowing costs. They are particularly attracted to healthcare assets for their reliable cash flows and resistance to swings in the business cycle. We respect the close vote of our shareholders and understand it as a mandate to press ahead with our successful growth strategy, Chief Executive Matthias Wiedenfels said. However, we also regard this decision as a mark of confidence in Stada’s abilities, which our employees have impressively demonstrated, in particular over the past months.   Stada said the termination of the deal did not have an impact on its earnings targets. For 2017, Stada still expects sales adjusted for currency and portfolio effects of 2.28 billion to 2.35 billion euros, with adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of 430 million to 450 million euros.

Sprint, controlled by Japan's SoftBank Group Corp, has entered into a two-month period of exclusive negotiations with Charter and Comcast that has put its merger talks with U.S. wireless peer T-Mobile US Inc on hold till the end of July, the sources said on Monday. A deal with Sprint would build on a partnership that Charter and Comcast announced last month. The two cable operators have agreed that they would not do deals in the wireless space for a year without each other's consent. Comcast has already unveiled plans for a wireless service, using its Wi-Fi hotspots and the airwaves of Verizon Communications Inc, the largest U.S. telecommunications provider, based on a deal between the two that dates back to 2011. Comcast and Charter are now in talks with Sprint to secure a similar network-resale agreement on better terms, the sources said. A previous nine-year-old network-resale agreement between Comcast and Sprint was never activated, one of the sources added. The Wall Street Journal, which first reported on the negotiations, also said that Charter and Comcast were in preliminary talks to take an equity stake in Sprint as part of an agreement. Such a deal would allow Sprint to invest more in its network, the newspaper added.

Investors have long expected a deal between T-Mobile and Sprint, the third- and fourth-largest U.S. wireless service providers, anticipating cost cuts and other synergies in the range of $6 billion to $10 billion.

Carolina nuclear plant","","Jun 26 2017","SCANA Corpsaid on Monday it extended its assessment for six weeks of anunfinished U.S. nuclear power plant being built for the utilityby a unit of Toshiba Corp, which is seeking to cut tiesto the financially disastrous project.","WILMINGTON, Del. (Reuters) - SCANA Corp said on Monday it extended its assessment for six weeks of an unfinished U.S. nuclear power plant being built for the utility by a unit of Toshiba Corp, which is seeking to cut ties to the financially disastrous project. The South Carolina project, known as VC Summer, and a similar half-finished nuclear power plant in Georgia known as Vogtle, are billions of dollars over budget and pushed Toshiba's Westinghouse Electric Co LLC into Chapter 11 bankruptcy in March. SCANA said on Monday it would extend to Aug. 10 its assessment agreement under which the utility will pay temporarily for construction to continue at VC Summer without cost to Westinghouse. The agreement was scheduled to expire this week. Cayce, South Carolina-based SCANA said the extension would give it time to determine the most prudent path forward for the project and said it expected to make that decision before October. Westinghouse plans to use the bankruptcy to end its contract for constructing the two power plants, but doing so would trigger guarantee claims against Toshiba. Earlier this month Toshiba agreed to settle its guarantees  with Southern Co, the main owner of the Vogtle project, for $3.7 billion. Toshiba now needs to reach a similar settlement with SCANA and Santee Cooper, the state utility that co-owns VC Summer, to determine its cost for guaranteeing the project. Settling the guarantee claims would put a line under Toshiba's liability for the two projects. The conglomerate has warned it may not survive and is seeking a deal this week to sell its prized memory chip business. Once it extracts itself from construction of the projects, Westinghouse plans to reach a services agreement with the plant owners to provide engineering and procurement to finish the projects, if the owners choose to complete construction. In a court filing, Lisa Donahue, who is overseeing Westinghouse's turnaround, said those services agreements are expected to provide substantial profitable revenue for a post-bankruptcy Westinghouse. That potential profit in turn is likely to help attract potential bidders for Westinghouse, raising funds to benefit the owners of the two nuclear power plants. The utilities that own the plants may also get some help from the U.S. Congress. The U.S. House of Representatives last week passed a bill that would extend the current deadline of end-2020 for producing power to qualify for potentially large tax credits.

Rosneft is suing Sistema for 170.6 billion roubles ($2.9 billion) in damages over the purchase of oil producer Bashneft (BANE.MM). Sistema proposed an out-of-court settlement last week.  Rosneft spokesman Mikhail Leontyev said the arrest of the shares, which halts their use but does not seize them, was a security measure and the shares arrested equaled the value of Rosneft claims against Sistema.  Sistema is one of the largest private holdings in Russia and is controlled by businessman Vladimir Yevtushenkov. MTS, with the market value of $8 billion according to Thomson Reuters data, is Sistema's largest asset. Sistema interests also include agriculture, real estate and other assets.  On Monday, Sistema said it had received notice of an enforcement action from the Moscow Directorate of the Federal Bailiffs Service and a copy of a court order from the Republic of Bashkortostan Arbitration Court. According to the court order, an arrest was imposed on a 31.76 percent stake in MTS, 100 percent of its Medsi chain of medical clinics, and 90.47 percent of Bashkirian Power Grid company owned by Sistema and its unit Sistema-Invest. Under the order, a relatively common device in Russia, Sistema still owns the shares but cannot carry out any action using them until the court allows it to. The court can order the shares to be seized, released or sold off as part of the dispute. Sistema owns a little over 50 percent in MTS, also present in Ukraine, Belarus, Armenia and Turkmenistan with a total 110 million clients. MTS shares lost over 6 percent in New York trade following shares arrest. Fair Compensation   The arrest of shares was made ... as a security in the framework of the legal claim lodged by Rosneft, Bashneft and the Republic of Bashkortostan against Sistema and Sistema-Invest, Sistema said on Monday. It said it considered the demands unlawful and unfounded. MTS said in a separate statement: This situation does not impact operations with MTS shares, and the rights to receive dividends on MTS shares owned by other shareholders.  Bashneft, which produces around 400,000 barrels of crude oil a day, was owned by Sistema for a couple of years until 2014, when the court has ruled to return the company to the state.  Yevtushenkov himself was accused in 2014 of misappropriating Bashneft shares and held for three months under house arrest. The charges, which Sistema denied, were eventually dropped  Rosneft bought Bashneft from the state last year.  Shares are not being seized but a number of actions such as sale, purchase, usage as a collateral, are being suspended ... Rosneft needs a fair compensation of its claims and these assets act as guarantee for this becoming possible, Rosneft spokesman Leontyev said.  He was later quoted by RIA news agency as saying that Rosneft was ready to accept any other adequate collateral from Sistema.  Independent directors on Sistema's board have asked Russian President Vladimir Putin to intervene in the dispute, but Kremlin has said Putin will not.

Loeb's fund, Third Point LLC, disclosed a $3.5 billion stake in the Swiss food group in a letter to its investors late on Sunday in which he said Nestle should boost margins, buy back shares and get rid of non-core businesses including a 23 percent stake in L'Oreal. The letter said that Bennink, a consumer goods industry veteran, was advising it on the Nestle investment and had also personally invested alongside the fund. Jan has direct operating experience in four of Nestle's key categories: coffee, baby food, medical nutrition, and dairy, as well as an unimpeachable record of substantial shareholder value creation, Third Point said in its letter. He brings deep expertise in packaged goods, which greatly enhanced our due diligence process and gives greater credibility to our investment thesis. A spokeswoman for Bennink said he was not available for comment. Bennink made his name as head of Dutch baby food producer Royal Numico, which he joined in 2002 when it was struggling in the wake of several U.S. acquisitions that made it a major player in the U.S. vitamin and nutrition market. After slimming the company down and refocusing it back on baby food and hospital nutrition products, he sold Numico to Danone in 2007, for $16.8 billion. That represented a multiple of 21.7 times earnings, much higher than the average multiple of 15.2 times for food and drink deals at that time. Bennink later cemented his reputation when he oversaw the spin-off of Sara Lee's international coffee arm and also ran the business, which is now controlled by JAB Holding. He has a fantastic reputation, very dynamic, very proactive, with a first-rate track record, Vontobel analyst Jean-Philippe Bertschy said. Activist investors often retain operational experts to advise on investment campaigns, with an eye to nominating them for a board seat in the future - a role Third Point may have in mind for Bennink. Ex-AIG Chairman Robert Miller and former Foster Wheeler CEO Raymond Milchovich joined Dow Chemical's board in 2014 after serving as Third Point advisers in its campaign for changes at the industrial conglomerate. Nestle said on Monday it remained committed to its current strategy. ($1 = 0.8945 euros) Additional reporting by Toby Sterling in Amsterdam and Michael

BNDES Chief Executive Officer Paulo Rabello de Castro said BNDES Participações SA [BNDESP.UL] wants JBS board members to explain how they will address dwindling access to credit and assess losses caused by executives and their involvement in a corruption scandal. BNDESPar has about 21 percent stake in JBS. Currently, family patriarch José Batista Sobrinho has a board seat on JBS, like his son - Chief Executive Officer Wesley Mendonça Batista. Reuters first reported BNDESPar's plans on June 22. Minority shareholders aligned with BNDESPar want the Batistas to compensate them for a recent plunge in shares of JBS, people familiar with the matter told Reuters on June 22. According to the sources, the company's image and reputation have been deeply hurt by the admission of crimes by Wesley and his brother Joesley. Last month, Prosecutor-General Rodrigo Janot reached a plea deal with the brothers, whose family owns 42 percent of JBS, to avoid prosecution if they turned in 1,893 politicians involved in a bribery scheme. Their testimonies ensnared President Michel Temer, whom Joesley accused of obstructing a major corruption probe. Temer has repeatedly denied the Batistas' accusations.     We want to reshuffle and boost the quality of the company's top brass and board, Rabello do Castro told reporters at the sidelines of an event in São Paulo. Shares of São Paulo-based JBS fell 1.6 percent to 6.16 reais, extending their losses to 35 percent since mid-May.  For over a decade, both brothers turned JBS from a mid-sized slaughterhouse in Brazil's midwestern high plains into the world's largest meatpacker - with operations in five continents and a global payroll of over 200,000. Part of that expansion was financed with loans and capital injections from BNDES. The Batistas and their family holding company J&F; Investimentos SA have taken full responsibility for any illegal acts, in a bid to clear JBS from any wrongdoing.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/britain-politics-may-idUSL8N1JN0LL","UPDATE 7-UK's May strikes $1.3 billion deal with N.Irish party to prop up government","","Jun 26 2017","* Angry Scotland, Wales say DUP deal weakens United Kingdom(Adds Sinn Fein reaction, Conservative spokesman on funding)","LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May struck a deal on Monday to prop up her minority government by agreeing to at least 1 billion pounds ($1.3 billion) in extra funding for Northern Ireland in return for the support of the province's biggest Protestant party. After over two weeks of talks and turmoil sparked by May's failure to win a majority in a June 8 snap election, she now has the parliamentary numbers to pass a budget and a better chance of passing laws to take Britain out of the European Union. May and Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Arlene Foster presided at the signing of a three-page so-called confidence and supply deal that is some way short of a more formal coalition agreement.  It means the DUP's 10 lawmakers will now vote in support of May's 318 Conservatives in the 650-seat parliament on the budget, legislative agenda, motions of confidence and Brexit. In return, May agreed to at least 1 billion pounds ($1.3 billion) in extra funding over two years for Northern Ireland, agreeing to raise pensions annually by at least 2.5 percent and to keep universal winter fuel payments for the elderly. I welcome this agreement, which will enable us to work together in the interest of the whole United Kingdom, give us the certainty we require as we embark on our departure from the European Union, and help us build a stronger and fairer society at home, May said in a statement.  May linked her deal with an attempt to end Northern Ireland's political crisis by stipulating the money would only be released to a power-sharing executive in Belfast, raising pressure on the DUP to come to an agreement with their Catholic nationalist rivals. However a Conservative party spokesman said that there would be a mechanism for the money to be released via a consultative committee even without a deal to restore power-sharing. Related CoverageSinn Fein says Northern Ireland billion-pound windfall no guarantee of power-sharing dealDublin welcomes greater Northern Irish Brexit voice after DUP, May dealSinn Fein says DUP, May deal a 'blank cheque' for damaging BrexitThe Conservative Party has recognized the case for higher funding in Northern Ireland given our unique history and circumstances over recent decades, DUP leader Foster told reporters in Downing Street. We welcome this new financial support of 1 billion pounds. Leaders of Scotland and Wales voiced anger at the deal, saying it would weaken, not strengthen, the ties that bind the United Kingdom by throwing money at one of its devolved regions at the expense of others. Today's deal represents a straight bung to keep a weak prime minister and a faltering government in office, said Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones of the Labour party. Scotland First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: In concluding this grubby, shameless deal, the Tories (Conservatives) have shown that they will stop at nothing to hold on to power – even sacrificing the very basic principles of devolution. Britain's Prime Minister, Theresa May, shakes hands with Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) Deputy Leader Nigel Dodds, in Downing Street, in central London, Britain June 26, 2017.Neil hallGerry Adams, president of the Irish Catholic nationalist Sinn Fein party, said the deal provides a blank cheque for a Brexit that threatens peace in Northern Ireland. The deal with the DUP, which won 292,316 votes in the June 8 election, will run for the life of the current parliament due to end in 2022 but will be reviewed after each parliamentary session and most of the funding is due in the first two years. Opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn questioned how the government had found a billion pounds given planned spending cuts, which he said should now be canceled for all the United Kingdom, not just the province of Northern Ireland.  Even with DUP lawmakers onside, May's effective majority is slim and her position remains insecure though she has promised to extricate the Conservatives from what she termed the mess of the election. Slideshow (14 Images)Her strategy for a complete break of Britain from the EU is under scrutiny and her future as prime minister is the subject of public debate with speculation that she could be challenged from within her own party within months.  Fragile Peace in Northern Ireland  While May negotiated the DUP deal, senior Conservatives such as ex-Prime Minister John Major raised concerns the deal risks pitching the province back into turmoil by convincing hard men on both sides of the sectarian divide to return to violence. The fear was that increasing the influence of pro-British unionists over the British government could create the perception that London was no longer an honest broker of the peace settlement reached in 1998. The U.S.-brokered Good Friday agreement brought an end to three decades of violence in Northern Ireland that killed 3,600 people. Northern Ireland has been in crisis since Sinn Fein pulled out of its government in January, prompting an election in March and a series of missed deadlines to restore the compulsory coalition between Catholic nationalists and pro-British Protestant unionists. I will be returning to Northern Ireland to continue our discussions as we attempt to re-establish the Northern Ireland Executive, Foster said. Now more than ever, political leaders, both locally and nationally, need to work together to find solutions for all the people we serve.  The latest deadline set by May's government for the parties in Northern Ireland to reach a deal is Thursday. Sinn Fein said the extra money for Northern Ireland would not in itself guarantee that power-sharing in the province would be restored by the new deadline.  Time is running short for the parties to come together and reach agreement to re-establish power-sharing, May said. Northern Ireland needs a functioning devolved government at this important time.

Rio's mines in Australia's Hunter Valley region are attractive to both Glencore and China because the quality of their coal means it is likely to continue to be burned even as concerns about emissions deter generators from using poorer quality coal, which is the most polluting of all. Yancoal increased its offer to $2.69 billion from $2.45 billion, adding $240 million in unconditional guaranteed royalty payments to a cash offer of $2.45 billion.  The revised offer from Yancoal of $2.69 billion offers compelling value to our shareholders, Rio Tinto Chief Executive Jean-Sebastien Jacques said in a statement.  Glencore on Friday had raised its offer to $2.675 billion in cash, looking to beat Yancoal's earlier offer of $2.45 billion.  Glencore said its bid would lapse if Rio Tinto did not declare it to be superior by June 26.  On Monday, it declined comment on Rio Tinto's decision to stick with Yancoal. Rio Tinto said Yancoal offered a faster and more certain timetable, with the deal likely to be wrapped up during the third quarter of 2017, compared with the first half of 2018 at the earliest for the Glencore deal.  The Rio Tinto mining company's logo is photographed at their annual general meeting in Sydney, Australia, May 4, 2017.Jason ReedYancoal also increased its termination fee, in the event a deal is not completed, to $225 million from $100 million. Yancoal continues to provide Rio Tinto with the certainty of approvals and funding required to facilitate the efficient and timely sale of the Coal & Allied assets, Yancoal Chairman Xiyong Li said in a statement. Yancoal, though based in Australia, is 78 percent owned by China's Yanzhou Coal Mining Company. The logo of commodities trader Glencore is pictured in front of the company's headquarters in Baar, Switzerland, September 30, 2015.Arnd Wiegmann/File PhotoThe sale includes a major stake in the Port Waratah coal-loading facility in Newcastle port, from where most of Australia's thermal coal departs for overseas markets. Both Glencore and Yancoal want to buy Rio Tinto's mines to operate alongside existing operations, looking to sell high quality thermal coal to power generators in Japan, Taiwan and South Korea that are under pressure to become more efficient and to lower emissions.  In raising its offer last week, Glencore said it would sell assets to ensure its debt level remained modest. Analyst Edward Sterck of BMO Capital Markets said if Glencore's higher bid had been accepted, it could reduce the company's flexibility to pursue its goal of expanding its agriculture business.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/hollandbarrett-ma-l1retail-idUSL8N1JN0U6","UPDATE 2-Fridman's L1 Retail to buy Holland & Barrett for $2.3 bln","","Jun 26 2017","* UK chains hit by consumer slowdown, online challenges(Adds analysts, background)","LONDON (Reuters) - Russian billionaire Mikhail Fridman's L1 Retail has agreed to buy Britain's Holland & Barrett for 1.77 billion pounds ($2.26 billion) in its first acquisition, betting on continued growth and expansion abroad for the health foods chain.  L1 Retail, part of Fridman's empire that spans investments in ride-hailing firm Uber to North Sea assets, said it expected to complete the purchase from The Nature's Bounty Co. and The Carlyle Group by September, subject to regulatory approvals. Britain's retailers face an uncertain future, with consumer spending slowing and online competition picking up. Luxury clothing chain Jaeger fell into administration in April, while dealmaking has also been on the rise, with Brazil's Natura set to buy The Body Shop from L'Oreal.  However, some industry experts think healthier foods could prove a resilient part of the market, with online giant Amazon.com (AMZN.O) agreeing to buy U.S. chain Whole Foods for $13.7 billion earlier this month. Researchers Euromonitor reckon the health and wellness market grew 4.8 percent a year between 2011 and 2016, reaching a total value of $704 billion last year. Holland & Barrett, whose products range from vitamins and homeopathic remedies to free from foods for allergy sufferers, says it has grown same-store sales for 32 consecutive quarters, with revenues topping 610 million pounds in 2016.  While focused mainly in Britain, the 1,000-plus store chain has been expanding abroad as well as online, helping to catch L1 Retail's eye.  We believe that the company is well positioned to benefit from structural growth in the ... health and wellness market and has multiple levers for long term growth and value creation, said L1 Retail managing partner Stephen DuCharme. Holland & Barrett was founded in 1870, but traces its roots in health and wellness back to 1920 when Samuel Ryder - who went on to sponsor the international golf tournament that bears his name - set up a company specializing in herbs. 'Push Back' Jonathan Buxton, partner and head of retail at Cavendish Corporate Finance, said the takeover by L1 Retail could help Holland & Barrett fend off growing competition.  With this kind of investment, we would expect that the retailer will continue to invest in its stores but more importantly, seek to increase its online presence to push back against the likes of Amazon following its acquisition of Whole Foods, he said.  According to Forbes, Fridman reached the seventh spot in Russia's 2017 rich list, with wealth of $14.4 billion. Though he has moved his base to London from Moscow, the 53-year-old and his partners still own major assets in several industries in Russia, including a majority stake in Russia's biggest food retailer by sales X5 Retail, top-10 lender Alfa Bank and Russia's third-biggest mobile operator Vimpelcom. However, since selling out of oil company TNK-BP to Russia's state-owned energy group Rosneft (ROSN.MM) in 2013, they have largely sought to invest outside Russia. L1 Retail's advisers include Karl-Heinz Holland, former CEO of German discount retailer Lidl Group, and Clive Humby, a founder of retail data pioneer dunnhumby. A spokesman for L1 told Reuters the company would create a board for Holland & Barrett that would include L1 Retail's advisory board and investment team, possibly some outside non-executive directors and the chief executive and chief financial officer of the chain. Private equity firm Carlyle acquired Nature's Bounty, including Holland & Barrett, in 2010 for $3.8 billion.  Reuters reported in January that Carlyle had hired Goldman Sachs to help it sell Nature's Bounty, but that it might opt to sell Holland & Barrett separately. Carlyle was advised by Goldman Sachs, Houlihan Lokey, UBS, PwC, Latham Watkins and OC&C.; Additional reporting by Maria Kiselyova in Moscow; Editing by Simon Jessop and Mark Potter"

DHT last month rejected a fifth takeover proposal from billionaire shipping tycoon John Fredriksen's Frontline, calling the $500 million all-share bid woefully inadequate. Frontline has now admitted defeat and switched course away from takeovers for the time being.    We will not spend time pursuing the DHT track, Frontline Chief Executive Robert Hvide Macleod said in a written comment to Reuters. With our present opportunities for creating value through fleet renewal, we're not currently pursuing any other acquisitions either, he added. Instead of a deal with Frontline, DHT struck a tankers-for-shares agreement with BW Group [BGLL.UL] in March. That made BW, led by shipping tycoon Andreas Sohmen Pao, DHT's biggest shareholder with a stake of over 30 percent. Frontline attempted to block the BW deal, first in a U.S. court and later in the High Court of the tiny Marshall Islands in the Pacific, but both lawsuits were eventually dismissed. Following DHT's rejection, investors and analysts had suggested Frontline could widen its search for acquisitions to include other competitors such as Gener8 Maritime (GNRT.N). Macleod said Frontline would continue to expand its fleet of crude tankers and that the company had ample access to borrow money at attractive rates in financial markets, but rejected takeovers for the time being. Frontline still believes the industry at some point should see further consolidation, but given today's market situation and Frontline's position and size, we're very comfortable moving forward on our own, he added. Frontline had previously argued that a deal to combine with DHT and create the world's largest listed tanker company would be able to lower costs and also well placed to participate in a market recovery.

Western Digital, which jointly runs Toshiba's main semiconductor plant, has been feuding bitterly with its Japanese partner over the $18 billion sale and has sought a U.S. court injunction to prevent any deal that does not have its consent. I must make it clear that Western Digital will not consent to a transaction with the proposed consortium, CEO Stephen Milligan said in a letter sent to Toshiba's board. The June 25 letter, seen by Reuters on Monday, said that SK Hynix's participation in a consortium purchasing Toshiba's interests in their joint ventures increases the likelihood of technology leakage and harm to the JVs going forward. Toshiba last week chose a consortium of Bain Capital and Japanese government investors as preferred bidder for the unit, the world's No. 2 producer of NAND flash chips. The South Korean chipmaker, which is relatively weak in NAND flash memory chips, will provide half of the 850 billion yen ($7.6 billion) that Bain plans to put up in the form of financing, sources have said. Toshiba CEO Satoshi Tsunakawa told a news conference on Friday that SK Hynix would not be holding any equity and would not be involved in management - an arrangement that was unlikely to raise regulatory red flags and would prevent leaks of key technology information.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/europe-stocks-idUSL8N1JN15N","Nestle, Italian bank deal prop up European shares","","Jun 26 2017","* Oil bounce also supports market(Adds details, updates prices)","MILAN (Reuters) - European shares rose on Monday as banks rallied after Italy reached a deal to wind up two failed regional banks and Nestle climbed to a new record after an activist investor urged changes at the consumer bellwether. Italy began winding up two failed Veneto region banks on Sunday in a deal that could cost taxpayers up to 17 billion euros but puts an end to a long-running crisis and leaves the lenders' good assets in the hands of Intesa Sanpaolo (ISP.MI). The announcement of definitive steps to resolve the two Veneto banks should be seen as a positive for Italian banks and the broader sector (albeit at a high cost), said Jefferies analyst Benjie Creelan-Sandford.  Intesa, as acquiror of the 'good' assets, also looks to be getting a good deal, he added. Shares in Intesa, Italy's largest retail bank, rose 3.2 percent while the euro zone bank index .SX7E rose 1.3 percent.  Gains in bank stocks helped the pan-European STOXX 600  and the euro zone blue chip .STOXX50E indexes rise 0.6 and 0.7 percent respectively, while UK's FTSE .FTSE added 0.6 percent. Further supporting sentiment was a survey showing that German business confidence unexpectedly rose in June to a record high, a fresh sign that company executives are more upbeat about the growth outlook of Europe's largest economy. The German blue chip index .GDAXI added 0.6 percent.     Nestle (NESN.S) led STOXX gainers, up 4.3 percent. Activist investor Daniel Loeb's Third Point unveiled a stake of more than 1 percent, urging the group to improve its margins, buy back stock and sell its stake in L'Oreal (OREP.PA).  UBS said despite its scale, Nestle lagged its rivals in profitability and that the move could put pressure on its CEO to take tangible steps to accelerate value creation. L'Oreal rose 4.1 percent. Gains in Nestle also gave a lift to sector peers such as Danone (DANO.PA), Unilever (ULVR.L) and Diageo (DGE.L), sending the European food and beverage index .SX3P up 1.9 percent and on track for its strongest day this year. Higher oil prices propped up the energy sector, the worst performing this year, with majors such as BP (BP.L) and Total (TOTF.PA) leading the charge. [O/R]  Underscoring the broadly upbeat mood across markets, safe-haven utilities .SX6P were the only sector in the red by mid morning, falling 0.1 percent. Among top STOXX fallers were William Hill (WMH.L) and Zalando (ZALG.DE), both down more than 2 percent following downbeat broker notes. Reporting by Danilo Masoni; Editing by Robin Pomeroy"

The Co-op Bank, which provides banking services to almost 4 million retail and small and medium sized enterprises, said it was in advanced talks with a group of existing investors over a deal which includes a recapitalization. A deal would allow the bank to meet the longer term capital requirements demanded by the regulator and to continue as a stand-alone entity, while safeguarding its values and ethics, it said in a statement. The bank, which put itself up for sale in February, nearly collapsed in 2013 after losses from problem real estate loans and has been struggling to rebuild its financial health. Co-op said it was discussing its capital raising options with the UK's Prudential Regulation Authority. A majority of the key commercial aspects of the deal had been substantially agreed, it said, and it was in advanced talks over how to manage the group's pension liabilities, it said in response to media reports of an impending deal. Discussions are continuing between the parties, including on other key matters, with a view to agreeing the final aspects of the Proposal and a further announcement will be made in due course, it said. As a result, the Co-op said it had decided to discontinue a formal sale process.  Financial support for the bank's portion of Co-operative Group's 10 billion pound pension scheme has been one of the sticking points of the deal. Co-operative Group currently has a 20 percent stake in the bank. However, the positions of the bank's investors and the pension scheme trustees on the issue were now largely aligned, a source familiar with the matter said. In an update on its financials, the Co-op said it now targeted an improved capital position, sustainable profitability in the medium term and a mid-single digit return-on-equity in 2021.

It gave no details on what it meant by pulled out but said it had intervened in the loan renegotiation talks to prevent job losses and asset stripping. Etisalat Nigeria had repaid $500 million of the loan before it defaulted in February due to a currency devaluation and its only remaining investors are its Nigerian partners, led by company chairman Hakeem Belo-Osagie. On Tuesday, parent company United Arab Emirates' Etisalat, said it was carrying its 45-percent stake at nil value, and that the Nigerian lenders had ordered it to transfer its shares to a loan trustee by June 23 after the renegotiation failed. Neither Etisalat nor Mubadala, which owns 40 percent of Etisalat Nigeria, could be reached for comment.  Given the inability of Etisalat (Nigeria) to come to an acceptable agreement with the banks, the largest shareholder in the company, Dubai-based Mubadala Development Company of the United Arab Emirates, has now pulled out of the company as well as the ongoing negotiations, the central bank said. It was based on the attempt of the banks to takeover the company that the financial and telecommunications regulators have moved in to intervene and forestall down-sizing and asset stripping, it said. In March, the central bank, which is also the banking watchdog, and the Nigeria Communications Commission (NCC)regulator tried to prevent lenders placing the firm in receivership to avoid a wider debt crisis and agreed with banks to pursue a default deal. But lenders, under pressure to avoid loan-loss provisions, have been pushing to finalize a restructuring before half-yearly audits this month. Central bank spokesman Isaac Okorafor said representatives from the central bank and the telecoms regulator would hold talks in the next few days with lenders and IHS Towers, the mobile phone tower managers, as well as equipment suppliers. The original loan was a seven-year facility to refinance a $650 million loan and fund expansion of Etisalat Nigeria's network. The company missed payments in February after sharp falls in the Nigerian naira bloated the loan's value, making repayments difficult. Etisalat is Nigeria's fourth biggest mobile operator with a 14-percent market share. South Africa's MTN has 47 percent, Globacom 20 percent and Airtel - a subsidiary of India's Bharti Airtel - 19 percent of Nigeria's mobile phone market.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/toshiba-accounting-idUSL3N1JK1DJ","UPDATE 3-Toshiba willing to talk with spurned Western Digital about chip unit sale","","Jun 23 2017","* Increases net loss, negative shareholder equity estimates(Recasts and writes through with CEO comments)","TOKYO (Reuters) - Toshiba Corp said it was open to talks with Western Digital Corp in their dispute over the sale of the Japanese conglomerate's prized chip unit - an apparent olive branch after it chose another suitor as preferred bidder. The two have been feuding bitterly and Western Digital, which jointly runs Toshiba's main semiconductor plant, has sought a U.S. court injunction to prevent any deal that does not have its consent. The softer tone from Toshiba comes on a day of further indignities as the crisis-wracked conglomerate saw itself demoted to the second section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange and estimated bigger losses for the past financial year. This week it chose a consortium of Bain Capital and Japanese government investors as preferred bidder for the unit, the world's No. 2 producer of NAND flash chips. It wants to clinch a deal, worth some $18 billion, by June 28, the day of its shareholders meeting. Western Digital used to be a good partner, so we want to continue talks. I'm disappointed with the current dispute, Toshiba CEO Satoshi Tsunakawa told a news conference, adding it was important that they joined forces to better compete against bigger rival Samsung Electronics. We want Western Digital to jointly invest to fight against Samsung. It will be so disappointing if we can't do so because of the dispute, he said. Related CoverageToshiba says open to talks with Western Digital over chip unit saleBut in a sign that tensions were still high, Tsunakawa also said Toshiba was not going to be the first to propose the U.S. firm join the consortium and it was still considering whether to block Western Digital employees not based at the plant from accessing joint venture data servers. Tsunakawa also said he did not expect any changes to the make-up of the consortium before June 28. Western Digital's offer had not found favor on price and because the U.S. firm wanted to take control of the unit, he said, adding that he expected executives from Toshiba to still be running operations after the sale. His comments come after sources familiar with matter said earlier this week that the Bain consortium members had made resolving the dispute with Western Digital a condition of their investment. Toshiba Corp CEO Satoshi Tsunakawa bows during a news conference after asking regulators for extension on financial filing and deal on chip unit sale, at the company headquarters in Tokyo, Japan June 23, 2017.Issei KatoRepresentatives for Western Digital were not immediately available to comment.  Hynix Hurdles? South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix Inc is also part of the Bain consortium and its membership has raised concerns that the winning bid may find it difficult to clear anti-trust reviews. Slideshow (4 Images)Its presence has made Western Digital reluctant to join the group in its current form due to worries that high-level technology for NAND chips, which provide long-term data storage, could be leaked to its rival, sources familiar with the matter have said. But Tsunakawa said SK Hynix would not be holding any equity and would not be involved in management - an arrangement that was unlikely to raise regulatory red flags and would prevent leaks of key technology information. SK Hynix, which is relatively weak in NAND flash memory chips, has said it has joined the group because it sees new business opportunities. It will provide half of the 850 billion yen ($7.6 billion) that Bain plans to put up in the form of financing, sources have said. Earlier in the day, Toshiba flagged a net loss of around $9 billion for the year ended in March with negative shareholders' equity of around $5.2 billion, both worse than expected on an increase in liabilities at bankrupt nuclear unit Westinghouse and potential legal damages. With negative shareholder equity confirmed, the Tokyo Stock Exchange said it would move Toshiba's listing to the second section of the bourse from Aug. 1 - the latest in a series of humiliating developments since December for a firm that has been in business for more than 140 years. Toshiba also received regulatory approval to delay filing its annual earnings by more than a month amid a prolonged accounting investigation at Westinghouse. It is the sixth time since 2015 that Toshiba has delayed an earnings filing. Regulators have now given Toshiba until Aug. 10 instead of June 30 to submit the filing. Failure to gain an extension would have put the troubled company's stock exchange listing in further jeopardy, although it still needs to dig itself out of negative shareholders' equity by the end of this financial year to stay listed.

The 63.9-million share offering raised $1.9 billion after being priced at $30 per share, within the expected range of $27 to $31.  That makes it the second-largest U.S. initial public offering this year behind messaging app Snap Inc's (SNAP.N) $3.9 billion offering in March.   Altice USA's IPO is viewed as a means for its founder, Franco-Israeli billionaire Patrick Drahi, to expand his U.S. cable empire by giving the company public stock it can use as currency for new acquisitions. The company, which Netherlands-based Altice NV (ATCA.AS)  put together by acquiring Cablevision Systems and Suddenlink Communications, is the fourth-biggest U.S. cable provider. Shares touched a high of $32.17 before paring gains to $32.00 in midday trading. One hurdle Altice could face is that there are few U.S. cable assets out there to buy. Altice USA's Chief Executive Officer Dexter Goei said in an interview on Thursday that there were no specific targets on his radar.  It's really about being ready for tomorrow, he said. We're not the type of people to be kicking down doors. There needs to be a confluence of minds if something is going to happen. Some analysts have said that Altice could harbor ambitions to one day take on large targets such as privately held Cox Communications, which has long said it does not want to sell. Hopefully, they will consider us as partners if they choose to do it, Goei said. But it's not going to be the driver of the success of our business.  A Cox spokesman said the company has been clear it is not for sale and that it is aggressively investing in its own network, products and strategic partnerships.  Following the IPO, 75.2 percent of the company's shares will be held by its parent, Altice NV, which translates to 98.5 percent of the voting power. Altice USA, which reported a net loss of $76.2 million for the three months ended March 31, expects to use proceeds from the offering to pay down debt of nearly $21 billion. It is the second U.S. cable operator to go public in the last five years. WideOpenWest Inc (WOW.N) raised about $310 million in its IPO last month, which was priced below the expected range.

With a deal expected within days, critics are concerned that Rome is exploiting loopholes to bend EU rules designed to prevent state bailouts. One European official privately admitted to exasperation, after the European Central Bank and European Commission have tussled with Rome for years over how to solve its banks' problems within EU law. On Wednesday, Italy's biggest retail bank Intesa Sanpaolo laid down tough conditions to buy the healthy parts of the two Veneto banks for just 1 euro, a move that would force the state to foot the bulk of the bill. Intesa said it would only take the banks if they were stripped of bad loans and risks, prompting criticism from those who designed the EU regime to stop the state from having to shoulder losses in bank crises, passing them on to investors instead. That solution also contrasts starkly with Santander's recent overnight rescue of a struggling lender in Spain, where it too paid just 1 euro but took on the smaller bank's troubled loans and will raise billions to clean it up. Rome is taking advantage of a flexibility in European rules that permits routine insolvency proceedings for banks not considered systemically important, allowing the process to be handled by the state rather than EU authorities. One EU official said state aid in this case might be technically possible given that banks' shareholders and junior bondholders are also going to take a hit. But critics said Italy was being allowed to cut corners. The Italians do not respect the rules. The ECB and the Commission are too weak to enforce them, said Sven Giegold, a German member of the European Parliament. This is destroying trust. Italy is the last country in the euro zone to get to grips with the problems of its banking sector, meaning it faces stricter 'bail-in' rules - written by Giegold and others and introduced last year - that impose losses chiefly on bondholders and investors. With elections due next year and much of its banks' debt in the hands of ordinary Italians, Rome wants to avoid this step. The signals from Italy are very negative, said Volker Wieland, one of the German government's economic advisors. Wieland accused Italy of looking for exceptions to the rules, warning that such an approach would discourage Germany from supporting any common European protection of deposits, a proposal made to underpin confidence in the region's lenders. The ECB, which supervises Italian banks, and the EU Commission, which rules on whether state support can be allowed, have declined to comment on the Italian proposal, saying they await a formal announcement from Rome. No Hiding Place At home too the tactics in Rome - after more than six years of procrastination through the country's banking crisis - are raising questions. The government had hoped healthier Italian banks would club together to help the lenders, Banca Popolare di Vicenza and Veneto Banca. But most demurred, having already spent billions propping up ailing banks, including through the government-sponsored Atlante fund that pumped 3.4 billion euros into the Veneto banks and is now set to be wiped out. Others had problems of their own, such as Monte dei Paschi, which is being bailed out by the state using another exception to the EU rules. Most banks said the government should stop asking them to chip in, and use instead the 20 billion euros it set aside for bank rescues, negotiating terms with Brussels. Opposition politicians have been critical. Intesa gets a free gift, the state takes on all the bad stuff and the taxpayer pays, said Renato Brunetta, parliamentary leader for former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia (Go Italy!) party, estimating the cost for the Italian state could be 5-6 billion euros. Did we really need to take so much time to come up with such a rubbish solution? Carla Ruocco, a prominent lawmaker of the 5-Star movement, echoed this view: By wasting years, the government put itself in a bind.

Iranian domestic carrier Zagros Airlines signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to buy 20 Airbus (AIR.PA) A320neo jets and eight A330neo aircraft, while privatized Iran Airtour signed an MoU for 45 A320neos. Iran has ordered more than 200 planes since international sanctions against the country were lifted last year in return for curbs on the country's nuclear activities. IranAir has ordered 100 planes from Airbus, 80 from U.S. rival Boeing (BA.N) and 20 ATR turboprops but implementing the deals has been hampered by uncertainty over financing.  Boeing has also signed a deal for 30 737 MAX jets with Iran's Aseman Airlines, which is managed as a private company and owned by Iran's civil service pension foundation. Iran Airtour was established as a subsidiary of IranAir and privatized in 2011 but maintains a status as subsidiary of the national flag carrier, according to CAPA aviation consultancy. Zagros Airlines is a private carrier.  Airbus Chief Operating Officer and planemaking president Fabrice Bregier said he did not believe the deals were related to political issues. The company said the MoUs were contingent upon all necessary approvals, including from the U.S. Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control. Airbus sales chief John Leahy said he expected the U.S. approvals within the next couple of months.  Airbus said it would continue to act in full compliance with the Iran nuclear deal, also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan Of Action, and associated rules.

By mid-afternoon shares had more than halved in value to 116 yen, eroding Takata's market capitalization by about 75 percent from a week ago to nearly $86 million now. Any filing would coincide with a deal for financial backing from U.S. auto parts maker Key Safety Systems Inc. Key is expected to acquire Takata assets as part of a restructuring in bankruptcy, a source told Reuters.         Takata would stop making air-bag inflators after completing a global recall as part of the restructuring plan with Key, separate sources said. Takata plans to begin bankruptcy proceedings in both the United States and Japan, sources have said. Such moves would culminate a long, tumultuous fall for the family-controlled company that grew to become a global supplier to most of the world's major automakers.

Berkshire will also indirectly buy C$400 million of Home Capital's common shares in a private placement through its unit Columbia Insurance Co, Home Capital said on Wednesday. Home Capital's strong assets, its ability to originate and underwrite well-performing mortgages, and its leading position in a growing market sector make this a very attractive investment, said Warren Buffett, Berkshire chairman and CEO.Berkshire will hold an about 38.39 percent equity stake in Home Capital after buying 40 million shares at an average price of about C$10.00 per common share. Berkshire will make an initial investment of C$153.2 million to buy 16 million common shares and an additional investment of C$246.8 million to purchase 24 million shares through a private placement.  Related CoverageShort seller Cohodes keeps Home Capital bet despite Buffett dealThe additional investment is subject to shareholder approval, while the initial investment will not require approval from shareholders. Canada's biggest non-bank lender also said it will continue to explore further asset sales and financing deals over the next year, but has concluded its strategic review process that began in April. This investment from Berkshire not only addresses Home Capital's near-term requirements for additional liquidity and a lower-cost credit agreement, but also facilitates what the Board feels is the best available path to long-term success, Home Capital's Chair Brenda Eprile said. Berkshire will not be granted any rights to nominate directors to Home Capital board or any governance rights as an equity holder, Home Capital said. The C$2 billion loan facility, expected to be effective on June 29, will replace the existing one for a similar amount between Home Trust Company and a major institutional investor. On Tuesday, the company said it would sell a portfolio of commercial mortgage assets valued at C$1.2 billion to bolster its liquidity and trim outstanding debt on a C$2 billion emergency facility it agreed with the Healthcare of Ontario Pension Plan in April.  Last week, Home Capital reached a C$30.5 million settlement with the Ontario Securities Commission, settled a class action lawsuit and accepted responsibility for misleading investors about problems with its mortgage underwriting procedures. The settlement is expected to help secure long-term financing at sustainable interest rates, investors and analysts said.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/uber-ceo-idUSL3N1JI26U","UPDATE 9-Uber CEO Travis Kalanick resigns under investor pressure","","Jun 21 2017","Uber Technologies IncChief Executive Travis Kalanick, co-founder of one ofthe most influential technology companies of its generation,resigned on Tuesday under pressure from investors after a stringof setbacks.","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Uber Technologies Inc Chief Executive Travis Kalanick, co-founder of one of the most influential technology companies of its generation, resigned on Tuesday under pressure from investors after a string of setbacks. Kalanick's departure caps a tumultuous period for the world's largest ride-services company that has revolutionized the taxi industry and challenged transportation regulations worldwide. The resignation sent shockwaves through Silicon Valley and leaves Uber's board of directors with the problem of finding a dynamic leader who also has a steady hand needed to heal Uber after a bruising six months. The person who still best personifies Uber's potential is the person who left Tuesday night, said Bradley Tusk, an Uber investor and adviser. But it's not like he really could stay without it being brutally bad for the company. Kalanick's pugnacious style largely defined Uber's approach and helped it become a transportation colossus valued at $68 billion, the largest private firm backed by venture capitalists in the world.  But that brashness has also been blamed for a string of scandals this year, from the unearthing of a culture of sexism and bullying at Uber to a U.S. Department of Justice federal investigation and a high-stakes lawsuit filed by Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) autonomous car division, Waymo, that threatens Uber's self-driving car ambitions. I love Uber more than anything in the world and at this difficult moment in my personal life I have accepted the investors' request to step aside so that Uber can go back to building rather than be distracted with another fight, Kalanick said in an email to employees that was seen by Reuters. Kalanick's departure as CEO widens an already gaping hole at the top of Uber which has no chief financial officer, head of engineering or general counsel at the moment. For now, 14 people who reported to Kalanick are running Uber. It is not clear who will be Uber's new CEO, but the next leader will likely be tasked with making the company profitable and paving the way to an initial public offering, said executive recruiters. They need someone who is willing to walk into this mess, and be the single adult in this room for awhile until the rest of the executive team is in place, said Steve Nilsen, a partner at executive search firm Boyden. The pursuit of a CEO puts the more than three-months-old search for a chief operating officer on hold, according to a source close to the board. The CEO must be hired first, the person said, and he or she will be key to figuring out the remaining positions to fill. Uber declined comment.  Facebook Inc (FB.O) Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg has been identified as a target in media reports, but a source close to Sandberg told Reuters she plans to stay at the online social media company. Toxic Culture Kalanick, who will remain on Uber's board, will likely have some sway over the new CEO. He still wields significant power in the board room, made possible by a dual-class share structure that gives him and key allies 10 votes per share.  Ultimately, it was some of Uber's main investors who forced Kalanick out, according to a source familiar with the matter. Venture capital firm Benchmark, whose partner Bill Gurley is one of Uber's largest shareholders, plus investors First Round Capital, Lowercase Capital, Menlo Ventures and Fidelity Investments, all pressed Kalanick to quit. A source close to Menlo Ventures, which led one of Uber's early financing rounds, told Reuters that the firm helped write a letter calling for Kalanick to step down. The investors delivered the letter to Kalanick while he was in Chicago, the New York Times reported, citing people with knowledge of the situation. (nyti.ms/2soTB79) FILE PHOTO - Uber CEO Travis Kalanick attends the summer World Economic Forum in Tianjin, China, June 26, 2016.Shu Zhang/File PhotoKalanick's decision was a surprise to everyone, a second Uber spokesman said. In a statement sent to Reuters, the Uber board of directors said Kalanick's resignation gives the company room to fully embrace this new chapter in Uber's history. Gurley on Wednesday resigned from his influential board seat, a Benchmark spokeswoman said, signaling the departure of one of Kalanick's closest confidants. He will be replaced by Benchmark general partner Matt Cohler. The board got a second new member on Wednesday in David Trujillo of TPG Capital, an Uber investor, according to a source familiar with the matter. Trujillo replaces David Bonderman, a co-founder of TPG who resigned from the board last week after making a sexist remark during an all-staff meeting called to discuss the results of an investigation into sexual harassment and discrimination at Uber.  U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder led that investigation, which concluded that Kalanick's authority should be reduced and that board oversight and independence should increase. Uber hired Holder's firm Covington and Burling to look into its culture and workplace practices after a female former employee, Susan Fowler, publicly accused the company of sexual harassment. In addition, Uber fired 20 employees for incidents involving discrimination, sexual harassment and other bad behavior earlier this month. Slideshow (3 Images)Uber is the very definition of a toxic leadership culture and Kalanick set the tone, said Jason Hanold, chief executive officer and managing partner at human resources executive recruitment firm Hanold Associates. Sweeping Power Following the release of the Covington report, Kalanick said last week he would take a leave of absence to grieve for his mother, who died recently in a boating accident that also seriously injured his father, and to work on his leadership skills. Uber couldn't make a credible claim that it was committed to the changes it has to make if he was hovering in the wings, waiting to return as CEO, said Erik Gordon, a technology and entrepreneurship expert at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business. Kalanick and other executives were also criticized for the handling of a crisis in India after an Uber driver was arrested for raping a passenger. Though the driver was convicted in 2015, Kalanick and other executives became convinced the crime was a set up by a local rival, former employees said.  Eric Alexander, the head of Asian business for Uber, shared medical records internally, including with Kalanick. Alexander argued they showed the woman had been assaulted but not raped, people who spoke to him said. Alexander was fired earlier this month.  Even some of Kalanick's staunchest allies have found fault with how Uber has been run. In a blog post on Medium published on Tuesday, Uber co-founder Garrett Camp, who has long aligned himself with Kalanick, called Uber's problems serious. Over the years we have neglected parts of our culture as we have focused on growth. We have failed to build some of the systems that every company needs to scale successfully, Camp wrote. In March, following the start of the Holder investigation, Uber director Arianna Huffington said on a call with reporters the board had full confidence in Kalanick. She repeated that position on Friday in an interview with Reuters by saying Kalanick's leave of absence was solely his decision. Benchmark's Gurley praised the CEO on Twitter following his resignation. There will be many pages in the history books devoted to @travisk - very few entrepreneurs have had such a lasting impact on the world, Gurley wrote.

Copersucar, a cooperative formed by more than 20 sugar and ethanol companies in Brazil, ended the 2016/17 cane crop year with total revenues of 28.3 billion reais, 7.6 percent more than in the previous season. We had a small fall on cane crushing volume, but better prices for sugar and ethanol on average in the crop, which boosted margins, said the company in the earnings report. Associated Copersucar mills in Brazil crushed 87 million tonnes of cane in the crop ended in March, 2.5 percent less than in the previous season. Copersucar sold 5.3 million tonnes of sugar, 3.6 percent less than in 2015/16, and 4.2 billion liters of ethanol, 16 percent less. But the company said larger selling volumes in its wholly-owned subsidiary Eco-Energy Biofuels in the United States and in the 50-50 joint venture with Cargill [CARG.UL], the world's largest sugar trader Alvean, helped its results. It said Alvean traded 12.1 million tonnes of sugar in the period, 5.2 percent more than in the previous crop year, giving the joint venture a 26 percent share of the global raw sugar trade. Copersucar Chief Executive Officer Paulo Roberto Souza told reporters during a conference call that Alvean reported better margins last year, taking advantage of a volatile market for raw sugar. Alvean benefited from cash and carry. They used our warehouses for that strategy, said Souza, saying higher volatility usually improves margins for traders such as Alvean. He said the joint venture boosted sugar sourcing in Brazil by doing business with independent mills. Souza believes it could well grow another 4 or 5 percentage points in volumes in the new crop.      Copersucar said its ethanol subsidiary Eco-Energy increased sales in the U.S. by 4.5 percent in 2016/17, to 9.2 billion liters. They gained share in a consolidated market, so they gained market from competitors, Souza said. Copersucar estimates its subsidiary holds now a 16-percent share of the American market. Souza said Eco-Energy is in talks with ethanol producers in the U.S. to have access to new supplies of the biofuel, as a way to further expand in that market.

Indian motorcycle maker Bajaj Auto (BAJA.NS) and several buyout funds are also preparing bids for Ducati, which is being put up for sale by German carmaker Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE). A deal with Harley-Davidson would bring together the maker of touring bikes like the Electra Glide that are symbolic of America with a leading European maker whose high-performance bikes have a distinguished racing heritage. Milwaukee-based Harley-Davidson has hired Goldman Sachs to work on the deal, one source familiar with the matter said, adding tentative bids were expected in July. Volkswagen, whose Audi division controls Ducati – maker of the iconic Monster motorbike – is working with investment boutique Evercore on the sale which will help it fund a strategic overhaul following its emissions scandal. Based in the northern Italian city of Bologna, Ducati was on the wish list of private equity funds KKR (KKR.N), Bain Capital and Permira, which are all working on the deal, said the sources who declined to be identified as the process is private. Ducati was launched in 1926 as a maker of vacuum tubes and radio components and its Bologna factory remained open in World War Two despite being the target of several bombings.  Ducati racers have won the Superbike world championship 14 times, with Carl Fogarty and Troy Bayliss its most successful riders. Harley-Davidson, which commands about half the U.S. big-bike market, was founded in Milwaukee, Wisconsin at the start of the last century and was one of two major American motorcycle manufacturers to survive the great depression. Demand for Harley's motorcycles continues to be slow as its loyal baby boomer demographic ages and rivals such as the Indian brand bike maker Polaris Industries Inc (PII.N) and Japan's Honda Motor Co Ltd (7267.T) offer discounts. Volkswagen's powerful labor unions, which control half the seats on the carmaker's 20-strong supervisory board, repeated their opposition to selling the Italian motorcycle maker. Ducati is a jewel, the sale of which is not supported by the labor representatives on Volkswagen's supervisory board, a spokesman for VW group's works council said in an email. Harley-Davidson is miles behind Ducati in technology terms, he added. Bidding Field Evercore has sent out information packages to a number of potential suitors including Ducati's previous owner Investindustrial, sources with knowledge of the matter said. A Harley-Davidson bike is displayed in their head office in Singapore October 13, 2016.Edgar SuInvestindustrial bought a stake in Ducati before the financial crisis, subsequently taking control of the business before selling it to Audi in 2012. It is now looking to compete with heavyweight private equity firms and large industry players to regain control.  Volkswagen, Audi, Harley-Davidson, KKR and Bain Capital declined to comment. Bajaj, Investindustrial and Permira were not immediately available. Volkswagen, Europe's largest carmaker, is seeking to move beyond an emissions-cheating scandal that has tarnished its image and left it facing billions of euros in fines and settlements. A successful deal for Ducati, which last year reported revenues of 593 million euros, would show Volkswagen boss Matthias Mueller is serious about reversing his predecessor's quest for size. The logo of Italian motorcycle manufacturer Ducati is seen at a motocycle dealer in Dietlikon, Switzerland October 11, 2016.Arnd WiegmannVolkswagen said last June it would review its portfolio of assets and brands, rekindling speculation among analysts that non-core businesses could be put up for sale. Volkswagen hopes to raise between 1.4 billion and 1.5 billion euros from the sale of Ducati, valuing it at 14-15 times its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of about 100 million euros, the sources said. The German car maker wants a valuation that reflects trading multiples of similar trophy assets in the automotive industry, such as Italian car maker Ferrari (RACE.MI) which trades at almost 30 times its forward earnings. Yet it may need to compromise on price as some of the bidders would struggle to pay as much as 1.5 billion euros for Ducati, several sources said. Price expectations have already proved challenging for some industry players who recently decided against bidding. Indian motorcycle firm Hero MotoCorp (HROM.NS) and its rival TVS Motor Company (TVSM.NS) initially expressed interest in Ducati but were put off by its price tag and decided to walk away, the sources said. German car marker BMW (BMWG.DE) and Japanese motorcycle makers Honda (7267.T) and Suzuki (7269.T) have also decided against bidding for Ducati, sources close to the companies told Reuters. A BMW spokesman confirmed the German firm was not interested in Ducati, while Hero and TVS were not immediately available for comment. Another source close to Volkswagen said the sale of Ducati might not be finalised before the annual EICMA motorcycle show in Milan in mid-November as Volkswagen wanted to find the right buyer and the sales process might take time.

Cordani, speaking during the company's first meeting with investors since its deal to be bought by Anthem Inc (ANTM.N) officially broke off last month, also said the company would do at least $2 billion in share buybacks this year and set a target of $16 in earnings per share for 2021.  He said M&A; areas that the No. 5 health insurer is considering also include growing internationally and building out its pharmacy and physician-related businesses, its retail capabilities and its government risk-based insurance programs. Cigna has a pharmacy management business that it is looking to expand both internally and through acquisitions, Cordani said.  But the most attention regarding Cigna's M&A; prospects on Wednesday was around rival Humana Inc (HUM.N), where Medicare Advantage accounts for two-thirds of revenue. Several Wall Street analysts have recently written research notes about the merits of Cigna buying Humana, a deal they said had been under consideration before the Anthem deal was made two years ago. When an investor asked if Cigna was as interested now in building its Medicare Advantage business as it was two years ago, Cordani confirmed that was the case. In an interview, Cordani declined to discuss the possibility that the company is interested in buying Humana or give a size or timing for any acquisitions.  We tend not to get too fixated on the headlines, Cordani said. The company considers deals based on if they create value for shareholders and moves ahead if they do, he said. Shares of Cigna were up 0.2 percent and Humana gained 1.2 percent in afternoon trading. Obamacare Individual Markets Cordani said Cigna has filed premium rates to stay in the same seven states where it now offers Obamacare individual plans for 2018, but that the company is waiting to make a final decision about its participation.  Republicans and U.S. President Donald Trump have pledged to repeal the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Insurers deciding about participation must submit rates to HealthCare.gov by the end of Wednesday, but can withdraw as late as September. Cigna's decision depends on new government rules or regulations for insurance or legislation, including whether the government will continue to fund the cost-sharing subsidies that affect individuals' out-of-pocket payments, it said.

The committee nonetheless approved 11 billion euros of purchases for the armed forces, including five corvette warships for two billion euros. The Defence Ministry had warned against delays, saying the purchases were urgently needed to modernize an army weakened by years of spending cuts. Christine Lambrecht, a lawmaker from the center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD), had earlier said that the budget committee would delay a decision on the whole funding package as her party needed more time for consultations. Defence minister Ursula von der Leyen is eager to get the requests approved before a Sept. 24 general election as delays could further hobble a military trying to rebuild after years of post-Cold War cuts and prepare for added responsibilities. The SPD are junior coalition partners of Chancellor Angela Merkel's CDU and their Bavaria-based sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU). After the postponement, Von der Leyen told ARD television that the procurement of the Israeli drones, favored by the military because they are compatible with models they already own, was still under discussion. Some SPD lawmakers have reservations about leasing Heron TP drones from Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) which can be armed and used to protect soldiers serving in Afghanistan and Mali. The higher court in Duesseldorf in May dismissed a legal challenge by U.S. weapons maker General Atomics to Germany's plans to lease the drones from rival IAI. But the court this month said it had put the deal on hold again as it considers a complaint by General Atomics against its decision. Some SPD lawmakers want the budget committee to delay a decision on the deal until a final court decision.  Germany already has three earlier versions of the Heron reconnaissance drone which are deployed in Afghanistan. They are maintained by Airbus and cannot be armed. Germany is supposed to be taking on added responsibilities within NATO and the European Union. The army is also facing a probe into right-wing radicalism in its ranks.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/mideast-stocks-idUSL8N1JI3LA","MIDEAST STOCKS-Saudi cheers new crown prince, MSCI news; oil price hits rest of Gulf","","Jun 21 2017","* Mohammed bin Salman's rise boosts confidence in economicreforms","* Saudi posts biggest single-day gain since August 2015 * Mohammed bin Salman's rise boosts confidence in economic reforms * Banks, property developers are top gainers * MSCI news lifts Almarai to all-time high * Other bourses focus on Brent below $46 a barrel By Celine Aswad and Andrew Torchia DUBAI, June 21 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's stock market jumped over 5 percent on Wednesday after the architect of the kingdom's economic reforms was appointed crown prince and index compiler MSCI said it would consider upgrading Riyadh to emerging market status. The stock index surged 5.5 percent, its largest single-day rise since August 2015, to 7,335 points, its highest level since December 2015. Trading volume was the largest this year. Fund managers said the appointment of Prince Mohammed bin Salman, previously deputy crown prince, to be first in line for the throne was not unexpected, but came sooner than anticipated. He has been the catalyst for radical reforms to reduce Saudi Arabia's dependence on oil exports, ranging from a plan to sell a stake in national oil giant Saudi Aramco and dozens of other institutions and reinvest the money in non-oil industries, to tough austerity plans to eliminate a huge budget deficit. For the first time in two years, investors will feel reassured that the economic reform plan Vision 2030 will not be scrapped, said Ayham Kamel, director of the Middle East and North Africa at consultancy Eurasia Group. As defence minister Prince Mohammed has overseen the war in Yemen and taken a tough line towards Iran, so some analysts fear his promotion could raise geopolitical tensions. But investors were not focusing on geopolitics on Wednesday. National Commercial Bank, the biggest listed lender which is expected to help arrange the privatisation programme and play a major role in funding some of the new non-oil industries, soared 10 percent. Mining company Ma'den jumped 9.7 percent. Mining is a key sector in Prince Mohammed's plans to cut the kingdom's reliance on oil. Real estate developers were also strong, especially those that are working with the government on projects. Emaar the Economic City, which is developing an industrial city near Jeddah, shot up 10.2 percent. To mark Prince Mohammed's promotion, the government said it was restoring financial allowances to civil servants retroactively to last September. This did not appear to involve a lot of money - Mazen al-Sudairi, head of research at Al Rajhi Capital, estimated 8 or 9 billion riyals ($2.1 billion to $2.4 billion) - but it lifted investor sentiment. The market was also buoyed by news that index compiler MSCI would, as expected, start to consider whether to upgrade Saudi Arabia to emerging market status. An upgrade would probably take effect in 2019, eventually attracting tens of billions of dollars of fresh foreign money. Iyad Ghulam, senior equities analyst at NCB Capital, said the MSCI news might give the market support for the medium term. We expect the market to rise 20 to 30 percent from the day of the MSCI announcement on putting Saudi on the short list until the decision date in June 2018, Ghulam said. Food maker Almarai jumped 9.1 percent to close at 90.00 riyals on Wednesday; it hit an all time intra-day high of 90.70 riyals. EFG Hermes predicts Almarai would see up to $405 million of passive fund inflows from an MSCI upgrade, plus up to $183 million if FTSE decides this September to upgrade Saudi Arabia. Oil Elsewhere in the Gulf, Brent oil's fall to below $46 a barrel - to levels not seen since November, before global oil producers agreed to cut output to prop up prices - hurt stock markets. While not disastrous for countries that have embarked on austerity programmes, it could mean governments have less room to boost spending this year than hoped. Dubai's index lost 1.0 percent as Dubai Financial Market, the only listed exchange in the Gulf, fell 3.4 percent. The Abu Dhabi index closed near flat. In Qatar, the index sank for a fourth consecutive day to its lowest close in 17 months. Petrochemical producer Industries Qatar fell 2.7 percent. The index has shed 11.6 percent since June 5, when Saudi Arabia and three other Arab states cut diplomatic and trade links with Doha. Highlights Saudi Arabia * The index surged 5.5 percent to 7,335 points. Dubai * The index lost 1.0 percent to 3,418 points. Abu Dhabi * The index edged up 0.1 percent to 4,459 points.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/amazon-bridge-idUSL1N1JI0KV","LPC: Amazon bridge loan heats up lukewarm M&A; financing","","Jun 21 2017","A bridge loan for up toUS$13.7bn to back Amazon.com’s purchase of upscale grocer WholeFoods Markets, which is the second-largest US bridge this year,is stoking merger-related financing that has been stifled byprolonged uncertainty about the Trump administration’s policies.","NEW YORK, June 21 (Reuters) - A bridge loan for up to US$13.7bn to back Amazon.com’s purchase of upscale grocer Whole Foods Markets, which is the second-largest US bridge this year, is stoking merger-related financing that has been stifled by prolonged uncertainty about the Trump administration’s policies. Even with Amazon’s 364-day loan, which is also the thirteenth largest in the past two decades, US bridge financing of about US$57bn this year is 21% lower than the same period last year, including deals closed and in process, according to Thomson Reuters LPC. As a result, fee income for banks arranging and syndicating the bridge facilities and longer-term funding is being squeezed. Bridges are usually replaced with permanent financing, including equity and bonds. “Everyone is hoping that Amazon/Whole Foods is the start of the next wave, but there’s no telling if that’s the case or if there won’t be anything else big until there’s more clarity around tax policy etc,” a senior banker said. Amazon.com said it expects to fund its US$13.7bn merger with debt that could include senior unsecured notes, term loans, bridge loans, or any combination, along with cash on hand. The Whole Foods acquisition, which according to Thomson Reuters ranks as the eleventh biggest global retail deal and the fourth biggest US retail deal on record, will help boost fee income for lenders at the tail end of a tough first half. Bridge financing so far this year roughly matches volume in the same period of 2015, and is the lowest since about US$31bn four years ago. Earlier this year, several high-profile insurance company mergers were scuttled by US antitrust rulings, and the lack of action on tax, trade and healthcare legislation is stifling the pace of new M&A;, bankers noted. Faster Takeout Some of this year’s borrowers are replacing bridges more quickly with permanent financing, expecting little regulatory scrutiny or opposition to their M&A; deals, several bankers and analysts said. At the same time, companies are taking advantage of ongoing lofty investor demand for bonds and other debt, and looking to lock in still low borrowing costs. “Given the robustness of the capital markets, and given the current situation with a lot of borrowers not having significant antitrust issues, borrowers have elected to hit the bond market immediately versus waiting a couple of months,” another banker said. “They feel good about closing their acquisitions, and there’s a quick takeout of the bridge. The swifter pace of swapping from a bridge to bonds, as well as the reduced overall loan volume, is weighing on total fees earned by lending banks. Fee income from providing bridge loans is US$109m so far this year, a 47% slump from the same time last year, according to a Freeman Consulting Services analysis based on LPC data. The fees earned from arranging permanent financing on those loans have also declined, although more modestly, by around 21% to US$172m. US medical supplier Becton Dickinson’s US$15.7bn bridge loan to buy medical technology company C R Bard, this year’s largest US bridge financing, is an example of the quicker turnaround to longer-term debt. “The Becton Dickinson bond offering closed less than a month after the acquisition was announced and the bridge was arranged,” said Jeff Nassof, a director at Freeman. “In cases like this, bridge loan fees are likely to be relatively low. This trend is a primary reason why bridge loan fees have declined at a sharper pace than volumes in the last year.” (Reporting by Lynn Adler; Editing By Chris Mangham and Jon Methven)"

BMC's bid for CA, which has a market capitalization of more than $13 billion, would require a large financing package and equity financing from BMC's private equity owners, Bain Capital and Golden Gate Capital, the source said on Tuesday.

Bain Capital and Golden Gate declined to comment.  CA shares rose 14.8 percent to $36.24 in after-hours trading  after Bloomberg News reported that BMC and CA are in early-stage talks about a potential merger.  CA, formerly known as Computer Associates, has its roots in providing mainframe computers used by large institutions like banks. It has been trying to shift its business to the cloud, and announced in March that it was acquiring application security firm Veracode for $614 million. BMC, which provides software that helps corporations organize their tech support functions, was taken private for $6.9 billion in 2013 by Golden Gate and Bain Capital, after pressure from activist hedge fund Elliott Management Corp.

But prospects for a clean early resolution to the sale of the world's No. 2 producer of NAND flash chips remain unclear as Western Digital (WDC.O), Toshiba's chips business partner, has launched legal action to prevent a deal without its consent. The consortium has offered around 2 trillion yen, a Toshiba spokesman said. Bain plans to be the biggest investor, providing 850 billion yen ($7.7 billion) in equity, three sources briefed on the matter said. The bid was less than a rival 2.2 trillion yen offer from U.S. chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO.O) and its partner U.S. private equity firm Silver Lake. It was also hastily put together but has the implicit stamp of approval from the Japanese government which is keen to keep key semiconductor technology under domestic control. Toshiba cannot afford to ignore the government because it needs its help with plans including the decommissioning of domestic nuclear power plants and as overseas nuclear power projects are currently in limbo after the bankruptcy of its U.S. nuclear unit. Some analysts believe that talks over the hotly contested deal have become so complex that only a government-orchestrated  solution is viable, but others doubt that the group will provide the necessary leadership the chip unit needs. There are many parties involved in this consortium, said  Atsushi Osanai, a professor at Waseda University Business School. Related CoverageBain to be biggest investor in Toshiba chip unit, putting up $7.7 billion: sourcesJapan trade ministry asks Western Digital to join Japan Government-Bain consortium for Toshiba chip unit: sourcesIt has undergone so many twists and turns during its formation process, that I'm skeptical about whether it can promptly make bold decisions. In that sense, Broadcom or Foxconn would be better suited. Toshiba said in a statement it took into consideration concern about technology transfers, job security for its domestic workforce and prospects of clearing regulatory reviews in its decision. While Bain will be the biggest investor, it will obtain around half the amount in financing from South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix Inc (000660.KS), the sources said, declining to be identified due to the sensitivity of the negotiations. A state-backed fund, the Innovation Network Corp of Japan and the Development Bank of Japan (DBJ) will each provide 300 billion yen in equity, while the core banking unit of the Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc (8306.T) will provide 550 billion yen in financing. FILE PHOTO - A logo of Toshiba Corp is seen on a printed circuit board in this photo illustration taken in Tokyo July 31, 2012.Yuriko Nakao/File PhotoThe numbers have yet to be finalised and are still subject to change, one of the sources said.   A representative for DBJ was not immediately available to comment. All other members of the consortium as well as Toshiba declined to comment on the details of the deal. In a Hurry  Toshiba is rushing to clinch an agreement by June 28, the day of its annual shareholders meeting. It needs to sell the unit to cover billions of dollars in cost overruns at its Westinghouse nuclear unit and to dig itself out negative shareholders' equity that could lead to a delisting. Following the announcement, Western Digital, which jointly operates Toshiba's main chip plant, reasserted in a statement that Toshiba was in breach of their joint venture contracts and said that a U.S. court hearing on its request for an injunction was scheduled for July 14. Japan's trade ministry, which has arranged much of the winning bid, is in talks with Western Digital, trying to persuade it to join the consortium, two separate sources familiar with the matter said. But Western Digital is reluctant to join the group in its current form due to worries that high-level technology for NAND chips, which provide long-term data storage, could be leaked to rival SK Hynix, they added. SK Hynix said it had joined the consortium because it sees new business opportunities with the deal. Although the South Korean chip maker is strong in DRAM chips, which help electronic devices perform multiple tasks at once, it is relatively weak in NAND.  Suitors that lost out refrained from comment on Wednesday. A representative for Broadcom did not respond to requests for comment. Silver Lake declined to comment. Foxconn, the world's largest contract electronics maker which also bid, did not respond to requests for comment. Formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry (2317.TW), the Taiwanese firm's consortium includes Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and computing giant Dell Inc. Toshiba's shares ended 2 percent lower. They are down about 30 percent since problems at Westinghouse surfaced late last year but have come some way off lows as talks about the chip unit sale progressed.

The deepwater SNE project is being closely watched as it would be the first oil development in the West African nation, in an offshore area that has recently attracted oil giants BP Plc, Total SA and China's CNOOC Ltd. Woodside, Australia's biggest independent oil and gas producer, said in a statement that FAR had apparently initiated arbitration proceedings. That came after FAR said on Tuesday that it had made a request to the International Chamber of Commerce in Paris to start arbitration. The project was due to start production as early as 2021, but has faced delays due to the ongoing ownership dispute between the two Australian energy companies. Woodside bought a 35-percent stake in the oil project last year from U.S. energy major ConocoPhillips and as part of the deal was due to become the operator later this year. Woodside said earlier this month that minority stakeholder FAR Ltd had advised that it would not support arrangements for Woodside to take over as operator. FAR contends that it should have had pre-emptive rights over the ConocoPhillips stake, which was sold for what was considered a cheap price of $350 million, and had said the Senegalese government was yet to approve the deal. However, Woodside said in its statement on Wednesday that Senegal's energy minister had issued an order confirming the company's participation in the project.

JDE executives said during a presentation of new products in Sao Paulo that the company was banking on higher quality products in the world's second largest coffee market to increase revenues and market share.  JDE has bought up a string of coffee and tea firms, establishing its position as a key player in the global retail business. It was created in 2015 when its controlling holding company, JAB  Holdings BV, bought Mondelez International Inc's coffee operations in a cash and stock deal.   The company has since acquired some of the best-known brands in Brazil, such as Café do Ponto, Pilão and Café Pelé.   We want to be a leader in Brazil. We continue to look for opportunities, Lara Barns, head of JDE local unit, told reporters after presenting a new set of products aimed at the premium coffee market in Brazil, as the firm bets on higher value-added items to boost revenues. JDE has around 20 percent of the local coffee retail market, behind leader Três Corações, a 50-50 joint venture between Israeli holding company Strauss Group Ltd and Brazilian family-owned firm São Miguel. Três Corações has 24 percent of share.   Brazil accounts for 20 percent of JDE global sales volumes, but only 10 percent of total revenues of 5 billion euros in 2016, said Barns, pointing to lower prices. That is thanks to abundant supply in Brazil, the world's largest producer, but is also due to a profusion of lower quality brands which make up most of the market, Barns said. But the premium coffee segment is the one that grows the most in Brazil. That is our bet, she added. According to Euromonitor, Nestle has 22 percent of the global coffee retail market. JDE has 9.5 percent, a share that could go up to 12 percent considering businesses from U.S.-based Keurig Green Mountain, acquired by JAB Holdings two years ago in a deal valued at $13.9 billion.

JBS, whose controlling shareholder recently agreed to pay a massive leniency fine after becoming embroiled in sweeping graft probes that have ensnared politicians and executives, said in a securities filing that its board and state development bank BNDES still had to approve the planned asset sales. The sales, which aim to raise 6 billion reais ($1.8 billion), include a 19.2 percent stake in Brazil-based dairy company Vigor Alimentos SA, along with its Northern Ireland unit Moy Park Ltd and Five Rivers Cattle Feeding in North America. The largest asset on the block is Moy Park, which JBS bought from Brazilian rival Marfrig Global Foods SA two years ago for $1.5 billion. Moy Park supplies 25 percent of chicken consumed in western Europe, according to its website. It is one of Britain's top 10 food companies, with 13 processing and manufacturing units in Northern Ireland, England, France, the Netherlands and Ireland. Five Rivers, the biggest U.S. cattle feeding operation, has a combined capacity of more than 980,000 head of cattle and locations in Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, Arizona, and Idaho, according to its website. It handles nearly 10 percent of cattle placed annually on U.S. feedlots, according to the Livestock Marketing Information Center. Five Rivers also manages a 75,000-head capacity feedyard in the Canadian province of Alberta. Just two weeks ago, JBS said core U.S. assets were not for sale. JBS bought Five Rivers from Smithfield Foods Inc [SFII.UL], the world's biggest pork producer, in 2008, along with other beef assets. Smithfield is now interested in getting back into the U.S. beef business, as well as poultry, its owner China-based WH Group Ltd told Reuters earlier this month. Smithfield declined to comment on Tuesday when asked if it was interested in the Five Rivers assets. Cargill Inc [CARG.UL], another major U.S. beef processor, also recently exited the cattle feeding business. Concerns that JBS might sell cattle slaughter operations, which could have cut into demand for feeder cattle, pushed U.S. feeder cattle futures to nearly a two-month low of 140.775 cents per pound after the JBS announcement. They later rebounded to trade down 0.075 cent at 144.925 cents. Originally, we were unsure if a packer would have to close a plant or something like that. This is just divesting itself from a feeding unit that someone else could buy and operate, said David Hales, a U.S. cattle analyst. JBS shares were down 4.4 percent at 6.07 reais in afternoon trading in Sao Paulo as the benchmark Ibovespa index fell around 2 percent. JBS has yet to hire an investment bank to sound out potential bidders, a person with direct knowledge of the company's strategy told Reuters, asking for anonymity to discuss the matter freely.  A sale of Vigor, which is majority-controlled by JBS' parent, J&F; Investimentos SA, has already been entrusted to two investment banks, Reuters reported last month. They have contacted French dairy producers Danone SA and Groupe Lactalis SA, Mexico's Grupo Lala SAB de CV and Switzerland's Emmi AG to analyze the business. JBS has a minority stake in Vigor.

The world's largest brewer, which owns the Budweiser and Stella Artois brands, has sent out first information packages to prospective bidders and has asked for first bids before the summer break, the people said. The brands, which are only sold in Germany but have high profit margins, could fetch several hundred million euros, according to the sources, who declined to be identified. They said AB InBev was working with Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) on the sale, which would follow its divestiture of SABMiller's European brands, including Peroni, Grolsch and Pilsner Urquell, to Japan's Asahi (2502.T). An AB InBev spokesman confirmed the company was considering the future of the German brands, saying it continuously reviews its portfolio.  We are having discussions regarding the future development of the Diebels and Hasseroeder brands along with their two associated breweries with a limited number of investors that would be able to implement a more focused strategy for these brands, the spokesman said in an email. It is very early days and we have nothing further to share at this stage. Deutsche Bank declined to comment. Hasseroeder and Diebels have combined sales of about 140 million euros, the sources said. One source estimated they would fetch around 200 million euros, though another said it could be much more than that, based on profit margins north of 35 percent. That would result in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of roughly 50 million euros.   Asahi paid around 15 times EBITDA for the European brands it bought from AB InBev, though the German brands are not expected to garner that high a multiple given that they are local brands in a tough market, rather than international.  Several sources predicted that the most interested buyers would be those that already have a presence in Germany. German brewers such as Bitburger or Radeberger are expected to express interest in Hasseroeder, one of the best-selling brands in eastern Germany, as well as for Diebels, which is famous for its top-fermented dark Altbier, drunk mainly in Duesseldorf and some neighboring cities.      The German beer market has grown increasingly competitive in recent years as consumer habits change and consumption slows, putting pressure on sales and profits.

Proceeds from the sale will bolster its liquidity and trim outstanding debt on a C$2 billion emergency facility it agreed with the Healthcare of Ontario Pension Plan (HOOPP) in April. The expensive bridge financing of C$2 billion provided by HOOPP came with an effective interest rate of 22.5 percent on the first C$1 billion drawn down. That affected the company's ability to originate new mortgages since it could not afford to lend money at lower rates than its cost of borrowing. Proceeds from the transaction are expected to have an immediate impact by enabling us to enhance our liquidity and reduce the outstanding debt under the company's $2 billion credit facility, said Interim Chief Executive Bonita Then.  Home Capital said KingSett had agreed to purchase the portfolio for 99.61 percent of its outstanding value, less a share of future losses on the loans. It expects to receive an initial cash payment of C$1.16 billion in the third quarter, equivalent to 97 percent of the value the mortgages. The balance of the payment will depend upon the level of any future losses. Shares of Home Capital rose as much as 6.8 percent on Tuesday and were trading up 4.2 percent at 1325 EST. We view the terms of this sale favorably and supportive of the high quality of Home Capital's mortgage book, said Raymond James analyst Brenna Phelan.  Home Capital said in April it was pursuing new financing and strategic options, including the possible sale of some assets. Depositors have withdrawn 95 percent of funds from Home Capital's high interest savings accounts since March 27, when the company terminated the employment of former Chief Executive Martin Reid.  The withdrawals accelerated after April 19, when the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC), Canada's biggest securities regulator, accused Home Capital of making misleading statements to investors about its mortgage underwriting business. Home Capital said last week it agreed a settlement with the OSC and accepted responsibility for misleading investors about problems with its mortgage underwriting procedures. The company still faces significant hurdles, including securing new long-term funding, finding a permanent chief executive, rebuilding relationships with brokers, and winning back the support of depositors and borrowers.

The consortium, whose bid clears Toshiba's 2 trillion yen  ($18 billion) minimum, has been seen as one of the strongest suitors for the unit - the world's No. 2 producer of NAND chips - as it would automatically have the government's stamp of approval, other sources have told Reuters. Toshiba needs to sell the prized chips unit to cover billions of dollars of losses from its now-bankrupt U.S. nuclear unit. The three-country group has been fighting to counter a 2.2 trillion yen offer from U.S. chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO.O) and its partner, U.S. private equity firm Silver Lake, which sources have said Toshiba management favors. The group includes the state-backed fund Innovation Network Corp of Japan, the government's Development Bank of Japan, and U.S. private equity firm Bain Capital. South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix Inc (000660.KS) and the core banking unit of the Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc (8306.T) are to provide financing under the consortium's proposal, sources have said.  Another person with direct knowledge of the matter said Toshiba's board will vote on a preferred bidder on Wednesday and announce the result through the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Related CoverageToshiba to decide on sale of its chips business to government-led consortium: NHKA Toshiba spokeswoman said the company cannot comment on specifics of the sale process. The Japan-U.S.-Korea bid has been orchestrated in large part by Japan's trade ministry, which wants to keep the valuable chip unit under domestic control. But Toshiba wants to complete the deal as quickly as possible to help cover massive cost overruns at its Westinghouse Electric Co nuclear unit, which went bankrupt in March, and to dig itself out negative shareholders' equity that could lead to a delisting. The conglomerate wants to reach a definitive agreement on a buyer by its June 28 annual shareholders meeting. The consortium had told Toshiba it needs to resolve a legal dispute with Toshiba's U.S. chip-venture partner Western Digital Corp (WDC.O) before it will invest in the firm's chip unit, sources briefed on the matter said before the decision. Western Digital has sought a U.S. court injunction to prevent its partner from selling the chip business without the U.S. firm's consent. Chief Executive Steve Milligan said this month that Toshiba was violating contractual rights and had left the U.S. firm no choice but to pursue legal action. A condition that Western Digital, which has proposed its own bid, essentially drop its legal action could pave the way for the California-based firm to join the government-led consortium. The ball is now in Western Digital's court, a source said. But Western Digital is reluctant to join the group in its current form due to worries that sensitive technologies belonging to its joint venture with Toshiba could be leaked to rival SK Hynix, sources said. It regards their technology in NAND semiconductors, which provide long-term data storage, as on par with that of industry leader Samsung Electronics (005930.KS). By contrast, SK Hynix is weak in NAND although strong in DRAM chips, which help electronic devices perform multiple tasks at once. Western Digital declined to comment.     Foxconn, the world's largest contract electronics maker, is also a suitor.

Activist investors, including Starboard Value LP, have put pressure on Parexel to explore a sale, arguing that the company's profit margins have consistently lagged those of its peers. Pamplona will pay $88.10 per share in cash for Parexel, representing a 5 percent premium to the stock's Monday close. Parexel's shares were trading at $87.67 before the bell, just shy of the offer price. The stock has jumped more than 20 percent since the first report of a potential sale appeared in May. Including debt, the deal is valued at $5 billion. Headquartered near Boston, Massachusetts, Parexel provides a range of services to the pharmaceutical industry, ranging from drug development and regulatory consulting to clinical pharmacology, clinical trials management and reimbursement. The company focuses on cancer drug research and has a platform for so-called real-world data, which can be used to assess the economic value of medicines and is sought after by drug makers looking to justify their prices to health insurers. Pamplona had been scouring the market in the last year, seeking to acquire a contract research organization. It made an unsuccessful bid earlier this year for Pharmaceutical Product Development LLC (PPD), a U.S. clinical trials firm valued at more than $9 billion. The contract research industry has been undergoing a wave of consolidation as pharmaceutical companies cut costs, reduce clinical trial times and expand their research and development presence around the world. Deal-making also allows companies to profit from economies of scale, as they seek to boost their real-world data gathering capabilities. Last month, INC Research Holdings Inc (INCR.O) agreed to merge with inVentiv Health Inc in a $4.6 billion deal. Contract researcher Quintiles Transnational Holdings Inc completed a $9 billion merger with IMS Health Holdings Inc last year. The Parexel deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter. Goldman Sachs is Parexel's financial adviser, while Goodwin Procter LLP served as legal adviser. Perella Weinberg Partners LP Pamplona's financial adviser, while Kirkland & Ellis LLP is their legal adviser.

Nestle said on Tuesday it was lead investor in a $77 million round of new funding for Freshly, helping it gain access to the $10 billion market for prepared meals in the United States, which it expected to grow at very attractive rates. Nestle did not disclose its exact investment, which it said would help Freshly build a new East Coast kitchen and distribution center in 2018 as it prepares to expand its U.S. service nationwide.  Nestle USA's Food Division President Jeff Hamilton would join Freshly's board of directors. Nestle shares rose 0.8 percent by 0920 GMT. The world's largest packaged foods maker is becoming more health and nutrition-focused as a new generation of savvy consumers demand fresher and healthier foods. It said last week it could exit its U.S. confectionary business.  The deal comes just days after Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) said  it would buy Whole Foods Market Inc (WFM.O) for $13.7 billion, in a deal that could turn the high-end natural and organic supermarket chain into a mass-market retailer.  Freshly is headquartered in New York with operations in the western state of Arizona. Founded in 2015 and with 400 staff,    its subscription-based model offers various meal plans to consumers via a rotating menu on its website. Nestle USA Chairman and CEO Paul Grimwood said consumers still bought most food in supermarkets but were increasingly turning to direct-to-consumer options. Acquiring a position in Freshly not only gives us access to this growth market, but it also brings reciprocal benefits for both companies. Nestle will gain visibility into Freshly's advanced analytics and its highly effective distribution network and Freshly will benefit from our R&D;, nutrition and sourcing expertise, he said in a statement. Its Phoenix facility lets Freshly ship to around 40 percent of consumers. Nestle estimated a new plant in Maryland should let Freshly serve about 93 percent of the U.S. population with prepared meals that can be heated in two to three minutes. This investment and close partnership will allow Freshly to continue to expand and rapidly scale our reach in order to achieve our goal of being in every household in America, Freshly CEO Michael Wystrach said.  Nestle its trying to capitalize on the growth of the market for delivered food, which range from HelloFresh and Blue Apron to Delivery Hero, which on Monday said it aims to raise around 927 million euros ($1.03 billion) through a stock market listing that could value it at up to 4.4 billion euros. German meal kit company HelloFresh is also preparing a stock market flotation which could come this year. Market research group Euromonitor International said Nestle is market leader for ready meals globally and in the United States, with 8.2 percent and 17.4 percent shares respectively, although its U.S. market share slipped from 18 percent in 2011.

The consortium is seen as one of the strongest suitors for the unit - the world's No. 2 producer of NAND chips - as it would automatically have the government's stamp of approval, but it is worried about legal risks if the spat is not settled, the sources said. The group includes a state-backed fund, the Innovation Network Corp of Japan (INCJ), the Development Bank of Japan (DBJ), as well as U.S. private equity firm Bain Capital and South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix Inc. Western Digital, which jointly operates Toshiba's main chip plant, has sought a court injunction to prevent its partner from selling its chip business without the U.S. firm's consent. Toshiba, which is seeking a minimum of $18 billion for its chip business, wants to complete the deal as quickly as possible to help cover billions of dollars in cost overruns at its now-bankrupt Westinghouse nuclear unit and to dig itself out negative shareholders' equity that could lead to a delisting. The conglomerate had set its sights on choosing a preferred bidder at a board meeting on Wednesday, separate sources familiar with the matter said. It wants to reach a definitive agreement by June 28, the day of its annual shareholders meeting. But the sources added that the condition set by the government-led group could prompt Toshiba to postpone the vote. The sources declined to be identified as discussions concerning the sale were confidential. INCJ, DBJ and SK Hynix declined to comment. A representative for Bain was not immediately available for comment. Toshiba said it would not comment on the auction process. Western Digital reiterated a June 15 statement by Chief Executive Steve Milligan in which he said that Toshiba was violating contractual rights and had left the U.S. firm no choice but to pursue legal action. The government-led consortium's bid has been orchestrated in large part by the trade ministry which wants to keep the chip unit under domestic control. It has been seeking to counter a 2.2 trillion yen ($19.7 billion) from U.S. chipmaker Broadcom and its partner, U.S. private equity firm Silver Lake. Foxconn, the world's largest contract electronics maker, is also a suitor. Formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry , the Taiwanese firm is leading a consortium that includes Apple Inc and computing giant Dell Inc . $1 = 111.7400 yen

DAE, the aircraft leasing and maintenance company controlled by the government of Dubai, previously said the deal, announced in April, would finalize sometime in the third quarter. The acquisition is subject to regulatory approval. I think it is fair to say after the close we will seriously consider placing a large order so that we have proper line of sight on ... growth for our company for the next several years, DAE CEO Firoz Tarapore told Reuters. The order would be bigger than the 23 new Airbus  aircraft AWAS has on order, he said. The AWAS acquisition would more than double DAE's fleet from 131 owned, managed and committed aircraft to 394 worth over $14 billion by the end of 2018. That will make DAE one of the world's top aircraft lessors behind the likes of General Electric (GE.N) and AerCap (AER.N). DAE is interested in buying narrow and wide-body jets from Airbus (AIR.PA) and Boeing (BA.N), and turboprop aircraft from ATR which is co-owned by Airbus and Italy's Leonardo LDOF.PA with deliveries to start from late 2019 - subject to availability. Tarapore said the firm would look at the Airbus A320neo and A350-900, Boeing's 737 MAX, 787-9 and 777 freighter, and ATR's 72-600. Narrow-bodies of course are the first preference but we believe that there are a few wide-body types that are quite appropriate to have on a leasing company books, he said. The ATR 72-600 fleet could grow to the top end of the 60-to-100 spectrum, he added. DAE currently has 57 owned and committed ATR 72-600s. DAE believes the AWAS acquisition will give it the benefits of scale - it will have more than 110 airline customers spread across 55 countries. Reuters reported on Monday that DAE plans to raise up to $2 billion in July with the proceeds to be used towards financing the AWAS acquisition. It is acquiring AWAS from private equity firm Terra Firma Capital Partners [TERA.UL] and the Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB). Editing by Mark Potter"

"https://www.reuters.com/article/tpi-triunfo-part-restructuring-idUSL1N1JG1ST","UPDATE 2-Triunfo nears debt deal after port exit, sources say","","Jun 19 2017","TPI Triunfo Participações &Investimentos SA sold a 50 percent stake in a port terminal topartner MSC Mediterranean Shipping Co SA on Monday, a key steptoward advancing the debt-laden Brazilian infrastructure firm'sturnaround.","SAO PAULO (Reuters) - TPI Triunfo Participações & Investimentos SA sold a 50 percent stake in a port terminal to partner MSC Mediterranean Shipping Co SA on Monday, a key step toward advancing the debt-laden Brazilian infrastructure firm's turnaround. In a securities filing, Triunfo (TPIS3.SA) said it sold the 50 percent it has in Terminal Portuário de Navegantes SA for 1.3 billion reais ($396 million) to MSC's Terminal Investment Ltd SARL. Reuters reported earlier in the day that both partners had agreed on price and terms for the deal. Triunfo, which has been a partner in the terminal known as PortoNave since 2001, could get a 90 million real earn-out and extraordinary dividends if some unspecified conditions are met, two people familiar with the deal said. The sale depends on antitrust and regulatory approval. Asset sales have become a key part of Triunfo's plan to reduce debt. Creditors have discussed a restructuring plan that would allow Triunfo to retain cash from potential divestitures while it downsizes, Reuters reported on May 11.  Without an agreement with creditors, Triunfo could risk the completion of future asset sales, people with knowledge of the company's situation have told Reuters. Triunfo is negotiating the restructuring proposal with creditors individually, and the PortoNave sale could accelerate such agreement, they said. Proceeds from the PortoNave stake sale are expected to mainly go to repay part of Triunfo's 3.5 billion reais in debt, one of the people said - an indication that an accord with creditors is close. Triunfo has hired Alvarez & Marsal Holdings LLC to conduct talks with banks. The restructuring talks have aimed at engaging creditors with a long-term turnaround at Triunfo, suggesting that banks that agree to take on a significant loss on their loans to the company may get repaid first, the sources said. São Paulo-based Triunfo declined to comment. Efforts to obtain comment from MSC's press office in Geneva outside business hours were unsuccessful. Aggressive Borrowing At that price, PortoNave was valued at about 11 times annual earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, said one of the people. PortoNave is considered one of the world's most efficient port operators and was the only one of Triunfo's main four business lines that turned a profit last year. Apart from PortoNave, Triunfo may sell stakes in a consortium running Brazil's Viracopos international airport and a hydropower dam. Reuters reported on March 27 that MSC's TIL unit was likely to exercise a right of first refusal to buy Triunfo's stake in PortoNave. Triunfo borrowed aggressively at the start of the decade to fuel expansion in toll roads, electricity and airports. Still, Brazil's worst-ever recession has eroded profitability at the company and about 1 billion reais of Triunfo's debt will mature by the end of next year.  Common shares (TPIS3.SA) fell 2.3 percent to 2.92 reais on Monday. Concern about the pace of negotiations with creditors has driven the stock down 41 percent in the past three months.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/blackrock-scalablecapital-idUSL8N1JD4K8","BlackRock takes Scalable Capital stake in Europe robo-advisor push","","Jun 19 2017","* First robo-advice deal by world's biggest asset managerin Europe","LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock (BLK.N), the world's biggest asset manager, made its first push into Europe's robo-advice market on Tuesday after taking a stake in Anglo-German digital investment manager Scalable Capital. BlackRock, which manages $5.4 trillion across a range of actively managed and index-tracking funds, led a 30 million euro ($33.6 million) funding round for Scalable alongside its two existing German venture capital backers, a joint statement said. The funding will help Scalable expand its robo-advice business - which uses low-cost exchange-based funds and online distribution - with financial institutions and corporates to help grow assets past the 250 million euros raised in the 16 months since launch from more than 6,000 retail clients. The expansion of BlackRock's digital efforts comes as fund and wealth managers globally look to overhaul their distribution models amid tougher regulation, pressure on fees and the changing investment needs of a younger generation. Patrick Olson, BlackRock's chief operating officer for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and who will join Scalable's supervisory board, said the decision to invest came as investors increasingly wanted to access their holdings using technology. This trend is prompting strong demand from European financial institutions – including banks, insurers, wealth managers and advisory firms – for high-quality technology-enabled investment solutions, Olsen said. Scalable Capital, founded in 2014 and based in Munich and London, uses exchange-traded funds from BlackRock and others to build low-cost portfolios for clients and is actively looking to expand into other European countries. As well as Britain and Germany, it is also active in Austria. New European rules aimed at improving transparency, value for money and protections for investors meant traditional asset and wealth managers would need to use technology to help design, manage and distribute investments, the companies said. Technology is not just a competitive advantage but a requirement for wealth management businesses to be successful in the future, Adam French, co-founder and co-CEO at Scalable Capital, said. The deal is subject to regulatory approval and is expected to close in the third quarter. The companies declined to specify the size of the equity stake taken by BlackRock or its growth targets. Fintech Stable The deal for Scalable comes several months after BlackRock Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink told Reuters he was considering up to four small acquisitions to shore up its technology and investment expertise. It also follows the purchase in 2015 of U.S.-based robo-adviser FutureAdvisor which, like Scalable, uses exchange-traded funds to build portfolios for clients and began serving retail customers. Since then, FutureAdvisor has put more emphasis on licensing its service to big wealth management companies to offer through their own advisers, typically to lower-tier clients who they might otherwise not retain. BlackRock is keen to win more market share with those wealth management firms, which are already a primary distributor of its funds to the general public. FutureAdvisor disclosed having $969 million in assets under management and 13,751 accounts in a February filing with U.S. regulators, up from $232 million and 3,460 accounts around when the BlackRock deal was announced in 2015. As well as FutureAdvisor, BlackRock's digital wealth management business includes Aladdin Risk for Wealth, iRetire and iCapital, all of which are solely for U.S.-based clients. Fink has placed an unusual emphasis on technology for a company in his industry, including through the company's Aladdin operating system for investment management, which it licenses to rivals. It is also exploring how computer models can improve stock picking while reducing costs and in March announced plans to bolster an internal team known for data-driven approaches to picking stocks.

Rice Energy's shares surged more than 24 percent to $24.47 in early trading, but below the $27.05 per share offered by EQT. EQT's shares were down 9.4 percent. The deal comes at a time when U.S. energy firms are pumping in money to develop facilities in gas-rich states like Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio as the country prepares to become the world's top natural gas exporter. EQT said it would be able to drill longer horizontal wells in Pennsylvania after the deal as most of the acquired acreage is next to where EQT already drills or owns land. EQT is a decade behind in fracking technology used by industry leaders in Marcellus/Utica, said Dallas Salazar, CEO of energy consulting firm Atlas Consulting. EQT needs a lot - and Rice offers a lot of what it needs. EQT has been buying acreage in the Marcellus shale field - where gas is among the cheapest in the country. Most recently it picked up 53,400 acres in the field from Stone Energy Corp. EQT said the acquisition would increase its 2017 average sales volume by 1.3 billion cubic feet equivalent per day (bcfe/d) and its core acres in the Marcellus field by 187,000 to 670,000. The deal would also give the company access to Rice Energy's midstream assets, including a 92 percent interest in Rice Midstream GP Holdings. EQT will take on about $1.5 billion in debt. Rice Energy shareholders will receive $5.30 per share in cash and 0.37 EQT shares for each share they hold, EQT said. The offer translates to a price of $27.05 per Rice Energy share, representing a premium of 37.4 percent to the stock's Friday closing price, according to Reuters calculations. Citigroup was EQT's financial adviser, while Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz were its legal advisers. Barclays Capital Inc was Rice Energy's financial adviser and Vinson & Elkins LLP its legal adviser.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/hudsons-bay-land-and-buildings-idUSL3N1JG3ZE","UPDATE 4-Activist Litt eyes Hudson's Bay real estate, stock soars","","Jun 19 2017","U.S. activist investorJonathan Litt on Monday called for Canada's Hudson's Bay Coto consider going private and to monetize its vast realestate holdings, sending shares in the owner of Saks FifthAvenue up 15 percent.","(Adds comments from Baskin Financial portfolio manager, updates stock price) By Solarina Ho and Michael Flaherty TORONTO/NEW YORK, June 19 (Reuters) - U.S. activist investor Jonathan Litt on Monday called for Canada's Hudson's Bay Co to consider going private and to monetize its vast real estate holdings, sending shares in the owner of Saks Fifth Avenue up 15 percent. The company, also known as HBC, said it would review the letter from Litt, whose activist real estate hedge fund Land & Buildings Investment Management disclosed it had bought 4.3 percent of Hudson's Bay. HBC stock had lost about a third of its value this year amid declining sales at its retail stores, which include Saks, Lord & Taylor and the 347-year-old Hudson's Bay brand. The company this month said it would cut 2,000 jobs as part of a restructuring of its retail business. The stock fell to a record low on Friday, partly due to investor frustration that the company has yet to announce plans to monetize its more than $10 billion in real estate assets. They include its Saks on Fifth Avenue in New York City, which is valued at $3.7 billion. Shares peaked just shy of C$30 two years ago but investors have since complained the value of its real estate holdings are not reflected in the price of its stock, which has a market capitalization of C$1.6 billion ($1.21 billion). Litt called on the board to focus on that issue, saying he estimates the real estate holdings are worth C$35 per share, nearly four times HBC's closing price on Friday. The path to maximizing the value of Hudson's Bay lies in its real estate, not its retail brands, said Litt, a former Citigroup real estate analyst. If there is a smarter and better use of any or all of the locations, stores should be closed and redeveloped and put towards their optimal use. In addition to its North American operations, HBC owns European department store Galeria Kaufhof. It also holds majority stakes in joint ventures worth over C$8.1 billion ($6.1 billion) for its property holdings in North America and Europe. HBC shares closed up C$1.34 at C$10.22 in Toronto after reaching a high of C$10.45. An Aggressive Activist Litt is known as an aggressive activist investor who pressures his targets through public letters, often pushing companies to sell themselves if they are unable to institute the changes he suggests. In the last year, Litt has pushed for the sale of Brookdale Senior Living Inc, Forest City Realty Trust Inc and FelCor Lodging Trust Inc. Litt took on Taubman Centers Inc this spring and waged an unsuccessful proxy fight to replace two directors on the board, including CEO Bobby Taubman. In 2015, Land and Buildings launched a proxy fight against Macerich Co that resulted in the mall owner adding two directors and making corporate-governance changes. Joshua Varghese, a portfolio manager with CI Investments, one of HBC's biggest shareholders, said he would like the company to close some stores, stop opening new ones and focus on finding ways to get the value of its real estate holdings reflected in the stock price. CI Investments is the company's sixth-largest shareholder with a 4.1 percent stake, according to Thomson Reuters data. I hope it will force the management team to address these issues in more detail with its shareholders, Varghese said. Founded in 1670, HBC began as a fur trader and once owned more than 40 percent of what is now Canada and much of what became North Dakota and Minnesota. U.S. real estate developer Richard Baker bought the firm in 2008 and took it public in 2012, retaining its name and Toronto headquarters. Barry Schwartz, portfolio manager at Baskin Financial Services, said the company should gradually pull the plug on its struggling stores and sell the real estate. Their retail is finished, said Schwartz, whose firm does not hold any HBC stock. ($1 = 1.3218 Canadian dollars) Reporting by Solarina Ho and John Tilak in Toronto and Michael

Canada's second largest pension fund is putting up 90 percent of the equity, along with the debt for the entity, which will be operated by the commercial aircraft financing and leasing business of General Electric Co This platform, at $2 billion today, has the potential over time to be meaningfully larger than $2 billion, Caisse Chief Executive Michael Sabia said in a phone interview. The new entity will focus on the market for high-tech, fuel-efficient narrow-body aircraft, he said. GE Capital Aviation Services (GECAS), which is putting up the remaining 10 percent in equity, is one of the world largest aircraft-leasing companies. One of the reasons that this transaction has come together is that GE is looking for capital-efficient ways for them to grow their business, Sabia said. We're providing capital to help them grow and they're providing operating capability to make sure these assets are well-managed.    Sabia said the entity, to be called Einn Volant Aircraft Leasing (EVAL), was looking at fuel-efficient, narrow-body or single-aisle planes, because those planes move most quickly and most easily among the airlines of the world. That market includes Airbus's A320neo and Boeing Co's 737 MAX, along with Canadian plane-and-train-maker Bombardier Inc's CSeries.  He added that the Caisse's 30 percent stake in Bombardier's rail division was completely separate from the pension fund's $2 billion investment over four years with GE. One aviation financing industry watcher said it is unlikely that GE Capital Aviation would be interested in the 110- to 130-seat CSeries, since it uses the engine of GE rival Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies. Sabia, however, said any decision about the financing of a specific aircraft would be a function of airline demand. The focus of this platform is working with airlines, Sabia said. Our openness to financing specific aircraft has everything to do with what the airlines buy.  A Bombardier spokesman could not be reached for comment. Shares of Bombardier closed up nearly 5 percent on Monday in Toronto trading. Qatar Airways CEO Akbar Al Baker earlier in the day said he was considering the CSeries for a possible new carrier in India. The CSeries has not secured a new firm order in about a year.

The deal cements Occidental's status as the dominant U.S. producer of oil via carbon injection, a process favored by environmentalists and oil producers alike, and one that could grow in popularity if Congress expands a tax credit this summer. The EOR process harnesses the carbon dioxide produced during the extraction of oil, from power plants or from natural sources, and forces it back into aging oil fields. That boosts the pressure underground and drives more oil to the surface. Occidental is not only buying out Hess's stakes in carbon injection projects, but is also getting complete control of naturally occurring sources of underground carbon dioxide, a boost to the company's bottom line. The cost of carbon is one of the largest expenses in EOR projects typically. For Hess, the deal gives it cash to further expand in North Dakota's Bakken shale and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, areas in which it already invests heavily. The deal is expected to close by August. Shares of Hess fell about 1 percent to $43.25 in morning trading.  Separately, Occidental said it would sell remote acreage in the Permian for $600 million to undisclosed buyers and acquire other acreage closer to existing wells. The deals will effectively cut Occidental's holdings in the Permian, America's largest oilfield, by 13,000 acres. Occidental declined to disclose the buyer but said the deal was not connected to the Hess transaction. The company said the deals should help it, one day, to break even with oil prices CLc1 at $50 per barrel after paying its dividend.  Oil on Monday traded near $45 per barrel. By monetizing assets in the tail of the portfolio that were not strategic to us, but are synergistic to other companies, we are creating value for our shareholders, Vicki Hollub, Occidental's chief executive, said in a statement.

We remain passionate about the opportunity and intend to continue pursuing discussions, Liberty House said in an email to Reuters.  The Seoul-based private equity syndicate led by Newlake Alliance and JB Asset Management was named on June 15 as the preferred bidder over Liberty, and that was thought to be the end of more than a year of Morgan Stanley-led (MS.N) efforts to provide a financial rescue package to Arrium.  Morgan Stanley recommended the Newlake and JB Asset consortium to Arrium's committee of creditors, which overwhelmingly supported the South Korean group, according to the steelmaker's financial administrator, KordaMentha.  The creditors' committee includes Australian lenders Commonwealth Bank (CBA.AX), National Australia Bank (NAB.AX), Westpac (WBC.AX) and ANZ Bank (ANZ.AX), which together are owed a combined A$1 billion ($761 million).  KordaMentha confirmed a revised bid had been submitted by Liberty House, but said administrators continued to deal with the Korean consortium on an exclusive basis.  South Australia state has pledged A$50 million to the new owner to help upgrade Arrium's steelworks.     A spokesman for the South Australia treasurer, Tom Koutsantonis, said the state would work with either group to keep Arrium in business.  Newlake's and JB's bid proposes spending more than A$1 billion on the Whyalla upgrade and on Arrium's mini-mills, steel distribution and iron ore mining divisions. The consortium also plans to build a gas-fired power station to feed the steelworks, which would help combat South Australia's energy shortage.  Newlake has said it will use the Finex steelmaking technology under license from South Korean steelmaker POSCO (005490.KS) to revamp the Arrium's main Whyalla steelworks. The decision to use the technology played a key role in the selection process, according to KordaMentha.   Newlake and JB West were not immediately available for comment.  Liberty House, which operates together with commodities and energy conglomerate SIMEC under the $9.4 billion Gupta Family Group (GFG) Alliance, hit the headlines last year when it offered to rescue steel plants owned by Tata Steel UK (TISC.NS) that were on the verge of shutdown.  Liberty's so-called green metal model is based on using renewable energy to fire furnaces and smelters that recycle local scrap and sell the finished metal to manufacturers.

Mohammed El-Kuwaiz, vice chairman of the Capital Market Authority, was quoted as saying by the Asharq al-Awsat newspaper that he expected the Saudi market to be included in the index by the end of 2018. MSCI will announce late on Tuesday whether it is putting Saudi Arabia on a list for possible index inclusion. Most funds think Riyadh has done enough to be included, but if MSCI follows its usual timetable, actual entry would occur in mid-2019. However, MSCI has the flexibility to move faster if it wishes. The Saudi stock index rose 2.4 percent, its largest single-day gain since November, although trading volume was only moderate. Local funds which have been somewhat sceptical of MSCI putting Riyadh on review reacted to the comments made by the vice chairman, said Mohamad al-Hajj, macroeconomic strategist at EFG Hermes. Some of the top-performing shares on Monday were those which may eventually be added to MSCI's standard emerging market index, including Banque Saudi Fransi, which jumped 7.5 percent, and medical insurer BUPA Arabia, up 6.0 percent. Although progress towards inclusion would be a net positive for the Saudi stock market, some analysts are cautious about speculative fever trumping fundamentals, which are not particularly supportive. Saudi Arabia's 12-month forward price-earnings ratio is 13.9 while the MSCI Emerging Market Index is at 12. While we believe that inclusion in watch list for Saudi will lead to enhanced market liquidity and generate more interest in the Saudi market, we caution investors to be wary of irrational exuberance as inclusion is unlikely to change market fundamentals which currently remain tepid, said a note by Alrajhi Capital. The government's petrodollar revenues remain under pressure and reforms planned for the next 12 months include another round of fuel and electricity price hikes and introduction of a value- added tax, which will raise costs for the private sector. Meanwhile, Dubai's National Central Cooling Co (Tabreed) surged its 15 percent daily limit to 2.12 dirhams after French power and gas group Engie agreed to buy a 40 percent stake for 2.8 billion dirhams ($763 million) from Abu Dhabi's Mubadala. Mubadala will convert its mandatory convertible bonds into shares, with 1.086 billion shares to be transferred to Engie at about 2.62 dirhams each. The Abu Dhabi fund will keep 42 percent after the deal has been approved by regulators. Analysts at Arqaam Capital said they were keeping their target price for the stock unchanged at 2.32 dirhams, as Tabreed's growth would benefit from Engie's experience but share buy-backs by the company were no longer likely. Drake & Scull climbed 1.2 percent after its acting chief financial officer told reporters that the company had not been affected by Qatar's diplomatic rift with some of its Gulf neighbours, although DSI was not bidding for new business in that country. DSI expects to complete a plan to reduce its capital by 75 percent by the end of the third quarter, deferring the process by one month, its chief executive said. The Dubai index added 0.4 percent. Qatar lost 1.3 percent with commodity-linked companies some of the worst performers as Brent oil stayed near its 2017 lows. Drilling rig provider Gulf International Services declined 4.0 percent and petrochemical maker Industries Qatar fell 2.7 percent. Abu Dhabi's index edged down 0.2 percent, weighed down by a 2.9 percent decline in Dana Gas, the most heavily traded stock on Monday.

On Friday, Amazon.com Inc countered. With its $14 billion purchase of grocery chain Whole Foods Market Inc , the largest e-commerce company announced its intention to take on Wal-Mart in the brick-and-mortar world. The two deals make it clear that the lines that divided traditional retail from e-commerce are disappearing and sector dominance will no longer be bound by e-commerce or brick-and-mortar, but by who is better at both. Amazon's purchase of Whole Foods also brings disruption to the $700 billion U.S. grocery sector, a traditional area of retailing that stands on the precipice of a ferocious price war. German discounters Aldi and Lidl are battling Wal-Mart, which controls 22 percent of the U.S. grocery market, with each vowing to undercut whatever price the others offer. The stakes are highest for Wal-Mart. Amazon's move aims at the heart of the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retail giant's business - groceries, which account for 56 percent of Wal-Mart's $486 billion in revenue for the year ending Jan. 31. With the deal, Whole Foods’ more than 460 stores become a test bed with which Amazon can learn how to compete with Wal-Mart’s 4,700 stores with a large grocery offering that are also within 10 miles (16 km) of 90 percent of the U.S. population. Amazon is expected to lower Whole Foods' notoriously high prices, enabling it to pursue Wal-Mart's customers. The push comes as Wal-Mart is headed in the opposite direction - going after Amazon's higher-income shoppers with a recent string of acquisitions of online brands such as Moosejaw and Modcloth and on Friday, menswear e-tailer Bonobos. Wal-Mart may be ready. In preparation for the grocery price war, Wal-Mart in recent months has cut grocery prices, improved fresh food and meat offerings, modernized shelving and lighting in its grocery aisles, and expanded its online grocery pickup service. Marc Lore, the Jet.com founder who now runs Wal-Mart's e-commerce business after selling a startup to Amazon, told Reuters in an interview that Amazon's move does not change Wal-Mart's game plan. We're playing offense, he said. Wal-Mart is offering curbside pickup of online grocery purchases at 700 locations, with 300 more planned by year end. It also is testing same-day fresh and frozen home delivery from 10 of its stores. We see an opportunity to do a lot more of that, Lore said. Roger Davidson, who oversaw Wal-Mart's global food procurement and now is president of Oakton Advisory Group, said the deal will reduce Wal-Mart's brick-and-mortar advantage. I think this acquisition is a concern, he said. Some industry observers say Amazon will find it difficult to use Whole Foods to pull away Wal-Mart shoppers because the two stores appeal to different customers. But Michelle Grant, head of retailing at market research firm Euromonitor, said Amazon could use an obscure part of the Whole Foods portfolio - Whole Foods 365 - to lure Wal-Mart shoppers. Whole Foods 365 offers private-label goods and lower prices than typical Whole Foods stores, and is targeted at younger, value-conscious shoppers. Amazon could provide the financial capital and tactical ability to build that into something big. That (Whole Foods 365) may become a big problem for Wal-Mart, Grant said. Amazon, which reported $12.5 billion in cash and equivalents and a free cash flow of $10.2 billion in the year ended March 31, has plenty to spend. Wal-Mart reported $6.9 billion in cash and equivalents and $20.9 billion in free cash flow at its year ended Jan. 31. Brittain Ladd, a former senior manager at Amazon who worked on its brick-and-mortar strategy, said Amazon will use Whole Foods to test concepts for the grocery store of the future. Ladd, who left Amazon in March, said Amazon will seek to eliminate checkout lines by using technology that automatically scans goods as customers add them to their shopping carts. It will select merchandise based on Amazon's vaunted customer data, and potentially expects the use of technology to change prices during the course of a day. Amazon declined comment on competition with Walmart but spokesman Drew Herdener said in a statement the company has no plans to cut jobs or use technology in development at its Seattle Amazon Go store to automate jobs of cashiers. Ladd, who helped with AmazonFresh's global expansion and now is a supply chain consultant, said an Amazon-owned Whole Foods also likely will offer in-car pickup of online purchases, and home delivery from Whole Foods stores, add pharmacies and showcase Amazon devices inside the stores. Amazon will reduce prices and change the assortment of products carried in Whole Foods stores to attract a larger customer base, said Ladd. Kroger and Wal-Mart will be impacted as their customers will defect to Amazon. Additional reporting by Richa Naidu in Chicago; Editing by

By Lisa Baertlein and Harriet McLeod LOS ANGELES/MOUNT PLEASANT, S.C., June 16 (Reuters) - The merger that shook food and retail stocks on Friday - Amazon.com Inc's proposed deal to buy Whole Foods Market Inc - rattled some employees of the upscale grocery chain who expressed fears ranging from layoffs to the loss of their laid-back corporate culture. The online retailer hopes the $13.7 billion acquisition helps it disrupt the grocery business and expand its real-world store footprint. Carmen Clark, 37, a six-year employee at a store in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina, said some workers worry that Amazon-led automation could lead to job cuts. Everybody's been kind of joking that it's going to be robots and drones, Clark said of potential changes from Amazon, which uses robots in its warehouses and is testing drones for delivery. But she is giving Amazon the benefit of the doubt. I have purchased from Amazon for five years. It's a good company, she said. Reuters approached a dozen employees in California, New York, Illinois, South Carolina and Rhode Island. Many said they had been told by managers not to speak to reporters. Several workers expressed relief and happiness about the planned sale, which came as Whole Foods faced pressure from hedge fund investor Jana Partners to improve results. Whole Foods recently overhauled its board and redoubled cost-cutting efforts, seeking to change a high-price image that has tagged it with the nickname Whole Paycheck. But Whole Foods has lost market share to rivals Kroger Co , Wal-Mart Stores Inc, Costco Wholesale Corp and others that have elbowed into the natural and organic segment Whole Foods pioneered. Some workers at the nonunion grocery chain wondered whether Amazon, known for its hard-driving culture, would mean big changes to their pay, benefits or employment. I think that they are a very profit-driven company, so there might be some streamlining as far as labor, said Sasha Hardin, 28, of the Mount Pleasant store, who has been with Whole Foods for 6-1/2 years. A Los Angeles deli worker in his 30s, who is expecting his first child this summer, is worried about layoffs. I want to keep working, said the worker, who did not want his name used. Whole Foods has a corporate culture that prizes inclusive decision-making, such as allowing workers to vote on benefits every three years and disclosing executive pay. I've heard that Amazon's culture is really cutthroat. That worries me, one bagger at a Providence, Rhode Island, store said. At least one customer was concerned that an Amazon purchase would further distance Whole Foods from its roots as a purveyor of premium, organic and specialty foods. This store has become a money-making machine, said Tony Castro, a 40-year-old private chef, who shops daily in Whole Foods' sprawling downtown Los Angeles store.

Blackstone will own 30 percent of the new company, which will have eight manufacturing facilities and three existing joint-venture sites.

Mubadala hoped to finalize a deal, that would need the DoJ's approval, to buy 50 percent of Viceroy Hotel Group within a matter of days, the Financial Times reported, citing one person aware of the matter.  The Abu Dhabi fund already owns 50 percent of Viceroy, which has more than a dozen hotels across the world, while the remainder is owned by Low and affiliates that purchased rights to and interests in the hotel group with funds from 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), the newspaper said. The Justice Department filed complaints on Thursday seeking to recover $540 million stolen from 1MDB, in the latest legal action tied to alleged money-laundering at the fund that brought the total claims by the DoJ to more than $1.7 billion. The department alleged more than $4.5 billion belonging to the state wealth fund, set up by Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak in 2009, was taken by high-level fund officials and their associates.  The proceeds of the sale, if agreed by Low, would be placed into an escrow account frozen by the Justice Department, the FT said. U.S. authorities, in civil complaints, have accused Low of laundering more than $400 million stolen from the scandal-tainted Malaysian fund through an account in the United States. The Malaysian businessman has not been charged with any crime. Viceroy declined to comment while the Justice Department, Mubadala, and Jho Low's Hong Kong-based company Jynwel Capital did not immediately respond to emailed requests for comment outside of regular working hours.

MSCI will announce late on Tuesday whether it is adding Saudi Arabia to a list for possible upgrade to emerging market status; the upgrade, if it happens, would probably not occur before mid-2019. The Saudi index rose 0.9 percent in thin trade as some stocks expected to be targets of incoming foreign funds rose, with Food maker Savloa jumping 5.0 percent to 48.40 riyals, its highest finish since January 2016. National Commercial Bank, the biggest lender, was up 2.1 percent while petrochemical blue chip Saudi Basic Industries added 2.2 percent. The Saudi labour ministry said it was working to transfer around 8,000 remaining workers at financially troubled construction company Saudi Oger to other firms. A spokesman for Oger could not be reached for comment, while a source close to the company said there was no decision to close it down. Most Saudi banks are exposed to Oger debt, but many have already taken partial provisions for it, while any wind-up process could be prolonged. Bank shares in general did not appear to be hurt by the Oger news. In most other big Gulf markets, however, the mood was glum. Brent oil futures settled at $47.37 a barrel on Friday - not a disastrous level for the Gulf, but one which means governments may have less to spend this year than investors hoped just a few weeks ago. Oil prices above US$50/bbl are conducive to helping reforms succeed while oil prices below US$40/bbl are likely to endanger macro stability, Bank of America Merrill Lynch said in a report last week. Dubai's stock index dropped 0.4 percent as Emaar Properties pulled back 0.9 percent. But Union Properties, the most heavily traded stock, gained 1.8 percent after saying it had entered an agreement with Al Ramz Capital to provide liquidity for its shares. Al Ramz is permitted to own up to 5 percent of the company's shares under the deal. Qatar, which has been hurt by the sanctions against Doha by other Arab states, dropped 0.8 percent as the biggest bank, Qatar National Bank, lost 2.5 percent.

On Friday, Amazon.com Inc countered. With its $14 billion purchase of grocery chain Whole Foods Market Inc, the largest e-commerce company announced its intention to take on Wal-Mart in the brick-and-mortar world. The two deals make it clear that the lines that divided traditional retail from e-commerce are disappearing and sector dominance will no longer be bound by e-commerce or brick-and-mortar, but by who is better at both. Amazon's purchase of Whole Foods also brings disruption to the $700 billion U.S. grocery sector, a traditional area of retailing that stands on the precipice of a ferocious price war. German discounters Aldi and Lidl are battling Wal-Mart, which controls 22 percent of the U.S. grocery market, with each vowing to undercut whatever price the others offer. The stakes are highest for Wal-Mart. Amazon's move aims at the heart of the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retail giant's business - groceries, which account for 56 percent of Wal-Mart's $486 billion in revenue for the year ending Jan. 31. With the deal, Whole Foods’ more than 460 stores become a test bed with which Amazon can learn how to compete with Wal-Mart’s 4,700 stores with a large grocery offering that are also within 10 miles (16 km) of 90 percent of the U.S. population. Amazon is expected to lower Whole Foods' notoriously high prices, enabling it to pursue Wal-Mart's customers. The push comes as Wal-Mart is headed in the opposite direction - going after Amazon's higher-income shoppers with a recent string of acquisitions of online brands such as Moosejaw and Modcloth and on Friday, menswear e-tailer Bonobos. Wal-Mart may be ready. In preparation for the grocery price war, Wal-Mart in recent months has cut grocery prices, improved fresh food and meat offerings, modernized shelving and lighting in its grocery aisles, and expanded its online grocery pickup service. Marc Lore, the Jet.com founder who now runs Wal-Mart's e-commerce business after selling a startup to Amazon, told Reuters in an interview that Amazon's move does not change Wal-Mart's game plan. We're playing offense, he said. Wal-Mart is offering curbside pickup of online grocery purchases at 700 locations, with 300 more planned by year end. It also is testing same-day fresh and frozen home delivery from 10 of its stores. We see an opportunity to do a lot more of that, Lore said. Roger Davidson, who oversaw Wal-Mart's global food procurement and now is president of Oakton Advisory Group, said the deal will reduce Wal-Mart's brick-and-mortar advantage. The logo of Amazon is seen at the company logistics center in Lauwin-Planque, northern France, February 20, 2017.Pascal RossignolI think this acquisition is a concern, he said. Some industry observers say Amazon will find it difficult to use Whole Foods to pull away Wal-Mart shoppers because the two stores appeal to different customers. But Michelle Grant, head of retailing at market research firm Euromonitor, said Amazon could use an obscure part of the Whole Foods portfolio - Whole Foods 365 - to lure Wal-Mart shoppers. Whole Foods 365 offers private-label goods and lower prices than typical Whole Foods stores, and is targeted at younger, value-conscious shoppers. Amazon could provide the financial capital and tactical ability to build that into something big. Slideshow (3 Images)That (Whole Foods 365) may become a big problem for Wal-Mart, Grant said. Amazon, which reported $12.5 billion in cash and equivalents and a free cash flow of $10.2 billion in the year ended March 31, has plenty to spend. Wal-Mart reported $6.9 billion in cash and equivalents and $20.9 billion in free cash flow at its year ended Jan. 31. Brittain Ladd, a former senior manager at Amazon who worked on its brick-and-mortar strategy, said Amazon will use Whole Foods to test concepts for the grocery store of the future.  Ladd, who left Amazon in March, said Amazon will seek to eliminate checkout lines by using technology that automatically scans goods as customers add them to their shopping carts. It will select merchandise based on Amazon's vaunted customer data, and potentially expects the use of technology to change prices during the course of a day. Amazon declined comment on competition with Walmart but spokesman Drew Herdener said in a statement the company has no plans to cut jobs or use technology in development at its Seattle Amazon Go store to automate jobs of cashiers. Ladd, who helped with AmazonFresh's global expansion and now is a supply chain consultant, said an Amazon-owned Whole Foods also likely will offer in-car pickup of online purchases, and home delivery from Whole Foods stores, add pharmacies and showcase Amazon devices inside the stores.

Amazon used aggressive pricing to become an e-commerce retail juggernaut and has recently been experimenting with brick-and-mortar outlets. It will take over a natural and organic grocer pioneer with 456 stores, a mecca for young, high-end shoppers, that has been struggling to rein in prices and integrate technology. The deal represents a dramatic turn in strategy for Amazon, which has offered food delivery through its Fresh service for a decade but has not made a major dent in the $700 billion grocery market. “The ramifications for all of retail are seismic – not just retailers that sell grocery, but for everyone,” Gordon Haskett analyst Chuck Grom said. For graphic - Whole Foods at a glance - click: tmsnrt.rs/2skJDSv Shares of dozens of supermarkets, food producers, payment processors and shopping malls collectively lost at least $35 billion in U.S. market value on Friday as the news reverberated across financial markets. Shares of grocer Kroger Co swooned 9.2 percent, while Wal-Mart Stores Inc fell 4.7 percent, signaling fears that Amazon could broaden Whole Foods' product mix and cut prices. Amazon's shares rose 2.4 percent to $987.71, adding $11 billion to its market capitalization, which in one sense makes the acquisition nearly free for Amazon shareholders.  Supermarkets will now have to contend with not only competition with each other and non-traditional grocers like Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Target Corp, but with a retailer like Amazon which has the financial capacity to price aggressively, said Mickey Chadha, vice president and senior credit officer at Moody's Investors Service. Amazon agreed to pay $42 per share in cash for Whole Foods, a 27 percent premium on the Austin, Texas-based grocer's closing share price on Thursday.  Related CoverageFor Whole Foods workers, fears of robots, drones and culture clashSeattle love, dread of activist investor help clinch Amazon M&A rolesAmazon-Whole Foods deal hits shares across the food chainBut in a sign that investors believe a rival bid is likely, Whole Foods shares rose above the offer price to close at $42.68. No Value in Status Quo A former grocery expert at Amazon predicted that the chain, nicknamed Whole Paycheck, would add a selection of discounted food and build out non-grocery areas within stores, particularly for pharmacy and Amazon devices. There’s no value in Amazon keeping the status quo at Whole Foods. Whole Foods was losing market share to Kroger, said Brittain Ladd, who until earlier this year was a senior manager working to roll out AmazonFresh globally.  It’s pharmacy. It’s having the ability to put stores that are similar to Apple stores inside Whole Foods, he said.  Amazon has been looking at shop layouts that could allow traditional in-store purchase, online ordering with on-site pickup, and home delivery, using store warehouse space as a distribution point, Ladd said. A Whole Foods Market is pictured in the Manhattan borough of New York City, New York, U.S. June 16, 2017.Carlo AllegriDespite Amazon's reputation for harnessing technology, a prototype store inside its corporate office in Seattle, called Amazon Go, which uses sensors and tech-savvy cameras to detect shoppers' selections and then charge their Amazon accounts, has rolled out more slowly than planned, a person familiar with the matter said.  And while some analysts expect Amazon to bring vast buying power to Whole Foods, Amazon's heft in the food market is far smaller than in other areas, and high demand for organic products gives farmers unusual bargaining power. Amazon spokesman Drew Herdener said plans do not include reducing jobs as the result of the deal and that the company does not plan to automate Whole Foods cashiers jobs with Amazon Go technology.  Whole Foods Was Under Pressure The deal unfolded after Jeff Bezos, Amazon's chief executive officer, approached Whole Foods CEO John Mackey about a month ago and received an eager response from Mackey, two people familiar with the matter said. Slideshow (18 Images)The grocer will continue to operate stores under the Whole Foods Market brand, and Mackey will remain CEO, the companies said.  Whole Foods has posted seven straight quarterly sales declines at established stores and recently overhauled its board of directors in the face of pressure from activist hedge fund Jana Partners LLC. Jana, which disclosed an 8.3 percent stake in Whole Foods in April and is the company's second biggest shareholder, stands to make roughly $300 million from the sale to Amazon. The deal is for $13.4 billion in cash and the remainder in debt. The acquisition price implies a trailing 12-month price-to-earnings multiple for Whole Foods of 31 times, versus a 14.4 average for the S&P; 500 Food Retail index. Amazon and Whole Foods expect to close the deal during the second half of 2017. Eyes on Grocery Shoppers Amazon, started in Seattle in 1994 by Bezos, a former hedge fund manager, has grown into the world's biggest diversified online retailer, with a market capitalization of nearly $500 billion. It has expanded from a book seller into a merchant of nearly all consumer products, as well as producing videos.  Both Amazon and Whole Foods cater to younger consumers including millennials as well as the affluent. Amazon could bring technology to all Whole Foods locations, or it could absorb Whole Foods into AmazonFresh. Either way, it's good for consumers like myself, said Di Wu, a New York resident in her early 30s who is a member of Amazon's Prime fast-shipping club and who shops at Whole Foods at least twice a week.  Amazon is known to drive down prices and make the shopping experience more efficient, Wu said. Goldman Sachs Group Inc advised Amazon on the deal and provided bridge financing. Bank of America Corp also provided financing to Amazon, while Evercore Partners Inc advised Whole Foods.

In a Friday securities filing, Copec and unit Arauco said they signed a non-disclosure agreement with Eldorado with the purpose of exploring a possible investment, without elaborating further. Earlier in the day, a person involved in the process told Reuters that Copec had already placed a bid for Eldorado. According to the person, who asked for anonymity as terms of the bid remain private, Eldorado is also a target of Brazilian rivals Suzano Papel & Celulose SA and Fibria SA , which were lured by potentially significant cost savings from an acquisition. Currently, Brazil's billionaire Batista family controls 81 percent of Eldorado through investment holding company J&F; Investimentos SA, with the rest being owned by two pension funds. Eldorado is among J&F;'s flagship assets put up for sale after agreeing to pay a record-setting 10.3 billion real ($3.2 billion) fine for its role in corruption scandals that threaten to topple President Michel Temer. That settlement followed testimony from J&F;'s owners Joesley and Wesley Batista that they spent 600 million reais to bribe nearly 1,900 politicians in recent years. Buying Eldorado could allow Copec to expand in Brazil, where lawmakers have discussed easing sales of land to foreign investors. Land in Brazil offers global pulpmakers strategic advantages, such as more productive soil than Scandinavia and Chile. Copec shed 0.4 percent to 7,840 Chilean pesos in midafternoon Friday trading, paring the stock's 2.3 percent gain since newspaper Valor Econômico reported the planned Eldorado bid earlier this week. A deadline for bids was unclear, the person said, although Copec's Arauco unit made an offer this week to the Batistas for their stake. The person added that exclusive talks could start over the weekend. Eldorado's debt hovers around 8 billion reais ($2.4 billion), and J&F; lenders are pressing for a sale, sources told Reuters last month. Fibria and J&F; declined to comment. Suzano did not have an immediate comment. Valor reported on Friday, citing a person familiar with the talks, that Copec's non-binding offer valued Eldorado at 11 billion reais. Exclusive Talks For years, family ownership of Brazilian pulp and paper companies has hindered a consolidation, as owners have resisted sharing control. Just seven pulp and paper M&A; deals have taken place in Brazil since the start of last year, compared with 11 each in Sweden and Indonesia and 54 in the United States, according to Thomson Reuters data. A decision on which company will hold exclusive talks with the Batistas for their stake is around the corner, the person said. Negotiating a deal could take a long time because a buyer will not spare Eldorado from a rather stringent due diligence procedure, the person added. One of the Batista brothers said in testimony that Brazilian President Michel Temer condoned use of bribes to silence a potential witness in a corruption scandal. Temer denies the accusations. This month the government ordered state-controlled lender Caixa Econômica Federal to stop providing financing to the Batista family, Reuters reported on June 7, citing people familiar with the decision, which a source called retaliation. Uncertainty surrounding the plea deal hampered Suzano's interest in Eldorado, Valor said. Fibria SA, the world's No. 1 eucalyptus pulpmaker, could bid for Eldorado as early as Friday, Valor reported, without saying how it got the information. The investment banking units of Itaú Unibanco Holding SA and Banco Bradesco SA are advising Suzano on a bid for Eldorado, according to Valor. Morgan Stanley & Co is Fibria's advisor, the person said. Copec's Arauco is being advised by Banco Santander Brasil SA and law firms Simpson Thatcher & Bartlett LLP and Mattos Filho Advogados. The banks did not have an immediate comment. Valor said this week that Fibria seemed the least likely suitor because a key shareholder, state development bank BNDES, would not approve a deal that could shore up the Batistas. $1 = 3.29 reais

"https://www.reuters.com/article/tesco-outlook-idUSL8N1JD0MQ","UPDATE 3-Tesco sales growth overshadowed by Amazon's Whole Foods move","","Jun 16 2017","* Tesco says its inflation significantly below market trend(Recasts after Amazon/Whole Foods deal, Tesco AGM, analystcomment, shares)","LONDON (Reuters) - Tesco (TSCO.L), Britain's biggest retailer, reported its strongest quarterly sales growth in seven years on Friday but its stellar performance was overshadowed by news of Amazon's (AMZN.O) $14 billion takeover of Whole Foods Market WFO.O. Shares in Tesco rose as much as 4.4 percent in early trading as its first quarter trading update showed it was successfully navigating an increasingly inflationary UK trading environment. But they ended the day down 4.9 percent as investors fretted over the implications for major supermarkets of an accelerated push by e-commerce giant Amazon into traditional food retailing. Shares in Sainsbury's (SBRY.L), Britain's second biggest supermarket, closed down 3.8 percent. But shares in Morrisons (MRW.L), the fourth biggest player, closed up 1.1 percent, reflecting an existing supply deal with Amazon. Incumbents to survive will need strong private label ranges, strong e-commerce operations and dominant scale to have lower costs, Bernstein analyst Bruno Monteyne said. Within our coverage, Tesco (has) positioned itself as the dominant player in those areas in the UK. Tesco CEO Dave Lewis has been leading a fightback after the company's profits were hammered by changing shopping habits, the rise of German discounters Aldi and Lidl and an accounting scandal in 2014. He stabilized the business and then got it growing again with a focus on lower prices, new and streamlined product ranges, better customer service and much improved supplier relationships. Tesco remains Britain's largest supermarket by a wide margin. The group, which in January agreed to buy wholesaler Booker (BOK.L) for 3.7 billion pounds ($4.7 billion), said UK like-for-like sales rose 2.3 percent in the 13 weeks to May 27, ahead of analysts' forecasts and a sixth straight quarter of growth. The key focus for this quarter has been working with our supplier partners to protect our customers from inflation. Today's numbers show the benefit of our approach, Lewis told reporters. The performance was driven by 1.3 percent growth in customer transactions, 10 million more year-on-year, and by volume growth in fresh food of 1.6 percent. Passing on Inflation FILE PHOTO: A woman walks past a Tesco supermarket in central London, December 9, 2014.Toby Melville/File PhotoBritons have been hurt by a rise in inflation, caused in large part by the fall in the value of the pound since last year's vote to leave the European Union, and by a slowdown in wages growth. Tesco, which has a share of around 28 percent of the UK grocery market, says it is not passing on as many cost increases to shoppers as its competitors. By purchasing a tighter range of goods and working more closely with its suppliers, Tesco is able to exploit its huge purchasing scale. Lewis said Tesco's grocery inflation in the quarter was 1.4 percent versus the most recent measure by industry researcher Kantar Worldpanel of 2.9 percent. At the moment inflation in Tesco is significantly below the market trend, he said.     Tesco's finance chief Alan Stewart said the group's margin and cost savings targets were unchanged after the update on the first quarter of its financial year. Analysts regard Sainsbury's as the most exposed to a weaker economy after its purchase of general merchandise retailer Argos. Other analysts say the discounters remain a major threat to Tesco and its traditional rivals, highlighting renewed momentum at Aldi and Lidl, with recent industry data recording their fastest sales growth since 2015. Tesco's group like-for-like sales rose 1 percent. But its international underlying sales fell 3.0 percent, reflecting a decision to discontinue unprofitable bulk selling activity in Thailand. Tesco's shares have now fallen 17 percent in 2017 on concerns over merits of the Booker deal and the deteriorating UK consumer outlook. Chairman John Allan appealed for patience at the company's annual shareholders' meeting. If we can see this turnaround through...we will see significantly better share prices in the future, he said.

The U.S. Justice Department sued FCA last month, accusing the Italian-American automaker of illegally using software to bypass emission controls in 104,000 diesel vehicles sold since 2014, in a move that could potentially lead to heavy fines. The company has proposed a software update as part of certifying 2017 diesel models to allow them to go on sale and then use that fix to update the 104,000 vehicles on the road. Asked whether it could take months to get U.S. authority approval for the software fix, as suggested by a U.S. Justice Department lawyer this week, Marchionne said we are much closer than this. When we made the proposal, we were ready to implement the fix immediately ... now it depends on them, Marchionne told journalists on the sidelines of a meeting in Venice of the U.S.-Italy council. We are talking to them ... we think we have a viable solution.      He said the company had not made any provisions for any potential fines, adding it was impossible to try estimate. Part of the 2018 business plan, which is centered around the revamp of its Jeep, Maserati and Alfa Romeo brands, is erasing all debt and accumulating at least 4 billion euros ($4.5 billion) of cash by the end of next year.  After failing to strike a much sought alliance for FCA, Marchionne has made executing the 2018 plan his core ambition before he steps down at the end of his tenure early in the following year. When asked whether he could rethink his decision to quit in early 2019 given political and market uncertainties surrounding his company, Marchionne, who turns 65 on Saturday, said No. He said there was a wide and deep bench of possible internal candidates to succeed him, and did not exclude the possibility of his powers being divided among several managers, although added this would be up to the board to decide. My job is not easy, it's a bit loaded, he said.  Marchionne said the second quarter was going in line with expectations and confirmed the targets for the full year.  Widely credited with reviving one of Italy's top corporate names and rescuing U.S. Chrysler from bankruptcy, Marchionne has seen pressure mounting in recent months, with the U.S. market at its peak and legal challenges launched in the United States and in Europe over the company's emissions credentials.  His ambition to tie up with General Motors (GM.N) to share the costs of making cleaner and more autonomous vehicles has been repeatedly rebuffed. While Marchionne briefly flirted with the idea of a tie-up with Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE), he reiterated on Friday that there were no talks with anyone at present. He stressed, however, that a merger for FCA was ultimately inevitable to be able to compete, although it might not happen during his tenure.  The only way you’re going to get that is by mass, there is no other solution, he said. Being small, cute is going to do nothing. Go home, go to a beauty parlor and do something else. Asked whether FCA felt the same investor pressure that led to the sacking of his counterpart at U.S. rival Ford (F.N) or that which prompted GM to leave Europe, Marchionne said the 2018 plan would be his judge. As long as we deliver on those commitments, you will not get pressured ... people will love you, he said. What they do to you in 2019 is a different story.

Whole Foods' shares rose as much as 28 percent to $42.35, after Amazon said it would buy the company in a deal valued at about $13.7 billion, including debt. Short-sellers aim to make a profit by selling borrowed shares on the hope of buying them back later at a lower price. Friday's spike in Whole Foods Markets' shares cost them $251 million, more than doubling their year-to-date losses to $404 million, data from financial analytics firm S3 Partners showed. Shorts are basically taking it on the chin. They weren’t having a good year, and now their year has gotten decidedly worse, said Ihor Dusaniwsky, head of research at S3 Partners. Whole Foods is the most heavily shorted name in the food retail space, with short interest of 28.1 million shares, or $1.2 billion, nearly as much as Kroger Co, Casey's General Stores Inc and Sprouts Farmers Market Inc combined, according to S3 Partners. Shorts started raising bearish bets against Whole Foods after December, around the time Amazon opened its online grocery store in a challenge to supermarkets. By mid-April, short interest grew by two-thirds to a high of $1.4 billion. I think short-investors thought Whole Foods would just be a casualty of Amazon's food retail expansion and then be bought on the cheap, said Dusaniwsky. Short-sellers may have been hoping to make money as Whole Foods shares fell due to increased competition from Amazon and then snap up the grocery store's shares on the cheap as they waited for a buyer to emerge, Dusaniwsky said. I don’t think the shorts thought Amazon would go brick-and-mortar. In early April, JANA Partners, an activist hedge fund led by Barry Rosenstein, disclosed a nearly 9 percent stake in Whole Foods. One of the hedge fund’s suggestions was that the grocery store could put itself up for sale. The hedge fund held 26.1 million shares as of May 27.

While Whole Foods bonds bounced on news of the US$13.7bn takeover by one of the most famous companies in the world, most of the rest of retail took a pasting in bonds and equities alike. Amazon's peer Walmart saw its share price down more than 6% within an hour of the news, while stock in grocery chain Kroger was off more than 15%. On the fixed income side, bonds across the retail sector were thumped by news of the acquisition, which was expected to squeeze margins in a sector with precious little room to give. Kroger (Baa1/BBB) was one of the hardest hit in investment grade, as its bonds gapped out up to 29bp shortly after the news, according to MarketAxess data. In high yield, meanwhile, organic Whole Foods rival The Fresh Market's bonds fell as much as 3.8 points to 83.9 cents on the dollar. And there was plenty of hurt outside the grocery space, with outstanding bonds from clothing retailer JC Penney and pharmacy chains Rite-Aid and CVS also clobbered in secondary trade. There is pressure on everybody, said Renato Latini, a credit analyst at asset manager Brandywine Global. Amazon are going to source products. If their technology applies down the supply chain - and to the extent that is proprietary - they could pinch the competition. Retail of Woe Retail has been the only sector to have a negative return in the junk bond space this year, as consumers increasingly shun brick-and-mortar stores in favour of online shopping. According to data from JP Morgan, US retail high-yield bonds posted negative returns of 0.31% as of June 9, compared to gains of 4.58% for US junk bonds as a whole. While clothing retailers have suffered, the problems have also been acute for grocery chains, which have been dealing with fierce competition, falling food prices and declining same-store sales. Retail is already a highly competitive sector with pretty thin margins, especially in the grocery space, said Matt Kennedy, head of corporate credit at Angel Oak Capital Advisors. Before news of the acquisition broke on Friday, Whole Foods had been under pressure from activist hedge fund Jana Partners, one of the largest shareholders with a roughly 8% stake. Whole Foods shares had been trading at about US$65 in October 2013, but plunged to around US$27 in September of last year. With Jana agitating for change, the company turned to investment bank Evercore Partners to advise on strategy, sources told IFR. According to a filing, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America Merrill Lynch provided a 364-day senior unsecured bridge term loan facility of up to US$13.7bn to help fund the acquisition. Some of that is expected to be taken out in the bond market. The acquisition is expected to close in the second half of 2017. One head of bond syndicate at a Wall St bank, not directly involved in the financing, said it may be a few weeks before a bond deal is launched. And while much of the retail sector was pounded on the news, Amazon saw its shares up 3% while Whole Foods shares jumped more than 27%. The only outstanding Whole Foods bonds, a US$1bn 5.2% 2025 issue, was quoted more than 100bp tighter after the deal was announced. Whole Foods sits on the cusp of junk status with a Baa3 rating from Moody's and a BBB minus from S&P.; But the agencies have differing views on Amazon, rated Baa1 by Moody's and AA- by S&P.; They are being bought by Amazon, which you can consider a Single A credit, one trader told IFR.

Amazon has already been expanding its Fresh grocery delivery business in European cities such as London and Berlin, but its purchase of a bricks-and-mortar supermarket chain, even one as small in Europe and high-end as Whole Foods, raises the prospect of tougher competition and more acquisitions. To hear that it's actually buying an existing retailer confirms its intentions in the area and that obviously leads to further competition in what is already a fiercely competitive market, said Laith Khalaf, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. Large European retailers' shares were down in afternoon trading. Ahold Delhaize closed down 9 percent in Amsterdam due in part to its large U.S. exposure, but Tesco was down 5 percent in London and Carrefour was down 3 percent in Paris. The news shook a grocery sector that is already grappling with consumer unease, currency volatility, geopolitical uncertainty and increased competition from the German hard discounters Aldi and Lidl. Shares were already wobbly on Friday following a big profit warning from Kroger, the largest U.S. operator. People are very nervous. And then they see this and they think – 'if online is going to kill offline, what am I doing in the sector? Sell', said Fernand de Boer, analyst at Petercam in Amsterdam. The news also has implications longer term, as some saw the acquisition of Whole Foods, whose only European stores are nine in Britain, as merely a first step. Clearly whoever and whatever Amazon looks at, the fallout from that is who they don't take over, said Shore Capital analyst Clive Black in London. Amazon has the ability to put the fear of God in any of its competitors. Black estimated it would still be a couple years before Amazon might buy another large British grocer, as it will need time to integrate Whole Foods with its existing food business. I would have thought it'd be somewhere down the line but who knows. Amazon's got the resource capability to buy whatever it wants. He said the move also suggests that the future of grocery retail is not just online, where profits are gobbled up by the complex and costly need to deliver food. Still, internet sales of food and drink exceeded $74 billion last year worldwide, up from $29 billion in 2011, according to Euromonitor International, which predicts it to reach $116 billion by 2021. Though large, e-commerce still only represents a small fraction of overall grocery shopping. South Koreans do the most shopping online, according to a report last year by Kantar Worldpanel, which said online accounted for 17 percent of overall grocery sales there. Japan and Britain are No. 2 and 3, both clocking in at around 7 percent. Reporting by Martinne Geller, editing by David Evans"

Kazakhstan is seeking $1.6 billion from the consortium of foreign investors operating Karachaganak, according to a 2016 report by Lukoil. The Astana government has said the dispute was about calculations of the parties' shares in the field's output. But Energy Minister Kanat Bozumbayev, who spoke to reporters separately on Friday, said the dispute, which Kazakhstan has taken to international arbitration, would have no effect on the project which aims to ensure that the field maintains its peak output for a longer period. I have met a delegation of the Karachaganak consortium today, he said. They do not link these two issues. Eni and Royal Dutch Shell each own 29.25 percent of the Karachaganak project in northwest Kazakhstan, which they jointly operate. Kazakh state-owned KazMunayGaz owns 10 percent, Chevron Corp 18 percent and Lukoil 13.5 percent. One of the world's largest oil and gas deposits, Karachaganak contains 1.2 billion tonnes of oil and gas condensate and more than 1.35 trillion cubic metres of gas. It produced 139.7 million barrels of oil equivalent in 2016, down 1.4 percent from a year earlier.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/bhp-billiton-chairman-idUSL3N1JC5U1","UPDATE 6-BHP names packaging guru MacKenzie as new chairman","","Jun 16 2017","* BHP under pressure to review structure, dump petroleum(Adds shareholder comment, paragraphs 4-5)","SYDNEY/MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Mining giant BHP on Friday named successful packaging executive Ken MacKenzie as its next chairman, handing him the job of tackling calls to dump its oil business and overhaul the board. MacKenzie, 53, succeeds Jac Nasser from Sept. 1, after activist shareholders have challenged the world's biggest miner to revamp its structure and improve returns. Investors welcomed the appointment of MacKenzie, who said he plans to meet shareholders in the coming weeks to listen to their views. He was seen as one of Australia's most successful chief executives in his 10 years of running Amcor Ltd. Sacha Sadan, director of corporate governance at Legal and General Investment Management - the fifth biggest shareholder in BHP's London listing with 2.48 percent - said he welcomed the announcement of a forward-thinking chairman.  We will continue our discussions on the prospects of the business, he said. Canadian-born MacKenzie presided over a long stretch of prosperity at Amcor, which makes packaging for food producers, industrial companies and pharmaceutical firms, that coincided with the end of a boom period for mining companies. Hedge fund Elliott Management has fired a barrage of criticism at Nasser and BHP Chief Executive Andrew Mackenzie since releasing a roadmap of changes it wants at the company, most notably an exit from U.S. oil and shale businesses. Elliott also wants BHP to collapse its dual listing, and earlier this week called for a board shake-up, blaming long-tenured directors for bad investments and ill-timed share buybacks.  That could place MacKenzie, who joined BHP's board only last year, in good standing. Focused on capital discipline, he replaced 75 percent of Amcor's top 80 managers in his first two years at the company. FILE PHOTO: Australian mining company BHP's new corporate logo, released to Reuters from their Melbourne, Australia, headquarters May 15, 2017. BHP/Handout viaFile PhotoOn Friday, Elliott said it supported the appointment of MacKenzie as a constructive step in bringing much needed change to the direction of BHP. Portfolio managers at another activist shareholder, Tribeca Investment Partners, were not available to comment. Nasser has defended the company's $20 billion investment in shale acquisitions in 2011 against Elliott's criticism.   BHP also faces a significant juncture in the Samarco mine dam liability saga in Brazil, which is meant to be settled in September. In late 2015, a burst dam at Samarco, a joint venture between BHP and Brazil's Vale, killed 19 people and caused the country's worst environmental disaster as mud and waste destroyed a village and polluted the Rio Doce river. Shaw and Partners mining analyst Peter O'Connor said MacKenzie would face a chorus of shareholders seeking change and rejuvenation of the board. He really needs to hit the ground running, he said. Despite being the world's biggest mining house, BHP has a history of appointing executives from outside the sector as chairs. Since 1984 only two out of six chairmen had mining  backgrounds. BHP's shares were little changed on Friday but have suffered a stretch of underperformance against arch rival Rio Tinto. The stock is down about 18 percent from its 2017 peak in late January. additional reporting by Barbara Lewis in London; Editing by Richard Pullin and Adrian Croft"

Some board members at Taiwan's Sinopac are hesitant to sign off on the deal, feeling seller's remorse as the price tag now looks too low, three separate sources with direct knowledge of the matter said. It has been a year since the deal was announced and the foot dragging comes ahead of a June 20 deadline imposed by the U.S. Federal Reserve, which approved the deal in March, although Cathay General, a Los Angeles-based bank, can request an extension. A collapse of the deal could also taint the reputation of Sinopac and Taiwanese banks in the U.S. market, coming in the wake of $180 million in U.S. fines for Taiwan's Mega Financial Holding (2886.TW) for violations of rules including lax attention to risk exposure in Panama. We have asked Sinopac to provide additional paperwork. If they don't do that, they automatically forfeit the deal, said an official at Taiwan's Financial Supervisory Commission. Sinopac needs to explain the full terms of the agreement in a satisfactory way, said the official, declining to elaborate.  The official and other sources declined to be identified as they were not authorised to speak to the media on matter. A spokesman for Sinopac said the company would submit the additional paperwork soon and hopes that the deal will close. The FSC suspended a review of the acquisition application,  according to a Sinopac statement earlier this month, which did not provide further details.  Cathay General did not reply to requests for comment via email.  Nasdaq-listed Cathay General has complained to Sinopac for not trying hard enough to get clearance from Taiwan regulators, said the three sources with direct knowledge of the matter. One of the sources said that the price had looked good to Sinopac last year amid uncertainties about Britain's decision to leave the European Union and the U.S. presidential election. But now things have changed. The U.S. and global economies are showing strong momentum, the source said.  Reporting by Faith Hung; Editing by Jacqueline Wong and Edwina Gibbs"

"https://www.reuters.com/article/lattice-ma-canyondbridge-bingham-idUSL8N1J503H","Former Oracle board member dogged by links to China-backed chip deal","","Jun 15 2017","As the ultimatecorporate insiders, board members are presented with plenty ofopportunities to cash in on their sector knowledge andconnections.","SAN FRANCISCO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - As the ultimate corporate insiders, board members are presented with plenty of opportunities to cash in on their sector knowledge and connections. The case of Ray Bingham, until recently Oracle Corp’s (ORCL.N) second-highest paid board member and executive chairman at U.S. chip maker Cypress Semiconductor Corp (CY.O), shows how taking advantage of those breaks can backfire. The 71-year old technology veteran helped set up a private equity fund backed by China’s central government last fall. In November, the fund agreed to buy Lattice Semiconductor Corp (LSCC.O), another U.S. chip manufacturer, for $1.3 billion – a potentially lucrative coup for Bingham. But the chip deal is in doubt over U.S. national security concerns. On Monday, Lattice and the buyout fund, Canyon Bridge Capital Partners, said they submitted the deal for review for the third time to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). The deal has also cost Bingham personally. His connection to Canyon Bridge has forced Bingham, recipient of a 2009 Financial Times ‘Outstanding Director’ accolade, to relinquish two marquee board seats in the technology sector because of divergent perceptions of whether he faced conflicts of interest in his various roles. On Sunday, Bingham resigned from Cypress' board of directors after the company's founder and sixth-largest shareholder - T.J. Rodgers - sued the Cypress board and launched a proxy contest to remove Bingham from the board. Rodgers alleged Bingham faced irreconcilable conflicts of interest because of his involvement with Canyon Bridge.  Bingham, in the Cypress announcement of his stepping down, cited this contest as a distraction. It came three months after he gave up his seat on Oracle's board of directors due to controversy over him moonlighting for Canyon Bridge. “Throughout the process (of joining Canyon Bridge), Ray conducted himself with transparency. He discussed his plans to join Canyon Bridge with Cypress' board and outside legal counsel, who concluded there was no conflict and was given the green light to join,” a Canyon Bridge spokesman told Reuters. Bingham himself did not respond to several requests for comment.  Bingham’s reputation in the technology industry helped clinch the Lattice acquisition for Canyon Bridge, regulatory filings show. Bingham was offered a $1.2 million signing bonus by Canyon Bridge, a $2 million cut of its management fees and a 20 percent stake in Canyon Bridge itself. That is in addition to the $890,902 in 2016 he received from Oracle, making him the second-highest paid board director at the company behind founder Larry Ellison, and an annual salary and bonus from Cypress worth $900,000, as well as equity grants worth $4.5 million. Related CoverageTimeline: Canyon Bridge's bid for Lattice SemiconductorThe income from Oracle and Cypress is now gone because of his gamble to align with Canyon Bridge. Bingham continues to serve on the board of two other publicly listed technology companies, Flex Ltd (FLEX.O) and TriNet Group Inc (TNET.N). A Compromising Relationship  U.S. board members increasingly come from business leadership backgrounds. This often presents them with new opportunities that come up through existing roles or previous corporate relationships. This was the case with Bingham, who had done business with China-born U.S. citizen, Benjamin Chow, when Bingham worked at private equity firm General Atlantic LLC a decade ago. Chow set up Canyon Bridge last summer with funding from China Reform Management, a Chinese state-owned investment firm, which became Canyon Bridge's sole investor, according to Lattice’s regulatory filings. For a timeline of events in the Lattice deal, click Chow approached Bingham last August. He believed that a U.S.-based buyout fund with a U.S. partner like Bingham would trigger much less scrutiny by CFIUS compared with a Chinese buyer, Reuters reported in March.  Canyon Bridge’s Chinese state links, first revealed by Reuters in November, were a bone of contention at Oracle. Its board told Bingham in March he could not retain his seat and continue to be a partner of Canyon Bridge, according to Bingham’s deposition in Rodgers’ lawsuit. In response, Bingham decided to step down. Oracle expressed concern that Bingham's affiliation with Canyon Bridge would compromise Oracle's relationship with the United States government, Andre Bouchard, the judge presiding over Rodgers' lawsuit, said at Delaware's Court of Chancery earlier this month, citing Bingham's deposition.  Oracle declined to comment. Chow, approached through Canyon Bridge, declined to comment. A Matter of Interest for the Board Bingham helped Chow set up Canyon Bridge in September and October 2016, taking on tasks ranging from setting up calls for hiring staff for Canyon Bridge to using Bingham’s name, a quote from him, and his phone number at Cypress on the press release announcing the Lattice deal on November 3, according to regulatory and court filings. Bingham was even given signatory authority on a $30 million Canyon Bridge bank account.  Yet he had not yet formally joined Canyon Bridge, and had not let Cypress’ board know. On Oct. 20, Bingham contacted Cypress' outside counsel, Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, to ask if he should tell Cypress’ board he was considering joining Canyon Bridge, according to a regulatory filing from Cypress. Bingham concluded there was no need to do so at that time, according to Cypress. Wilson Sonsini did not respond to a request for comment. Clearly this is a matter that would have been of interest to the other board members, and the fact that Bingham did not come forth with this information prior to that time seems odd,  said Alan Seem, a corporate partner at law firm Shearman & Sterling LLP who is not involved with the case. On Nov. 4, at a regularly scheduled Cypress board meeting and a day after the Lattice deal was announced with his name on the press release, Bingham told the board that he was contemplating joining Canyon Bridge as a minority partner, according to Cypress.  At the same meeting, Morgan Stanley (MS.N) gave a presentation to Cypress' board in which it identified Canyon Bridge as one of the top four most likely acquirers for Cypress out of a list of 30 company names.  Cypress itself had been approached by Lattice twice in 2016 about making a potential acquisition offer, most recently last September, but it turned both opportunities down, according to Cypress. Nonetheless, Cypress said its board concluded there was no conflict of interest because there were no active talks or considerations about a possible deal with either Lattice or Canyon Bridge.  But some Cypress board members could see that there was scope for future problems.  On Nov. 7, Eric Benhamou, Cypress’ lead independent director at the time, told another director that Bingham’s role with Canyon Bridge was “ripe for conflicts [of] interest,” according to a Cypress regulatory filing. In December, Cypress’ board amended the company’s code of ethics to ensure that if Cypress was having significant acquisition talks with a potential target, then any conflicted director would recuse themselves. “Duty of loyalty issues are corrosive. They leave investors with the impression that the playing field isn’t level, said Thomas Lys, accounting information and management professor at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management.

Bingham is quoted in the press release as a co-founder of Canyon Bridge praising the transaction. Cypress first learns of Bingham's status as a partner of Canyon Bridge from the press release. - November 4, 2016: Cypress' board holds a meeting where Bingham tells the board he is considering joining Canyon Bridge as a minority partner part-time. Cypress' board finds no apparent conflict of interest for Bingham, but agrees to continue monitoring the situation. - December 23, 2016: Bingham joins Canyon Bridge as a partner.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia declined to issue an emergency order blocking the FCC's vote in April to reverse a 2016 order limiting the number of television stations some broadcasters can buy. Critics said in a court filing that failing to block the FCC rule will usher in a wave of media consolidation. Andrew Jay Schwartzman, a Georgetown University law professor representing a coalition of groups that had sued, said the decision was extremely disappointing. But the case is far from over, and we feel that we have a strong case once it is fully briefed and argued. Shares in Tribune rose 5.6 percent to $41.23 on the news, while Sinclair was up 3.3 percent to $36.00. Sinclair said in a statement it was pleased that the court denied the motion for an emergency stay of a rule that had been in effect for decades. As part of the $3.9 billion deal, Sinclair has said it may still have to sell certain of its stations, such as those in St. Louis and Salt Lake City, to comply with FCC regulations. Under rules adopted in 1985, stations with weaker over-the-air signals could only be partially counted against a broadcaster's ownership cap. But last year, the FCC, under Democratic President Barack Obama, said those rules were outdated after the 2009 conversion to digital broadcasting, which eliminated the differences in signal strength. It revoked the rules in September. In April, the FCC voted to undo the Obama change. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai also said he plans to take a new look at the current overall limit on companies owning stations serving no more than 39 percent of U.S. television households. FCC Commissioner Mignon Clyburn, a Democrat, called the vote in April a huge gift for large broadcasters with ambitious dreams of more consolidation. She said it will have an immediate impact on the purchase and sale of television stations. U.S. broadcasting and publishing group Meredith Corp spokesman Art Slusark said in April the vote may open up the opportunity for more acquisition opportunities. Its shares rose 1 percent on Thursday. Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Dan Grebler and Tom Brown"
"https://www.reuters.com/article/nestle-confectionery-idUSL8N1JC4WV","UPDATE 2-Nestle may sell U.S. confectionery business","","Jun 15 2017","* Business makes up 1 pct of Nestle sales(Adds analyst comment, background)","LONDON (Reuters) - Nestle (NESN.S) may sell its roughly $900 million-a-year U.S. confectionery business, which includes Butterfinger and BabyRuth, in the Swiss food group's latest effort to improve the health profile of its sprawling portfolio. The world's largest packaged foods maker said on Thursday it would explore strategic options, including a possible sale, for the business that also includes 100Grand, SkinnyCow and Raisinets. Analysts have been speculating that Nestle could exit the U.S. confectionary business which is not in line with its stated strategy of becoming more health and nutrition-focused. That strategy, underlined by last year's naming of a healthcare veteran as CEO, comes as the whole packaged food sector battles a slowdown from a new generation of savvy consumers that are eating fresher and healthier foods. The review is limited to the United States, where Nestle does not control its key KitKat brand, and is No. 4 behind Mars, Hershey (HSY.N) and Mondelez International (MDLZ.O). With annual sales of 900 million Swiss francs ($923 million), the U.S. confectionery business accounts for only 1 percent of company sales. Nestle's other products range from instant coffee to mineral water and baby food. This might seem small stuff, but in our view it could be a significant step by new-ish CEO Mark Schneider ... toward a more deliberate and efficient capital allocation strategy, said RBC Capital Markets analyst James Edwardes Jones in a note. Nestle said it remained fully committed to growing its international confectionery business, particularly KitKat, which is made in the United States by Hershey. It said it would also keep the Nestle Toll House baking products. Globally, Nestle's confectionery business generated sales of 8.8 billion Swiss francs ($9.02 billion) last year. To-Do List The global packaged food industry has seen a wave of deals as companies seek to boost profits in a weak market. Unilever (ULVR.L) is trying to sell its shrinking margarines business after rebuffing a takeover bid by Kraft Heinz (KHC.O), and Reckitt Benckiser Group (RB.L) is selling its French's mustard business to pay down debt from its purchase of Mead Johnson MJN.N, which closed on Thursday.  Nestle had organic sales growth of 3.2 percent last year, which Bernstein analysts said was the lowest of this century and the fifth straight year of slowing growth.   With that backdrop, Nestle has pushed aggressively into areas of health and nutritional science, buying and investing in a range of biotech and medical device firms, as it presses the boundaries between food and medicine. At the same time it has divested underperforming businesses including the Nutrament drink, Jenny Craig diet business and PowerBar snacks. Last year, it formed an ice cream joint venture with Britain's R&R.; Last year, RBC's Jones said a strategic review of the confectionery business should be near the top of the new CEO's to-do list. It's incompatible with Nestle's strategy, margins are falling and its competitive position is anemic, he said. The clear U.S. leader is Hershey, which last year rejected a takeover offer by its more international rival, Mondelez. Reporting by Martinne Geller; Editing by Ben Hirschler and Edmund Blair"

The British outsourcing group hired Goldman Sachs last year to launch an auction process for one of its units, Capita Asset Services, in a bid to raise cash and return to growth after a string of profit warnings, partly due to Britain's vote to leave the European Union. Chicago-based private equity fund GTCR and European rival CVC Capital Partners [CVC.UL] are among a group of three buyout funds which are competing with Link Group (LNKG.PK), a provider of shareholder management services as well as analytics, registry and fund administration services to more than 2,500 clients, the sources said. Another source named European buyout fund BC Partners as the fourth bidder involved in the process, adding that the deadline for final bids is on June 21. Capita, GTCR, BC Partners and CVC declined to comment while Link Group could not immediately be reached outside business hours. Capita has a market value of 4.3 billion pounds and its near-total focus on Britain means that unlike some rivals it does not benefit from the translation of foreign currencies back into a weak pound. Its chief executive Andy Parker resigned earlier this year after the company reported a bigger than expected drop in profits and said it would take until 2018 before it could return to growth. As part of its turnaround efforts the London-based company is trying to simplify its structure, reduce the number of business units and their reporting lines to boost oversight and transparency. The sale of its asset services unit, which serves a wide range of financial institutions including wealth and asset managers as well as banks, could fetch between 700 and 800 million pounds, the sources said. It would help it to reduce its debt burden which stood at 1.7 billion pounds at the end of last year. Capita Asset Services provides everything from shareholder solutions, fund management and loan servicing for all types of secured and collateralized loans.

India is replacing China as the driver of fuel demand growth globally. The International Energy Agency expects India to account for a quarter of global energy use by 2040. BP wants to sell fuels in India in a tie up with Reliance, which operates the world's biggest refining complex and is chaired by billionaire Mukesh Ambani.  We will not do it (setting up fuel stations) alone. It will be in tie-up with Reliance. Maybe we will expand this to jet fuel also, BP's Chairman Bob Dudley told Reuters on the sidelines of an event to announce the investment plan and partnership.  BP has a license to sell jet fuel and build 3,500 fuel stations in India. India's pricing formula gives higher profits to retailers with refining plants or domestic supply sources. Ambani said the partnership would also look at opportunities in trading that could include products such as oil, gas, fuels, liquefied natural gas (LNG), power, and carbon.  Dudley, who wants BP to catch up with production volumes of its biggest rivals Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L), is banking on Indian policy moves and a favorable investment climate to unlock the resources. After eight years, Reliance and BP have decided to invest in the D6 block on the east coast to raise gas output by 30-35 million cubic meters a day between 2020 and 2022. This will help in India's gradual migration to a gas-based economy. This is an important step forward for BP in India. Working closely together, Reliance and BP are now able to develop these major deep-water gas resources offshore India efficiently and economically, Dudley said. BP in 2011 made a foray into India's exploration sector when it signed a $7.2 billion deal to buy a 30 percent stake in some oil and gas blocks operated by Reliance. It also formed gas sourcing and marketing tie-ups with the Indian conglomerate. The gas joint venture is marketing some of the LNG sourced from BP's portfolio. I think that's what we are going to revive and reinvigorate, Dudley said, when asked if BP planned a long-term LNG supply deal with the Indian joint venture.  Dudley said the two companies were not putting boundaries on the expansion of the partnership, which will cover all forms of fuel marketing, retail distribution, and a combination of gas and renewables.

The planned merger would create the world's third-largest aerospace supplier after U.S companies United Technologies and General Electric. Thursday's Safran shareholder vote was a key demand of UK hedge fund TCI, which had waged an intense campaign to block the deal, or at least reshape it. In May, Zodiac accepted a 15 percent cut in Safran's $9 billion offer after Zodiac profit warnings. Safran's original $9 billion offer was weakened by conflicting movements in share prices and a deteriorating industrial performance at Zodiac, though on Wednesday Zodiac eased concerns by reiterating financial targets. Shareholders in Safran had been asked to vote in favour of two mechanisms that will enable the company to issue new preference shares that would then be convertible in ordinary shares after three years. Safran says it is confident of resolving Zodiac's industrial problems after visiting its plants, including a British factory blamed for the latest profit downgrade in April. Safran is offering 25 euros per Zodiac share in cash, down from 29.47 euros previously, or an alternative of preferred shares up to a total of 31.4 percent of the $7.7 billion deal.

We will announce specific deals as soon as they are ready. The Russian stock index on Thursday slipped below the psychologically important 1,000-point level for the first time since late November 2016 on concerns about potential new U.S. sanctions against Moscow.

Atkins, which agreed in April to be acquired by SNC for C$3.6 billion ($2.7 bln), said a strong performance at its North American business helped lift its underlying pretax profit by 18 percent in the year through March to 164.6 million pounds ($209.7 million). Revenue rose 12 percent to 2.08 billion pounds. The results beat analysts' expectations for an annual pretax profit of 158.03 million pounds on revenue of 2.07 billion pounds, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S estimates. SNC-Lavalin, which agreed to buy Atkins at a price of 2,080 pence per share, said last month it would not raise its offer for Atkins unless it faces a rival bid. In April, U.S. activist investor Elliott Capital Advisors disclosed it had taken a 6.8 percent stake in Atkins. Analysts said the strong results justified SNC's offer price and should smooth the takeover process. A gate-crasher to the deal now seems increasingly unlikely, Liberum analyst Joe Brent said. We expect the deal to close prior to the long stop date of 31st July 2017, he added. Atkins, which serves companies including BP and Network Rail, said revenue in North America rose 32.5 percent during the financial year, helped by new transport projects. The company had earlier expressed optimism over its outlook, saying it should benefit from plans by U.S. President Donald Trump to boost infrastructure spending. Shares in WS Atkins have risen 33 percent since the election of Trump last November. They were largely unchanged at 2,073 pence by 0810 GMT on Thursday. The company said its Middle East and energy markets, which have proved to be its weak spots in the first half of the year, performed in line with market expectations during the full year. $1 = 0.7849 pounds

The escalation in the spat between Western Digital, which jointly operates Toshiba's main chip plant, and its business partner follows tense last-minute jockeying by suitors for the world's second-biggest producer of NAND semiconductors. According to a person familiar with the matter, the California-based firm has been left out of a new Japan government-led group being formed to bid for the unit. Toshiba's attempts to circumvent our contractual rights have left us with no choice but to take this action, Western Digital's Chief Executive Steve Milligan said in a statement. Left unchecked, Toshiba would pursue a course that clearly violates these rights, he added. Western Digital has filed its suit with the Superior Court of California, seeking an injunction until its arbitration case against Toshiba is heard. It is concerned about how Toshiba, the Japanese government and other stakeholders are handling the auction process, a second source said. The second source added it had submitted a revised bid on Wednesday that satisfies Toshiba's requests on deal certainty and price but did not receive a favourable response. Toshiba has demanded at least 2 trillion yen ($18 billion) for the unit. Sources declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the negotiations concerning the auction. Toshiba said in a statement that it was proceeding with selecting a preferred bidder for its memory unit by the second half of June as planned and hoped to reach a definitive agreement on a sale by June 28. Toshiba wants to complete the deal as quickly as possible to help cover billions of dollars in cost overruns at its now-bankrupt Westinghouse nuclear unit and to dig itself out negative shareholders' equity that could lead to a delisting. Satoru Oyama, senior principal analyst at research firm IHS, said Western Digital's argument made sense from a common-sense point of view and that developments were moving towards a worst-case scenario for the Japanese company. Toshiba has more to lose in the dispute because it is running out of time, he said. Toshiba and Western Digital eventually have to talk. They cannot afford to keep fighting when Samsung is taking advantage of the NAND market boom and investing massively. A third source familiar with the matter said Western Digital expects to get a ruling on its injunction request by mid-July and that arbitration cases generally take 16-24 months to resolve. A state-backed fund, the Innovation Network Corp of Japan (INCJ), has been at the centre of trade ministry efforts to forge a successful bid that will keep the highly prized unit under domestic control. But the nature of its partnerships appears to be going through drastic changes compared to just last week. It has been in talks with Bain Capital and the group now includes South Korea's SK Hynix Inc, sources have said. INCJ was, however, also part of a proposed bid tabled by Western Digital last week that also included U.S. private equity firm KKR & Co LP, other sources familiar with the matter have said. Other bidders include Foxconn, the world's largest contract electronics maker. Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry, is leading a consortium that includes Apple Inc computing giant Dell Inc and Kingston Technology Co. The highest known bid so far is one from U.S. chipmaker Broadcom and its partner, U.S. private equity firm Silver Lake. They have offered 2.2 trillion yen, sources have said. Toshiba's shares were down 0.5 percent in afternoon trade. $1 = 109.5900 yen

The sale has seen much last-minute jockeying by suitors, leaving the conglomerate little time to come to a decision by its shareholders meeting at the end of this month. Toshiba is seeking a minimum of $18 billion for the world's second-biggest producer of NAND chips and wants to get the deal done as quickly as possible to help it cover billions of dollars in cost overruns at now-bankrupt nuclear unit Westinghouse. Given the jockeying, Toshiba has given up on choosing a winning bid on Thursday to negotiate the deal, said a person with direct knowledge of the matter. Sources had said the company was aiming for a Thursday decision, though a spokeswoman insisted the deadline for the decision was the second half of June. A state-backed fund, the Innovation Network Corp of Japan (INCJ), has been at the center of trade ministry efforts to forge a successful bid that will keep the highly prized unit under domestic control. But the nature of its partnerships appears to be going through drastic changes compared to just last week. Standard & Poor's said on Thursday it remained poised to cut Toshiba's CCC- long-term credit rating because its plan to sell its memory business has yet to materialize and additional losses or financial burdens might still arise in connection with its U.S. nuclear power business. Drawn-out talks over its sale raise the risk of further clouding the timing and amount of the sale if the market or conditions in which the business operates worsen more than the company assumes, S&P; said. INCJ was part of a proposed bid tabled by U.S. chipmaker Western Digital last week that also included U.S. private equity firm KKR & Co LP, sources familiar with the matter have said. But other sources have also said INCJ is in talks with Bain Capital about bidding for the unit, as the U.S. private equity firm appears willing to put in more money than rivals. The Asahi newspaper reported on Wednesday that INCJ was now in a consortium that included Bain, KKR, SK Hynix as well as the Development Bank of Japan (DBJ). Western Digital, which jointly operates Toshiba's main chip plant but is now in a bitter dispute with the conglomerate over whether the auction can proceed without its consent, was not included. The INCJ bid would also exceed 2 trillion yen ($18 billion), the newspaper said. A person familiar with the matter told Reuters on Wednesday that SK Hynix would be providing a loan to help finance the bid although it would not be taking a direct stake. Another person briefed on the matter said the Asahi report was correct on the participants in the consortium. The sources declined to be identified as they were not authorized to talk to the media on the matter. Mana Nakazora, chief credit analyst at BNP Paribas, said the complexity of the situation now meant that the auction could only be settled with the government's intervention. While the makeup of the Japan-U.S. consortium may well change, it's increasingly unlikely that there are other options, she said. Fierce Battle Other suitors are also making last-minute pitches. One source familiar with the matter said on Wednesday that Western Digital was still in talks with the trade ministry over their consortium. The California-based firm has decided to raise its offer to at least 2 trillion yen, a separate source said on the weekend. The CEO of Foxconn told Reuters on Monday the Taiwanese firm was leading a group including Apple Inc, computing giant Dell Inc and Kingston Technology Co. The highest reported bid so far is one from U.S. chipmaker Broadcom and its partner, U.S. private equity firm Silver Lake. They have offered 2.2 trillion yen, sources have said. According to the Asahi report, INCJ, DBJ and Bain would each invest 300 billion yen in a special-purpose company to buy the unit, Toshiba Memory Corp. Toshiba itself would contribute up to 100 billion yen and other Japanese firms a combined 140 billion yen, while KKR is considering putting in 100 billion yen, the Asahi said. It added that SK Hynix would lend 300 billion yen to the project and Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ 400 billion yen. Toshiba, SK Hynix, INCJ, Bain, KKR and a spokesman for the core unit of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc declined to comment. The trade ministry and DBJ did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Shares in Toshiba ended down 4 percent on Wednesday, hurt by a newspaper report that the conglomerate would not be able to file its annual report by the end of this month.

We are looking into this application for a guarantee along with the states of North Rhine-Westphalia and Berlin, a ministry spokeswoman told reporters. She added that presenting a sustainable concept for the future was key to getting such a guarantee. Air Berlin's CEO Thomas Winkelmann said on Wednesday it was a confidential figure when asked for details of the airline's request for loan guarantees from the two German states. We're not looking for any kind of taxpayers' money. We don't want to be state-owned. As management, we look at every opportunity over how to restructure the company, and that includes restructuring the debt, he told Reuters after the carrier's annual general meeting in London. The German carrier, 29 percent-owned by Abu Dhabi-based carrier Etihad, last week asked Berlin and North-Rhine Westphalia (NRW) to consider loan guarantees. German Economics Minister Brigitte Zypries said on Tuesday that the airline was in a precarious situation. German newspaper Welt reported on Tuesday that Air Berlin is seeking loan guarantees of around 100 million euros ($112 million). German carrier Air Berlin's aircraft is pictured at Tegel airport in Berlin, Germany, September 29, 2016.Axel Schmidt/File PhotoAir Berlin is expecting a difficult 2017, Winkelmann told the annual general meeting, but also said that Air Berlin's dominant position in key German hubs made it interesting to players in the European market.     Air Berlin Chief Financial Officer Dimitri Courtelis told the AGM that 2017 would be a transitional year, but the company was targeting positive earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) in 2018. German carrier Air Berlin aircrafts are pictured at Tegel airport in Berlin, Germany, June 14, 2017.Hannibal HanschkeAir Berlin is scrambling to protect roughly 8,000 jobs in Germany, mainly based in Berlin and North Rhine-Westphalia. Winkelmann joined Air Berlin in February 2017, and said on arrival that his aim was to reposition the company. Last year, the carrier made a record net loss of 782 million euros after it faced increased competition from leaner rivals for its traditional routes to Spanish holiday destinations.  Winkelmann has previously said that Air Berlin is seeking a partner, and larger rival Lufthansa, which last year agreed a long-term deal to lease 38 planes and crew from Air Berlin, is seen as the obvious investor.   Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr had previously expressed interest in Air Berlin on the condition that its debt pile and costs could be brought down. Travel agencies, monopoly experts and rival carrier Ryanair have also raised competition concerns over any possible takeover of Air Berlin by Lufthansa.    Winkelmann said that Air Berlin's appeal was based in its dominance in Germany's biggest state NRW and Berlin.  That strong market position is, I think, interesting for a couple of players in the European market, he said. But we can't comment who or what.

Pfizer denied it supplied its lung cancer product at the alleged price of 152,000 rand  ($12,046) and said it would cooperate fully with the investigation. We await the opportunity to be contacted by the Commission to clarify the pricing for this product, it said in a statement. The Commission said it had information that suggested Pfizer's lung cancer treatment cost approximately 152,000 rand for 250 mg when bought through an agent. Aspen, a local company based in Durban, has also denied any wrongdoing, saying it had not increased its prices for medicines used to treat leukaemia beyond the margin approved by the South African health department.

Deutsche Post initially developed an electric minivan dubbed Streetscooter for its own operations to avoid inner-city emissions after growth in online shopping resulted in increased parcel deliveries. But in April it took on carmakers by unveiling plans to step up production and sell to other delivery firms. For the larger van, Ford will supply vehicle technology based on the Transit model, with Deutsche Post keeping assembly, distribution and sales in-house, a Germany-based Ford spokesman told Reuters. The new model is part of a plan to build another production site for the Streetscooter unit and double annual output to 20,000 vans by the end of the year. This step emphasizes that Deutsche Post is an innovation leader. It will relieve the inner cities and increase people's quality of life, Deutsche Post executive board member Juergen Gerdes said in a statement. Advances in manufacturing software are allowing auto industry newcomers such as Deutsche Post, Google and start-ups to tap suppliers to design, engineer and test new vehicle concepts without hiring thousands of engineering staff or investing billions in tooling and factories. Deutsche Post, which is also building a country-wide network of maintenance and repair shops, wants a fleet of at least 2,500 of the new vans on the road by the end of 2018, it said. The postal services group decided to build its own vans after it could not agree on a wider supply contract with established vehicle makers.

The contenders are Mexican chemical firm Mexichem (MEXCHEM.MX); U.S. industrial technologies company Fortive Corp (FTV.N), Singapore's Temasek Holdings [TEM.UL], U.S. tools maker Stanley Black & Decker (SWK.N), Chinese investment fund Primavera and Chinese pipe maker Ningxia Qinglong (002457.SZ). The sale has set a minimum value of $1.5 billion for the company. Netafim said in March it had hired Goldman Sachs (GS.N) to handle a possible sale or public offering of the company. Centerview and Bank of America (BAC.N) were also appointed to advise on the deal. The company is hoping for a valuation of between 10 and 12 times its expected 2017 earning before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of around $120 million, a banking source told Reuters in May. Any offer reflecting a value of more than $1.8 billion allows Permira to force the remaining shareholders to sell their holdings in Netafim, Calcalist said. Kibbutz Hatzerim owns 32.7 percent of Netafim and Kibbutz Magal owns 6 percent. A spokesman for Netafim declined to comment. The date of the third round has yet to be set. Netafim, which has 4,300 employees and 17 factories in 10 countries, provides irrigation products for agriculture, greenhouse and mining applications.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/anbang-group-chairman-profile-idUSL3N1JB2E6","Chairman Wu charts roller-coaster ride for Waldorf-owner Anbang","","Jun 14 2017","* Wu Xiaohui temporarily steps aside after report ofdetention","BEIJING (Reuters) - Founded as a provincial auto insurer, Anbang Insurance burst from obscurity with a $2 billion bid for New York's Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in 2014, casting the company and its ambitious chairman as flagbearers for a new breed of Chinese dealmakers. But its headline-grabbing deals and the connections forged by chairman Wu Xiaohui - from Beijing to President Donald Trump's son-in-law - have invited closer scrutiny. On Wednesday, the privately held company said Wu had temporarily stepped aside, following unverified reports of his detention in China. It has not provided further details. Wu, who married the grand-daughter of late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, has been the driving force at Anbang since founding the company in 2004. The group worked in obscurity before turning to more aggressive financing to catapult it over rivals who rake in much larger volumes of premiums.  Over the past three years, Anbang has secured acquisitions worth more than $30 billion - a diverse list that has raised regulatory questions at home and abroad. As queries grew, the low-profile Wu made more public appearances this year at key events including the annual Boao Forum, China's answer to the Davos World Economic Forum.   On one panel there he playfully sparred with Levin Zhu, the politically powerful former CEO of China International Capital Corp and a former Anbang director, who repeatedly questioned him on the company's finances, attendees reported. Anbang's rise to international prominence has been much like that of modern China itself - meteoric, with mystical origins, and often misunderstood, said Brock Silvers, managing director of Kaiyuan Capital, a Shanghai-based investment advisory firm.  The company was continuously dogged by rumors regarding its capital origins, yet continued to succeed, he added. Hard-Driving, Hands-on Known for his hard-driving, hands-on approach and single-minded ambition, Wu is not the first high-profile executive reported to be targeted or questioned by Chinese authorities. China-born billionaire Xiao Jianhua was taken from a luxury Hong Kong hotel in a wheelchair in January, a source told Reuters. Local media reported the group that took him away were mainland Chinese agents, which Chinese authorities have not commented on.  Fosun chairman Guo Guangchang reportedly lost contact with the healthcare-to-insurance conglomerate in 2015 before re-emerging to say he was assisting authorities in a probe. Wu says he works at least 12 hours a day, and those working with him say calls from Wu at all hours of the day or night are not uncommon. Occasionally, he sleeps in his office. FILE PHOTO: Chairman of Anbang Insurance Group Wu Xiaohui attends the China Development Forum in Beijing, China March 18, 2017.Thomas Peter/File PhotoWe must win the first battle and every battle thereafter as we are representing Chinese enterprises going global, Wu, now 51, told students at Harvard University in 2015. We must have conviction that we can make profit even under the worst case scenario in order to move forward on each investment. Deal or No Deal Many of Anbang's latest deals, though, have faltered. The Beijing-based firm in 2016 offered $14 billion for U.S. hotel operator Starwood but pulled out from what would have been the largest Chinese takeover of a U.S. company. A year later, it held talks with Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law, to develop a New York office tower. That deal foundered amid controversy over the extended family of the U.S. president selling to a politically connected Chinese tycoon. Anbang's $1.6 billion offer for U.S. annuities and life insurer Fidelity & Guaranty Life fell through in April. Anbang had separately sought to list its life insurance business in Hong Kong and invited banks last August to pitch for the deal, sources familiar with the matter said at the time. That too went quiet. Wu's strategy echoed that of famed U.S. investor Warren Buffett - an aggressive pursuit of yield-producing companies, funded by cash from selling insurance products and other sources.  In addition to his international deals, Wu also bought significant stakes in a number of Chinese banks and financial companies. He also aligned with powerful allies. When he set up Anbang, Wu enlisted a small consortium of private and state investors, led by Shanghai Automotive Industry Group Corp (SAIC), the parent of a government-owned automaker. State-owned China Petrochemical Corp later bought a stake. In addition to Levin Zhu, Anbang's original board included Long Yongtu, China's chief negotiator when it joined the World Trade Organization. Wu also turned to Chen Xiaolu, a son of Chinese Marshal Chen Yi, for support. One source who has advised Anbang said Wu worked hard to cultivate connections with politically connected figures and princelings, the children of the country's political elite, including the Deng family.  Even if you marry a princeling, that doesn't necessarily mean you are a full member of the family, the source said.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/europe-debtcollectors-idUSL4N1FR3SE","Debt collectors make Europe's bad loans pay again","","Jun 14 2017","* Graphic on Italian non-performing loans: http://reut.rs/2lKLiwh","* Debt collectors capitalise on Europe's bad debt * Regulators wary of too much consolidation in sector * Seek to strengthen secondary market for NPLs * Graphic on Italian non-performing loans: reut.rs/2lKLiwh By Alasdair Pal LONDON, June 14 (Reuters) - When Heli Vesanto’s Norwegian gym thought she had fallen a month behind on her membership fees, it did not contact her itself but called on one of Europe's largest debt collection companies instead. “Of course you feel a bit of pain opening a letter like that,” she said, referring to fears that her credit rating would be affected, making it harder for her to borrow. The overdue payment letter sent by Sweden's Intrum Justitia turned out to be a mistake by the gym - Vesanto had cancelled her membership - but it was also a window, for her, on an industry that has become familiar to many Europeans. The growing use of debt collection companies in Europe has been a boon for investors in the major firms which have come to dominate the field. Continuing consolidation of the industry has also led regulators to seek to counterbalance their influence. As well as selling debt recovery services to clients such as Vesanto's gym, Intrum and other big European debt collection companies Hoist Finance, also from Sweden, and Italy's Cerved Information Solutions, buy unpaid loans at a discount and recover what they can. They have benefited from the fact that Europe's banks are weighed down by almost a trillion euros of non-performing loans and under pressure from regulators to get those debts off their balance sheets. Shares in Intrum and Hoist have risen by 17 and 30 percent in the last two years respectively. Cerved's share price is up nearly 50 percent over the same period, compared with a 16 percent loss for European banking shares. “Specialisation works,” said Erik Forsberg, chief financial officer for Intrum Justitia. “We argue we will always be more efficient than a bank or telco or a utility. Last month, however, Intrum's share price took a hit after it was forced to row back on its merger plans. In the biggest of a series of tie-ups in the sector, Intrum plans to merge with privately-owned Norwegian firm Lindhoff, creating Europe's largest debt collection company. The European Commission approved the merger on Monday, after Intrum proposed a string of divestments that has sent its share price down 17 percent since May 18. Intrum said they would cut the proposed cost savings of the merger by nearly a third. Also in the regulators' sights is the extent to which the debt collection firms have been able to dictate prices of non-performing loans, to the detriment of Europe's struggling banks. Headwinds Italy's 350 billion euros of bad debt was one of last year's biggest market worries, with the Italian government forced to create a state-backed bail-out fund to tackle rising non-performing loans. In December UniCredit, Italy's biggest lender by assets, estimated that the price of recent deals would allow it to recoup just 23 cents to the euro on its bad loans, far below the 43 cents to the euro average for Italian banks. It then went on to sell a large portion of its bad loan portfolio at just 13 cents to the euro. Nicolas Veron, a senior fellow at Brussels-based think tank Bruegel, said low prices were a market reality and arguably reflected the low value of the loans rather than any fire-sales. But regulators are keen to close the gap between what banks sell their loans for and what the debt collection companies are ready to pay. The European Union is considering plans to strengthen the secondary market for NPLs, which may boost demand and raise their sale prices. On May 24 the European Central Bank said it is encouraging public-private partnerships to improve data quality and recovery processes to reduce asymmetries between buyers and sellers. Veron said he did not think such measures would lift prices that much because their level reflected a tough political and economic climate. Some of the initiatives are helpful but I don't think they will change the prices you get under current conditions. The eurozone's bad debts are finally beginning to fall, according to ECB data released in April, but still stand at some 931 billion euros. The three big debt collection companies' net profit margins, meanwhile, have risen, with Intrum at 24.1 percent, Hoist at 19.5 percent and Cerved at 12.9 percent, the first time the company, floated in 2014, has reported a double digit margin. Intrum said in April it saw pricing pressure from increased competition in western Europe in the first quarter of 2017 hitting its margins slightly, arguing that boosting efficiency should compensate over time. Cabot Credit Management, majority owned by U.S. firm Encore Capital, plans to list as early as this year, according to Sky News, joining its UK-listed peer Arrow Global. We are reviewing our strategic options, but no decisions have been finalised, a spokesperson for Cabot said. Virginia-based PRA Group is also active in Europe. In the United States, PRA and Encore have fared less well than their European counterparts and their share prices have fallen over the last three years. Some U.S. Supreme Court Justices criticised the business models of debt collectors after a subsidiary of Encore tried to collect a decade-old debt from a woman who filed for bankruptcy in 2014. On May 15, the Supreme Court ruled by majority that the woman could not sue the firm. The debt collectors say their success is not due to heavy-handed practices but rather a sophisticated analysis of borrowers' ability to pay. StepChange, a UK charity that helps people with debt problems, said consolidation and stricter regulation meant conditions in Britain had improved in recent years. There are larger, more reputable firms operating and the more unsavoury elements have exited the market, a spokesperson said. But companies should keep the way they do business under constant review, Stepchange said. There is still some evidence of poor practice, including some clients who report pressure to make unaffordable repayments. Additional reporting by Valentina Za in Milan, Francesco

The completion of the acquisition marked the end of Yahoo as a stand-alone internet company, a tech pioneer once valued at more than $100 billion.

The statement represents a new delay for the Inga 3 project, which has struggled to attract financing. Last May, the government announced plans to select a developer by October 2016 and begin construction this month. The World Bank announced it had suspended funding for Inga 3 last July after the presidency took control of the project from the prime minister's office, raising concerns about transparency . A brief statement from the presidency gave no reason for the latest decision, which affects the China Three Gorges Corporation and a consortium that includes engineering giant Actividades de Construccion y Servicios SA . The project along the Congo River will expand on two existing Inga hydroelectric dams and is part of an eight-stage Grand Inga project that would produce a record 44,000 MW at an estimated cost of $50 billion to $80 billion. Proponents say it could one day power half of Africa. Critics say the money would be better spent supporting smaller local plants. The two consortiums have been invited ... to do everything possible to form a single group before submitting an optimized bid, said a statement from the presidency. Of Inga 3's 4,800 MW, 2,500 will be sold to South Africa and 1,300 is earmarked for Congo's mining sector. The remaining 1,000 will go toward meeting domestic demand in a country where less than 15 percent of the population has electricity.

Analyst Natalia Corfield wrote in a client note that a still sluggish economy and weaker prospects for a proposed pension reform could delay efforts to bolster loan book quality. Lenders have wrestled with record provisions since Brazil slumped into a deep recession almost three years ago. Late last month, meatpacker JBS SA's (JBSS3.SA) controlling shareholder J&F; Investimentos agreed to pay a record-setting 10.3 billion real ($3.2 billion) fine for its role in a corruption scandal that seemed to implicate Brazilian President Michel Temer. Shares of Brazil's largest banks have dropped an average of 13 percent since mid-May, when allegations first surfaced that Temer had endorsed the payment of hush money to silence a potential witness and took bribes from JBS. Temer has denied the allegations. Lenders could suffer from their exposure to other companies facing hefty fines as part of a fresh wave of expected plea bargains and leniency deals, some investors fear. Despite the mitigating factors, we maintain our view that expected asset quality improvements have become less likely given the recent political crisis, New York-based Corfield said in the note. Banking sector officials, by contrast, have argued that the events leading to the J&F; plea deal are unlikely to pose any serious risk for the nation's banking system. Some Brazilian banks have held preliminary consultations with prosecutors over how plea deals work, the online service of Valor Econômico newspaper reported on Tuesday. The report did not disclose the names of the banks due to concerns about how investors would react to the news, ValorPRO said, citing a person familiar with the matter. A spokeswoman for the prosecutor-general's office declined to comment.     A presidential decree announced last week would allow Brazil's central bank to strike plea-bargain agreements with lenders that admit breaching the law in exchange for softer fines or more lenient prison terms for their executives. An index grouping all financial shares .IFNC in Sao Paulo's B3 exchange rose 0.4 percent in midafternoon Tuesday trading, reversing earlier losses. Protein Sector Preferred shares of Banco Bradesco SA (BBDC4.SA), the country's No. 3 listed bank, shed 0.3 percent, while those of Itaú Unibanco Holding SA (ITUB4.SA) - the country's biggest lender by assets - added 0.9 percent.  State-controlled Banco do Brasil SA (BBAS3.SA) rose 1.1 percent, while units of Banco Santander Brasil SA (SANB11.SA) dropped 0.1 percent. The government may have to amend parts of the decree to include prosecutors in the structuring of plea deals along with the central bank and the securities industry watchdog, Valor said. According to Corfield, one aspect of concern is the banking industry's exposure to meatpackers including JBS. Overall, JBS and J&F; appear to pose the largest risk to Brazil's banking system, the note said. Together they account for about two-thirds of estimated bank loans to the protein sector. JPMorgan estimates J&F;'s total bank debt at 33.6 billion reais, of which 21.1 billion reais mature within the next 12 months. Most of that comes from JBS, the world's largest meatpacker, the note said. Despite this sizeable amount, an important mitigating factor is the composition of the JBS’s short-term debt, which is largely comprised of trade finance lines, Corfield wrote in the note.

Shaw said it would pay C$430 million ($325 million) to acquire wireless spectrum from Quebecor Media Inc, which is majority-owned by Quebecor Inc, for use in its home markets in Alberta and British Columbia as well as in southern Ontario. The moves are the latest one-two M&A; punch from Shaw, after early last year selling its media assets to sister company Corus Entertainment and acquiring Wind Mobile, which it rebranded as Freedom Mobile in November. Shares of both Shaw and Quebecor jumped after the news, with Shaw up 4.2 percent to C$29.75 and Quebecor up 1.9 percent at C$41.35 in morning trade. It was a good price (for ViaWest), a good strategic move to focus back onto the core, said Jeff Fan, a telecom analyst at Scotiabank, adding that the price they paid for the Quebecor spectrum was at the high end of his expected range. Calgary-based Shaw is locked in a fierce battle for internet, television and telephone customers in the west of the country with Vancouver-based rival Telus Corp. Just by getting low-band spectrum it's not going to put them on equal footing, but it does narrow the network quality gap quite significantly, Scotiabank's Fan said. The spectrum transaction requires approvals from a competition watchdog and the government, and is expected to close this summer. Analysts were calling on Shaw to sell its data center business after U.S. telecommunications firms Verizon Communications Inc and CenturyLink Inc reaped several billions of dollars after agreeing to sell their portfolios last year. Shaw bought ViaWest from private equity firms Oak Hill Capital Partners and GI Partners for about $1.2 billion three years ago. Peak 10 Holding is owned by GI Partners. ViaWest is a Colorado-based data center company which offers hybrid IT and cloud-based solutions. It owns about 30 data centers in several U.S. states including Colorado, Nevada and Minnesota. Reuters reported in April that Shaw was looking for a buyer for ViaWest and was expecting a higher price than its original investment. TD Securities acted as exclusive financial adviser and Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP and Dentons Canada LLP provided legal advice, Shaw said.

Sears Canada's shares slumped as much as 56 percent to 50 Canadian cents in early trading, as investors fretted about whether the company would be able to weather this liquidity crisis before it found a buyer. The company was valued at about C$51 million ($38.5 million)at its lowest stock price on Tuesday, a far cry from the C$1.18 billion valuation when it was partially spun off from Sears Holdings Corp (SHLD.O) in November 2012. Sears Canada, much like Sears Holdings - now its fourth-largest shareholder - has struggled for years to remain relevant to shoppers who have switched to stores that keep up with fast-changing fashion trends. The company has also booked losses as Wal-Mart Canada and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) have stepped up competition. Sears Canada's sales have fallen every quarter since it was spun off from Sears Holdings in 2012. Sears Holdings, in March, also warned about its ability to continue as a going concern. The company said on Tuesday that it would cut 400 full-time jobs at its headquarters in Illinois as part of its plan to save more than $1 billion in costs annually. Sears Canada said it would postpone its 2017 annual meeting scheduled for June 14 to a date it would determine later. The company's cash and estimated cash flows from operations were not expected to be enough to meet obligations over the next 12 months, it said in a statement. The company said it had expected to be able to borrow up to an additional $175 million, which was secured against its owned and leased real estate, as part an existing loan. Based on current talks with lenders, however, it expects that it will be able to borrow up to $109 million. Sears Canada said it had recently begun a process to address its liquidity situation to continue to finance its business and had hired BMO Capital Markets to assist with the restructuring process.

Around 400 retail investors, represented by the Spanish Association of Minority Shareholders, asked Spain's Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office on June 8 to investigate whether Popular's chairman Emilio Saracho and former board member Antonio del Valle misled the market and accelerated the bank's demise, a document reviewed by Reuters shows. The prosecutor's office, which acknowledged the complaint, did not say whether it will pursue the matter.  Saracho did not reply to an email seeking comment and a spokesman for Ve Por Mas, a financial group controlled by del Valle's family, said del Valle had no comment. In a separate development, Spanish consumer group OCU said on Monday it had filed a lawsuit with the High Court against Popular's previous board, in which it alleges false accounting. Banco Popular declined to comment on either action and sources told Reuters there was not yet any joint defense strategy by the former board members and lawyers had not yet been appointed. Asked about the OCU claim on Monday, Popular's former chairman Angel Ron told esRadio: If someone brings forward charges against us accusing us of committing a crime we have never committed, we would respond with the legal tools at our disposal, with calm, knowing that the work has been done well, in accordance with the opinion of the authorities that show that the bank was solvent and that there has been a liquidity problem in recent weeks. As part of the rescue, which involved activating Europe's strict new bank resolution regime, Santander bought Popular for 1 euro, while shareholders and junior bond investors saw their investments wiped out. Any legal action taken against Popular would become the responsibility of Santander, and could take years to resolve based on previous such cases. OCU said it had received inquiries from shareholders who subscribed to Popular's 2.5 billion euro (2.8 billion) capital increase in May 2016. The investors said they were not privy to the correct financial information, it added. OCU sent a letter to the Economy Ministry and Bank of Spain last week asking that Popular's 300,000 retail investors should have any claims heard quickly, rather than the years lawsuits such as theirs normally take to resolve. Rival Spanish lender Bankia was taken over by the government in 2012, just a year after a listing in which hundreds of thousands of small investors bought shares. It was subject to a number of court cases before eventually agreeing last year to pay them 1.5 billion euros in compensation.

Qatar's index fell by 0.4 percent but remained more stable than when the sanctions were announced last week. Qatar National Bank, the region's largest lender, fell by 1.3 percent. Like other Qatari banks, it has been hit by concern that the economic and diplomatic boycott imposed by Saudi Arabia and its allies could reduce its access to foreign funding. However, some other lenders held firm, with Doha Bank up 0.2 percent. Logistics company Gulf Warehousing, which had plunged after the boycott started, rebounded 6.9 percent to 48.80 riyals. Though Qatar's trade has been disrupted, it has kept shipments moving thanks to measures such as changing shipping routes to operate via Oman instead of the United Arab Emirates. Dubai's index rose 0.4 percent as Emaar Properties rose 1 percent, building on gains after last week's announcement of plans to spin off its local real estate business. In Abu Dhabi, the index climbed 0.6 percent as Dana Gas jumped by its 15 percent daily limit to 0.69 dirhams, its highest level since late 2014. Trade in the stock was at its heaviest for three years. The company said it was proposing to restructure its $700 million of outstanding sukuk at much lower profit rates because it had discovered the paper was unlawful in the United Arab Emirates -- a claim that some creditors said they would contest. Saudi Arabia's index was almost flat in thin trade but Gulf Union Cooperative Insurance jumped by its 10 percent daily limit after saying it had cut its accumulated losses to 20 percent of capital from 33.5 percent. Highlights Saudi Arabia * The index edged down 0.03 percent to 6,821 points. Dubai * The index gained 0.4 percent to 3,442 points. Abu Dhabi * The index added 0.6 percent to 4,538 points.

According to Valor, which did not specify how it got the information, Chile's Parque Arauco SA has hired Banco Santander SA to work on a proposal, while Morgan Stanley & Co is advising Fibria, the world's No. 1 eucalyptus pulpmaker. Another potential contender is Suzano Papel & Celulose SA , which is said to have hired two unidentified large Brazilian investment banks to analyze a bid, Valor said. Two bankers told Valor under condition of anonymity that Eldorado's equity could be worth between 3 billion reais and 4 billion reais ($904 million and $1.2 billion). With debt hovering at 8 billion reais, Eldorado could soon be put up for sale after two key members of Brazil's Batista family were ensnared in a corruption scandal, sources have told Reuters in recent weeks. Eldorado lenders are pressing for a sale of the company, Valor noted. J&F; Investimentos SA, the company overseeing the business of the Batistas, has 81 percent of Eldorado. The remaining 19 percent is owned by Brazilian pension funds, Petros Fundação and Funcef Fundação dos Economiarios, and special purpose vehicle FIP Olímpia. There were no immediate comments by São Paulo-based J&F;, Fibria, Suzano or the banks. The media office of Santiago-based Arauco did not answer early calls seeking comment. Last October, J&F; started talks to buy out the stakes that both Petros and Funcef have in Eldorado. Both Joesley and Wesley Batista, the family members that last month entered the plea deal with Brazilian prosecutors, want to speak to bidders of Eldorado first before hiring an advisor for a sale, Valor said, citing banking executives with knowledge of the matter. Fibria seems the most unlikely suitor because a key shareholder, state development bank BNDES, is unlikely to approve a transaction that could shore up the Batistas, Valor said, without saying how it got the information. In their plea bargain, both Batistas ensnared President Michel Temer in a corruption scandal, unleashing retaliatory actions from his government against the group. $1 = 3.3176 reais

LSE expects to increase its profit margin for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) to about 55 percent by 2019, up from 46.5 percent last year, it said in a statement. Chief Executive Xavier Rolet told an Investor Day event that the energised and globally competitive group continued to see growth and investment across all of its core businesses. The bullish outlook comes despite the collapse of a merger that was expected to help it compete better with rivals such as Intercontinental Exchange Inc, and despite heightened uncertainty surrounding Britain's intended departure from the European Union in 2019. Britain's future relations with the EU appear even less clear after Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservative party lost its majority in an election. Rolet made no mention of the vote or its impact in his initial address. Analysts have said the merger collapse showed big bourse deals were off the agenda, but Rolet said asset managers, pension funds and banks want an exchange group with a global reach in a sector that is still a construction site. There is nobody today that has a complete suite of global businesses ... M&A; is probably going to continue. In fact, it never has stopped, Rolet said. The exchange said it would cut costs by 50 million pounds ($63 million) annually until 2019, while operating expenses would remain stable at around a 4 percent increase. The bulk of growth will come from the group's FTSE Russell indexes unit in a sign of how exchanges are diversifying from their traditional trading platforms into what the Intercontinental Exchange calls content. Rolet said there would also be double-digit revenue growth at its the LCH clearing unit, despite threats from the European Union to shift the clearing of euro denominated derivatives from London to the continent after Brexit. New EU securities trading rules known as MiFID II come into effect next January to introduce more open access competition in clearing. Rolet said most exchanges hated it, but this group will be able to take full advantage of that regulation. The group operates the Milan stock exchange and a clearing unit in Paris. The LSE was looking at whether it should buy or build an international central securities depository (ICSD) to have a global collateral framework for customers, after the merger collapse meant Deutsche Boerse's ICSD would not be part of the group, Rolet said. The upbeat outlook, however, failed to stop LSE shares closing down 1.6 percent, when the broader market was only slightly lower. $1 = 0.7891 pounds

In fact, he has nursed it back to improving sales and profits by focusing primarily on organic growth opportunities, and the business remains core to GE. Flannery will take over General Electric Co from Jeff Immelt, who is stepping aside after 16 years as head of the conglomerate he helped steer through the financial crisis but which is now worth a third less than when he took over. On Flannery's watch, the healthcare unit - best-known for imaging and diagnostics - has also expanded into life sciences, offering a range of services to pharmaceutical and biotech companies. GE faces tough competition for its medical imaging machines, which include MRI scanners and ultrasound devices, from rivals including Philips and Siemens, as well as younger Asian upstarts. But a focus on expansion into new markets has helped lift sales at GE Healthcare to $18.3 billion last year, with organic revenue increasing by 5 percent and margins by 100 basis points. Flannery has worked hard to move GE into newer areas of healthcare like life sciences, where GE has emerged as a significant player in helping with the production of biological drugs and cell therapies. Such drugs, given by injection or infusion, are a pivotal driver of innovation in the drugs industry, being used to treat complex diseases from rheumatoid arthritis to cancer. Flannery told Reuters last year he aimed to double down on life sciences, given this business's large and high-margin opportunities. One of the more innovative ideas launched by GE recently is the design of prefabricated drug factories for making complex biotech medicines, an idea it is pioneering in both China and Ireland. GE reckons its off-the-shelf modular factories are 25 to 50 percent cheaper than the traditional plants and can be constructed in just 18 months rather than the typical three years. Some analysts continue to question whether healthcare truly fits with mainstay GE industries like power generation and jet engines, but Flannery's elevation suggests the group is not contemplating ditching healthcare any time soon. In a sign of continuity, GE said Kieran Murphy, who currently heads life sciences, would lead the wider GE Healthcare division - and the company stated bluntly: Healthcare is a key GE business now and in the future.

Last year, Diebold bought its German rival Wincor Nixdorf for 1.7 billion euros ($1.9 billion), creating the world's biggest provider of automated teller machines (ATMs). The company is expected to increase its revenue 2 percent annually through 2020 and raise its earnings per share to $3 or more via $200 million in cost reductions and other benefits from the merger, Barron's columnist Vito Racanelli wrote on Saturday. Diebold's business is seen strained on the notion of declining use of cash in some countries. Cash is growing slowly as a medium of exchange in developed countries, although faster in emerging markets, Racanelli said. Still, demand for ATMs should grow with interest rates and bank profits. Possible U.S. retail growth from sales of self-checkout machines, a strength of Wincor Nixdorf in Europe, would also enhance Diebold's stock, according to Racanelli. Diebold's share price could rise 25 percent to 40 percent in the next couple of years to $33 to $38, compared with Friday's close of $26.80, he said.

As the diplomatic crisis in the region continued, the UAE told its banks to stop dealing with 59 individuals and 12 entities with alleged links to Qatar, and advised its banks to conduct enhanced due diligence towards the six Qatari lenders. Five of the six are listed on the market: Qatar National Bank, Qatar Islamic Bank, Qatar International Islamic Bank, Masraf Al Rayan and Doha Bank. All of them fell on Sunday with Islamic lender Masraf Al Rayan, the biggest loser, down 4.0 percent. Qatari banks have about 60 billion riyals ($16.5 billion) of funding in the form of customer and interbank deposits from other Gulf states, SICO Bahrain estimated; most of this could eventually pull out if the crisis continues. Commercial Bank of of Qatar was the only lender to rise on Sunday, gaining 2.7 percent. Barwa Real Estate dropped 4.1 percent and the Qatari stock index fell 1.9 percent. Last week, it shed 7.1 percent because of the crisis. Meanwhile, the Riyadh index lost 0.8 percent in low volumes, weighed down by the petrochemical sector as the Brent oil price stayed near a one-month low. Ethylene maker National Petrochemical lost 3.5 percent to close at its lowest price since November. Shares of companies that might benefit from index compiler MSCI upgrading Riyadh to emerging market status were relatively resilient; dairy producer Almarai rose 0.9 percent to 82.90 riyals, a fresh all-time high. MSCI will announce on June 20 whether it is putting Saudi Arabia on review for a possible upgrade. In Egypt, the index fell 0.5 percent, easing from an all-time high as some investors booked profits. The largest listed lender, Commercial International Bank, lost 1.1 percent. Dana Gas, Drake & Scull In Abu Dhabi, Dana Gas soared 13.2 percent and was the most heavily traded stock. It has rocketed 46 percent this month on news that it has received a portion of its overdue payments from Egypt and on hopes for its legal efforts to recover money from Iraqi Kurdistan. A 0.9 percent rise by shares in the second largest bank in the region by assets after QNB, First Abu Dhabi Bank, also carried the Abu Dhabi index 0.5 percent higher. In Dubai, builder Drake & Scull rose 1.2 percent to 0.422 dirham; it has risen 5.5 percent since Thursday in unusually large volumes. Former chief executive Khaldoun Tabari has sold his stake in the company to Tabarak Investment, a source told Zawya, a Thomson Reuters publication. Tabarak Investment's stake stands at around 18 to 20 percent after the sale, making it the largest shareholder, Zawya said. In April, DSI said it would sell 500 million dirhams ($136 million) of shares to Tabarak as part of its capital restructuring programme, subject to regulatory approval. The company's business environment still looks tough, according to analysts. Project tendering seems to be muted in 2017, we do not expect any foreseeable significant operational improvements. Overrun costs and doubtful receivables continue to be DSI's biggest obstacles leading to DSI potentially posting some 250 million dirhams additional losses by the end of this year, a note by Al Ramz Capital said last week. The Dubai stock index fell 0.4 percent as 12 shares rose but 18 declined including builder Arabtec, down 1.6 percent. Highlights Saudi Arabia * The index lost 0.8 percent to 6,809 points.

Opel boss Karl-Thomas Neumann plans to resign as General Motors (GM) prepares to sell the business to France's PSA Group (PEUP.PA), German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung (FAS) reported over the weekend. Without citing its sources, the newspaper said Neumann saw the sale as the right strategic step, but was concerned PSA under-estimated the growing importance of electric cars. The source said Volkswagen (VW) bosses were informally discussing giving Neumann, who quit VW in 2013 for the Opel top job, a prominent position, potentially as head of premium brand Audi (NSUG.DE).  VW and Opel declined to comment. Audi CEO Rupert Stadler has come under fire for how he has handled the fallout from VW's diesel emissions scandal. He only received a five-year contract extension last month because of an agreement among supervisory board members that he would not serve out his full term, two sources have told Reuters. Pressure has built on Stadler after Munich prosecutors widened an investigation into the premium carmaker, and after Germany's transport ministry accused Audi of cheating on emissions tests. In an interview with trade publication Automobilwoche, Stadler over the weekend defended his record: The diesel crisis has consumed and is still consuming resources. I'm still convinced that we have initiated the right strategic steps. Neumann, 56, planned to inform Opel's supervisory board about his decision at its next meeting on June 22, FAS said, adding he wanted to stay on only until GM completed the sale of Opel to PSA, owner of the Peugeot, Citroen and DS brands. Opel this week said the 2.2 billion euros ($2.5 billion) deal could be completed as early as July 31, pending regulatory approval from antitrust authorities. Neumann joined GM in 2013 to lead the U.S. carmaker's European operations, which include the Vauxhall brand, after losing out in a management reshuffle at VW. In his former roles at VW, he was in charge of electro-mobility and head of China. ($1 = 0.8935 euros) Reporting by Frankfurt Newsroom; Editing by Georgina Prodhan and Mark Potter"

In a June 9 letter to Mnuchin shared with Reuters, the 27 lawmakers said it would be a strategic misstep to allow the $2.33 billion sale to go ahead. It is critical that CFIUS (Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States) exercise extreme caution when a foreign investment transaction includes the transfer of military proficiencies and sensitive technology to China, the lawmakers wrote. They added: It would be a serious strategic misstep to permit a company like Zhongwang Holdings Ltd to take control of a U.S. aluminum firm like Aleris.  The lawmakers said Aleris was involved in the production and testing of specialized alloys used by the defense industry, and the company's research and technology were critical to U.S. economic and national security interests. Chinese entities, including state-owned or state-controlled enterprises, often maintain relationships with China's military, compounding the risk that U.S. technologies will fall into the wrong hands, they wrote. Additionally, Zhongwang was under investigation by the U.S. Department of Commerce for allegedly evading U.S. import duties, and was being probed by U.S. agencies over allegations of smuggling, conspiracy and wire fraud, they said.  Aleris spokesman Jason Saragian said Aleris did not make defense products in the United States. We believe this letter is based on misinformation, he said. The facts are that the completion of this transaction would result in job preservation and growth for hundreds of US Aluminum manufacturing jobs, he said in an emailed response to the letter.    Zhongwang, backed by Chinese aluminum magnate Liu Zhongtian, announced the deal in August, in a bet by the billionaire that the nascent U.S. automotive aluminum sector will be the industry's next big growth market. Last November, a dozen U.S. senators wrote to then Treasury Secretary Jack Lew urging him to launch a review of the deal by the Committee on Foreign Investments by the United States. Lawmakers who signed the new letter include House of Representative Democrats David Loebsack, Tim Ryan, Gene Green, Debbie Dingell, Seth Moulton, Marcy Kapur, Pete Aguilar, Tony Cardenas, Brenda Lawrence, Norma Torres, Linda Sanchez, and Republicans Robert Pittenger, Keith Rothfus, and French Hill.

The Superior Justice Tribunal, Brazil's top appeals court, rejected on Friday claims by some OAS creditors that the sale of a 24.4 percent stake in Invepar SA be stopped. The decision allowed creditors to convene an assembly on June 22 to decide how to take ownership of the stake, the sources said. According to the sources, who requested anonymity to discuss the deal, the court's decision will speed up talks between the creditors and Mubadala. Under preliminary terms of the deal, Mubadala proposed to inject fresh capital into Invepar to kick-start projects and cut debt, sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters in February. A sale, which could be announced at some point during the third quarter, would trigger a reworking of the shareholder accord between OAS and the three Brazilian pension funds that own a combined 75.6 percent of Invepar, the sources said. The Reuters report in February said Mubadala would pump fresh capital into Invepar to rework that accord, diluting the stakes that Previ Caixa de Previdência do Banco do Brasil SA , Petros Fundação Petrobras SA and Funcef Fundação have in Invepar. OAS declined to comment. Efforts to reach a Mubadala spokesman in Abu Dhabi after working hours were unsuccessful. Some of the OAS creditors that won the right to the Invepar stake declined to comment. Formally known as Investimentos & Participacoes em Infraestrutura SA, Invepar operates toll road, airport and urban mobility licenses, including São Paulo's GRU international airport and the MetrôRio and VLT Carioca urban transport projects in Rio de Janeiro. A new partner would help Invepar cut debt and jumpstart investments that snagged amid Brazil's harshest recession ever, surging borrowing costs and the involvement of OAS in the nation's worst corruption scandal. The creditor group wants to sell the stake for a value north of 2.2 billion reais ($668 million), the sources said. The creditors took control of the stake in exchange for their redemption of 1.25 billion reais worth of OAS debt. $1 = 3.2959 reais

Aseman and Boeing had signed a tentative deal in April. Iran's state news agency IRNA reported that representatives of Aseman and Boeing signed the final agreement in the capital Tehran on Saturday. I am very pleased that after a year of negotiation with Boeing, the contract to buy 30 Boeing 737s was signed today, Aseman CEO Hossein Alaei was quoted as saying by IRNA after the signing ceremony. Owned by Iran's civil service pension foundation but managed as a private company, Aseman is Iran's third-largest airline by active fleet size, according to the CAPA consultancy. Alaei said Aseman was ready to order another 30 of the same planes once the delivery of the first order was finished. IRNA reported that the deal for 60 jets would be worth $3 billion, saying Aseman would pay 5 percent and seek financing for the rest. Boeing has already agreed to sell 80 aircraft to flag carrier IranAir under a deal between Tehran and major powers that led to the lifting of most sanctions in return for curbs on its nuclear technology development activities. Trump has said he opposes the nuclear sanctions pact but has not stated a public view on the aircraft deals reached under the accord.

The U.S. chipmaker is part of a consortium led by a Japanese government-backed fund. The group will present the new offer of 2 trillion yen or more by Thursday, when the struggling Japanese conglomerate is due to choose a preferred bidder for its Toshiba Memory Corp unit, the world's second-largest producer of NAND memory chips, the person told Reuters on Saturday. Toshiba has been favoring a rival bid from U.S. chipmaker Broadcom Ltd (AVGO.O), which has partnered with U.S. private equity firm Silver Lake to offer 2.2 trillion yen, people familiar with the matter have told Reuters. A spokesman for Western Digital had no comment. Toshiba could not immediately be reached for comment. Toshiba had set a 2 trillion yen threshold for the sale as it rushes to find a buyer to cover billions of dollars in cost overruns at its now-bankrupt U.S. nuclear business Westinghouse Electric Corp. The offer by Western Digital, a long-time partner of the laptops-to-nuclear conglomerate's lucrative chips division, comes as uncertainty about the make-up of the groups bidding for Toshiba's crown jewel has increased. Western Digital has been seen by some sources as crucial to successful deal, as it jointly operates a key flash-memory chip plant with Toshiba in western Japan. At Loggerheads But the two companies have been at loggerheads over the auction. Western Digital is pursuing an international arbitration claim that Toshiba has breached joint-venture contracts by entertaining outside bids. FILE PHOTO: The logo of Toshiba Corp is seen behind cherry blossoms at the company's headquarters in Tokyo, Japan April 11, 2017.Toru HanaiWestern Digital argues that the sale cannot proceed without its consent but the U.S. firm will drop its claim if Toshiba agrees to the new offer, the source said on Saturday. Toshiba is concerned an acquisition by Western Digital would run into antitrust objections from China and elsewhere as the U.S. firm is the world's third-largest NAND producer behind South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co (005930.KS) and Toshiba. To counter those concerns, the Western Digital portion of the consortium's new offer will be in the form of a debt purchase whereas the U.S. firm had previously been looking for an equity stake in Toshiba Memory, the source said. The Japan-Western Digital consortium initially offered 1.6 trillion yen, sources have said. CEO Steve Milligan then raised the offer to close to 2 trillion yen on Friday in a meeting with Toshiba CEO Satoshi Tsunakawa, the source said on Saturday. But Toshiba expressed dissatisfaction with Friday's bid. Our concerns about the prospects of success for a deal were not wiped out, a Toshiba spokeswoman said. That set the stage for the latest offer of 2 trillion yen, or more. In Friday's meeting, Toshiba's Tsunakawa asked if Western Digital could further increase the price, the source said, adding that the U.S. firm would modify its proposal, to align with their thinking.  Western Digital's new offer will also include a commitment to $25 billion dollars in capital spending for the joint venture's Yokkaichi facility, including building two fabrication plants, the source said. It will also pledge $39 billion for research and development and money to boost the local economy, while expanding the workforce there by five percent a year for two years, he said.

Rite Aid's share price dropped as much as 16.7 percent after the Capital Forum reported that the Federal Trade Commission's staff was prepared to recommend that the agency file a lawsuit to stop the deal. Shares of Walgreens were little changed. A final decision on a lawsuit would be made by FTC acting Chair Maureen Ohlhausen, a Republican, and Commissioner Terrell McSweeny, a Democrat. A source close to the deal confirmed the report to Reuters and said that agency staff has asked companies and groups concerned about the deal for depositions and affidavits that could be used in a lawsuit aimed at stopping it. Walgreens, Rite Aid and the FTC all declined comment. Walgreens has 8,175 stores, and Rite Aid has about 4,600. CVS Health Corp (CVS.N) is the nation's largest drugstore chain with more than 9,600 stores. Walgreens has indicated it may sell as many as 1,200 stores to smaller chain Fred's as a way to resolve antitrust problems under the proposed merger. David Balto, a former FTC official, said the agency would have a compelling case if it sued to stop the deal and noted that the agency had stopped other big transactions, including a bid by Staples Inc (SPLS.O) to buy Office Depot Inc (ODP.O), which was scrapped last year.  Rite Aid and Walgreens have been waiting for FTC approval since Walgreens made its initial offer in October 2015. In that time, the closing date of the deal has been postponed repeatedly and the offer price has been reduced to $6.50-$7.00 per share, down from $9. In late afternoon trading on Friday, shares of Rite Aid were down 13.6 percent at $3.05, while Walgreens shares were off 0.4 percent at $81.11 The deal would help Walgreens widen its U.S. footprint and negotiate for lower drug costs.

A source familiar with Western Digital said the revised proposal included a significantly increased deal value as well as an investment in Toshiba Memory's convertible debt that could help smooth the regulatory process. The Japan-backed consortium also has commitments in place that Toshiba's essential technology will stay in Japan, the source added.    This group is competing with U.S. chipmaker Broadcom Ltd (AVGO.O), which has partnered with U.S. private equity firm Silver Lake. Toshiba favors the Broadcom bid as it is higher and would avoid antitrust concerns triggered by Western Digital, which overlaps heavily with Toshiba on NAND chips. Antitrust Concerns A senior Toshiba executive said after Friday's meeting that even a minority stake by Western Digital would make it hard to clear antitrust review.  In its bid, Western Digital initially sought a majority but has agreed to limit its stake to 19.9 percent to appease Japan's government. The bid price is still short of Toshiba's threshold 2 trillion yen ($18 billion) and lower than Broadcom's offer of 2.2 trillion yen, they said. Attention is now focused on last-ditch efforts to salvage the government-Western Digital bid.  Two sources familiar with the matter said on Friday the Japanese state-backed fund was in talks with U.S. private equity firm Bain Capital about teaming up in a bid. One of the sources said Bain would replace KKR as the main partner for the state-backed fund. In the previous round of bidding, Bain partnered with South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix (000660.KS).

Sirius XM, controlled by media mogul John Malone's Liberty Media Corp (FWONA.O) will receive three board seats and appoint the chairman. Sirius is prevented from buying additional Pandora stock for 18 months and will not buy more than 31.5 percent of Pandora after that period. A person holds a smart phone with the Pandora app showing in New York U.S., June 9, 2017.Shannon StapletonThe deal ends a strategic review by Pandora and should ease pressure from activist investor Corvex Management LP that goes back more than year. The deal is a new opportunity for Pandora that raises its value, Corvex CEO Keith Meister told CNBC on Friday.  The investment also ends an earlier agreement for KKR & Co (KKR.N) to make an equity investment. KKR will get a $22.5 million termination fee.  Reuters first reported on Thursday that Sirius XM was looking to invest in Pandora after their merger negotiations fell apart, citing sources. While Sirius XM agreed to a standstill agreement for 18 months, it probably does not rule out an outright acquisition of Pandora later, analysts said. Sirius XM's owner Liberty Media, controls a media empire that includes big stakes in sports teams, cable and internet companies. It took full control of Sirius XM in 2013, five years after it first bought a stake. Liberty owns more than 60 percent of Sirius.  The latest investment by Sirius is convertible into Pandora common stock at $10.50 per share, a 23.8 percent premium to its Wednesday close. Pandora also said on Friday it will sell its ticketing firm Ticketfly to Eventbrite for $200 million, less than half of the $450 million it paid last year.  Shares of Pandora were up 1.1 percent at $8.51 in afternoon trading, while Sirius was off 3.4 percent at $5.22 per share. Sirius XM was advised by Allen & Co and Bank of America, while Pandora was advised by Centerview Partners and Morgan Stanley. Reporting by Liana B.

As Britons awoke to news that Prime Minister Theresa May would have to turn to the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) for support after unexpectedly losing her parliamentary majority in an election, the Northern Irish party's website crashed under the weight of curiosity. A giant screen on Sky News asked WHO ARE THE DUP? and data from Google showed searches spiked significantly in the hours after the election results emerged. Some remembered it as the party of Ian Paisley, the firebrand Protestant cleric who once heckled the Pope himself, calling him the antichrist. The DUP forged its combative brand of British nationalism in the Protestant areas of 1970s Belfast as the bloody Troubles pitched hardline unionists fighting to remain part of Britain against mainly Catholic nationalists seeking a united Ireland. Others noted that the party now was one of the most socially conservative in Europe, having sought to maintain some of the continent's strictest restrictions on abortion and consistently opposed gay marriage. It recently backed the right of a Belfast bakery to refuse to make a cake with a gay rights slogan and proposed a law to allow religious business people to refuse to serve people where that would conflict with their religious beliefs. At least one senior party member has defended creationism, the theory that the world was created by God 10,000 years ago. And Paisley once declared the country and western style of dancing as sinful. Same Sex In a pointed Twitter post linking to a speech describing the legalization of same-sex marriage as life-changing, the openly gay Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson reminded the potential new partners of the government that she was a Protestant Unionist about to marry an Irish Catholic. Davidson's Scottish Conservatives went from one seat to 13 in the election, giving the national party one of its few success stories on the night.        On Facebook, a post by a group calling for a protest against the Conserative-DUP tie-up attracted the interest of over 3,000 people. May's former cabinet colleague George Osborne also could not resist a dig with a cartoon in the Evening Standard newspaper he edits which made an unflattering reference to the Orange Order, the group founded in 1795 who march the streets of Northern Ireland every year to protect Protestant interests. The cartoon showed a member of the order in a trademark black bowler hat and orange sash with a tiny, angry-looking May in his front pocket. Editing by Jeremy Gaunt"

The senior unsecured €250m eight non-call three note, upsized by €10m from the originally planned €240m, priced at 6%, the tight end of initial price talk at 6%-6.25%, but only after the deal's covenant package was amended. The notes initially included covenants that allow the company's restricted subsidiaries to make investments in its unrestricted subsidiaries, something which could have enabled Superior Industries, an autoparts manufacturer, to insulate assets from creditors. Those assets could also be used as collateral to back new debt. They have a J Crew-style provision in the documents that allows the company to siphon off key assets through unrestricted subsidiaries, one investor said at the early stages of marketing. US retailer J Crew transferred valuable intellectual property into a Cayman Islands unrestricted subsidiary in December last year. This allowed it to alter its debt and liens covenants to the detriment of bondholders. The possible inclusion of a similar provision in a European deal for the first time raised the question of whether or not bond terms are facing the risk of further erosion. However, the controversial clause was then removed from the notes' documents entirely. A market source said the provision was not purposefully included in the bond's documents but was carried over from a US precedent that had been used to draft them. TPG, J Crew's private equity owner, also holds preferred equity in Superior Industries. The source added that the term was ultimately removed to keep investors happy, particularly given Superior Industries' position as a debut issuer in the market. Increasing Resistance? The deal comes as another demonstration of increasing resistance from investors against aggressive deal terms, which have flourished of late in the supply-short high-yield market, where buyers are crying out for deals. Superior Industries follows bureau de change operator Travelex, which was forced to sweeten the terms of its €360m bond to convince investors in late April, tweaking an aggressive covenant package, as well as extending call protection. Travelex, together with Superior Industries, to me shows a change. There is a shift, putting more power, more negotiating power, in investors' hands with regard to covenants when the book isn't filling quickly enough, said Sabrina Fox, head of European research at credit research firm Covenant Review. However, with both Superior Industries and Travelex widely seen as challenged credits, it remains to be seen whether or not investors will be able to push back on less problematic names. While Travelex's business model had come under fire for the declining demand for currency exchange services, investors questioned Superior Industries' first-quarter sales and the state of the auto market. Several investors said they were not focused on the deal's covenants. A second investor said the primary issue was the company's weak prospects for cashflow generation and leverage level, rather than the covenants. The covenants are something that would put us off if we liked the credit. The first thing we do is decide if we like the credit, then we go into the covenants. The covenants are not make or break for me, he said. Another investor said the covenants did not affect his fund's decision, given the small amount purchased and a rare juicy yield on offer. People should have been furious, the first investor said. The risk with controversial deals from a credit perspective is that people don't like the credit from the beginning and don't read the prospectus. That's what makes it so difficult to push back. Timing Fox added that timing has been playing a key role in limiting investor ability to push back on deal terms, with accounts often having no more than a day or two to review a transaction between announcement and pricing and getting to grips with the terms on offer. Drive-by trades, where a deal prices on the day of its announcement, have also not been uncommon in the high-yield market of late. The most recent issuers to go down such a route have been UPC and Ardagh. Some drive-by deals follow non-deal roadshows, where issuers are supposed to hold discussions with investors without marketing a transaction. I do wonder whether it (non-deal roadshows) will become more of a theme if banks and law firms keep seeing the push-back, Fox said. Is it going to be a way of them avoiding making changes once the deal comes out, because they've already filled the book before the prospectus has been distributed? With European interest rates eventually bound to rise, several bankers told IFR they are pushing issuers to come to the market and lock in cheap rates while they can. Against that backdrop, companies are likely to remain keen to close deals as soon as possible. Despite the trade's challenging nature, market reaction to Superior Industries' deal was positive, with the note trading up to a bid price of 101.540 to yield 5.722% less than a day after it priced, according to Tradeweb data. Proceeds from the bond will be used to refinance the bridge loan Superior Industries took out to acquire Germany-based automotive parts company Uniwheels. JP Morgan (B&D;), Citigroup, RBC and Deutsche Bank managed the trade. (Reporting by Yoruk Bahceli; editing by Philip Wright, Sudip Roy)"

The U.S. private equity firm would replace rival KKR & Co LP as the main partner of the state-backed fund and would be a minority investor in the consortium under the plan being discussed, one of the sources said. Bain submitted a bid in the second-round of the auction with South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix. The current consortium led by the Japan Innovation Network Corp fund is one of two frontrunners in the race for the world's second biggest producer of NAND flash memory chips. The sources declined to be identified as the talks were confidential. A representative for SK Hynix declined to comment. A representative for KKR was not immediately available for comment. Western Digital, which jointly operates a key flash memory chip plant with Toshiba in Japan, has been planning to work with the Japanese state-backed fund and KKR in its proposal. It recently presented an outline of its proposed bid to Toshiba, separate sources said. The Japan-backed consortium is competing with U.S. chipmaker Broadcom Ltd which has partnered with U.S. private equity firm Silver Lake. Some sources say Broadcom may have the upper hand as it has submitted a higher bid that is also likely to invite less anti-trust scrutiny. The Japan-backed consortium was also seen on the backfoot as Western Digital and Toshiba are at loggerheads over the sale of the chip unit, with the California-based firm claiming breach of contract. In its bid, Western Digital initially hoped to gain a majority holding, but has agreed to limit its stake to 19.9 percent to appease the government, the sources said. Toshiba is rushing to find a buyer for the business, which it values at $18 billion or more, to cover billions of dollars in cost overruns at its now-bankrupt U.S. nuclear business Westinghouse Electric Corp.

The European Commission, which rules on issues of competition for the 28-member bloc, said that both companies were developing treatment for insomnia based on a novel mechanism and there would be insufficient competition in this area if one of the two research programmes were discontinued. Actelion's insomnia programme was to be transferred to a newly created company called Idorsia, in which Johnson & Johnson would hold a 32 percent stake. The Commission said this holding would allow it to exercise influence on decisions. The Commission said Johnson & Johnson would have to limit its shareholding in Idorsia to below 10 percent - or up to 16 percent provided J&J; was not the largest shareholder - and commit not to nominate a board member. It would also have to grant Minerva Neurosciences, a partner for its own insomnia research programme, new rights over global development and waive its royalty rights on Minerva's sales in Europe. In view of the specific features of this case, these commitments addressed the Commission's competitive concerns concerning treatments in development for insomnia, the Commission said.
