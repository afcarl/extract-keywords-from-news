Like many U.S. banks in recent years, Bank of America has been reducing its overall branch count to cut costs even as it opens new branches in select markets. New branches are typically smaller, employ more technology, and are aimed at selling mortgages, credit cards and auto loans rather than simple transactions such as cashing checks. Pace said there is one completely automated branch in Minneapolis and one in Denver, both of which are relatively new markets for the bank's consumer business. They are about a quarter of the size of a typical branch. The new branches were mentioned briefly Tuesday by Dean Athanasia, co-head of Bank of America's consumer banking unit, during a question and answer session at an investor conference, but he did not provide details. Athanasia said Bank of America will open 50 to 60 new branches over the next year, though Pace said the bank will also be closing branches in certain markets, so the 50 to 60 branches do not represent a net increase. Bank of America opened 31 new branches in 2016.   Bank of America had 4,579 financial centers at the end of the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to 4,726 in the fourth quarter of 2015 and 5,900 at the end of 2010.

The bank said the licence allows it to conduct private banking including investment, credit and wealth planning advisory services to its ultra-high and high net worth clients. Private wealth in the Middle East and North Africa is projected to rise at a compound annual rate of 8.2 percent to reach $11.8 trillion by 2020, according to research from Boston Consulting Group. The rate of growth is higher than for most other regions including North America, Europe and Latin America. Bank of Singapore has held a presence since 1996 in Dubai through its representative office based outside the DIFC, the emirate's financial free zone. It said its assets under management in the Middle East had doubled and net new money had grown by almost five times over the past three years. Chief Executive Bahren Shaari said the bank aimed to scale up its research and advisory capabilities in the region with the opening of the new branch, due to take place in the first quarter of 2017.

Union National has got approval from China's central bank to convert its representative office into a branch in Shanghai, Mohammed Nasr Abdeen told reporters late on Wednesday after the bank's annual general meeting, making it among the first Gulf banks to have a bank branch on the mainland. The formality will be completed in one month, he said. Union National, the fifth largest lender by assets in the emirate, may also consider expanding in China, subject to central bank regulations, Abdeen said. Union National opened its representative office in China in 2008, the first bank from the United Arab Emirates to do so. National Bank of Abu Dhabi and Emirates NBD  have also set up representative offices in China. The lender also plans to expand aggressively in Egypt by opening more branches this year, Abdeen said, without specifying how many. Egypt is a good market for us and the bank has gained confidence of the market, he said, adding it has 42 branches in the country. The bank has no plans to enter any new markets. It has one branch in Qatar and another in Kuwait. Abdeen said the bank was unlikely to be impacted this year by high cost of funding, like it faced last year. Union National's full-year 2016 profit attributable to equity holders fell 15.1 percent. The main factor for reduction of profit, in addition to provisions was the cost of funds. I don't expect that this year, because the high cost of the previous year will be shifted to the loans, he said. The AGM approved a 20 percent cash dividend (2016) for shareholders.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/morocco-banks-idUSL8N1IP6CO","Morocco opens first Islamic bank branch months after approval","","May 23, 2017 /  6:15 PM / in 2 months","","RABAT, May 23 (Reuters) - The first Islamic bank in Morocco, Umnia Bank, has opened its doors five months after the country's central bank approved requests to open Islamic financial institutions. Islamic banks and insurers are setting up in Morocco after new legislation allowed them into the market, and the central bank has set up a central sharia board, a body of Islamic scholars, to oversee the sector. The North African country long rejected Islamic banking because of concern about Islamist movements, but its financial markets lack liquidity and foreign investors, and Islamic finance could attract both of those. Umnia Bank, a joint venture of Qatar International Islamic Bank (QIIB) and Moroccan lender Credit Immobilier et Hotelier S.A. (CIH Bank), opened a total of three agencies in the country on Monday, including two in Casablanca and one in Rabat. The bank plans to open more branches throughout the country, it said in a statement. On Tuesday afternoon, Umnia Bank's branch in Rabat attracted a significant amount of clients, including people simply curious about Islamic financing. I have an account with CIH Bank and I just came by here to learn more about what the difference is, said one client. Umnia Bank, attached next to a CIH Bank branch, is just a few blocks away from the forthcoming Dar Assafaa, Attijariwafa Bank's Islamic finance subsidiary. As a Muslim, I'm happy we finally have Islamic banks in the country, said Ritaj, a mother of three, who drove three hours from Tangiers to open an account. The branch was still ironing out technical problems. The director still had not received details for a prospective client about margins for a murabaha transaction -- one of the Islamic instruments that is compliant to sharia law. Morocco is the most advanced of North African neighbours in developing Islamic finance. Tunisia and Algeria are also starting to explore the banking based on religious principles which avoid interest and pure monetary speculation. Islamic finance has been growing over the past decade as it broadens its investor base across the Middle East, North Africa, Africa and southeast Asia, tapping into conservative religious clients.

The bank, part of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, has played a central role in the Saudi government's recent financing activity, in April helping to arrange a $10 billion loan, while Mitsubishi UFJ in October helped with its $17.5 billion international bond sale. The bank also signed an agreement in September with Saudi Aramco IPO-ARMO.SE to assist and collaborate in the company's future development. The oil giant is targeting 2018 for what is expected to be the world's biggest initial public offering. Saudi state news agency SPA said the cabinet licenced the bank to open a branch in the kingdom and authorised the Minister of Finance to decide on any subsequent request to open other branches. Saudi Arabia and Japan have strong trading ties, with Japan's oil and gas procurement from Saudi Aramco accounting for more than 30 percent of Japan's total imports for the sector, according to a release from the bank in September. Banking licences in the kingdom are granted relatively infrequently. Qatar National Bank was the last foreign bank to be permitted to open a branch in September 2015. Out of the 13 foreign banks listed on the central bank's website as being licenced to operate, five are Gulf lenders - two from Bahrain and one each from Kuwait, the UAE and Oman. Other international lenders include JP Morgan, Deutsche Bank and BNP Paribas. Other Asian banks with licences include Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, State Bank of India and National Bank of Pakistan. Reporting by Tom Arnold, editing by Louise Heavens"

As it is planned, the bank in Serbia will be the central office for the Balkans, Eastern and Western Europe, the central bank said in a statement on Friday. China is strengthening its economic presence in Serbia with more than 20 finance and infrastructure deals, including currency swaps, renewable energy, highway construction. In April, Hebei Iron & Steel Group signed a 46 million euro ($52 million) agreement to buy a loss-making Serbian steel plant. The Bank of China will have to secure final approval and an operating licence, and be listed in Serbia's Business Registry, before it can begin operations in Serbia, the central bank said. Some 22 foreign bank branches in Serbia are already registered as domestic legal entities and must comply with central bank requirements. China is also boosting its economic presence in the wider Balkans with its One Belt, One Road initiative, intended to open new trade links for Chinese firms as the domestic economy slows.

The citizens of France have trusted you with leading the country at a difficult time for Europe and the whole world community, Putin told Macron, whose staff had accused Russia during the campaign of trying to damage their candidate. The Kremlin said Putin told Macron in a congratulatory telegram: The growth in threats of terrorism and militant extremism is accompanied by an escalation of local conflicts and the destabilization of whole regions. In these conditions it is especially important to overcome mutual mistrust and unite efforts to ensure international stability and security. Late on Friday, 1-1/2 days before polls opened, Macron's campaign said it had been the target of a massive computer hack that dumped internal campaign emails online. A New York-based cyber intelligence consultancy, Flashpoint, said there were indications a hacker group with ties to Russian military intelligence was behind the attack.  Putin has repeatedly denied interfering in the elections of any foreign countries, and rejected previous allegations about Kremlin-backed hacking operations. Earlier in the campaign, a Macron aide had said Russia was mounting a campaign to disseminate fake news via cable television and social media to discredit Macron and help his rivals. Putin had spoken favorably about Macron's conservative rival Francois Fillon, who had said he wanted a reset of frayed relations with Russia. Later, after Fillon's prospects faded under the weight of a nepotism scandal, Putin took the unusual step of granting a Kremlin audience to far-right candidate Marine Le Pen, who was Macron's opponent in Sunday's run-off. She told reporters after meeting Putin that if victorious, her first act would be to think about lifting the sanctions that the European Union imposed on Russia after it annexed Ukraine's Crimea peninsula three years ago. Macron's victory extends a losing run for Putin, who had banked on political upheaval in Western capitals bringing in new leaders better disposed toward Russia. He is expected to run for re-election next year, and a lifting or easing of Western sanctions would help him secure a strong mandate from Russian voters, who are feeling the pain from an economic slowdown made worse by the sanctions. During the U.S. presidential campaign, Putin spoke in glowing terms about Donald Trump. U.S. intelligence officials alleged Russia actively tried to help Trump's campaign by hacking his opponents' emails. Russia has denied that.

HSBC, the world's sixth-largest bank by assets, announced in 2015 that it would hire 4,000 new staff and invest billions to make the Pearl River Delta (PRD) its gateway to China, a retail and corporate banking push that bet on a tech boom, infrastructure spending and a growing middle class. It is, as Chief Executive Stuart Gulliver reminded shareholders in Hong Kong on Monday, a key plank of the bank's global strategy to improve profits by focusing on markets with stronger economic growth. PRD already generates more than 10 percent of China's GDP and over a quarter of its exports. On the ground, HSBC still has a mountain to climb. In a rundown mall in Houjie, a factory town in the urban sprawl of Dongguan, the HSBC branch stands out with its bright posters and smiling receptionist, but only a handful of customers an hour crossed the threshold during a Reuters visit last week. At the nearby Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) branch in Changan, dozens rolled up in a similar period. Large local rivals in the PRD, most state-backed, each have more than 1,000 branches to HSBC's 114 including Guangdong, and they don't have the headache of the tough compliance rules that HSBC has to follow to safeguard its international business. It's a headache the bank has to pass on to prospective customers. A factory owner who gave his surname as Luo said he opened an HSBC account last year to facilitate his business making wooden floorboards and panels for clients in Hong Kong, where HSBC was founded in 1865. Luo, who spoke to Reuters as he was leaving the Houjie branch, represents the kind of affluent Chinese customer with business in Hong Kong that the bank is keen to snag. But opening a bank account was quite a lot of trouble, he said, and took nearly two weeks. HSBC's customer-checking procedures have got tighter in recent years after it was hit with billions of dollars in fines in the U.S. for lapses in anti-money laundering controls. A HSBC staff member at the branch, who declined to be named, confirmed that customer background checks can take longer than at local banks that have no or negligible U.S. business at risk and are not subject to global regulatory scrutiny. Making Progress HSBC says it is pleased with its progress in China. At the start of April it had 150,000 credit cards in circulation, having begun to issue them in December, mostly after digital applications. It has also launched online trading and banking over social media platform WeChat. We do not intend to compete on a traditional basis in PRD. Absolute branch numbers and footfall will not be our measure, said Kevin Martin, HSBC's Asia Pacific head of retail banking and wealth management. But that's a game its big rivals are also playing; ICBC, for example, has offered WeChat banking since 2013. Since HSBC announced its strategy in June 2015, China's slowing growth and a stock market crash have prompted a rethink on the pace of expansion. CEO Gulliver said last year it would take on the 4,000 new regional hires over five years, not three, as initially planned. Quite rightly, management felt at that time they didn't want to achieve the strategy by taking on more risk, Sam Laidlaw, an independent board member at HSBC, told Reuters. Investors remain broadly positive. It's not an overnight thing, and of course everyone wants it to be faster. The (China) strategy should be pursued – but it is only one of many strategies for HSBC, said Hugh Young, Singapore-based fund manager at Aberdeen Asset Management, HSBC's 6th-largest shareholder. And what figures the bank has disclosed for 2016 are encouraging, albeit from a low base; it said in its annual report that its number of retail banking and wealth management clients and its mortgage loan book in the area had both increased by 51 percent during the year. But it also has some battles with red tape to win. The lender is still waiting for approval for its securities business venture with a state-owned fund in the PRD, more than a year after it announced the partnership. And some say the bank remains something of an outsider. At the Ling Jia Property Agency, a few metres from HSBC's Houjie branch, realtor Yi Linfeng said most of his customers use ICBC for mortgages. None, he says, have ever used HSBC. I think they mostly have foreign customers from Taiwan and Hong Kong. Additional reporting by Carolyn Cohn in London; Editing by

Some customers, like Way Zhi, a 28-year-old who helps run a family trading business, welcome the peace -- you don't have to waste a few hours each time like in local banks, he said -- but it is a reminder that HSBC has some way to go to scale up. Large local rivals in the PRD, most state-backed, each have more than 1,000 branches to HSBC's 114 including Guangdong, and they don't have the headache of the tough compliance rules that HSBC has to follow to safeguard its international business. It's a headache the bank has to pass on to prospective customers. A factory owner who gave his surname as Luo said he opened an HSBC account last year to facilitate his business making wooden floorboards and panels for clients in Hong Kong, where HSBC was founded in 1865. Luo, who spoke to Reuters as he was leaving the Houjie branch, represents the kind of affluent Chinese customer with business in Hong Kong that the bank is keen to snag. But opening a bank account was quite a lot of trouble, he said, and took nearly two weeks. HSBC's customer-checking procedures have got tighter in recent years after it was hit with billions of dollars in fines in the U.S. for lapses in anti-money laundering controls. A HSBC staff member at the branch, who declined to be named, confirmed that customer background checks can take longer than at local banks that have no or negligible U.S. business at risk and are not subject to global regulatory scrutiny.

The lender is still waiting for approval for its securities business venture with a state-owned fund in the PRD, more than a year after it announced the partnership.

HSBC, the world's sixth-largest bank by assets, announced in 2015 that it would hire 4,000 new staff and invest billions to make the Pearl River Delta (PRD) its gateway to China, a retail and corporate banking push that bet on a tech boom, infrastructure spending and a growing middle class. It is, as Chief Executive Stuart Gulliver reminded shareholders in Hong Kong on Monday, a key plank of the bank's global strategy to improve profits by focusing on markets with stronger economic growth. PRD already generates more than 10 percent of China's GDP and over a quarter of its exports. On the ground, HSBC still has a mountain to climb. In a rundown mall in Houjie, a factory town in the urban sprawl of Dongguan, the HSBC branch stands out with its bright posters, colorful pamphlets for credit cards and smiling receptionist, but only a handful of customers an hour crossed the threshold during a Reuters visit last week. At the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (601398.SS) (ICBC) branch in nearby Changan, dozens rolled up in a similar period.

Our customers still want to visit us, Jonathan Velline, Wells Fargo's head of ATM and store strategy, told Reuters in an interview. They're still coming to our stores and our ATMs at pretty consistent rates.  Bankers across the industry share that view.

The United States falls somewhere in the middle among developed nations in terms of how aggressively its banks have been slimming down, according to the International Monetary Fund's population-adjusted data. They have cut relatively more branches than banks in Germany, France or Canada, but not nearly as many as those in Greece, Ireland, Spain or Italy.  While other factors are at play, one difference is that U.S. customers still routinely use checks and need branches to process them, said Rick Spitler, managing director at consulting firm Novantas.

This thesis…that we have mobile banking and high-tech banking, therefore the branch offices are dinosaurs and going away appears to be substantially overstated, he said.

Reflections are seen in the windows of a Bank of America branch in New York, U.S. on October 8, 2008.Lucas Jackson/File PhotoThe traditional branch costs roughly $2-4 million to set up and $200,000-400,000 per year to operate, according to Ed O'Brien, an analyst at Mercator Advisory Group. For big banks with thousands of branches – many of them clustered in pricey urban centers – it can get expensive.  For instance, an eight block stretch near Manhattan's Penn Station houses 14 bank branches - Astoria Bank, Apple Bank, Capital One, Citibank, HSBC, PNC, TD Bank, Sterling National Bank, Wells Fargo, two Bank of America branches, and three Chase branches.  Yet bank executives argue that, in a competitive market, they need to be footsteps away from the best customers.  Executives at JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), the country's largest bank, say each branch earns about $1 million in annual profit, but takes a decade to reach its full potential.  Chase bankers regularly scrutinize data on branch foot traffic and what customers do while inside to determine whether a location should remain open, shut down or shrink.  The bank has shut 265 locations since 2013, roughly 5 percent of its network, but executives insist that branches remain essential for JPMorgan's relationships with customers. They are the best way to sell clients many products and services ranging from mortgages to investment advice, according to Gordon Smith, JPMorgan's head of consumer and community banking.  Often I will be asked why don't we just accelerate closings. Why don't we close 400 or 500 branches? Smith said at the 2016 investor day. The answer is that customers won't go there.  John Elmore, vice chairman of community banking and branch delivery at U.S. Bancorp, says branches are especially important for small businesses that need to deposit cash frequently, prefer to negotiate loans in person, or want strategic advice.  Proximity to their business is a very, very important factor to their bank selection and their continuing relationship with a bank, Elmore told Reuters.  Cost Questions  Banks do keep trying to steer customers to digital tools.  They have reduced the number of tellers and moved them to the back. Their ATMs can perform more sophisticated tasks and banks have developed nifty mobile apps for routine banking needs. They are even experimenting with digital loan underwriting.  Yet customers still expect contact with bank staff and JPMorgan recently had to hire more tellers after customer complaints.  JPMorgan and Wells Fargo data show most customers visit branches several times every quarter, though younger clients tend to visit less often.  It may be too early to tell what happens in the long run when a big bank shutters many branches.  Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), which has closed a quarter of its branches since 2009, could eventually serve as a test case. The bank says it is done with cuts, but Keefe Bruyette & Woods analyst Fred Cannon calls for more.

While other factors are at play, one difference is that U.S. customers still routinely use checks and need branches to process them, said Rick Spitler, managing director at consulting firm Novantas.  FDIC Chief Economist Richard Brown said he often fields questions why the industry still has so many branches.  This thesis…that we have mobile banking and high-tech banking, therefore the branch offices are dinosaurs and going away appears to be substantially overstated, he said.  On Every Corner  The case for reining in sprawling branch networks as a way to cut costs looks compelling.  Reflections are seen in the windows of a Bank of America branch in New York, U.S. on October 8, 2008.Lucas Jackson/File PhotoThe traditional branch costs roughly $2-4 million to set up and $200,000-400,000 per year to operate, according to Ed O'Brien, an analyst at Mercator Advisory Group. For big banks with thousands of branches – many of them clustered in pricey urban centers – it can get expensive.  For instance, an eight block stretch near Manhattan's Penn Station houses 14 bank branches - Astoria Bank, Apple Bank, Capital One, Citibank, HSBC, PNC, TD Bank, Sterling National Bank, Wells Fargo, two Bank of America branches, and three Chase branches.  Yet bank executives argue that, in a competitive market, they need to be footsteps away from the best customers.  Executives at JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), the country's largest bank, say each branch earns about $1 million in annual profit, but takes a decade to reach its full potential.  Chase bankers regularly scrutinize data on branch foot traffic and what customers do while inside to determine whether a location should remain open, shut down or shrink.  The bank has shut 265 locations since 2013, roughly 5 percent of its network, but executives insist that branches remain essential for JPMorgan's relationships with customers. They are the best way to sell clients many products and services ranging from mortgages to investment advice, according to Gordon Smith, JPMorgan's head of consumer and community banking.  Often I will be asked why don't we just accelerate closings. Why don't we close 400 or 500 branches? Smith said at the 2016 investor day. The answer is that customers won't go there.  John Elmore, vice chairman of community banking and branch delivery at U.S. Bancorp, says branches are especially important for small businesses that need to deposit cash frequently, prefer to negotiate loans in person, or want strategic advice.  Proximity to their business is a very, very important factor to their bank selection and their continuing relationship with a bank, Elmore told Reuters.  Cost Questions  Banks do keep trying to steer customers to digital tools.  They have reduced the number of tellers and moved them to the back. Their ATMs can perform more sophisticated tasks and banks have developed nifty mobile apps for routine banking needs. They are even experimenting with digital loan underwriting.  Yet customers still expect contact with bank staff and JPMorgan recently had to hire more tellers after customer complaints.  JPMorgan and Wells Fargo data show most customers visit branches several times every quarter, though younger clients tend to visit less often.  It may be too early to tell what happens in the long run when a big bank shutters many branches.  Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), which has closed a quarter of its branches since 2009, could eventually serve as a test case. The bank says it is done with cuts, but Keefe Bruyette & Woods analyst Fred Cannon calls for more. He also points to Citizens Financial Group Inc (CFG.N), KeyCorp (KEY.N), Comerica Inc (CMA.N) and Zions Bancorp (ZION.O) as banks that have not slimmed down enough.  James Abbott, investor relations chief for Zions, said the group had eliminated roughly 20 percent of its branches since 2009 and continued to evaluate further cuts. The other banks did not provide a comment for this story.  Cannon argues their costs are too high, and that they could eliminate locations without giving up much revenue.  I think there's going to be a real question about the cost of that branch infrastructure, he said.  Reporting by Dan Freed in New York; Editing by Lauren Tara LaCapra and Tomasz Janowski"

The 40-year-old father of one was among millions of east Europeans who moved to wealthier western Europe in search of better-paid jobs after their countries joined the EU from 2004, leaving huge labor market gaps behind. With economic prospects improving across eastern Europe and wages rising due partly to a shortage of workers, official data show tens of thousands of people returning to the region, where the cost of living remains well below western levels. Those numbers will not cure chronic labor shortages overnight. Thousands of people are still planning to leave, and latest data show emigrants from both Hungary and Bulgaria still outnumber returnees. But the first waves of returnees still signal something of a turning point for a region where migration has hitherto worked largely as a one-way street. Kiss left home in 2010 to take up a job in a hotel kitchen in northern Italy after his video rental and massage businesses crashed during the global crisis, which hit Hungary hard. I had to find something to be able to maintain the same standard of living, said Kiss, whose son, now eight, was just 10 months old when he started working abroad. Kiss, who has recently acquired a barista certification, plans to use his savings to launch a cafe in Budapest with a fellow Hungarian with whom he worked while abroad. Distance and this way of life take a very hard toll on your relationships, he said. For me, too, not coming home now would have probably meant the end of my family. Official statistics show 17,000 Hungarians returned last year, up from below 15,000 a year earlier. More than 9,000 Bulgarians have been returning home every year since 2014, double the numbers of earlier years. Many are young people returning to start their own business, mainly in the IT sector, or to join growing outsourcing business opportunities.

Meanwhile, net migration of EU citizens to Britain, a top target for east Europeans along with Germany or Italy, fell last year as new arrivals from eastern European countries sank to the lowest level since they joined the EU in 2004.

The United States has plenty of idle equipment laying around after its own unconventional drilling boom cooled. But moving that machinery from the plains of Texas to the windswept Patagonian desert is proving complex and costly for global oil majors who say Argentina's protectionist past is slowing efforts to spark its own shale revolution. A move by Argentina's government to cut import taxes on used oil-field equipment has sparked fierce opposition from local manufacturers, who are lobbying the government to include protections for them in a measure they fear will destroy their livelihoods.  Among them is Adrian Ramos, president of QM Equipment, a manufacturer of drilling and fracking equipment located in the Argentine coastal city of Mar del Plata.  We got in touch with [the Production Ministry] and let them know it was totally impossible for us to survive this, Ramos told Reuters in a telephone interview. Negotiations with Ramos and others have slowed the rollout of tariff reductions. President Mauricio Macri in April had promised oil executives the changes would be coming within weeks. The previously unreported talks with local manufacturers underscore the challenges faced by Macri, who came to power in 2015 on a wave of popular discontent that ended 12 years of leftist rule. The market-friendly former businessman has pledged to revive Argentina's moribund, inflation-racked economy by reducing trade barriers and wooing foreign investment.  But he has gotten blowback from industries and unions that have benefited from protectionist policies. With mid-term elections approaching in October, popular opposition to rising imports and factory layoffs has become a vulnerability for Macri's Let's Change coalition. Big oil firms, meanwhile, are fuming too. Vaca Muerta, a Belgium-sized shale formation located in the western Patagonian province of Neuquen, is seen as the most promising unconventional oil and gas field outside of North America, the birthplace of the shale revolution.  Already burdened with pricey labor and transport costs in Argentina, companies have grown frustrated with delays in the equipment import reform. Speaking at an industry event in Buenos Aires in late June, Richard Spies, chief executive of Pan America Energy, an Argentine subsidiary of BP PLC, called on government officials to hit the accelerator. Get these things done, Spies said. We need that equipment that's idle in the United States moved down here to facilitate the developments that are coming in Vaca Muerta. In an emailed response to questions from Reuters, a Production Ministry spokesman said the import proposal was advancing and a decree would be passed by the executive branch in the coming weeks. It would not need congressional approval, the spokesman said. Bringing The Dead Cow to Life A drilling rig is seen at the Loma Campana Vaca Muerta shale oil and gas drilling site, own by Argentina's state-controlled energy company YPF, in the Patagonian province of Neuquen, Argentina June 22, 2017.Juliana CastillaArgentina is one of many resource-rich Latin American countries that have struggled to develop abundant oil and mineral reserves. Rules aimed at protecting domestic players and guaranteeing large revenues for government have chased away some foreign investors.  New right-leaning governments in the region have introduced business-friendly policies to lure them back. Brazil's Congress in 2016 opened the nation's deepwater pre-salt fields to foreign operators. This year Peru lowered air-quality standards to attract mining investment. Spurring development of Vaca Muerta - Spanish for 'Dead Cow' - is one of Macri's major priorities as he tries to unwind regulations put in place by his predecessor Cristina Fernandez. Argentina holds the world's second-largest shale gas reserves, but it imports a quarter of its energy needs, one reason for the country's $7-billion current account deficit. Macri has promised rail and pipeline projects to connect remote Vaca Muerta to markets and ports. Most crucially, he struck a deal with unions in January to reduce notoriously high labor costs. Still, production costs remain well above those of global competitors. Prices at the Loma Campana field, jointly operated by state-run oil company YPF SA and Chevron Corp exceed $43 per barrel, compared with $32 in the Niobrara in Colorado and Wyoming. (For a look at Argentine shale activity, see tmsnrt.rs/2uPm98U)     Used oil equipment can currently be imported at tariffs ranging from 7 percent to 28 percent, with imports of some types of machinery banned, the Energy Ministry said in an emailed statement to Reuters.  The proposed change would eliminate the bans, lower tariffs to between 0 percent and 7 percent and provide a form of compensation for companies that buy locally produced equipment, the Ministry said. It added that it has been meeting with drillers, oil services companies and local manufacturers about the rule.  Evidently this dialogue process has taken time, a ministry spokesman wrote. We expect the decree to be signed soon.   Compete or 'Disappear' Local companies fear the changes could be devastating.  Everaldo Santa Cruz is head of the oil and gas business at HTI SA, a maker of drilling and hydraulic fracturing equipment in Canuelas, Buenos Aires province. He said HTI has invested heavily in building frac pumps to supply drillers in Vaca Muerta, and that the $1.2 million price tag is comparable with that of U.S. manufacturers. But Santa Cruz said he worries he will never get to fully develop that part of his business if the decree is passed. HTI doesn't stand a chance if his customers are allowed to import equipment they already own from the United States, paying only transport costs and the lowered tariffs, he said.  We understand that it can speed up production to an extent, Santa Cruz said. But there's a risk that companies like ours that try to develop local solutions to support the industry simply disappear.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/argentina-shale-idUSL1N1K301X","RPT-Tariff fight roils Argentina’s shale patch as Macri opens trade","","July 12, 2017 /  11:02 AM / 16 days ago","","(Repeats for additional clients with no changes to text) By Luc Cohen BUENOS AIRES, July  12 (Reuters) - Argentina needs oil rigs to develop its vast shale oil and gas resources. The United States has plenty of idle equipment laying around after its own unconventional drilling boom cooled. But moving that machinery from the plains of Texas to the windswept Patagonian desert is proving complex and costly for global oil majors who say Argentina's protectionist past is slowing efforts to spark its own shale revolution. A move by Argentina's government to cut import taxes on used oil-field equipment has sparked fierce opposition from local manufacturers, who are lobbying the government to include protections for them in a measure they fear will destroy their livelihoods. Among them is Adrian Ramos, president of QM Equipment, a manufacturer of drilling and fracking equipment located in the Argentine coastal city of Mar del Plata. We got in touch with [the Production Ministry] and let them know it was totally impossible for us to survive this, Ramos told Reuters in a telephone interview. Negotiations with Ramos and others have slowed the rollout of tariff reductions. President Mauricio Macri in April had promised oil executives the changes would be coming within weeks. The previously unreported talks with local manufacturers underscore the challenges faced by Macri, who came to power in 2015 on a wave of popular discontent that ended 12 years of leftist rule. The market-friendly former businessman has pledged to revive Argentina's moribund, inflation-racked economy by reducing trade barriers and wooing foreign investment. But he has gotten blowback from industries and unions that have benefited from protectionist policies. With mid-term elections approaching in October, popular opposition to rising imports and factory layoffs has become a vulnerability for Macri's Let's Change coalition. Big oil firms, meanwhile, are fuming too. Vaca Muerta, a Belgium-sized shale formation located in the western Patagonian province of Neuquen, is seen as the most promising unconventional oil and gas field outside of North America, the birthplace of the shale revolution. Already burdened with pricey labor and transport costs in Argentina, companies have grown frustrated with delays in the equipment import reform. Speaking at an industry event in Buenos Aires in late June, Richard Spies, chief executive of Pan America Energy, an Argentine subsidiary of BP PLC, called on government officials to hit the accelerator. Get these things done, Spies said. We need that equipment that's idle in the United States moved down here to facilitate the developments that are coming in Vaca Muerta. In an emailed response to questions from Reuters, a Production Ministry spokesman said the import proposal was advancing and a decree would be passed by the executive branch in the coming weeks. It would not need congressional approval, the spokesman said. Bringing The Dead Cow to Life Argentina is one of many resource-rich Latin American countries that have struggled to develop abundant oil and mineral reserves. Rules aimed at protecting domestic players and guaranteeing large revenues for government have chased away some foreign investors. New right-leaning governments in the region have introduced business-friendly policies to lure them back. Brazil's Congress in 2016 opened the nation's deepwater pre-salt fields to foreign operators. This year Peru lowered air-quality standards to attract mining investment. Spurring development of Vaca Muerta - Spanish for 'Dead Cow' - is one of Macri's major priorities as he tries to unwind regulations put in place by his predecessor Cristina Fernandez. Argentina holds the world's second-largest shale gas reserves, but it imports a quarter of its energy needs, one reason for the country's $7-billion current account deficit. Macri has promised rail and pipeline projects to connect remote Vaca Muerta to markets and ports. Most crucially, he struck a deal with unions in January to reduce notoriously high labor costs. Still, production costs remain well above those of global competitors. Prices at the Loma Campana field, jointly operated by state-run oil company YPF SA and Chevron Corp exceed $43 per barrel, compared with $32 in the Niobrara in Colorado and Wyoming. (For a look at Argentine shale activity, see tmsnrt.rs/2uPm98U) Used oil equipment can currently be imported at tariffs ranging from 7 percent to 28 percent, with imports of some types of machinery banned, the Energy Ministry said in an emailed statement to Reuters. The proposed change would eliminate the bans, lower tariffs to between 0 percent and 7 percent and provide a form of compensation for companies that buy locally produced equipment, the Ministry said. It added that it has been meeting with drillers, oil services companies and local manufacturers about the rule. Evidently this dialogue process has taken time, a ministry spokesman wrote.

Chairman Angel Ron had long maintained that Popular was financially strong enough to remain independent. But shareholders rebelled over his failure to clean up 30 billion euros ($32 billion) in toxic assets and on Thursday the bank said he would be replaced. Popular's new leadership under JP Morgan Chase (JPM.N) Vice President Emilio Saracho and a record low share price could now spur a move from rivals who have been circling the bank, in turn triggering further consolidation, analysts and bankers say. Spain's banking sector has already been culled from 55 to 14 players since 2008, when a property bubble burst forcing the government to clump together a number of failing lenders. But there is scope for the number to shrink further. The top four (banks) are sitting there thinking 'how are we going to play this out?', one senior Madrid-based banker, who asked not to be named, said. It is a very incestuous sector where nothing happens without them all knowing. They need a bit of a catalyst, someone to go first.     A report in Spanish newspaper Expansion on Thursday said Popular was in talks over a potential merger with BBVA (BBVA.MC), which with 10 times its stock market value has the buying power to make a move. Representatives for Popular and BBVA have declined to comment on any talks. Popular's shareholder revolt was led by Mexican billionaire Antonio del Valle, who according to banking sources favors merging Popular with a competitor. Spain's largest banks, Banco Santander (SAN.MC) and Caixabank (CABK.MC) as well as BBVA, have been slashing costs this year, which analysts say has helped defer the need for an expected second wave of consolidation. Uncertainty over a 10-month political deadlock on forming a new government also helped freeze deal-making. But the big players are looking at acquisitions as a more long-term solution to shrinking margins and Popular is just one of several small and mid-sized lenders which could be targets.  Historically low interest rates and fierce competition for a shrinking loan book have on average halved banks' profitability rates since the crisis. In response, Santander, Caixabank and BBVA have all announced staff cuts and branch closures in Spain. Tempting Target  This interest rate environment makes it impossible for banks to reach a sustainable profitability level, and the only way to improve it is through consolidation, Jose Luis Suarez, a professor of finance at Spain's IESE business school, said. He said Popular's weakness would accelerate the process and he expected mergers to begin in the first half of next year. Below the top tier, former savings banks such as Liberbank and Ibercaja, and even fifth-largest Banco Sabadell (SABE.MC), could attract suitors. But Popular could be the most tempting target given its price and its strong small-business portfolio. Another banker in Madrid said it may not be worth the effort for big banks to buy smaller fry such as Ibercaja or Liberbank, but a bigger deal with Sabadell or Popular could be tempting. Analysts at Morgan Stanley said a Popular-BBVA deal would make sense, noting Popular's shares have fallen 66 percent over the past year, making the bank three times cheaper than its book value, while BBVA's predominance in emerging markets means an expansion back in Spain could be beneficial. Santander, BBVA and Caixabank's stated strategic plans do not include acquisitions, but they have all said they would consider opportunities. IESE's Suarez said Caixabank, which made an informal approach to Popular in 2012, was the biggest contender for takeovers since its domestic focus has prevented it from finding more profitable business abroad, as have Santander and BBVA.  Caixabank, Spain's biggest bank by domestic assets, has seen its lending income stagnate over 2016 and it has made a bid for Portugal's Banco BPI (BBPI.LS), a major step outside its core Spanish market.  Policymakers both in Spain and across Europe favor more consolidation in the sector. The Spanish government is already working to merge Bankia (BKIA.MC), which was nationalized in 2012 with a 22 billion euro bailout, with smaller state-owned BMN, although it could open it up to outside bids.

Trump told the New York Times in an interview that he thinks there is some connectivity between human activity and global warming, despite previously describing climate change as a hoax. A source on Trump's transition team told Reuters earlier this month that the New York businessman was seeking quick ways to withdraw the United States from the 2015 Paris Agreement to combat climate change.  But asked on Tuesday whether the United States would withdraw from the accord, the Republican said: “I’m looking at it very closely. I have an open mind to it.  A U.S. withdrawal from the pact, agreed to by almost 200 countries, would set back international efforts to limit rising temperatures that have been linked to the extinctions of animals and plants, heat waves, floods and rising sea levels.         . Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, also said he was thinking about climate change and American competitiveness and how much it will cost our companies,” he said, according to a tweet by a Times reporter in the interview. Two people advising Trump’s transition team on energy and environment issues said they were caught off guard by his remarks.  A shift on global warming is the latest sign Trump might be backing away from some of his campaign rhetoric as life in the Oval Office approaches. Trump has said he might have to build a fence, rather than a wall, in some areas of the U.S.-Mexican border to stop illegal immigration, tweaking one of his signature campaign promises. Also in Tuesday's interview, he showed little appetite for pressing investigations of his Democratic rival in the presidential campaign, Hillary Clinton. Related CoverageFactbox: Summary of Trump's comments in New York Times interviewFactbox: Contenders for key jobs in Trump's administration“I don’t want to hurt the Clintons, I really don’t. She went through a lot and suffered greatly in many different ways, he told reporters, editors and other newspaper officials at the Times headquarters in Manhattan.  But Trump said no when asked if he would rule out investigating Clinton over her family's charitable foundation or her use of a private email server while she was U.S. secretary of state during President Barack Obama's first term. If Trump does abandon his campaign vow to appoint a special prosecutor for Clinton, it will be a reversal of a position he mentioned almost daily on the campaign trail, when he dubbed his rival Crooked Hillary, and crowds at his rallies often chanted: Lock her up. His comments to the Times about Clinton angered some of his strongest conservative supporters. Breitbart News, the outlet once led by Trump's chief strategist, Steve Bannon, published a story on Tuesday under the headline, Broken Promise: Trump 'Doesn't Wish to Pursue' Clinton email charges. President-elect Donald Trump reacts to a crowd gathered in the lobby of the New York Times building. Trump, who has never previously held public office, was quick to bristle at unflattering news coverage during the campaign, even as he remained accessible to certain reporters, including several from the Times.Lucas JacksonThe FBI investigated Clinton's email practices, concluding in July that her actions were careless but that there were no grounds for bringing charges.  The Clinton Foundation charity has also been scrutinized for donations it received, but there has been no evidence that foreign donors obtained favors from the State Department while Clinton headed it. Businessman and President Trump, a real estate developer who has never held public office, brushed off fears over conflicts of interest between his job as president and his family's businesses. The law's totally on my side, the president can't have a conflict of interest, he told the New York Times. My company's so unimportant to me relative to what I'm doing, Trump said. Slideshow (4 Images)Conflict-of-interest rules for executive branch employees do not apply to the president, but Trump will be bound by bribery laws, disclosure requirements and a section of the U.S. Constitution that prohibits elected officials from taking gifts from foreign governments, according to Republican and Democratic ethics lawyers. There may be specific laws that don’t apply to the president, but the president is not above the law, said Richard Painter of the University of Minnesota, a former associate counsel to Republican President George W. Bush. Do we really want to run our government where you have the president, the leader of the United States and the free world, saying: 'I'm going to do the bare minimum to squeak by?' asked Norman Eisen, a former top ethics lawyer in Obama's White House. Trump's businesswoman daughter Ivanka joined her father's telephone call with Argentine President Mauricio Macri earlier this month and attended a meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, raising questions of possible conflicts of interest. When asked whether House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan and other Republicans in Congress would consider his  trillion-dollar infrastructure plan, Trump boasted he was popular with the party's leaders on Capitol Hill.     “Right now, they’re in love with me, he said.     Since his Nov. 8 election victory, Trump has been meeting with prospective candidates for top positions in his administration. Ben Carson, a former Republican presidential hopeful who dropped out of the 2016 race and backed Trump, has been offered the post of secretary of housing and urban development, Carson spokesman Armstrong Williams said.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/swiss-finance-idUSL8N1CP5PN","Swiss government says will look to open doors for banks abroad","","October 20, 2016 /  12:01 PM / 9 months ago","","BERN, Oct 20 (Reuters) - The Swiss government will work to boost the competitiveness of the country's financial sector against international rivals, it said on Thursday, striking a more supportive tone towards the industry. Home to banking and insurance giants UBS, Credit Suisse and Zurich Insurance, Switzerland is the world's biggest centre for foreign wealth, with an estimated $2.3 trillion kept in the Alpine country. However, its banks have been under pressure for years as a global clamp-down on tax evasion has eroded bank secrecy rules that had helped the world's wealthy keep cash hidden from the taxman. The government said in its first industry report since 2012 it had a responsibility to guarantee the best conditions for Swiss financial firms. Switzerland's financial centre should continue to assert itself as one of the world's leading locations for financial activity and can strengthen this role further, it said in the report prepared by the finance ministry. It marked a more accommodating tone towards the financial sector under new Finance Minister Ueli Maurer, who replaced Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf at the start of 2016. Widmer-Schlumpf had supported tougher regulation and helped draft new too-big-to-fail (TBTF) rules, which included tough capital requirements for UBS and Credit Suisse. The State Secretariat for International Financial Matters (SIF), a branch of the finance ministry, will review the TBTF law every two years with a particular focus on its impact on banks' international competitiveness, the government said. Continued access to foreign markets is essential for financial services firms, the government said, adding a comprehensive agreement with the European Union covering financial services was a long-term option. Switzerland is not a member of the EU and uses bilateral agreements to give certain industries access to the single market, although this does not include financial services. In the meantime, Switzerland will look for bilateral agreements with partner countries as well as EU equivalence recognition for select Swiss financial regulation. The government said Britain's vote to leave the EU would lead to considerable short- and mid-term uncertainty for banks with UK operations, but that it was too early to say what impact Brexit would have on the Swiss financial centre. It also raised the possibility of increased market access between Britain and Switzerland after Britain had left the EU. The government reiterated its commitment to support financial innovation by reassessing Swiss regulations, warning a framework that was no longer up-to-date could harm Switzerland's competitiveness by hindering market entry for new providers. In April, the Federal Council tasked the finance ministry with reviewing its regulatory framework and suggesting possible action in the fintech area by autumn 2016.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/britain-banks-lending-idUSL4N19L3XH","British bank branch closures cut small business lending in half","","June 29, 2016 /  11:00 PM / in a year","","LONDON, June 30 (Reuters) - British banks' closure of hundreds of branches in the last three years has more than halved lending to small businesses in the areas affected, research on Thursday showed, ahead of a debate in parliament about the impact of the cuts. Britain's biggest banks HSBC, Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group  have been steadily shrinking their branch networks to cut costs while investing in online and mobile banking services. Research by campaign group Move Your Money suggested many customers were losing out as a result, with lending to small local businesses down by 63 percent in towns and villages that had lost a bank branch. The impact on communities following the closure of their last bank branch was even more striking, with a 104 percent drop in lending growth to small businesses, according to the research, based on data from the British Bankers' Association. The UK's biggest banks are abandoning communities across the country, and today for the first time we can see the incredible damage that is happening, Fionn Travers-Smith, campaign manager for Move Your Money, said. The impact of branch closures on lending in specific areas had not been closely tracked until the British Bankers' Association began releasing information in 2013 about local lending patterns. This marked a government push to increase transparency and encourage competition between banks. The Move Your Money study is one of the first to make use of that data to map how the closures have affected lending. Politicians from the main political parties have arranged to debate the issue in parliament later on Thursday and are expected to demand a tightening of the rules that govern branch closures and that banks do more to help customers affected. RBS, Lloyds, Barclays and HSBC did not respond to requests for comment. A spokesman for the British Bankers' Association said banks have signed up to protocols aimed at minimising the impact of branch closures, including partnering with post offices to offer services and carrying out impact studies before closures. Banks are determined to leave no one behind, he said. Reuters earlier this month reported that Britain's largest banks are disproportionately closing branches in the lowest-income areas while expanding in wealthier ones. The analysis found more than 90 percent of the branch closures were in areas where the median household income is below the British average of 27,600 pounds ($39,042). Banks could face more pressure on costs after Britain's vote last week to leave the European Union, potentially creating the biggest upheaval for the country's banking industry since the 2007-2009 financial crisis. The vote for Brexit has led to predictions of a recession and earnings downgrades that hit bank shares. Academics and campaign groups say Britain should enact tougher legislation like in the United States which requires banks to maintain branches and lending in poorer areas. The U.S. Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 is designed to reduce discriminatory lending against low-income areas by requiring banks to lend in communities where they are chartered.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/deutschebank-china-idUSL6N0S92Y820141014","Deutsche Bank looks to open new branches in China","","October 14, 2014 /  12:25 PM / 3 years ago","","FRANKFURT, Oct 14 (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank hopes to open new branches in China at a rate of about one per year as it positions itself to benefit from expanding trade and investment between Asia's largest economy and Europe. Werner Steinmueller, head of transaction banking at Deutsche, said the expansion was part of the bank's wider efforts to profit from China's economic rise. We will steadily open branches, Steinmueller told journalists on Tuesday. The exact pace and path of expansion depends on Chinese regulators who must approve or even guide each opening, he said. Germany's flagship bank, which has six branches in China now, aims to become the leading European player in the offshore renminbi market, offering importers and exporters trade financing, settlements and debt issuance in the Chinese currency. Steinmueller said the bank was betting on long-term reforms in Chinese financial regulations to open markets and make renminbi, which is controlled, freely convertible by 2020. Germany is China's biggest European trading partner with a shared export-import volume of 140 billion euros ($177 billion) in 2013. Renminbi, meanwhile, is expected to grow in importance and become a reserve currency in the coming years, Steinmueller said. The renminbi is becoming more and more mainstream, he said. Deutsche Bank already offers corporate banking and securities services, wealth management, and transaction banking in China. It offers investment banking services domestically through Zhong De Securities Company, a joint venture with Shanxi  Securities Co. Ltd. China and Germany signed agreements this year to launch clearing and settlement mechanisms in Frankfurt in a move to elevate the role of Germany's financial capital in Chinese finance. Deutsche said it could divert some of its own renminbi clearing volumes from Shanghai to Frankfurt to support the facility. If you launch a clearing centre then you also have to put some volumes in it, Steinmueller said. $1 = 0.7902 euro

In April 2016, the central bank had said it planned to introduce a ceiling on total foreign currency positions - surplus or deficit - of 30 percent of each bank's capital and reserves. On Thursday, the central bank said the rule, which would limit the risks of foreign currency open positions, would also apply to Qatari banks' foreign branches. But it will not apply at the level of banks' subsidiaries, or to hedging transactions. Under previous regulations, lenders' foreign currency assets were required to be at least equal to their liabilities.   (Reporting by Celine Aswad; Editing by Andrew Torchia)"

"https://www.reuters.com/article/wells-fargo-marketing-idUSL5N1GY5TZ","Wells Fargo banks on new ad campaign to regain customer trust","","March 21, 2017 /  7:48 PM / 4 months ago","","NEW YORK, March 21 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co will launch a new multi-channel ad campaign, its chief executive said on Tuesday, in a further sign of the bank's efforts to regain trust after a sales scandal last year caused a sharp drop in account openings. The advertising campaign, to begin in mid-April, will be published across different media channels and focus on the changes the bank has implemented since it was rocked by revelations over illegal sales practices in September last year. For our team members and customers, we want to create a culture that's better every day, Chief Executive Officer Timothy Sloan said in explaining the new campaign to employees at a town hall meeting in Orlando, Florida on Tuesday. Building Better Every Day, the slogan of the new campaign, will run across broadcast and print ads, online and on the bank's mobile app, as well as on its internal channels, Sloan said. A spokesman declined to comment on the budget for the new campaign. But following the fallout, Wells Fargo last year said it would increase marketing spending and in October 2016 launched its first nation-wide campaign to address its sales practices. Federal regulators last year had ordered the San Francisco-based bank to pay $190 million in fines and restitution because they said its high pressure sales environment pushed employees to open 2 million deposit and credit card accounts without customers' permission. The bank has since unveiled a new compensation structure for its branch employees that creates incentives based on customer service rather than sales goals. Wells Fargo, the third-largest U.S. bank, saw a sharp drop in account openings, customer interactions at its branches and an increase in account closures since the scandal. It has since started to report on consumer activity on a monthly basis. Its latest retail business figures on Monday showed the bank is still fighting an uphill battle to regain customers. Consumers opened 43 percent fewer checking and 55 percent fewer credit card accounts on a yearly basis in February. A pick-up in marketing spend should benefit account openings the next few months, but were that not to occur, then it could force us to reconsider the long-term growth potential in Wells' retail bank, Brian Kleinhanzl, an analyst with KBW said in a research note on Monday. But other analysts said the bank hardly had a choice when it came to investing in public outreach campaigns.

Intesa said that as of January, 100 of its branches would be open until 8 pm (1900 GMT) during the week and on Saturday morning. By June, the longer opening hours would apply to 500 branches. This is part of a deal with unions announced in October which will save around 1,000 jobs that were at risk after Intesa said it would close or merge nearly a fifth of its Italian network of 5,100-5,200 branches. Most Italian banks are shut on Saturdays and close to the public at 1445 GMT during the week. Italian banks are under pressure to cut costs and reduce branch networks to revive weak profitability and adapt to the rising popularity of Internet banking.

The advertising campaign, to begin in mid-April, will be published across different media channels and focus on the changes the bank has implemented since it was rocked by revelations over illegal sales practices in September last year. For our team members and customers, we want to create a culture that's better every day, Chief Executive Officer Timothy Sloan said in explaining the new campaign to employees at a town hall meeting in Orlando, Florida on Tuesday. Building Better Every Day, the slogan of the new campaign, will run across broadcast and print ads, online and on the bank's mobile app, as well as on its internal channels, Sloan said. A spokesman declined to comment on the budget for the new campaign. But following the fallout, Wells Fargo last year said it would increase marketing spending and in October 2016 launched its first nation-wide campaign to address its sales practices. Data by Kantar Media, a New York-based ad-tracking firm, showed that Wells Fargo's advertisement expenditure rose by around 15 percent to $183.8 million in the first 11 months of 2016 compared to the year prior. In October last year, the bank's advertisement expenditure across TV, internet, radio, outdoor displays, magazines and newspapers increased by 32 percent on a yearly basis to $27.5 million. A Wells Fargo spokeswoman could not immediately comment on whether the increase was directly related to the company's 2016 campaign. A spokeswoman for marketing group Omnicom, which owns media agency OMD that runs the bank's advertisement campaigns, did not reply to requests seeking comment. Federal regulators last year had ordered the San Francisco-based bank to pay $190 million in fines and restitution because they said its high pressure sales environment pushed employees to open 2 million deposit and credit card accounts without customers' permission. The bank has since unveiled a new compensation structure for its branch employees that creates incentives based on customer service rather than sales goals.  Wells Fargo, the third-largest U.S. bank, saw a sharp drop in account openings, customer interactions at its branches and an increase in account closures since the scandal. It has since started to report on consumer activity on a monthly basis. Its latest retail business figures on Monday showed the bank is still fighting an uphill battle to regain customers. Consumers opened 43 percent fewer checking and 55 percent fewer credit card accounts on a yearly basis in February. A pick-up in marketing spend should benefit account openings the next few months, but were that not to occur, then it could force us to reconsider the long-term growth potential in Wells' retail bank, Brian Kleinhanzl, an analyst with KBW said in a research note on Monday. But other analysts said the bank hardly had a choice when it came to investing in public outreach campaigns. If they do spend, they get accused of wasting money, Stephen Biggar, an analyst with Argus Research, told Reuters.

We can only conclude that our website has been deliberately targeted and blocked by Qatar authorities, the Doha News said in a statement. We are incredibly disappointed with this decision, which appears to be an act of censorship. A spokesman for the Qatari government did not respond to phone messages seeking comment. The two Internet service providers, Vodafone Qatar and state-controlled Ooredoo ORDS.QA, declined to comment. Freedom of expression is tightly controlled in Qatar with self-censorship prevalent among national newspapers and other media outlets. The gas-rich state has faced increased international scrutiny over alleged corruption and labor abuse as it prepares to host the 2022 soccer World Cup. Internet users outside Qatar were still able to access the Doha News, which stirred a debate about the limits of tolerance with an opinion column in August about gay rights in the conservative country. Rights group Amnesty International said the government appeared to have targeted a key source of journalism which fostered dialogue and discussion about social and political issues that affect people in Qatar.  Some Qataris on social media said they were upset at the news site being blocked, calling it a setback for the country. It's extremely worrying that @dohanews has been blocked. We always prided our self in being open to voices, Anood al-Thani, a student, said on Twitter. Others said Doha News, which has an audience of around one million unique users per month, was run by foreigners and had put itself at risk by being unfairly critical in its reporting. The site has an unprofessional bias against Qatar and recently became the source of all those foreign media attacks on Qatar, feeding them with everything that offends us, tweeted Ahmed al-Kuwari, a Qatari engineer. Qatar finances and hosts the pan-Arab satellite TV network Al Jazeera, which has won millions of viewers across the Arab world and beyond, as well as the government-funded Doha Centre for Media Freedom. A 2016 survey by Northwestern University, one of six prominent U.S. schools with branches in the country, showed most Qataris support the principle of free speech online. But the same survey also showed that a majority want the Internet to be more tightly regulated. A close U.S. ally that hosts a large U.S. military base, Doha has escaped the unrest that has engulfed other parts of the region. It lacks any organized political opposition.

Shawn Rose, Scotiabank's executive vice president of digital banking, said the move would support the bank's aim of becoming a leader in financial technology and was, in part, a response to growing competition from both mainstream banks and fintech startups. Canada's largest banks are investing hundreds of millions of dollars in new technology as they adapt to a transformational increase in customers banking online rather than branches where transactions have significantly declined. It's accelerating, that competitive fear, said Rose, who joined the bank six months ago to help develop its digital operations. We don't want to lose a day. It's critical. The people we hire, they need a place to establish these routines. Scotiabank has opened similar hubs in Mexico, Peru, Chile and Columbia (Pacific Alliance), which it has identified as key markets as it looks to diversify from Canada, where growth has been held back by a sluggish economy. It's potentially more important for us to do this at the Pacific Alliance ... These Pacific Alliance countries are outpacing the mothership. The bank demonstrated projects including a payment system that combines blockchain, which underpins digital currencies like bitcoin, with biometric scanning to recognize an employee. A quick hand swipe through a scanner allows staff within the new facility to pay for food and beverages in the cafeteria without using a bank card, cash or a device. Rose said the bank is the process of filing a patent for that particular technology.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSFit978697","Fitch Affirms New Zealand Covered Bond Ratings on New Criteria","","November 8, 2016 /  6:06 AM / 9 months ago","","(The following statement was released by the rating agency) Link to Fitch Ratings' Report: New Zealand Covered Bond Programmes - Rating  Action Report here SYDNEY, November 08 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the ratings of five New  Zealand mortgage covered bond programmes following the implementation of the  agency's new Covered Bonds Rating Criteria published on 26 October 2016. The  Outlooks are Stable. The agency has also assigned a Payment Continuity Uplift  (PCU) to each programme. The ratings of the New Zealand mortgage covered bond programmes affirmed at  'AAA' with a Stable Outlook correspond to the following issuers. The programmes  have been assigned a corresponding PCU: - ANZ Bank New Zealand Limited (ANZNZ, AA-/Stable/F1+); PCU of six notches - ASB Bank Limited (ASB, AA-/Stable/F1+); PCU of three notches - Bank of New Zealand (BNZ, AA-/Stable/F1+); PCU of six notches - Kiwibank Limited (Kiwibank, AA/Rating Watch Negative/F1+); PCU of six notches - Westpac New Zealand Limited (WNZL, AA-/Stable/F1+); PCU of six notches Issuer Default Rating Uplift An Issuer Default Rating (IDR) uplift of zero-notches has been assigned to the  programmes of the above-mentioned issuers, as New Zealand does not explicitly  exempt the issued covered bonds from bail-in under the Open Bank Resolution  regime and there is a risk of cover pool enforcement. Therefore, the IDR remains  the floor of the covered bond rating. Payment Continuity Uplift  Four New Zealand programmes were assigned a PCU of six notches, as they were  assessed as having at least 12 months liquidity protection for principal  payments and sufficient protection for interest payments for the timely payment  of the covered bonds. Where programmes have a combination of both hard and soft  bullet issuance types, which can cross default, Fitch looks at the materiality  of liquidity protection for each issuance type in the programme and assigns the  PCU based on the mechanism that provides the least protection. The remaining  programme's liquidity provisions are commensurate with a PCU of three notches as  a result of the limited cure period under the 12 month pre-maturity test for the  outstanding hard bullet covered bonds.  Recovery Uplift All New Zealand programmes are considered to have significant foreign-exchange  (FX) exposure in the recovery given default scenario, as cover assets are  denominated in New Zealand dollars and the majority of issuance is denominated  in other currencies. Fitch expects the covered bond swaps hedging this risk  would be terminated in a covered bond event of default scenario. Fitch has  capped the recovery given default uplift for these programmes to one-notch, as  the FX exposure presents significant downside risk to the programme. The  one-notch uplift for recoveries is supported with sufficient  overcollateralisation (OC), which Fitch relies on to cover credit loss on the  cover assets when assigning the bond rating.  Breakeven Asset Percentage for the Ratings Fitch has revised the breakeven asset percentage (AP) for the ratings of the  covered bond programmes following the update of its refinancing spread levels  and fire-sale discount assumptions. The 'AAA' breakeven AP's for ANZNZ, Kiwibank  and WNZL have been capped at the maximum contractual AP documented in the  programme. In its analysis, Fitch gives credit to the highest level of nominal AP observed  in the past 12 months for four out of five programmes in New Zealand. Even  though these programmes' excess over-collateralisation is funded through a  demand loan, repayments under the demand loan rank subordinate to covered  bondholders. For WNZL's programme, Fitch only gives credit to the  over-collateralisation defined via the asset coverage test (ACT) calculated by  WNZL and published in its investor reports. This is because the repayment of its  demand loan in the programme ranks in priority over payments to covered  bondholders. Detailed information on the programmes mentioned in this commentary can be found  in the Excel file, New Zealand Covered Bond Programmes - Rating Action Report,  dated 8 November 2016, which can be accessed by the link above. Variation from Criteria Fitch has applied a variation from its cover asset Refinancing Spread Level  (RSL) assumptions for New Zealand, which provide for refinancing stress on  standard mortgage cover assets simulating their sale to meet covered bond  payments. Only ANZNZ and ASB have cover assets indirectly linked to an at-call  line-of-credit product that is not included in the cover pool. These products  are linked to the same secured property as the cover assets and, in the event of  the cover assets being sold, the line-of-credit loans would also need to be  sold. Fitch believes the additional line-of-credit loans increase the  refinancing cost for these programmes, as they could be more difficult to sell  to a third-party as the line-of-credit product is not standard across New  Zealand. It also increases the amount of loans needed to be sold, potentially  affecting the sale price of the cover assets.  Fitch considered an additional stressed refinancing rate differential of 100bp  above New Zealand's base mortgage refinance stresses for cover assets linked to  at-call line-of-credit loans. The agency applied the adjusted refinancing stress  on the pro-rata value of the cover assets linked. The revised mortgage refinance  stresses on the 'AA+' tested rating on a probability of default basis was  334bps. ANZNZ's refinance spreads at 'AA+' were adjusted to 268bp and ASB's to  292bps from the base rate of 234bp, based on the pro-rata value of these linked  line-of-credit loans to the cover pools. There was no ratings impact to the  covered bonds of ANZNZ and ASB as a result of this variation to criteria. KEY RATING DRIVERS ANZNZ Mortgage Covered Bonds The 'AAA' rating of ANZNZ's mortgage covered bonds is based on the bank's  Long-Term IDR of 'AA-', the newly assigned IDR uplift of zero notches, the newly  assigned PCU of six notches and a recovery uplift of one-notch. The covered  bonds are issued through ANZ New Zealand (Int'l) Limited, a guaranteed issuing  vehicle ANZNZ uses for international funding. The recovery uplift is capped at  one-notch as the programme is significantly exposed to FX risk from recoveries.  This is because the assets are denominated in New Zealand dollars while all its  covered bonds are non-New Zealand dollar denominated, despite swaps being in  place on the liabilities.  The relied upon asset percentage (AP) of 67.6%, the highest nominal AP of the  past 12 months, which Fitch uses in its analysis, provides more protection than  the 90.0% breakeven AP for the 'AAA' rating. The breakeven AP is also equivalent  to the programme's maximum contractual AP and corresponds to a 'AA+' tested  rating on a probability of default (PD) basis and a one-notch recovery uplift.  The Stable Outlook on the covered bonds' rating reflects the Stable Outlook on  ANZNZ's IDR and the significant buffer against downgrade from the uplift above  the issuer's IDR. ASB Mortgage Covered Bonds The 'AAA' rating of ASB's mortgage covered bonds is based on the bank's  Long-Term IDR of 'AA-', the newly assigned IDR uplift of zero notches, the newly  assigned PCU of three notches and a recovery uplift of one-notch. The offshore  covered bonds are issued by ASB Finance Limited, a special purpose vehicle  guaranteed by ASB. The PCU is capped at three notches due to the limited cure  period of up to six months under the 12 month pre-maturity test for the  outstanding hard bullet bonds, which remain relevant to the assessment of  liquidity. The recovery uplift is capped at one-notch as the programme is  significantly exposed to FX risk from recoveries. This is because the assets are  denominated in New Zealand dollars while 87.4% of covered bonds are non-New  Zealand dollar denominated, despite swaps being in place on the liabilities.  The relied upon AP of 71.7%, the highest nominal AP of the past 12 months,  provides more protection than the 87.5% breakeven AP for the 'AAA' rating. The  breakeven AP corresponds to a 'AA+' tested rating on a PD basis and a one-notch  recovery uplift. The Stable Outlook on the covered bonds' rating reflects the  Stable Outlook on ASB's IDR and the one-notch buffer against downgrade from the  uplift above the issuer's IDR.  BNZ Mortgage Covered Bonds The 'AAA' rating of BNZ's mortgage covered bonds is based on the bank's  Long-Term IDR of 'AA-', the newly assigned IDR uplift of zero notches, the newly  assigned PCU of six notches and a recovery uplift of one-notch. The offshore  covered bonds are issued through BNZ International Funding Limited, a guaranteed  issuing vehicle BNZ uses for international funding. The recovery uplift is  capped at one-notch as the programme is significantly exposed to FX risk from  recoveries. This is because the assets are denominated in New Zealand dollars  while 71.2% of covered bonds are non-New Zealand dollar denominated, despite  swaps being in place on the liabilities.  The relied upon AP of 84.4%, the highest nominal AP of the past 12 months,  provides more protection than the 90.5% breakeven AP for the 'AAA' rating. The  breakeven AP corresponds to a 'AA+' tested rating on a PD basis and a one-notch  recovery uplift. The Stable Outlook on the covered bonds' rating reflects the  Stable Outlook on BNZ's IDR and the significant buffer against downgrade from  the uplift above the issuer's IDR. Kiwibank Mortgage Covered Bonds The 'AAA' rating of Kiwibank's mortgage covered bonds is based on the bank's  Long-Term IDR of 'AA', the newly assigned IDR uplift of zero notches, the newly  assigned PCU of six notches and a recovery uplift of one-notch. The recovery  uplift is capped at one-notch as the programme is significantly exposed to FX  risk from recoveries. This is because the assets are denominated in New Zealand  dollars while all covered bonds are non-New Zealand dollar denominated, despite  swaps being in place on the liabilities.  The relied upon AP of 60.6%, the highest nominal AP of the past 12 months,  provides more protection than the 90.0% breakeven AP for the 'AAA' rating. The  breakeven AP is also equivalent to the maximum contractual AP in the programme  and corresponds to a 'AA+' tested rating on a PD basis and a one-notch recovery  uplift. The Stable Outlook on the covered bonds' ratings reflects the five notch  buffer against Kiwibank's IDR before the covered bond rating will be subject to  downgrade, all else being equal. WNZL Mortgage Covered Bonds The 'AAA' rating of WNZL's mortgage covered bonds is based on the bank's  Long-Term IDR of 'AA-', the newly assigned IDR uplift of zero notches, the newly  assigned PCU of six notches and a recovery uplift of one-notch. The covered  bonds are issued through Westpac Securities New Zealand Limited, London branch,  a guaranteed issuing vehicle WNZL uses for international funding. The recovery  uplift is capped at one-notch as the programme is significantly exposed to FX  risk from recoveries. This is because the assets are denominated in New Zealand  dollars and all covered bonds are non-New Zealand dollar denominated, despite  swaps being in place on the liabilities.  The relied upon AP of 88.5% published in the programme's ACT that Fitch uses in  its analysis provides more protection than the 90.0% breakeven AP for the 'AAA'  rating. The breakeven AP is also equivalent to the maximum contractual AP in the  programme and corresponds to a 'AA+' tested rating on a PD basis and a one-notch  recovery uplift. The Stable Outlook on the covered bonds' rating reflects the  Stable Outlook on WNZL's IDR and the significant buffer against downgrade from  the uplift above the issuer's IDR. RATING SENSITIVITIES ANZ Bank New Zealand Limited - Mortgage Covered Bonds The covered bonds would be vulnerable to a downgrade if the bank's Long-Term  Issuer Default Rating (IDR) falls below 'BBB+'. The 'AAA' breakeven of 90% is  equal to the maximum contractual AP in the programme; if the AP relied upon by  Fitch rises to the maximum contractual AP, ratings would not be affected.  ASB Bank Limited - Mortgage Covered Bonds The covered bonds would be vulnerable to a downgrade if the relied upon AP rises  above the 'AAA' breakeven AP of 87.5% or if the bank's Long-Term IDR falls below  'A+'. If the nominal AP in the programme rises to the maximum 90% contractual AP  stipulated in the programme documents, the rating on the covered bonds would  fall to 'AA', one notch above the IDR. Bank of New Zealand - Mortgage Covered Bonds The covered bonds would be vulnerable to a downgrade if the relied upon AP rises  above the 'AAA' breakeven AP of 90.5% or if the bank's Long-Term IDR falls below  'BBB+'. If the nominal AP in the programme rises to the maximum 97.0%  contractual AP stipulated in the programme documents, the rating on the covered  bonds would fall to 'AA', one notch above the IDR. Kiwibank Limited - Mortgage Covered Bonds The covered bonds would be vulnerable to a downgrade if the bank's Long-Term IDR  falls below 'BBB+'. The 'AAA' breakeven of 90% is equal to the maximum  contractual AP in the programme; if the AP relied upon by Fitch rises to the  maximum contractual AP, ratings would not be affected.  Westpac New Zealand Limited - Mortgage Covered Bonds The covered bonds would be vulnerable to a downgrade if the bank's Long-Term IDR  falls below 'BBB+'. The 'AAA' breakeven of 90% is equal to the maximum  contractual AP in the programme; if the AP relied upon by Fitch rises to the  maximum contractual AP, ratings would not be impacted.  Fitch's 'AAA' breakeven AP for a given covered bond rating will be affected by,  among other factors, the profile of the cover assets relative to outstanding  covered bonds, which can change over time even in the absence of new issuance.  Therefore, the 'AAA' breakeven AP to maintain the covered bond rating cannot be  assumed to remain stable over time.

     The SGX Nifty Futures was trading at 8,197.50, up 0.21 pct from previous
close.
     The Indian rupee will likely open little changed to lower against the
dollar, tracking lacklustre trade across Asian currencies, as investors stay on
the sidelines ahead of the Federal Reserve's policy review that begins today.

been grappling with ballooning oversupply for over two years.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/standard-bank-ivorycoast-idUSL5N0YQ3MH20150604","Standard Bank board votes to open new Ivory Coast branch","","June 4, 2015 /  4:00 PM / 2 years ago","","ABIDJAN, June 4 (Reuters) - Standard Bank has decided to push forward with plans to open a new Ivory Coast-based branch to expand its operations to French-speaking West Africa, the bank's country manager said on Thursday. The bank, Africa's biggest lender by assets, opened a representative office in Ivory Coast's commercial capital Abidjan in early 2014. Herve Boyer told Reuters that Standard's board approved the conversion of the office into a branch last week. We have refocused the bank on Africa, and definitely one part of the puzzle was missing, which is francophone Africa, he said. Right now we think is a good time to transform the rep office into a full branch of the group. Ivory Coast, the world's top cocoa grower, has emerged as one of Africa's fastest growing economies since a brief 2011 civil war ended more than a decade of political turmoil. A presidential election in October could open the door to a flood of new foreign investment if, as expected, it is held without major incident. Following three years of heavy investment in large-scale infrastructure, Prime Minister Daniel Kablan Duncan told Reuters in March that he expected double-digit growth this year and every year through 2020. Boyer said that Standard Bank planned to apply for a banking license that would it allow it to operate across the West African Economic and Monetary Union (UEMOA), an eight member bloc that shares a common CFA franc currency pegged to the euro. Ivory Coast, a regional business and transport hub, makes up around 40 percent of the zone's economy. Other member states include Senegal, Benin, Burkina Faso, Togo, Mali, Niger and Guinea Bissau. Standard Bank must now seek approval from the South African Reserve Bank to open the branch and apply for a license with the Central Bank of West African States. Boyer said the bank was targeting the first quarter of 2016 for the branch's opening. Reporting by Joe Bavier Editing by Jeremy Gaunt"
"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-banks-trafficking-idUSKBN17Y22Q","Bank staff will 'red-flag' trafficking suspects with powerful new tool","","May 2, 2017 /  5:01 PM / 3 months ago","","LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - A fearful customer, a flurry of late-night transactions or suspicious financial documents; for bank staff these could all be giveaway signs of the booming global trade in humans. Bank employees will now be trained to spot and report signs of human trafficking using a practical toolkit - including red-flag indicators and case studies - launched by the European Bankers Alliance and the Thomson Reuters Foundation on Tuesday. The toolkit will be shared confidentially across the alliance, which was established in 2015 by the Thomson Reuters Foundation and includes Barclays, HSBC, Western Union, Standard Chartered, Deutsche Bank, Santander, UBS and Commerzbank. Nick Lewis, head of intelligence and investigations at Standard Chartered, said all employees would receive training based on the kit to fight the vile and inhumane crimes of human trafficking and modern slavery. Fighting human trafficking is already a priority for us, but saying that is not the same as giving our staff the skills they need to actually be able to identify it when they encounter it, said Lewis. The initiative also involves non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and law enforcement agencies in a joint response to rising concerns about the growth of trafficking rings operating across Europe.  Nearly 46 million people globally are living as slaves, forced to work in factories, mines and farms, sold for sex, trapped in debt bondage or born into servitude, according to the 2016 Global Slavery Index by rights group Walk Free Foundation. In Britain, an estimated 10,000 to 13,000 people are living as slaves, according to government figures.   Through access to huge amounts of traffickers' financial data and face-to-face contact with possible victims, banks are in a unique position to find information to identify and disrupt trafficking and help law enforcement agencies prosecute the crime. Activities covered in the kit include customer spending, flows of money in and out of global accounts as well as suspicious behavior observed in bank branches. Lewis said Standard Chartered staff would be trained to spot victims in branches who appear threatened or under the control of traffickers, and would then know what to do. He said that in certain cases, employees could also ask a customer if they are ok. This opens up a whole new domain of engagement and identification of trafficking victims ... and a whole new potential avenue for victims to say 'I'm not ok', he added.  But he said staff would not interrogate customers and would only act when particular circumstances arouse suspicion.  Lewis said that collaborating with other partners and a greater understanding of how money moves in source, transit and destination countries was also vital. The alliance also includes anti-trafficking NGO Stop the Traffik, Europe's police agency Europol, the UK Anti-Slavery Commissioner, the UK National Crime Agency and pro bono lawyers.  The trafficking of people is a business and it's about money; a lot of people globally are very wealthy because of slavery and exploitation, said Neil Giles, director of Stop the Traffik. It is only through collaboration that we will generate the systemic disruption required to bear down on modern slavery and undermine the markets in which people are bought and sold.

Thai banks are seeking opportunities overseas in response to limited growth potential at home due to the sluggish domestic economy that has led to slow loan growth and rising bad debts. SCB, Thailand's third-largest lender, is also keen to expand in Indonesia, Vietnam and Myanmar, Kamalkant Agarwal, the head of international banking at SCB, told Reuters. The Chinese branch would target clients seeking to make foreign direct investment (FDI) in Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam, he said. SCB, which has a representative office in Beijing, has submitted a proposal to open its first Chinese branch in Shanghai, Manop Sangiambut, executive vice president for the China division, said. The lender has so far approved $300 million in loans to Chinese customers, Manop said. As the economy slows in China, investors are expected to increasingly target the fast-growing economies of Southeast Asia. China's outward foreign direct investment will increase and we expect Thailand to be one of the beneficiaries, said Kamalkant. SCB is a relatively recent entrant to the international banking scene, and its foreign portfolio stands at around 0.2 percent of the total, he said. The Thai bank opened a branch in Vietnam earlier this year, and expects to expand there, he said. Fast-growing Vietnam is attracting rising FDI and has signed up to a number of free trade agreements that should boost it more. We are quietly confident about growing our business in Vietnam, he said. It is already at $2,000 per capita, which is typically the point at which discretionary spending breaks out. SCB also hopes to apply for a banking license in Myanmar when the new government calls for the next round of applicants, he said. Rival Bangkok Bank is among the banks that already have licences there.   (Reporting by Simon Webb and Manunphattr Dhanananphorn; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman)"

The move comes as French telecoms operator Orange and its partner Groupama also aim to launch Orange bank in mid-May in France, where the online banking market is dominated by ING Direct, Societe Generale's Boursorama and Credit Mutuel Arkea's Fortuneo. It is also part of Carrefour chief executive Georges Plassat's ambition to step up the company's online expansion, as he looks to cement a turnaround that was initially largely focused on revamping the group's physical store network. Plassat said this month that Carrefour targeted a group business volume of 4 billion euros ($4.3 billion) from E-commerce by 2020 against 1.2 billion in 2016. This service is fully in line with our digital transformation and Carrefour's will to innovate, Carrefour France executive director Noel Prioux told a news conference. Under the offer, a client going to a Carrefour store can buy for 5 euros from April 18 onwards a box coupling a current account managed online to a Mastercard payment card. The account allows no overdraft and is accessible to all regardless of income level or resources. It will cost its user one euro per month. We are launching the first current account distributed in France by a retailer, accessible to all with no income limitations, said Carrefour Banque CEO Julien Jaillon. Carrefour Banque, created in 1981 and 40 percent controlled by BNP Paribas, already offers consumer credit, savings, and insurance services to its 2.5 million clients. The new service, which is targeting tech-savvy people in their 20s and 30s as well as families, will initially be available in more than 3,000 Carrefour stores in France. Similar to the 'Nickel' account launched in late 2014 former SocGen communication official by Hughes Le Bret, which offers consumers accounts that can be opened at tobacco stores with only an ID card and a telephone number, C-zam is also available to people otherwise unable to get mainstream accounts. Jaillon did not provide financial targets for C-zam but said he had big ambitions in terms of volume for a service which he said was the most competitive price-wise in France. Carrefour Banque is following in the tracks of the big traditional French banks, which have boosted their online business to counter both low-cost Internet competitors and a drop in the numbers of clients visiting branches, both of which are denting their profits and forcing them to close outlets. $1 = 0.9264 euros

In 2015, the official Xinhua news agency ran stories about how Hunchun was accelerating its OBOR plans, and early in 2016, China's cabinet released a list of Chinese cities included in OBOR: Hunchun was on the map. The fact that the list came about slowly, and that some cities felt moved to lobby to be included, underlines how the pet project of Chinese President Xi Jinping is as amorphous as it is ambitious. The challenge of defining exactly what OBOR means will come to the fore later this month, when heads of state and senior officials from around the world gather in Beijing for the first major summit dedicated to the project. Frankly, I don't really know what the belt and the road are. The reason being that I think Beijing doesn't know either, said Tom Miller of Gavekal Dragonomics, who recently wrote a book on the New Silk Road. In theory, incentives for cities, companies and countries to be involved are strong: hundreds of billions of dollars are expected to be spent on roads, railways, pipelines, ports and industrial zones stretching from Sri Lanka to Djibouti. But as Hunchun shows, the reality of OBOR can be complicated and requires buy-in from other countries. The city's position at the apex of Russia, North Korea and China is a blessing and a curse. While Russia is gradually opening up to more trade, North Korea has stalled. Tantalisingly close to the sea but without a sea port after Russia's annexation in 1860, local businesses said they wanted to ship more goods via Rason, a nearby North Korean port earmarked as an export hub to China, Japan, South Korea and beyond. That would open a shipping route to southern China, but with sanctions in place against Pyongyang, global tensions rising over its arms program and Rason developing slowly, expectations of progress are low. We currently transport goods by rail to southern China. We'd like to ship from Rason, but at present that's not happening, said Wang Hai, general manager of Guanghai Import and Export Trading Company in Hunchun, a small firm with 12 staff, both Chinese and Russian. Hunchun is a hub for northeast Asia, so in theory it should play a big role in 'One Belt, One Road', but for now it hasn't been able to get its act together. (For a graphic on China's Hunchun city, click tmsnrt.rs/2qVcSJI) Russia More Promising?

Russian President Vladimir Putin will also attend, reflecting his country's importance in China's OBOR strategy; in Hunchun, some enterprises are already seeing benefits from mutual trade. Xingyang Seafood, for example, imports 90 percent of its seafood from Russia and 10 percent from North Korea, said chairman Zhao Yang. The main advantage of being in Hunchun is that we are close to Russia, Yang told Reuters. The company is headquartered in northern China's Shandong province, but in 2015 it opened a branch in Hunchun to exploit its proximity to Russia. How does North Korea help us? It doesn't help us at all, they have hardly any seafood left there. Hunchun's spokesman Hao Qiang declined to comment about the city's relationship with North Korea, because of the current political situation, and would not say how many North Koreans were working in the city. But we can talk about Hunchun's trade with Russia, the city's clean air and successful tree-planting initiatives. In addition to oil and gas export opportunities between Russia and China, Putin has spoken of roads and bridges being built to strengthen links. Russia has struggled, however, to lure enough people to sparsely populated regions bordering China's northeast, and there are concerns among Russians of creeping colonization if too much land is leased to the Chinese. They (Chinese) will live there, their relatives will come, they will deepen their roots there, they will take Russian women as wives, firebrand opposition politician Vladimir Zhirinovsky said in 2015, when proposals to lease Russian land to Chinese farmers were put forward. We will only have problems. I see no advantages. For Hunchun, OBOR is the latest in a series of development programmes aimed at revitalising Jilin province and China's northeast. In the 1990s, the United Nations backed the Tumen River Area Development Project, which became the Greater Tumen Initiative linking China, Mongolia, South Korea and Russia. The benefits of large-scale state investment are clear. From 25th place among smaller cities in Jilin in terms of economic growth, Hunchun now stands third. Foreign trade has doubled since 2011, according to city statistics. Whether OBOR can add value over the longer term is uncertain, Peter Cai wrote in a report for the Lowy Institute, an Australian think-tank. If the Chinese government fails to connect its domestic projects with overseas components, OBOR will be little different from other domestic infrastructure programmes, greatly diminishing its economic and strategic value.

These independents, known as teapots since they are smaller companies than their state-owned rivals, are scrambling to survive shifting government policies at the same time domestic oil demand growth is slowing, undermining their ability to expand by just serving their home market. In 2016, China's annual fuel demand growth was at a three-year low. The good days won't last much longer, as China's oil demand has been shrinking, said Zhang Liucheng, vice president of Shandong Dongming Petrochemical Group, the country's largest independent refiner. Late last year, Beijing suspended fuel export quotas for the independents, handing control of diesel and gasoline exports to the dominant state refiners. Other government moves may also squeeze the independent's margins. Top state refiner Sinopec overhauled its fuel buying policy by centralizing all purchases at its Beijing headquarters and China plans to slap consumption taxes on refinery by-products such as light cycle oil, sold as diesel, and mixed aromatics, which are added to gasoline to improve fuel quality. They had already been diversified and nimble at working around the various government mandates...now they are definitely looking for ways to step up their game and have better people, global access and financing to do so, said Michal Meidan, analyst at consultants Energy Aspects. Executives at some of China's top independent refiners outlined to Reuters their plans to diversify to endure these changes. Dongming, for example, plans to add a 800,000 tons-per-year naphtha cracker, extending its business from transportation fuels to higher value plastics and synthetic rubber as well as fine chemicals, said Zhang. The 260,000 barrels-per-day (bpd) refiner is also looking to invest in small-scale onshore fields, said Zhang.  Zhang also aims to boost trading operations by combining physical oil and gas trading with financial services such as offering credit facilities for fellow teapots at better rates than banks. FILE PHOTO: A worker walks past oil pipes at a refinery in Wuhan, Hubei province March 23, 2012.Stringer/File PhotoUnderscoring how much Beijing has prioritized clean energy, Shandong Haike Group said it will open this month a factory that makes electrolytes used in lithium batteries for electric vehicles. The company said the plant will be the country's largest with the capacity to produce 100,000 tons a year. It also plans to grow its pharmaceutical business but has no plans to expand its refining capacity. Uncertain Future for Teapots Slideshow (2 Images)Shandong Chambroad Group plans to move into lumber processing to develop a special building material for villa cottages and gardens, said chairman Ma Yunsheng. In addition to the policy actions against them, the teapots have lost a major advocate with the departure of Shandong provincial governor Guo Shuqing, which further shrouds their future, said Energy Aspects' Meidan. Newly installed Shandong party chief Liu Jiayi could try to tackle overcapacity and pollution in the province, which would add to pressure on the independents, she said.  For some, the expansions are an opportunity to move from a small local operation into a global company.  Shandong Hengyuan Petrochemical Co, a refiner backed by a local government and the first teapot to own a refinery abroad, wants to become a regional player, combining assets at its home base in Shandong with the refinery in Port Dickson, Malaysia, that it recently acquired from Shell (RDSa.L). As part of the expansion, it will set up a trading desk in Kuala Lumpur to secure crude for the two plants with a combined capacity of 160,000 bpd and also supply 4 millions of tons of fuel annually to Shell under a 10-year pact.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/qatar-media-idUSL8N1DW44I","Blocked Qatari news site blames government censorship","","December 1, 2016 /  12:26 PM / in 8 months","","DOHA (Reuters) - An independent English-language news site in Qatar accused the Gulf state of censorship on Thursday, saying two Internet service providers had simultaneously blocked access to it. We can only conclude that our website has been deliberately targeted and blocked by Qatar authorities, the Doha News said in a statement. We are incredibly disappointed with this decision, which appears to be an act of censorship. A spokesman for the Qatari government did not respond to phone messages seeking comment. The two Internet service providers, Vodafone Qatar and state-controlled Ooredoo ORDS.QA, declined to comment. Freedom of expression is tightly controlled in Qatar with self-censorship prevalent among national newspapers and other media outlets. The gas-rich state has faced increased international scrutiny over alleged corruption and labor abuse as it prepares to host the 2022 soccer World Cup. Internet users outside Qatar were still able to access the Doha News, which stirred a debate about the limits of tolerance with an opinion column in August about gay rights in the conservative country. Rights group Amnesty International said the government appeared to have targeted a key source of journalism which fostered dialogue and discussion about social and political issues that affect people in Qatar.  Some Qataris on social media said they were upset at the news site being blocked, calling it a setback for the country. It's extremely worrying that @dohanews has been blocked. We always prided our self in being open to voices, Anood al-Thani, a student, said on Twitter. Others said Doha News, which has an audience of around one million unique users per month, was run by foreigners and had put itself at risk by being unfairly critical in its reporting. The site has an unprofessional bias against Qatar and recently became the source of all those foreign media attacks on Qatar, feeding them with everything that offends us, tweeted Ahmed al-Kuwari, a Qatari engineer. Qatar finances and hosts the pan-Arab satellite TV network Al Jazeera, which has won millions of viewers across the Arab world and beyond, as well as the government-funded Doha Centre for Media Freedom. A 2016 survey by Northwestern University, one of six prominent U.S. schools with branches in the country, showed most Qataris support the principle of free speech online. But the same survey also showed that a majority want the Internet to be more tightly regulated. A close U.S. ally that hosts a large U.S. military base, Doha has escaped the unrest that has engulfed other parts of the region. It lacks any organized political opposition.

A defiant Erdogan, whose narrow victory exposed the nation's deep divisions, has said Sunday's vote ended all debate on the more powerful presidency he has long sought, and told European observers who criticised it: talk to the hand. Prime Minister Binali Yildirim, whose job will cease to exist once the constitutional changes take full effect, said Erdogan would be invited to rejoin the ruling AK Party as soon as official results are announced, a sign the government has no intention of waiting to see the outcome of opposition appeals. More from Reuters:  * COMMENTARY: The real winners, and losers, in the Turkish referendum reut.rs/2oiA6bM * COMMENTARY: Why Assad used chemical weapons  reut.rs/2o5FMEV Under the outgoing constitution, the president had been required to remain impartial and renounce party political ties. Few in Turkey expect legal challenges to the referendum to lead to a recount, let alone a re-run. But if unresolved, they will leave deep questions over the legitimacy of a vote which split the electorate down the middle, and whose polarising campaign drew criticism and concern from European allies. Turkey's bar association said a last-minute decision by the YSK electoral board to allow unstamped ballots in the referendum was clearly against the law, prevented proper records being kept, and may have impacted the results. With this illegal decision, ballot box councils (officials at polling stations) were misled into believing that the use of unstamped ballots was appropriate, the Union of Turkish Bar Associations (TBB) said in a statement. Related CoveragePutin congratulates Turkey's Erdogan for referendum win: sourcesObserver says 2.5 million Turkish referendum votes could have been manipulatedPro-Erdogan vote among Turks in Germany unleashes integration rowOur regret is not over the outcome of the referendum, but because of the desire to overlook clear and harsh violations of the law that have the potential to impact the results, it said. The main opposition People's Republican Party (CHP), which has said it will take its challenge to the European Court of Human Rights if necessary, presented a formal appeal to annul the vote to the YSK. CHP deputy chairman Bulent Tezcan said the number of missing votes was unprecedented, although the exact number of unstamped ballots was unknown.  YSK Chairman Sadi Guven said on Monday the last-minute decision to allow unstamped ballots was not unprecedented as the government had previously permitted such a move. An Austrian member of the Council of Europe observer mission said up to 2.5 million votes could have been manipulated, almost double the margin of Erdogan's victory, and that the YSK decision on unstamped ballots appeared illegal. Anti-government demonstrators shout slogans during a protest in the Kadikoy district of Istanbul, Turkey, April 17, 2017.Kemal AslanThese complaints are to be taken very seriously and they are, in any case, of such an extent that they would turn around the outcome of the vote, Alev Korun told ORF radio. The European Commission, which unlike U.S. President Donald Trump has declined to congratulate Erdogan on Sunday's vote, called on Turkey to launch a transparent investigation into the alleged irregularities. There will be no call to Erdogan from the Commission, certainly not a congratulatory call, a Western official with knowledge of EU policy told Reuters. Turkey is sliding towards a semi-authoritarian system under one-man rule. Considerable Complaints Election authorities have said preliminary results showed 51.4 percent of voters had backed the biggest overhaul of Turkish politics since the founding of the modern republic, a far narrower margin than Erdogan had been seeking.  Slideshow (11 Images)Erdogan argues that concentration of power in the presidency is needed to prevent instability. Opponents accuse him of leading a drive toward one-man rule in Turkey, a NATO member that borders Iran, Iraq and Syria and whose stability is of vital importance to the United States and the European Union. Speaking in parliament on Tuesday, Yildirim said rumours of irregularities were a vain effort to cast doubt on the result. The people's will has been reflected at the ballot box, and the debate is over, he said. Everyone should respect the outcome, especially the main opposition. Omer Celik, minister for European affairs, said criticism of the referendum was politically motivated, defending what he said were Turkey's strong legal framework and transparent election process.   The YSK said on its website on Sunday, as votes were still being cast, that it had received considerable complaints that voters had been given slips and envelopes without official stamps and that - after an appeal from a ruling AK Party official - it would accept unstamped documents as long as they were not proven to be fraudulent. The bar association, whose head Metin Feyzioglu is seen as a potential future leader of the opposition CHP, said it had also received phone calls from many provinces about unstamped ballots on Sunday and that its lawyers had advised that records of this should be closely kept once ballot boxes were opened. But it said that had failed to happen, and that evidence of irregularities had therefore not been properly archived. On its website, the YSK gave four examples of cases in previous decades where unstamped ballots had been accepted at individual ballot boxes. But those cases only affected several hundred votes and the decision was taken days after the vote and only once the possibility of fraud had been ruled out.  The YSK has also decided to annul elections in the past because of unstamped ballots. It cancelled the results of local elections in two districts in southeastern Turkey in April 2014 and re-held them two months later. And in Sunday's referendum, the YSK's overseas election branch had already rejected an appeal by a ruling AK Party official to have unstamped envelopes counted as valid. YSK officials could not be reached for comment.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed-breakingviews-idUSKBN16N2VP","Cox: Please don't let the Fed become the new SEC","","March 16, 2017 /  8:35 PM / in 4 months",""," NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - For the first time since self-professed, easy-money real-estate developer Donald Trump became president, the Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate. All hell has not broken loose. That may be of some comfort to Janet Yellen, chair of the U.S. central bank, and her colleagues, who reasonably might have feared a backlash from a White House promising economic sparks.  As official rates rise, even if by just 25-basis-point increments, the cost of money goes up across the board for families looking to buy houses, drivers trading in their cars, teenagers heading to college or consumers brandishing credit cards at the mall – and even for property moguls. That's why Trump candidly admitted during the campaign that lower interest rates have been very good to him. A 30-year bull market in bonds arguably helped him turn a small portfolio of buildings and golf clubs, along with some cash bequeathed by his father, into extraordinary wealth and a platform to work from the Oval Office.  His unpredictable style, however, has left open the question of how he will approach the Fed's independence should a duty to keep the economy from boiling over run up against a pledge to return GDP growth to 3 percent or higher. Aside from the diminishing force of his Twitter handle, Trump has a nearly unprecedented opportunity to overhaul the central bank thanks to a raft of vacancies on its important steering body, the Board of Governors.  With three vacancies to fill pretty much immediately, and perhaps two more prying loose in the first half of 2018 should Yellen decide to retire, Trump could stack the seven-member Fed leadership squad with people whose views are more to his liking. This would extend beyond monetary policy to include banking regulation and financial-market stability, matters within the purview of the world's most influential central bank.  Given some of Trump's iconoclastic cabinet picks, such as those leading the Energy Department and the Environmental Protection Agency, and a demonstrated desire from legislators in both parties to rein in its powers, Fed independence cannot be a foregone conclusion.  The worry is that an increasingly politicized Fed – one where members of Congress and the executive branch meddle in the minutiae of decisions relating to the institution's mandates of maximizing U.S. employment and keeping prices stable – fails to do its job well. The flawed experience of the Securities and Exchange Commission, America's main enforcer of investor protection, offers an example of how such a thing might damage the Fed.  It's easy to knock the SEC. Indeed, it has become something of a punching bag for politicians blaming it for failing to prevent, among other fiascos: Bernie Madoff's massive Ponzi scheme, the bankruptcies of Enron and WorldCom, and the demise of onetime Wall Street titans Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns, for which it was the primary regulator. A 2010 report entitled The SEC: Designed for Failure by the minority staff at a House of Representatives committee makes for particularly gruesome reading.  And that’s sort of the problem. The agency must plead annually to Congress for its budget, despite raising revenue from fines and other enforcement mechanisms. That creates an unholy symbiosis whereby lawmakers on the one hand excoriate its processes as technologically backward, as California Representative Darrell Issa, a Republican, did for, among other crimes, using Google Finance and other commercially available resources to scrutinize corporate filings. Then they delineate its budget in ways that impede making long-term investments in better analytical tools.  The nomination process is also fraught with politics. Under the 1934 law that created the SEC, Congress mandated that five commissioners would be appointed by the president with the advice and consent of the Senate. But not more than three of such commissioners shall be members of the same political party, and in making appointments members of different political parties shall be appointed alternately as nearly as may be practicable.  While the idea may have sounded right at the time, it has effectively foisted the extreme partisan divisiveness that characterizes America's political class upon the leadership of the SEC, which should be a group willing and able to fulfill its mission of protecting investors without fear or favor. This partly explains how an initiative like the fiduciary rule, which states that investment advisers must act in the best interest of their clients, wound up outside the SEC's oversight. Politics at the commission prevented it from taking up the proposal, which whatever one thinks of its design, hardly belongs under the Department of Labor’s remit.  Nominations to the Fed board have become terribly fractious, too. Yellen was confirmed by a 56-26 vote in 2014. Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer received 27 votes against his nomination later that same year. By contrast, Alan Greenspan was confirmed to replace Paul Volcker in 1987 with only two senators objecting. The trajectory is moving toward more partisanship, which gives Trump, whose party also controls the Senate, an extraordinary opportunity.  Some senators may know better than to fiddle with Fed independence. It didn't work out well for the American economy when Arthur Burns supinely crafted policy to benefit President Richard Nixon. Indeed, after Burns, the smaller chamber changed the way the nation appointed the chairman. Up until then, while all Fed board members faced a confirmation vote for their 14-year terms, the president picked the chair without Senate approval. With the 1977 Federal Reserve Reform Act, the Senate gave itself that right.  While this might suggest that checks and balances can help insulate an institution like the Fed from presidential whims, it only works if the Senate can be relied upon to defend its independence. If today’s Senate does not, then Americans can expect the future of monetary policy and bank regulation to have an unhealthy SEC flavor.BreakingviewsReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/wells-fargo-marketing-idUSL2N1GY1SG","Wells Fargo banks on new ad campaign to regain customer trust","","March 21, 2017 /  7:54 PM / in 4 months","","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co will launch a new multi-channel ad campaign, its chief executive said on Tuesday, in a further sign of the bank's efforts to regain trust after a sales scandal last year caused a sharp drop in account openings. The advertising campaign, to begin in mid-April, will be published across different media channels and focus on the changes the bank has implemented since it was rocked by revelations over illegal sales practices in September last year. For our team members and customers, we want to create a culture that's better every day, Chief Executive Officer Timothy Sloan said in explaining the new campaign to employees at a town hall meeting in Orlando, Florida on Tuesday. Building Better Every Day, the slogan of the new campaign, will run across broadcast and print ads, online and on the bank's mobile app, as well as on its internal channels, Sloan said. A spokesman declined to comment on the budget for the new campaign. But following the fallout, Wells Fargo last year said it would increase marketing spending and in October 2016 launched its first nation-wide campaign to address its sales practices. Data by Kantar Media, a New York-based ad-tracking firm, showed that Wells Fargo's advertisement expenditure rose by around 15 percent to $183.8 million in the first 11 months of 2016 compared to the year prior. In October last year, the bank's advertisement expenditure across TV, internet, radio, outdoor displays, magazines and newspapers increased by 32 percent on a yearly basis to $27.5 million. A Wells Fargo spokeswoman could not immediately comment on whether the increase was directly related to the company's 2016 campaign. A spokeswoman for marketing group Omnicom, which owns media agency OMD that runs the bank's advertisement campaigns, did not reply to requests seeking comment. Federal regulators last year had ordered the San Francisco-based bank to pay $190 million in fines and restitution because they said its high pressure sales environment pushed employees to open 2 million deposit and credit card accounts without customers' permission. The bank has since unveiled a new compensation structure for its branch employees that creates incentives based on customer service rather than sales goals.  Wells Fargo, the third-largest U.S. bank, saw a sharp drop in account openings, customer interactions at its branches and an increase in account closures since the scandal. It has since started to report on consumer activity on a monthly basis. Its latest retail business figures on Monday showed the bank is still fighting an uphill battle to regain customers. Consumers opened 43 percent fewer checking and 55 percent fewer credit card accounts on a yearly basis in February. A pick-up in marketing spend should benefit account openings the next few months, but were that not to occur, then it could force us to reconsider the long-term growth potential in Wells' retail bank, Brian Kleinhanzl, an analyst with KBW said in a research note on Monday. But other analysts said the bank hardly had a choice when it came to investing in public outreach campaigns. If they do spend, they get accused of wasting money, Stephen Biggar, an analyst with Argus Research, told Reuters. But if they don't spend, they get accused of not doing everything they can to regain customers.     Reporting by Tina Bellon; Additional reporting by Tim Baysinger; Editing by Bernard Orr"
"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-visa-ban-commentary-idUSKBN15G4T0","Commentary: Trump's visa ban isn't as new as you think","","February 1, 2017 /  3:16 PM / 6 months ago","","For those who say This is not who we are, look again. Sadly, it’s who we’ve always been.  President Donald Trump's executive order banning travelers and refugees from seven predominantly Muslim countries is only the latest twist of dark threads that have long been present in America. The executive order is not unprecedented. It is evolutionary.  The countries affected by Trump's executive order – Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen – have been singled out under American immigration law since the days following 9/11.  But let’s be more specific. Trump’s executive order only lists Syria by name. It refers to the other countries in reference to a 2015 Obama-era law, 8 U.S.C. 1187(a)(12). (And the list thus has nothing to do with any of Trump’s business interests. He did not create it, nor is he the first American president to omit Saudi Arabia from post-9/11 scrutiny.) That list, part of the Orwellian-named Visa Waiver Program Improvement and Terrorist Travel Prevention Act of 2015, disallows use of America's visa-free travel program to persons who even once visited the targeted nations. So, for example, British citizens otherwise eligible to enter the United States without a visa must instead appear for questioning and be individually approved for an actual printed visa in their passport at an American embassy or consulate abroad. The rule applies even if their travel was as a journalist or member of a volunteer health team.  Though Trump in his crude style proposes extreme vetting, such a process has been in place since the George W. Bush administration, continued under Barack Obama, and is operating today. It too has an Orwellian name, administrative processing. Among the nations affected: those same seven countries. People from these nations go through an alternate visa procedure that delays their travel as they wait to be vetted by various intelligence agencies. Some applications are left to pend indefinitely.  There were no mass dissent memos filed by State Department employees over any of those steps.  READ MORE COVERAGE OF THE 45th U.S. PRESIDENT: Exclusive: A third of Americans think Trump's travel ban will make them saferCommentary: 'Why is my family a national security threat?'Commentary: National security in an 'alt-facts' worldCommentary: With Trump, a VERY DIFFERENT presidency. Exciting!  While the idealized stories of individual refugees heard this weekend are deeply emotional, left undiscussed was the fact that compared to other nations, the United States is quite stingy in the number of people it accepts.  America sets an annual ceiling on refugees; for FY 2016 it was 85,000. Refugee number 85,001, no matter how desperate, waits until next year. Go back to 2006, and the ceiling was 70,000 (though less than 50,000 were actually admitted). There have been refugee surges into the United States such as Holocaust survivors following World War Two (650,000 displaced people, opposed by half of Americans) and Vietnamese boat people (130,000, opposed by 57 percent of Americans), though Americans historically fear refugees, rather than welcome them.  Since 1980, the United States has accepted fewer than two million refugees overall, and 40 percent of those were children accompanying their refugee parent(s). By contrast, though not limited to refugees, the Obama administration alone deported 2.5 million people.  A total of 30 American governors said they'd refuse to accept Syrian refugees into their states if they could. Some 60 percent of all Americans oppose accepting any Syrian refugees. A little less than half of Americans polled support suspending immigration from “terror prone regions.”  The FY2016 American quota for Syrian refugees was 10,000. In contrast, among Syrians alone, Canada in 2016 took in 25,000. Germany admitted 300,000 refugees from various nations in 2016, following close to one million in 2015.  8 U.S.C. 1152 Sec. 202(a)(1)(A) makes it unlawful to ban immigrants (Legal Permanent Residents, green card holders) because of nationality, place of birth, or place of residence. The law however is silent on banning non-immigrants such as tourists or students, as well as refugees, for those same reasons.  And even though legal immigrants are not banned by nationality or place of birth per se, yearly limits on the number of immigrants from certain nations are near-virtual bans. For example, the restrictions some Filipino and Mexican relatives of American citizens face amount to a 24-year wait (another Orwellian term, priority date) for a green card. It is not uncommon for applicants to die before their turn comes.  Challenges to Trump’s order will be difficult. Acting Attorney General Sally Yates, who was fired after refusing to defend Trump's executive order in court even after her own department's Office of the Legal Counsel signed off, appeared to base her opposition on other than strict legal grounds – the intent of the order. She singled out personal objections over whether the order was a “wise or just” policy.  American courts have as recently as 2015 upheld the long-standing non- judicial reviewability of visa decisions made abroad, meaning those decisions cannot be challenged in domestic courts. The United States also generally does not extend the protections of American law to foreigners outside the country. The Supreme Court acknowledges immigration law’s plenary power” doctrine, leaving most discretionary decisions in the hands of the executive branch. Legal victories this weekend were only limited stays of actions inside American borders, and complied with by the Department of Homeland Security on an exceptional “national interest” basis, not a policy one. It is unclear a Constitutional crisis is afoot.  However, the most noteworthy aspect of Trump's executive action on immigration is the driver of it all: fear.  The government of the United States, from September 12, 2001 through the present day, has fanned the flames of fear. Despite an American here at home having a greater chance of dying in a fall than by terror, Trump follows his predecessors in warning of attacks inside the Homeland committed by the poster child of fear, the foreign militant infiltrating the United States. What happened if we didn't act and somebody was killed? Trump spokesperson Sean Spicer said in defense of the executive order. The order itself invokes the specter of 9/11, even further receded into history than the last time it was invoked to support something (torture, leaving Guantanamo open, shoes off at the airport...).  Nothing Trump has done regarding immigration will make America safer. But like much of the security theater normalized post-9/11, safety is not the point. Keeping fear alive and maintaining the politically-driven myth that government is on the job protecting the Homeland is what matters. Trump knows this, as did Obama and Bush.  The ugly truth is despite the protests, a number of Americans remain afraid of foreigners and want what Trump is giving them. They always have.

Al Safa Bank Co., founded locally, will be based in Ramallah, the seat of the Palestinian government in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. It will be capitalised at $75 million. Taking this step reflects confidence in the Palestinian economy and its banking sector, and in the fact that prospects for investment show promise, secretary of the founding  committee, Abdel-Rahim Al-Hassan, told Reuters. Co-founders of the bank have already bought some 37 million shares, valued at $37 million, with another 38 million shares now on sale to the public, Al-Hassan said. The Ramallah branch will open in the third quarter of 2016, he said. Al Safa will be the third bank in the West Bank to operate under Islamic law in which all forms of interest are forbidden and banks and customers share investment risks and any profits. Al-Hassan said the bank will offer services that include project-funding, foreign currency trading and real estate investment. Reporting by Ali Sawafta; Writing by Nidal Almughrabi; Editing

In a royal decree read on state television, the king also reshuffled the country's top religious body, the Council of Senior Scholars, and the Shura Council, which advises the government. The changes come as the kingdom prepares to implement reforms proposed by its Vision 2030, which aims to reduce dependence on oil, attract foreign investments and promote more cultural openness. State television said King Salman had appointed Ali bin Nasser al-Ghafis as labor minister to replace Mufrej al-Haqbani. Ghafis is currently head of the Technical and Vocational Training Corporation, a network of colleges set up to train young Saudis in the trades. The program had long been regarded as ineffective but received a new lease on life under former labor minister Adel Fakieh, who is now a leading figure in the kingdom's initiative to transform its oil-dependent economy. The king also changed the secretary-general of the country's consultative Shura Council, Mohammed Al Amro, and replaced several members of the assembly. Some members of the council have recently come under fire on social media for proposing or supporting cuts to some social benefits and the raising of prices of some basic services. Labor Woes Haqbani faced a slew of challenges in his time at the helm of the Labour Ministry, as a sharp drop in crude prices slashed government revenues and took a toll on economic growth. Job creation dried up this year amid severe cuts to public spending and delays in state payments to contractors, despite reforms geared toward creating jobs for Saudis. The unemployment rate rose to 12.1 percent in the third quarter, up from 11.6 percent the previous quarter. The kingdom's economic reform plan, led by Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, has set targets to cut the jobless rate to 7 percent by 2030 and raise women's participation in the labor force to 30 percent from 22 percent. Saudi Arabia has also been embarrassed this year by labor unrest, as delayed payments by the state have pushed the kingdom's largest contractors into financial duress and led them to delay salary payments. Thousands of mostly foreign employees went unpaid for months and were abandoned without food in squalid labor camps. As the salary delays worsened, frustrated workers have in some cases staged rare public protests. Modern-Thinking Scholars The appointment of more modern-thinking clerics to the Council of Senior Scholars also appears to support the reform plan, which has courted controversy in the conservative Sunni kingdom by calling for entertainment and women's employment. New members include Mohammed al-Issa, a previous minister of justice and former member of the council often cited by liberals as the sort of moderate Wahhabi cleric that reformers in the royal family want to promote. Another new member, Sulaiman Aba al-Khail, was formerly head of the religiously-oriented Imam bin Saud University and described by Saudi Twitter users as liberal. Aba al-Khail was quoted in an interview with al-Watan newspaper last month as saying that some scholars have corrupted the minds of young Saudis. The council remains dominated by older conservatives such as Saleh al-Fawzan and Saleh al-Luhaidan, who once called for Muslim media owners who broadcast depravity to be executed. In recent years, however, the government has promoted more moderate clerics and opened up the council to include scholars from the other main branches of Sunni jurisprudence beyond the Hanbali school followed by Wahhabis.

Sheikh Khalid Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, a member of the Abu Dhabi royal family, joined Prince Andrew, The Duke of York, to open the office at One Hyde Park, the 1 billion pound luxury Candy and Candy development located near the Harrods department store. Trad Al Mahmoud, chief executive of ADIB Group, said the bank was hoping to attract clients from the UAE who use London as their base for business and personal transactions and who desire Islamic finance services, based on principles such as a ban on interest and pure monetary speculation. This launch signifies the merging of our Islamic financial values with the advanced financial infrastructure and ecosystem of the UK, said Mahmoud. The UK is the largest Islamic finance centre in Europe, with 19 billion dollars out of global assets of 1.7 trillion dollars and is home to five fully sharia-compliant banks, data from the UK Islamic Finance Secretariat (UKIFS) estimates. Although there are now 22 banks in Britain licensed to conduct Islamic finance transactions, ADIB is the first UAE-based financial institution to receive a banking operation licence from the UK Financial Services Authority (FSA). Britain's largest standalone sharia bank, Bank of London and the Middle East (BLME), is awaiting regulatory approval to move in the reverse direction to tap into the close ties between the oil-rich Gulf and the UK. It is aiming to start operations in the Gulf, initially with a representative office this year, and a branch or subsidiary in the longer term, Chief Executive Humphrey Percy told Reuters in an interview. Earlier in May, ADIB warned that profit growth for the rest of the year would be subdued as it posted flat income for the first quarter of 2012 and warned of the impact of the global financial crisis and euro zone uncertainty on its business. One Hyde Park, completed just over a year ago, is one of London's most expensive retail and residential developments, housing the most expensive flat in Britain, sold for 136 million pounds ($213.24 million). Investors seeking safe havens for their cash have flocked to central London, stoking demand for the best shop units in the British capital's prime shopping streets. It was built by Project Grande (Guernsey) Ltd, a joint venture between Christian Candy's company CPC, and Waterknights, a company owned by the prime minister of Qatar, Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr Al-Thani. It is also home to a Rolex outlet and a store selling McLaren's new sports car."

The OPEC country is slowly getting back on its feet nine years after the U.S.-led invasion that toppled former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein and it needs foreign investment in virtually every sector to rebuild its dilapidated infrastructure. Iraq is expected to be the world's biggest source of new oil supplies over the next few years after signing contracts with international oil companies, and draw more investment in other areas like infrastructure. The country is on the comeback, business conditions have improved considerably and it's the right time to get in, Tirad Al Mahmoud, CEO of ADIB, said in a statement. Iraq is safer now than the years of the sectarian violence in 2006-07 but attacks and bombings are still happening daily. Just last week, more than 100 people were killed in coordinated attacks across the country. The Central Bank of Iraq confirmed granting a license for the UAE bank to open a branch in the country. According to the central bank website, Iraq has seven state-owned banks, 23 private banks, and 11 Islamic private banks, including Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank. Most banking activities are conducted by two state-owned banks, Rafidain and Rashid. Much of the private banking activity is limited to deposit services and a small amount is personal lending. Our challenges are clear. We aim to increase the private sector banks' share of the Iraqi market from the current level of less than 20 percent and to develop the Islamic banking industry there, Mahmoud said.

For years, the OPEC member's economic performance has lagged other Gulf Arab oil exporters as ingrained political tensions between the cabinet and parliament, and entrenched bureaucracy, have delayed business reforms and multi-billion-dollar infrastructure plans. The new rules will have a positive impact on the local market as they enrich the type of services being offered, create new jobs and ultimately result in the economic and social growth of the country, the central bank said in a statement. Previously, each foreign bank was limited to opening one branch in Kuwait; that restriction will now be removed, though the central bank will still approve new branches on a case-by-case basis. The new rules also allow foreign lenders to open representative offices in Kuwait, one of the world's major oil exporters, the central bank said on its website (www.cbk.gov.kw). Kuwait has 11 domestic banks: five conventional, five Islamic and one specialised bank, according to the central bank. There are also 11 branches of foreign banks, including top regional lenders such as National Bank of Abu Dhabi  and Qatar National Bank, as well as international heavyweights such as BNP Paribas, Citigroup and HSBC. I do not see that it is going to make a big difference. In general, the main issue for banks is that the sector is underdeveloped and the general economic situation is not very helpful, Abdul Aziz al-Yaqout, regional managing partner at the DLA Piper law firm, said of the new rules. I do not see that Western banks are going to necessarily use this opportunity. The overall environment still has to change, then it will be interesting. Other restrictions on foreign banks in Kuwait have limited them to offering investment banking services and banned them from competing in the retail sector. It was not immediately clear whether these restrictions might be eased. Kuwait's $186 billion economy is expected to grow by a mere 3.0 percent this year, the slowest pace among the six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, slightly up from an estimated 2.8 percent last year, a Reuters poll of analysts showed in January. The International Monetary Fund said in December that Kuwait's heavy reliance on oil revenues - oil and its products account for more than 95 percent of goods exports - had increased income volatility and risks to long-run growth. Credit growth in Kuwait has been extremely weak. So one argument would be: let more foreign banks come in and let them compete and perhaps they can kick-start lending more aggressively, said Farouk Soussa, Citigroup's chief economist for the region. If you speak to people in banks in Kuwait, they are more than happy to lend, provide credit to viable projects and companies. But there are not many of those guys in Kuwait, so it does not matter how much supply you put in, you have to improve demand as well. So I think there is a bit of a problem there. Kuwait attracted mere $4.7 billion in foreign direct investment in a decade to 2012, just 1.4 percent of total flows into the six GCC states, according to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development.

The aim is that the China Construction Bank has a hub in Switzerland by the end of this year, Finance Minister Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf is quoted as saying by Swiss newswire SDA, while speaking on Friday on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos. Widmer-Schlumpf said the bank had shown a clear desire to set up a branch in Switzerland, either in Geneva or Zurich, but that it had not yet filed an application and that a few regulatory questions needed to be answered first. A spokesman for the Swiss finance department confirmed Widmer-Schlumpf's comments. A representative for CCB was not immediately available for comment outside of business hours. News of a CCB's possible arrival in Switzerland follows an agreement this week between the Swiss National Bank and the People's Bank of China to establish clearing arrangements in Switzerland for trading of the yuan, or renminbi, and extend a pilot scheme for clients of Swiss banks. Switzerland has sought to attract a Chinese bank in order to help strengthen its case to be a major renminbi trading hub. Until recently, transactions in China's currency have been impractical for all but very large European companies that are able to involve China's central bank in a deal, because the renminbi is not freely convertible. China's central bank has already chosen Sydney, Seoul, Paris, Luxembourg, London, Frankfurt, Singapore and Hong Kong as global centres for renminbi trading, as part of efforts to promote the use of its currency in international trade.

Former Norwegian Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg, who took over on Wednesday as NATO secretary-general, struck a more conciliatory tone towards Moscow than his Danish predecessor Anders Fogh Rasmussen. Stoltenberg said Russia needed to demonstrate a clear change in its actions and to comply with international law over Ukraine, where Moscow has annexed the Crimea region and supports pro-Russian separatists in the east. But, speaking at his first news conference at NATO headquarters, he said: I see no contradiction between a strong NATO and our continued effort to build a constructive relationship with Russia. Just the opposite. The ceasefire in Ukraine offered an opportunity, Stoltenberg said, although he said Russia maintained its ability to destabilise Ukraine. Stoltenberg, 55, who in his youth was an anti-war activist, is known for his skills in forging compromise and for his knowledge of Russia. As prime minister, he negotiated a deal with Russia in 2010 that ended a four-decade dispute over their Arctic maritime borders and built a personal friendship with then-president Dmitry Medvedev. Stoltenberg takes over at a time when NATO is wrapping up its combat mission in Afghanistan but faces new challenges from a resurgent Russia to the east and Islamic State militants on the southern border of NATO ally Turkey. Symbolising these twin challenges, Stoltenberg said his first visits in the coming days would be to Poland and Turkey. NATO said last week Russia has withdrawn many of the more than 1,000 troops it had inside Ukraine but kept a large force near the border. Halting Cooperation NATO suspended all practical cooperation with Russia in April in protest against its annexation of Crimea. It said high-level political contacts with Russia could continue but NATO and Russian ambassadors have met only twice since the Crimea crisis erupted. NATO would consider any Russian request for a new meeting with an open mind, Stoltenberg said. Russian President Vladimir Putin welcomed Stoltenberg's appointment in April, saying the pair had very good relations. Stoltenberg's comments contrasted with the hard line taken by Rasmussen, whose attempts to build a strategic partnership with Moscow were dealt severe blows first by Russia's war with Georgia in 2008 and now by the Ukraine crisis. After the Russian aggression against Ukraine, I also had to realize that the security situation in Europe was, and now is, dramatically changed and it is clear that Russia doesn't consider us a partner, but rather an adversary, Rasmussen told Reuters in a telephone interview on Wednesday. Russia's behaviour was the strongest regret of his time in office, he said. NATO has made clear it will not intervene militarily in Ukraine, which is not an alliance member, but it has reinforced the defences of its eastern allies, which worry they could be a target of Russian aggression. NATO as an organisation also has no plans to fight Islamic State, but a number of NATO allies are taking part in air strikes in Iraq or Syria. Stoltenberg made clear NATO would come to Turkey's aid if it was attacked. Our responsibility, the basic responsibility, is to stand up and be very clear that we are going to protect Turkey, that collective defence, Article 5, is something which is also going to be applied if Turkey is in any way attacked, he said. Article 5 is NATO's key mutual self-defence clause. Editing by Tom Heneghan"

Two of the sources said Anirudh Singh, 33, expected to raise at least $200 million for the fund, while one source put the potential launch capital at more than $100 million. Singh worked for Eton Park for roughly six years after a stint at Goldman Sachs, documents filed with Britain's Financial Conduct Authority show. He is not deregistered from the firm. Singh did not respond to requests for comment. His move would be the first spin-out from Eton Park's London office since its assets halved from a peak of $14 billion in 2011. After a tough few years for most hedge funds in which several high profile firms have closed, several high-profile traders have branched out on their own, including the former chief investment officer at Perry Capital, David Russekoff.

The bank has more branches in and around New York than in other areas like Florida that are more commonly hit by hurricanes. And, with the city's subways damaged, getting employees around will be tough, said Emmett Vollenweider, a native of Louisiana who worked through the damage left by Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Irene, among others. The bank prepared for the storm days ago by restocking 3,200 automated teller machines in the region with currency. If there are large power outages, cash is king, Vollenweider said. While some of the 1,050 Chase branches in the area were open over the weekend, all were closed on Tuesday after super-storm Sandy slammed the region with hurricane-force winds on Monday, bringing flooding that crippled New York's subway system and closed financial markets for two days. Chase's initial goal is to reopen 100 or so branches that the bank previously identified as hub locations that can be reached by the greatest numbers of customers, even if not as conveniently as before the storm.

Trump jumped at the chance, claiming in a tweet that he had worked hard with Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford Jr. to keep the plant in Kentucky, even though Ford had never considered moving the whole factory south of the border.  In letting Trump claim a victory, Ford made what appeared to be a calculated, public appeal to the next president in an attempt to soothe concerns about outsourcing jobs and to gain some leverage with the new administration as the automaker pushes for favorable policy changes in Congress.  Ford is not going to make a decision on a purely political basis, said Kristin Dziczek, director of industry, labor and economics at the Center for Automotive Research in Michigan.    They are going to make a decision that makes business sense, economic sense and if it happens to align with political goals, that's great, she said. The No. 2 automaker in the United States is not the only company in Trump's crosshairs working out how to deal with the new political reality in Washington. Apple Inc (AAPL.O), criticized by Trump for not building products in the United States, is studying the possibility of moving iPhone production to the United States, Japanese news service Nikkei reported on Thursday. Apple did not reply to a request for comment on Friday. Jobs = Votes Trump campaigned heavily on bringing jobs to the United States and attacking companies such as Ford that plan to take some production overseas, a message that resonated in the economically ravaged center of the country.  Ford gave Trump plenty of ammunition, confirming in September that all of its remaining small-car production in the United States, at its facility in Wayne, Michigan, would go to lower-cost Mexico by 2019.  Executive Chairman of Ford Motor Co., Bill Ford Jr. addresses the public outside the Historic Ford Estate - Fairlane, once the home of his great-grandparents Henry and Clara Ford, during a celebration in honor of what would have been the 150th birthday of Henry Ford, founder of the Ford Motor Company, in Dearborn, Michigan July 27, 2013.Rebecca CookFord Chief Executive Mark Fields said no plants would be closed as a result, and no U.S. jobs would be lost as capacity at the Wayne plant would be taken up by two new models.   The Mexico plans remain in place, despite the fact that Trump vowed on the campaign trail to stop Ford opening a new plant in that country and promised to slap 35 percent tariffs on any Ford vehicles made there.  Ford went further this month, announcing on Election Day a new $195 million investment in India to add 3,000 jobs over the next five years in a technology and business center in Chennai. Ford said this week it would import its Ford EcoSport built in India to the United States. Trump has not made any public comment on that plan. Both Claim Victory Slideshow (2 Images)On Thursday, Ford said it had been reviewing where to build the Lincoln MKC, just one vehicle built at the Louisville assembly plant, but had decided to keep it in Kentucky.  As such, nothing changed, but letting Trump announce the decision gave him the opportunity to claim he saved U.S. jobs and cast Ford as a patriotic manufacturer. Both sides will claim a certain level of victory because nobody wants a significant negative impact on the industry, said Dave Cole, chairman emeritus of the Center for Automotive Research. It was unclear how many, if any, jobs were actually saved by the decision. Ford decided last year to move MKC production by 2019, on the assumption that production of the Ford Escape, a similar vehicle made in the same plant, would grow. But recently Escape demand has slumped, which may have prompted Ford to reconsider. According to Cole, Ford's olive branch to Trump was a clear indication that it needs help from the next administration as it faces a host of issues from fuel economy standards and the rise of autonomous vehicles to trade and currency. Cole said Trump, who boasts about his dealmaking skills, may choose to focus on bargaining with companies he has targeted - even if only for small concessions - rather than pursue more punitive measures such as tariffs, which would take time to implement and potentially damage the economy. Ford nodded to those wider issues in a statement on Friday, saying it was encouraged that Trump's economic policies will help improve U.S. competitiveness.  Ford, like other global U.S. corporations, agrees with key aspects of Trump's economic plans. It has called for U.S. tax reform and raised concerns about the costs of federal regulations. Ford also shares Trump's concerns about currency manipulation. Editing by Bill Rigby"
"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-corruption-prosecutor-exclusiv-idUSKBN16M2M9","Exclusive: Brazil prosecutor sees 350 new graft probes after Odebrecht testimony","","March 15, 2017 /  5:28 PM / 4 months ago","","CURITIBA, Brazil (Reuters) - A top Brazilian prosecutor said more than 350 new investigations will spring from a trove of testimony by executives of construction firm Odebrecht, revealing how corruption cut across the political spectrum from the smallest cities to the highest levels of government.  Carlos Lima, the dean of a team of prosecutors in southern Brazil that is driving the three-year old Car Wash investigation, said the Odebrecht statements expanded the probe far beyond expectations and would ensnare top congressmen, senior members of the executive branch and other powerful figures.  On Tuesday, Brazil's Prosecutor General Rodrigo Janot asked the Supreme Court to open 83 new investigations into politicians based on the still-sealed testimony. He also requested another 211 potential cases be sent to lower courts.   Between the cases that will go to the Supreme Court and those that will land here with us in Curitiba, there will be upward of 350 new investigations that will begin, Lima told Reuters Tuesday in his office in the southern city of Curitiba. The revelations could topple President Michel Temer's government, experts say, or derail the prospect of economic reforms that has lifted Brazilian financial markets and made its currency amongst the best performing in the world last year.  Odebrecht is one of several large construction firms that for years paid billions of dollars in bribes to Brazilian politicians and executives at state-controlled businesses, primarily oil company Petrobras. The 'Car Wash' investigation started three years ago with a probe into a money launderer whose testimony revealed the vast scheme that has now enveloped top political and business leaders. Since signing the world's largest leniency deal with Brazilian, U.S. and Swiss prosecutors late last year, Odebrecht has become the target of probes by several Latin American nations, where it admitted to paying bribes to win contracts.  Lima said the new investigations would bring in several other nations that are not yet investigating Odebrecht, without providing details. Lima said the Odebrecht testimony would shock even graft-weary Brazilians. It would show how corruption was endemic at all levels of government, from municipal to federal, as construction firms shelled out billions in bribes in exchange for lucrative government contracts, he said.  There will be no doubt left about the immense extent of corruption in the Brazilian political system, from top to bottom. It is going to be on view for the entire world to see, Lima said.  Car Wash by itself will not change a thing, but it will reveal the extent of corruption. What has to change is our democracy itself, he said. The Brazilian population has to decide now if it wants to continue to be cheated.  Brazilian federal prosecutor Carlos Fernando dos Santos Lima smiles during an interview with Reuters in Curitiba, Brazil, March 14, 2017. Picture taken March 14, 2017.Rodolfo BuhrerBrasilia on Edge Brazil's political class is agonizing about the over 950 depositions given by 77 Odebrecht executives, expected to be made public soon.  Janot has asked the Supreme Court for permission to investigate congressmen and ministers; the release of their names is imminent. Janot already obtained permission to investigate 54 politicians in 2015. It is not clear if some of those names will feature on the new list. Congressmen have been working for months to undermine the Car Wash investigation, Lima said, trying to pass amnesty measures during the dead of night. So far those efforts have borne no fruit and Lima believes the moment has passed.  Slideshow (2 Images)Once it is known who is not involved, the mood of those not under investigation will be more positive, and I believe they will see that it's useless to try to pass amnesties or other measures to allow those who are corrupt to escape justice, he said.  He would not comment on whether he thinks the Odebrecht revelations would result in the fall of Temer, who took over as president last year following the impeachment of Dilma Rousseff.  Temer served as vice president to Rousseff but helped to lead the maneuverings that ended in her ouster. Sergio Praça, a political scientist at the Getulio Vargas Foundation, a leading Brazilian University, said Temer's government is on the brink.  Temer has repeatedly said he is a caretaker president until the 2018 elections and that his main goal is to pass economic reforms to pull Brazil's economy from its worst recession on record.  Temer has pushed through austerity measures and is likely to get changes to the bloated pension system passed, Praça said. But once the Odebrecht testimony really hits, even if Temer's government survives, which it very well may not, it will have absolutely no political force, he said.   There will be total paralysis. No more reforms will pass because this government is going to implode. Nothing will get done until a new president is elected. Reporting by Brad Brooks; Editing by Nick Zieminski and Daniel Flynn"

"https://www.reuters.com/article/boe-banks-regulator-idUSL5N0R526320140905","Britain eases rules for foreign bank branches","","September 5, 2014 /  11:56 AM / in 3 years","","LONDON, Sept 5 (Reuters) - Foreign banks can operate as branches in Britain but only if they hold minimal deposits and meet other safeguards under new Bank of England (BoE) rules partly aimed at making it easier for Chinese wholesale banks to set up shop in London. The new rules mark a formal change of tack by Britain whose regulators since the 2007-09 financial crisis have put pressure on all types of foreign bank branches to become subsidiaries that are more accountable to local supervisors. Branches, unlike subsidiaries, do not have the cost of maintaining their own buffer of capital and liquidity, instead relying on the parent's resources. The BoE's supervisory arm, the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), said in a statement on Friday that deposit-taking foreign banks that want to remain a branch must have less than 100 million pounds ($163 million) in account balances and fewer than 5,000 customers. The new rules mean it will be easier for wholesale foreign banks from China and elsewhere, which cater to other financial institutions and large corporations rather than retail customers, to open non-deposit taking branches which would not face size limits. Britain wants to encourage greater use of London as a hub for Chinese currency dealing, with the China Construction Bank selected in June to become the first clearing service for renminbi trading in the UK capital. The bulk of foreign, deposit-taking branches in Britain had 10 to 99 million pounds in their accounts at the end of 2012, according to BoE figures. There were only a handful of branches with more than 100 million pounds or more in deposits who may now have to convert into subsidiaries or withdraw from the market. Under the new rules, all branches must also have an equally strict supervisor in their home country, insure any deposits with a UK scheme, and prove they can be wound up quickly in a crisis while maintaining access to any deposits. Where the PRA is satisfied of these factors, it will also need to have a clear and agreed split of prudential supervisory responsibilities with the home state supervisor, the PRA said. Where the PRA is not content, it will consider the most appropriate course of action, which could include refusing authorisation of a new branch or cancelling an authorisation of an existing branch. Britain also wants to avoid having to compensate savers with deposits at a failing foreign bank as it had to with Icesave accounts run by a branch of Icelandic bank Landsbanki, which collapsed in 2008 during the global financial crisis. Britain and the Netherlands, which found itself in the same situation in 2008, compensated thousands of Icesave customers and earlier this year filed a claim for $4.8 billion against Iceland to recover the money. 1 US dollar = 0.6130 British pound

In March, Kuwait said it would allow foreign banks to open multiple branches to spur growth. Analysts said it was unlikely that many banks would take advantage of the offer unless the government accelerated long-postponed infrastructure projects. Allowing foreign banks to expand in Kuwait will encourage competition and the development of banking products and services, governor Mohammad al-Hashel said in a statement on the central bank website (www.cbk.gov.kw). He said the central bank had put ICBC in the official register of foreign banks after it got approval from the Finance Ministry to open a branch. ICBC got approvals last year from Kuwait's central bank and cabinet. It will be the bank's fourth branch in the Gulf Arab region after Doha, Abu Dhabi and Dubai. ICBC's chairman said earlier this year his bank could be a liaison between Chinese companies and Kuwait, according to a report on Kuwait's state news agency KUNA. Jiang Jianqing said he welcomed opportunities for investment in Kuwait's development plan, KUNA said. The development plan, first announced in 2010, seeks to spend billions of dollars on major infrastructure projects such as roads, a new airport and refinery. Foreign banks in Kuwait, a major oil exporter, include regional lenders such as National Bank of Abu Dhabi  and Qatar National Bank, as well as international heavyweights BNP Paribas, Citigroup and HSBC . International names have been able to operate in the country since 2004 but, until this year, had only been able to open one branch. This is ICBC's first branch. Other restrictions on foreign banks in Kuwait have limited them to offering investment banking services and banned them from competing in the retail sector. It is not immediately clear when these restrictions might be eased.   (Reporting by Sylvia Westall; Editing by Alison Williams)"

Officials from Richard Stockton College in nearby Galloway Township, said in a statement they plan to convert some of the 1.4 million square foot building into dormitory space.  The Showboat has 1,329 hotel rooms and sits on 28 beachfront acres. Four Atlantic City casinos have closed this year, and city officials have struggled find uses for the shuttered buildings.  The former casino floor would be converted to administrative offices. Theaters at the building would, under the college's plans, house facilities for dance, music and drama programs, the school said. One of the three towers will remain a hotel holding some 479 rooms opening sometime in the spring of 2015. The college said dorm rooms could be used as hotel rooms during summer months, when demand is high and most students are away from campus.  The college said the purchase price is far less expensive than new construction. The purchase was announced in November. Gaming companies, fearing new competition, have typically inserted deed restrictions prohibiting new owners from re-opening the properties as casinos. The diversification of activities available in AC stands to benefit all of the city's stakeholders, said Caesars Entertainment CEO Gary Loveman in a statement.

Tetsuya Kubo, who became president of the brokerage arm of banking group Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc (SMFG) (8316.T) this month, said he wanted to open 25 new branches as part of an effort to increase retail client assets by one-third, to 30 trillion yen ($302 billion), by 2016. The aggressive shift in strategy for SMBC Nikko, which has 109 branches and has not opened a new one in five years, could also mean tougher competition for Nomura Holdings Inc (8604.T) and Daiwa Securities Group Inc (8601.T), Japan's two largest securities firms which have about 180 and 120 branches, respectively. Kubo, 59, said there was a need to invest in the brokerage's retail network after years of tight cost controls under the previous owner Citigroup Inc (C.N), which sold the franchise, known as Nikko Cordial, to SMFG in 2009. Nikko is strong in retail but for the past several years we didn't really put resources into branches and staff, Kubo, previously chief financial officer of SMFG, told Reuters in an interview last week. His comments were embargoed for release on Monday. To be a winner over the long term there is a need to increase staff, Kubo said. Earlier this month, the company announced it would boost overall staffing by 600, to 8,600, under a three-year business plan. A Different Look Kubo said he was confident that bold fiscal and monetary steps under Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, aimed at pulling the economy out of deflation, would continue to push stock prices higher. He would not be surprised, he said, if the Nikkei stock average .N225 reached 16,000 by the end of 2013. That would be a gain of another 20 percent for the benchmark from its close on Friday at 13,316.48, after already rallying some 50 percent since Abe was tipped as a candidate for premier in mid-November. Kubo also noted a marked increase in interest from foreign investors during the final months of his tenure as the banking group's CFO, when the aggressive economic stimulus espoused under Abenomics set stocks rising and the yen tumbling. While it was normal to be called on by asset managers in charge of Japan, he also started to get requests for meetings from global managers of equity funds. There was a different look in their eyes. They wanted to know what was happening in Japan, what had changed, he said. Japanese individuals, which park the bulk of their $15 trillion worth of savings in bank deposits and other low-yielding instruments, have been a particularly hard sell for Japanese stock brokers and asset managers. Memories still linger of the collapse of Japan's asset bubble two decades ago, which hit retail investors hard. Kubo sees SMBC Nikko's ties to its parent bank, which owns 100 percent of the broker, as a key advantage over independent securities firms such as Nomura and Daiwa in tapping the renewed retail investor interest in stocks. The brokerage has attracted 1 trillion yen in assets through referrals from SMFG bank clients since becoming part of Japan's third-largest banking group, Kubo said. Of the 7 trillion yen increase in retail assets the brokerage is targeting over the next three years, it hopes to capture another 1 trillion yen through such referrals from SMFG, which has 10 times the number of accounts as SMBC Nikko, he said.

Some 70 percent of 1,500 automated teller machines in the area were working. Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) said that nearly 90 percent of its nearly 1,200 branches in Maryland, Virginia, Washington, D.C., Delaware, Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey and Connecticut had re-opened. Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) said about 75 percent of its 1,700 banking centers in the Northeast were functioning again. It had 13 branches open in Manhattan and planned to have several more open on Thursday. It was also deploying mobile ATMs in the area. At least 134 of the 183 Morgan Stanley (MS.N) brokerage offices that were closed had reopened by mid-morning, the company said. The offices that remained closed either lacked electricity or were inaccessible due to flooding or other damage. Most of the closed offices were in New Jersey and New York, with some in Connecticut. Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) opened both its headquarters in lower Manhattan and its office across the river at 30 Hudson Street in Jersey City, New Jersey, on Wednesday. Goldman offices in Princeton, New Jersey, and Greenwich, Connecticut, were open for some employees, while others worked remotely. Staff in the securities division - especially those who live in Manhattan - generally came into the office, though the lack of public transportation and traffic made commutes longer than usual. Goldman's two main buildings in the New York area, on opposite sides of the Hudson River, sustained some flooding but no serious damage from the hurricane, a representative said. Citigroup's lower Manhattan buildings used for trading and investment banking remain closed. The company said on Tuesday night that it would update information on access to those Greenwich Street buildings later this week. A Citigroup spokeswoman said the company is using back-up offices to continue to do business. Bank of America's 2 and 4 World Financial Center offices in lower Manhattan were closed, but it's One Bryant Park location in Midtown was open.

Currently, more than 40 percent of the 1.2 billion population is not covered by the banking system. Creating more branches would allow Indians, particularly those in rural areas, to get credit at a cheaper rate. Many now have to rely on money-lenders who charge up to 30 percent interest rates.

The cabinet approved the licence...to open a branch in the kingdom and authorised the finance minister to decide on any subsequent request to open other branches of the bank, the Saudi Press Agency quoted Information Minister Abdulaziz al-Khoja as saying on Tuesday. The report only gave a version of the bank's name in Arabic but it was identified as ICBC by local media on Wednesday. A public relations company representing the bank in the Gulf said it would be unable to confirm the report until ICBC had been officially contacted by the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority (SAMA), the central bank. SAMA lists only 11 foreign banks on its website that are already licenced to operate in the kingdom. State-owned ICBC is the world's largest bank by stock market capitalisation. It has branches in Abu Dhabi and Qatar, as well as a subsidiary in Dubai. It has also been seeking a licence to operate in Kuwait; the country's state news agency KUNA reported earlier this year that its central bank had given initial approval for ICBC to set up a branch there. ICBC's Middle East operations made a 2011 pre-tax profit of $32 million, more than double the $15 million it recorded in the previous year, the bank said in March. Total assets jumped 146 percent to $3.06 billion. The bank has moved to benefit from China's increased trade with Middle East countries and a growing appetite for renminbi-denominated business. In addition to Chinese imports of Saudi oil, the countries have set up a string of joint ventures in refining and petrochemicals. Saudi Arabian Oil Co (Saudi Aramco) and China Petrochemical Corp (Sinopec) have a refining joint venture in the Chinese province of Fujian and plans for another in western Saudi Arabia. Saudi Basic Industries Corp  has a world-scale ethylene plant with Sinopec in China's Tianjin, which the companies this year agreed to expand to produce polycarbonates. Chinese building firms have meanwhile made headway in winning large engineering, procurement and construction contracts from Saudi Arabia in a market once dominated by Western, Japanese and South Korean companies. China's Sepco III Electric Power Construction Corp was awarded multi-billion dollar contracts to build two power plants in 2009 and 2010. In January, Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao visited Riyadh for talks with King Abdullah and the late Crown Prince Nayef, with trade high on the agenda."

Crippled by mismanagement during 49 years of military regimes and cut off from much of the world due to Western sanctions, the domestic banking sector is ill-equipped to provide services to local citizens, let alone global companies. A semi-civilian government took power in 2011 and has initiated sweeping economic reforms. In October, it granted nine foreign banks licences to operate on a limited basis, its biggest move to date to bring in much-needed foreign capital to a fast-growing economy. The banks were required to put up minimum paid-in capital of $75 million, but BTMU - a subsidiary of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc - put in $100 million, Watanabe said. We decided that we would show a strong commitment to this country, he told reporters at the branch in Yangon, Myanmar's commercial capital. He said BTMU will aim to gain 150 accounts from foreign companies with deposits of $100 million within its first year of operating in the country. Japan's Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp - a subsidiary of Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc - and Singapore's Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp Ltd said they plan to open branches on Thursday. Licences are limited to one branch that can provide loans to foreign companies and only in foreign currency. Licencees are also expected to lend to domestic banks. Myanmar's Central Bank said on April 2 that it expected six more foreign banks to submit applications for their final licences in the coming months. The six are Japan's Mizuho Bank Ltd - a subsidiary of Mizuho Financial Group Inc - and Singapore's United Overseas Bank Ltd, as well as Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd, Bangkok Bank PCL, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd  and Malayan Banking Bhd.

RBS was ordered to sell the UK branches as a condition of its 2008 taxpayer bailout, which left the bank 81 percent state-owned. A 1.65-billion-pound ($2.59 billion) sale of the branches to Spain's Santander (SAN.MC) collapsed in October 2012, triggering a fresh sale process that has been plagued by delays. In separate interviews with Reuters, senior figures from short-listed bidders W&G; Investments and Corsair said a deal needed to be agreed quickly so that the branch business, which has assets of about 20.5 billion pounds, can begin operating as a separate entity ahead of its change in ownership. Both laid out plans to expand the business by focusing on small business lending and said they were committed long-term investors who wanted to create a challenger bank in the UK. Headed by former Tesco Finance chief Andy Higginson, W&G; Investments is a UK-based group of institutional investors which will list on London's Alternative Investment Market (AIM) on Tuesday. It wants to pay between 1.1 and 1.5 billion pounds for the branches. U.S.-based private equity firm Corsair is bidding along with fellow private equity house Centerbridge, and other investors including the Church of England's investment fund and Standard Life Investments. It wants to install former Lloyds Banking Group (LLOY.L) executive John Maltby as chief executive and pay between 600 million and 800 million pounds to become a cornerstone investor ahead of a stock market flotation that would value the new bank at more than 1.5 billion pounds. The third bid is headed by British private equity house AnaCap, with U.S. investor Blackstone. In a statement, they said they would work with RBS to achieve a premium valuation for the business through a stock market offering, but would give no detail on the value of their proposed deal. RBS declined to comment on the process. 'Slightly Neglected' Asked about the biggest challenge to their bid, W&G;'s Higginson said the most important thing was for the branches to get separate management as soon as possible so that value is preserved. Having been a division within RBS with a for-sale sign above it for five years, inevitably it's been slightly neglected, said Higginson. The staff have done a fantastic job in holding the customers, but you know this business needs separate focus, the management vigor that a for-sale sign doesn't allow you to have. Under the W&G; plan, RBS would ready the business for sale over about two years by giving it more autonomy, getting a banking license and making other necessary changes, before passing it over to the investors. Corsair would install Maltby as chief executive as soon as a deal was done, and he and RBS would work together to prepare the business for independence, a similar model to the one proposed by AnaCap/Blackstone. Maltby said both staff and customers had been living through a period of uncertainty. The quicker the process can come to a successful conclusion and we can get on and build this new bank the better it is for all parties, he said. Under the terms of its bailout, RBS must sell the branches by the end of 2013. Chief Financial Officer Bruce Van Saun said in February the bank had already told the European Commission it was likely to need an extension but would not apply formally until a preferred bidder was picked. In It for the Long Haul Higginson said his grouping had a very big group of powerful institutional investors that would create a business that would still be around in twenty years' time. The investors would be legally allowed to sell their equity once W&G;'s AIM trading goes 'live', he said, but stressed that they were long-term holders by nature. W&G;'s stock market listing begins on Tuesday based on the 15 million pounds that was raised to fund the bid's costs, but the shares are suspended until the bid is accepted and 1.1 billion pounds is raised from investors. Corsair and its fellow investors do not currently have any obligation to stay on after a flotation. The IPO (stock market sale) is the beginning of the process, not the end, said Maltby. Each of the investors is very long term and expect to continue to be investors long after the IPO. Both bidders see room for significant growth in the small business market, where the branches have a 5 percent market share, but neither would give details of their target market share. AnaCap/Blackstone said it has experience in SME lending through AnaCap's investment in UK SME lender Aldermore. The grouping's proposed management team, former Lloyds executive Mike Fairey and former First Direct boss Alan Hughes, have track records running major UK retail and SME banks, the statement added. Both Higginson and Maltby said jobs would increase under their plans and that they had no plan to follow a Europe-wide branch cutting trend that saw 5,500 outlets eliminated last year. We have no plans to slash the branch network, said Higginson, adding that they would institute longer, Tesco-style opening hours if that's what customers want.

Switzerland is keen to attract a Chinese bank to help strengthen its case to be a major trading hub in China's renminbi currency. The aim is that the China Construction Bank has a hub in Switzerland by the end of this year, Swiss newswire SDA quoted Finance Minister Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf as saying on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos. Widmer-Schlumpf said the bank had shown a clear desire to set up a branch in Switzerland, either in Geneva or Zurich, but that it had not yet filed an application and that a few regulatory questions needed to be answered first. A spokesman for the Swiss finance department confirmed Widmer-Schlumpf's comments. A spokesman for CCB declined to comment. The news came after an agreement this week between the Swiss National Bank and the People's Bank of China to establish clearing arrangements in Switzerland for trading of the renminbi and to extend a pilot scheme for clients of Swiss banks. Transactions in China's currency have been impractical until recently for all but very large European companies that are able to involve China's central bank in a deal because the renminbi is not freely convertible. In the past five years, China has promoted use of the yuan  for trade and investment, and also as a reserve currency to help lower currency risks for Chinese companies and challenge the dollar's global dominance over the long term. China's central bank has already chosen Sydney, Seoul, Paris, Luxembourg, London, Frankfurt, Singapore and Hong Kong as global centres for renminbi trading.

At a meeting called the Economic Peace Conference, Maduro said businesses will be able to seek loans from the behemoth state-run fund Fonden, a joint Chinese-Venezuela fund, and a fund linked to trade bloc Mercosur. I announce I will put (the funds) at the service of this economic forum ... to spur a new strategy of investment, Maduro said in televised comments. I call on you to join this battle for productivity, growth, fair prices and economic development. He did not describe how much would be available to lend through the funds, which have been heavily criticized by opposition leaders for lack of transparency and limited congressional oversight. Fonden has received more than $100 billion since its 2005 creation but publishes few detailed accounts of the projects it finances. Maduro said his government would also seek to speed up disbursement of hard currency to companies that have pending requests for dollars to import goods, an issue that has been a chronic complaint of business groups. Government officials on Wednesday were slated to hold talks with industry leaders to seek ways to boost productivity. Maduro has faced nearly three months of violent opposition protests demanding he resign over soaring prices, product shortages and violent crime. Wednesday's measures appeared to be an olive branch to businesses that Maduro has accused of leading an economic war against him by hoarding goods and artificially accelerating inflation that is among the world's highest at 57 percent. Relations with business have been tense since Pedro Carmona, the head of the largest business organization, Fedecamaras, became de facto president in 2002 coup that briefly ousted late socialist leader Hugo Chavez. The government in March opened a new currency exchange platform meant to ease shortages of dollars that have limited imports and left shoppers scrambling to buy imported goods ranging from toilet paper to wheat flour. But critics insist that resuming economic growth will require rolling back Chavez's economic policies including price and currency controls and a wave of nationalizations that put hundreds of businesses under state control.

The 500, Run on the Memorial Day holiday weekend in the U.S. heartland, is a uniquely American event unapologetically billed as The Greatest Spectacle in Racing and this year the famed Brickyard is poised to deliver on the high-octane hype. While the Monaco Grand Prix may be the most glamorous race, the Indy is the most heart-stopping with 33 cars cheered on by nearly 300,000 spectators and charging at hair-raising speeds around an oval that could hold Churchill Downs, Yankee Stadium, the Rose Bowl, the Roman Colosseum and still have room to spare. On Sunday, the Brickyard will serve as the first leg in a dizzying motor-racing doubleheader that will see Busch take on two of the most treacherous circuits in the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and Charlotte Motor Speedway. The 2004 NASCAR Cup champion's day will begin with a 500-mile dash at the Indy followed by a flight to Charlotte for a 600-mile stint behind the wheel in NASCAR's Coca-Cola 600. Only four drivers have attempted the treacherous high-speed endurance test and Tony Stewart is the only one to complete the 1,100-mile Memorial Day double having finished sixth at the Indy and third in Charlotte in 2001. Related CoverageFactbox: 2014 Indianapolis 500It's not like I'm putting my career or my credentials on the line to prove anything, said Busch, who qualified a respectable 12th on the grid and is the first driver to attempt the double since Robby Gordon in 2004. This is a moment to moment to check off something on my bucket list but also challenge myself to see where I can end up in this open wheel rank at one of the most difficult races in the world. Jacques Villeneuve has won just about everything there is to win in an open-wheel race car, including the 1997 Formula One drivers crown and the 1995 Indy 500, but it has been nearly two decades since the Canadian blitzed his way onto Victory Lane and he returns to the Brickyard searching for a bit of Indy magic. Villeneuve will be joined on the starting grid by Colombian F1 alumni and 2000 Indy 500 winner Juan Pablo Montoya, defending champion Tony Kanaan and three-time winner Helio Castroneves, the latter who is bidding to become part of the Brickyard's most exclusive club - four-time winners of the Indianapolis 500. Membership is made up of the three giants of American motor sport - A.J. Foyt, Al Unser and Rick Mears - and would welcome its first new member since 1991 if Castroneves can find his way to Victory Lane on Sunday and chug on the traditional of quart of cold milk that goes to the winner. Just thinking about it, joining the club only three guys, it's a dream, said Castroneves. Last year four women featured on the 500 starting grid but there will be a noticeable lack of girl power on Sunday when the green flag drops. Danica Patrick, the only woman to win an IndyCar race and lead a lap at the 500, has long departed for NASCAR while Switzerland's Simona de Silvestro is testing with Sauber and poised to make the jump to Formula One. Others like Brazil's Ana Beatriz, Britain's Katherine Legge and Venezuelan Milka Dunno have simply fallen by the wayside leaving Pippa Mann to carry the woman's standard. It's actually a little strange, I'm use to seeing a few other women out here, said Mann, who will be participating in here third Indy 500. From that respect it's a little odd, a little strange but once we put the helmet on we're just another driver out there. Local boy Ed Carpenter will start from the pole for the second consecutive year driving a car sponsored by another Indianapolis sporting great in former Masters and U.S. Open champion Fuzzy Zoeller and his company Fuzzy Vodka. Starting alongside Carpenter on the front row will be Canadian James Hinchcliffe and Australian Will Power.

Obama chose his words with excruciating care in reaching out to Iran publicly and privately, including through secret letters to Iran's Supreme Leader. The new president emphasized he wanted a new beginning with a country that called the United States the Great Satan and was branded by his predecessor as part of an axis of evil. Obama intended to go the extra mile on engagement, his aides said, so if the gambit failed, allies and adversaries alike could not point the finger at the United States as the bad guy. Instead, they would rally behind the effort to pressure Iran. Three years later, tensions over Iran's nuclear program have escalated to their highest level in years. Tehran is threatening to block the Strait of Hormuz and the chances of a miscalculation that could lead to a military clash - and a global oil crisis - appear to be rising. Diplomacy has given way to harsher tactics, with Obama and his European allies trying to isolate the Islamic republic with the toughest sanctions ever. Interviews with U.S. officials reveal a strategy of watching and waiting and a belief that the West's leverage over Iran may grow as Tehran feels the heat from the sanctions and popular upheaval in the Middle East. One official also predicted that the neighboring government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, a key Iranian ally, would ultimately collapse, adding to the worries of Iran's leaders. It's our assessment that the Assad regime is not going to survive, White House deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes told Reuters. The fall of the Assad regime would substantially impact Iran's strategic position in the world and the region. The combination of those sanctions and the demise of the Assad regime is a level of pressure that the Iranian government has never been under before, he said. The White House insists that the United States is not pursuing a strategy of seeking regime change. We are absolutely not, Rhodes said. It's very much the policy of the United States to change Iran's behavior through our sanctions and through isolation, not to change the Iranian regime. Obama remains open to talks with Iran, aides say. But after years of disappointment, with a U.S. election looming, and with Congress and allies like Israel lobbying him to stand tough, Washington sees the next move as Tehran's, officials and European diplomats say. How Obama arrived at this point is a story of peace offers made and rebuffed, a crushed revolution on Tehran's streets, and dashed hopes for a civilian nuclear deal. At the start of the 2012 U.S. election year, Iran and its suspected quest for a nuclear bomb is firmly at the top of Obama's foreign policy priorities. Reaching Out Obama began with outreach - some of it unusually direct. Early in his term, the president sent a personal letter to Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khameini, who holds ultimate power, to show the seriousness of the outstretched hand. A letter from the president was the clearest signal of our intentions that we could possibly make, a U.S. official said. The United States and Iran do not have formal diplomatic ties. Obama was closely involved in writing the letter that took account of their differences on nuclear and other issues, made clear there were two paths, and expressed a desire for a different kind of relationship, officials said. It was also a test to see if a serious dialogue could begin. Related CoverageFactbox: What next for Congress on Iran sanctions?And in an unprecedented March 2009 Persian New Year message to the people and leaders of Iran, Obama repeatedly referred to the Islamic Republic of Iran. It was a recognition of the formal name of the government and a signal that regime change was not the U.S. policy. The intention was to show a U.S. president who is not playing the villain in Iranian politics, Rhodes said. When you have a U.S. president who is not playing that role and saying look we've had a difficult history, let's look forward, the regime loses one of its most powerful propaganda tools, he said. But Khamanei's response to Obama's 2009 letter contained nothing encouraging that the administration could act on. A second letter was sent to Khameini tied to that response. Turning Away Late in 2009, Obama's policy began to shift. In September, he took to the world stage at a Group of 20 summit in Pittsburgh, flanked by the leaders of Britain and France, and revealed that Iran was building a secret nuclear fuel plant underground near the holy city of Qom. The previous evening, Obama made sure his aides had briefed Russian and Chinese officials, who had not known about the facility. In October, in direct talks in Geneva, the United States and its allies offered nuclear fuel for a civilian nuclear reactor in Tehran. In exchange, Iran would ship its enriched uranium outside the country, where it would be rendered unusable for a potential nuclear weapon. Iran never picked up on the offer. The final straw when Iran declared in February 2010 that it would begin enriching uranium up to 20 percent. By the end of 2009, we were fully shifted to the notion of pursuing a U.N. Security Council resolution with more sanctions, one official said. Obama's critics and political opponents assert that his initial outreach was dangerous and displayed a lack of judgment. Leading Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney in November accused Obama of naïveté in his efforts to engage Tehran. Obama's approach to dealing with Iran's nuclear ambitions was a case study in botched diplomacy, he said in an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal. Current and former Obama aides disagree sharply. There was never any illusion or naïveté about who the regime was. There was never any assumption that we would pursue this regardless of their behavior, said Dennis Ross, a top White House adviser on Middle East policy until last month. If they weren't prepared to be responsive, then the assumption always was this will make it easier for us to mobilize real pressure against them, he said. Obama was also criticized as missing a golden opportunity when the largest street protests in the Islamic republic's history broke out after Iran's disputed June 2009 election. The protests, ultimately quashed with violence, did appear to catch the White House by surprise. But aides defended the muted U.S. response. We knew that too overt an embrace in some ways could hurt the Iranian opposition, said Jim Steinberg, former deputy secretary of state. Especially when it looked like they had a chance of prevailing, we didn't want to undercut them and strengthen the hand of the hardliners. A Soft War? U.S.-Iran tensions continued to ratchet up, and a string of events made it look to the outside world like an undeclared soft war was under way. The United States accused Iran's shadowy Quds Force in a plot to assassinate the Saudi ambassador to Washington. The Stuxnet computer virus attacked centrifuges at Iran's Natanz enrichment facility. Iran accused Israel and the United States. Late last year, the United States lost a spy drone in Iran, unmasking an aggressive surveillance program. There have been unexplained explosions at an Iranian missile depot and four nuclear scientists have been killed in Iran - the latest on Wednesday. We had absolutely nothing to do with the deaths of any of these scientists or the missile depot. Things exploding in Iran do not have anything to do with the United States, a U.S. official said. Iran reacted to those events and the stepped-up economic sanctions as if under siege. It threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz, a major oil shipping lane. They feel themselves under threat internally. They talk about the soft overthrow and the covert war that is being waged, said John Limbert, a professor of Middle East studies at the U.S. Naval Academy. U.S. officials downplayed the possibility that Iran would follow through on its threats. Iran has threatened to close the Strait before, usually when its leaders feel international pressure, another U.S. official said on condition of anonymity. It's doubtful Iranian leaders want an all-out war, but they'll continue to agitate and push the envelope in ways they believe advance their national interests, the official added. Waiting for Iran Obama is still open to an Iranian overture for serious negotiations on its nuclear program, officials say. Indeed, that is the ultimate goal of the pressure strategy, they say. We have a number of ways to communicate our views to the Iranian government, and we have used those mechanisms regularly on a range of issues over the years, White House National Security Council spokesman Tommy Vietor said. But any message that we have delivered to the Iranian government would be the same as what we've said publicly, Vietor said. For now, Obama is focused on new sanctions that target Iran's central bank and oil sales. We are already seeing ... a really substantial impact on the Iranian economy, the Iranian currency, Rhodes said. The next step for us is making sure that as we do that there is continued space for the Iranian government to take a different path, rather than simply seeing our pressure as an end of itself. But with Iran announcing it has begun enrichment at the protected underground site near Qom, and Israel not ruling out a unilateral strike on Iran's nuclear sites, time may be short. U.S. intelligence agencies say there is no evidence that Iran has decided to move forward with building a nuclear weapon. But experts point out it is taking steps to lay the groundwork so it can move quickly if that decision is made. If Iran decided to move forward, it would be about a year away from having a crude nuclear explosive device, David Albright, president of the Institute for Science and International Security, said. They still don't know quite how to move forward without getting caught, he said. Additional reporting by Arshad Mohammed and Warren Strobel; Editing by Doina Chiacu"

The controversial world number 29 was booted off the team before the quarter-final win over Kazakhstan on Sunday for publicly criticizing Tennis Australia (TA) officials in an extraordinary tirade at Wimbledon. Tomic was arrested in Miami last week after holding a noisy party at a penthouse suite in his hotel and the 22-year-old later said he was still in a fight with TA and had no intention of making peace. However, TA president Steve Healy said the governing body hoped to contact him soon to hammer out their issues. We want to offer Bernard the opportunity to raise the issues he has raised, so we can address those with him, Healy told local media in Canberra on Tuesday. We think (Tomic's) criticisms are unjustified -- he needs to hear that. He needs to get some detail, and we want to bring him back into the fold. I think the important thing to understand is he's had fantastic support from Tennis Australia and we want him to understand and appreciate that and then welcome him back into Davis Cup. Australia rallied to win their quarter-final 3-2 on Sunday, setting up a last four encounter away to Britain at a yet-to-be confirmed venue on Sept. 18-20 as the 28-time winners seek to lift the trophy for the first time since 2003. TA's high performance chief Pat Rafter announced last month that funding would be cut to Tomic and his sister Sara, who plays mostly second-tier events on the ITF circuit, in part because of their father John Tomic's uncooperative attitude. Bernard Tomic responded by accusing TA of neglecting he and his sister's development during his Wimbledon rant. Relations plumbed a new depth last week when TA said Tomic was playing a Hall of Shame event in a media release, rather than the Hall of Fame championships in Newport. The governing body quickly apologized for what it said was a clerical error but the Tomic family threatened to sue. Tomic is in Bogota, Colombia preparing to defend his Claro Open title. Healy also said TA would invite applicants for the captaincy of the Davis Cup team after previously anointing Lleyton Hewitt for the role. The retiring Hewitt was to take over after playing his last tournament at the Australian Open in January. Wally Masur has been the team's interim coach since Rafter quit earlier this year to take the high performance role. We want to give everyone a chance to not only apply, but tell us their vision for Davis Cup, Healy said. But Lleyton's a pretty fantastic candidate. Reporting by Ian Ransom; Editing by John O'Brien"

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-usa-zarif-idUSBRE96S0VO20130729","Iran nominee seen as olive branch to United States","","July 29, 2013 /  7:20 PM / 4 years ago","","DUBAI/PARIS (Reuters) - If Iranian President-elect Hassan Rouhani wanted to signal his determination to rebuild relations with the United States and strike a grand bargain, he could hardly do better than pick Mohammad Javad Zarif as his foreign minister. Iranian news agencies reported on Monday that Zarif, a former ambassador to the United Nations and Tehran's leading connoisseur of the U.S. political elite, is set to be in the cabinet Rouhani will announce after taking office on Sunday. A source close to Rouhani confirmed Zarif will be nominated as foreign minister. A fluent English speaker who earned his doctorate at the University of Denver, Zarif has been at the center of several secret negotiations to try to overcome 35 years of estrangement between Washington and Tehran, diplomats said. Those talks failed because of deep mistrust on a range of disputes from Iran's secretive nuclear program and support for anti-Israeli militants to U.S. sanctions and hopes of engineering regime change in Tehran. Zarif's elevation, however, suggests the moderate new president is keen to make another try at breaking the deadlock. He was always trying to do what was possible to improve relations in a very intelligent, open and clear way, said a senior Western diplomat who had repeated dealings with Zarif. This is someone who knows the United States very well and with all the frustrations of the past is still someone they know in Washington, he said. The usual caveats about Iran apply: under the Islamic Republic's complex institutional set-up, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei calls the shots in foreign and security policy and controls the nuclear program, which Western powers say is aimed at developing atomic weapons. The foreign minister ranks roughly fourth in the foreign policy pecking order, after Khamenei, the head of the National Security Council, who also serves as Iran's chief nuclear negotiator, and the president. Nevertheless, assuming he is confirmed by Iran's prickly, conservative-dominated parliament, Zarif's appointment would be a strong gesture of positive intent towards the United States. The two countries have had no official ties since 1980 after Iranian students occupied the U.S. embassy in Tehran, taking 52 diplomats hostage in protest against Washington's admission of the former Shah after he was toppled by the Islamic revolution. Contact Book Zarif's Washington contact book includes Vice President Joe Biden, Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel and a who's who of U.S. national security officials on both sides of the aisle. The soft-spoken career diplomat resigned from the nuclear negotiating team after hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was elected in 2005. In 2007, he returned from New York after five years as Iran's permanent representative to the United Nations and found himself out of favor as his country turned its back on the notion of seeking better ties with the West and Ahmadinejad sidelined English-speaking diplomats. Since then, Zarif has been in a holding pattern, nominally senior adviser to the foreign minister from 2007 to 2010, then from 2011 international director of Islamic Azad University, a network of educational institutions established by ex-president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, his political patron. Rafsanjani, who is also Rouhani's mentor, has long favored a pragmatic rapprochement with the United States, but Khamenei has stamped on all such efforts since he succeeded the founder of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, in 1989. Dennis Ross, a veteran U.S. diplomat who served as President Barack Obama's top Middle East adviser until 2011, said Zarif had shown a willingness to negotiate in good faith and his appointment would be seen in Washington and Europe as an indication that Rouhani wants to do business with the West. But he cautioned that the question remained whether this would translate into an easing of Tehran's resistance to curbing its nuclear drive. Zarif is not someone who does favors for the United States, Ross said. He fits the category of a sign or signal until you see Iran actually doing something. Brent Scowcroft, national security adviser to President George H.W. Bush, described Zarif as reasonable but said much would depend on how much leeway he is given. Western diplomats said Zarif was a central negotiator in the last major effort to negotiate a grand bargain between Tehran and Washington that began after the September 11, 2001, attacks on the United States and foundered in mid-2003. U.S. newspapers published in 2007 the bare text of a draft agreement, put together in secret talks in Paris, Geneva and New York, that would have established negotiations between the two countries on all outstanding issues. While the draft fell short of an agreement on substance, it noted both sides' expectations on issues such as assurances that Iran's nuclear program has no military capability, and assurances that the United States would act against anti-government People's Mujahideen activists based in Iraq. The texts are authentic, said a Western diplomat who was involved in the back-channel talks, confirming that Khamenei had given the green light for negotiations to go ahead. Hostage Negotiator Years earlier, as a junior diplomat Zarif was involved in negotiations to win the release of U.S. hostages held by pro-Iranian gunmen in Lebanon, according to the memoirs of former U.N. envoy Giandomenico Picco. Even though the United States did not make a promised reciprocal goodwill gesture at the time, Zarif remained committed to improving ties. In Washington, Trita Parsi, president of the pro-dialogue National Iranian American Council, said Zarif has been involved in multiple U.S.-Iranian negotiations, including talks on Afghanistan after the U.S.-led 2001 invasion, and Tehran's 2003 proposal for a grand bargain with the United States. Based on my interviews with him, (Zarif) was involved in the drafting of it, Parsi said of that offer of a comprehensive new start, which then President George W. Bush's administration spurned. Veteran U.S. diplomat James Dobbins, the U.S. point man at a 2001 Bonn conference that formed a new Afghan government after the overthrow of the Taliban, credited Zarif with a pivotal, positive role in the diplomacy - and with a sense of humor. Dobbins - now the State Department's special envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan - recalled in 2007 testimony to the U.S. Congress how Zarif, then a deputy foreign minister, persuaded the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance to drop its demand for control of an outsize proportion of Afghan ministries. The Northern Alliance delegate remained obdurate. Finally, Zarif took him aside and whispered to him for a few moments, following which the Northern Alliance envoy returned to the table and said: ‘Okay, I agree. The other factions can have two more ministries. And we can create three more, which they can also have.' We had a deal, Dobbins recalled. Zarif had achieved the final breakthrough without which the (Hamid) Karzai government might never have been formed.

In response, banks are expected to close more unprofitable branches while they invest in mobile and online services for customers who want to bank while on the move. Internet and mobile banking is now used for transactions worth 6.4 billion pounds a week in Britain, up from 5.8 billion last year, the report showed. Banking apps for mobile devices have been downloaded more than 14.7 million times - up 2.3 million just since January - while Internet banking services are typically receiving 7 million log-ins each day. Royal Bank of Scotland said last month it was inevitable that it would close more of its 1,900 branches after branch transactions fell by 30 percent over the past 3 years. Barclays, Lloyds and HSBC are also expected to close branches, according to industry sources. The Campaign for Community Banking Services, a lobby group, has warned that further closures could have a damaging impact on rural communities that rely on local branches for banking services and called for measures such as branch sharing to avoid the last branches left in a particular area being shut down. But the BBA said branches would remain integral to banking in the 21st century. It said 2,274 bank branches had been refurbished in the past two years, underlining banks' commitment to their high street outlets. Day-to-day branch use is falling sharply and while the size of these networks will decline, high street outlets will remain important for those bigger moments, such as when a customer takes out a mortgage, wants to assess their financial options or resolve a complaint, the report said. Banks are looking to automate more basic banking services within branches, such as withdrawing and depositing cash and paying bills, freeing up staff to focus on offering advice. But Paul Adams, chief executive of Glory Global Solutions, which provides self-service machines for bank branches, said British lenders have yet to fully grasp the opportunity provided by new technology to improve customer experiences. New technology allows and permits branches to be more open plan in the way they are presented. There is an opportunity here with some of this technology to really drive up the services provided to customers, he told Reuters. RBS said last month that over 400 of its branches across Britain would be fitted with new technology including iPads so that customers can register and access online banking. Industry sources say a surge in the popularity of mobile banking applications is the main driver behind the rise in digital transactions.

Some 32 percent of U.S. bank customers use mobile banking at least once a month, half-again as many as last year, consulting firm Accenture said in a survey released on Tuesday. Of those who took out a car loan, 21 percent did so online, double the portion the year before. Twenty-five percent went online for a home mortgage, up from 15 percent. The shifts came even as almost four out of five people said they will visit bank branch offices just as frequently, if not more so, five years from now. Branch closings would be inconvenient, two-thirds said. Half said they would switch banks because of a branch closing. Having people want more digital banking and branches too, means trouble for bank executives, said Michael Goodson, an Accenture managing director for financial services. There is a risk of moving too slowly and a risk of moving too quickly, in terms of alienating customers, Goodson said. Accenture found that customers feel little loyalty to banks and would likely switch to a more appealing competitor if they thought the change would not be difficult. Branch real estate and staff cost the top 25 U.S. banks about $50 billion a year, more than information technology, call centers or other operating expenses, according to Accenture. Processing deposits digitally can cost 95 percent less than using human tellers. Gordon Smith, chief executive for consumer banking at JPMorgan Chase & Co, said at an investor conference last week that the company is adding about 100 branches a year to its network of 5,652, up 7 percent from 2010 and second in size only to Wells Fargo & Co's 6,217 locations. Branches continue to attract customers and deposits, Smith said. Still, JPMorgan's pace of building is one-third its former rate and the new branches are smaller and have 20 percent fewer employees. Bank of America has reduced its count by 10 percent since 2010 to 5,243. Full-service banks could lose as much as 35 percent of their market share to more digitally-adept peers and newcomers by 2020, said Wayne Busch, head of Accenture's banking practice in North America. The companies that take customers, Busch said, could include banks that are online only and retailers that partner with financial institutions. An example of that type of venture happened when Wal-Mart Stores Inc teamed up with American Express Co to offer a prepaid debit card in lieu of checking accounts. "

JPMorgan Chase & Co said it had reopened 587 Chase branches, about 55 percent of the total in the states of New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Nearly 60 percent of the New York City-based bank's 3,200 automated teller machines in the area were running. Citigroup Inc, as of mid-day Wednesday, had re-opened 55 percent of its nearly 300 branches in and around New York City. Some 70 percent of 1,500 automated teller machines in the area were working. Wells Fargo & Co said that nearly 90 percent of its nearly 1,200 branches in  Maryland, Virginia, Washington, D.C., Delaware, Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey and Connecticut had re-opened. Bank of America Corp said about 75 percent of its 1,700 banking centers in the Northeast were functioning again. It had 13 branches open in Manhattan and planned to have several more open on Thursday. It was also deploying mobile ATMs in the area. At least 134 of the 183 Morgan Stanley brokerage offices that were closed had reopened by mid-morning, the company said. The offices that remained closed either lacked electricity or were inaccessible due to flooding or other damage. Most of the closed offices were in New Jersey and New York, with some in Connecticut. Goldman Sachs Group Inc opened both its headquarters in lower Manhattan and its office across the river at 30 Hudson Street in Jersey City, New Jersey, on Wednesday. Goldman offices in Princeton, New Jersey, and Greenwich, Connecticut, were open for some employees, while others worked remotely. Staff in the securities division - especially those who live in Manhattan - generally came into the office, though the lack of public transportation and traffic made commutes longer than usual. Goldman's two main buildings in the New York area, on opposite sides of the Hudson River, sustained some flooding but no serious damage from the hurricane, a representative said. Citigroup's lower Manhattan buildings used for trading and investment banking remain closed. The company said on Tuesday night that it would update information on access to those Greenwich Street buildings later this week.

Yet many lenders are holding back from massive cuts for fear of choking off a source of new business, alienating older customers and sparking a political backlash in isolated regions. Branch closures are greeted with dismay when communities are left without a local bank. But they reflect an online revolution that is transforming the way people do everything from buying holidays and comparing insurance prices to borrowing library books and renting DVDs. They are also an ideal way for lenders to cut costs and build up more capital after the financial crisis. The figure on closures or sales last year was compiled by Reuters based on year-end statements from 26 of Europe's 30 largest listed banks. The other four do not disclose the figures routinely and would not provide them. As many as 40 percent of Europe's bank branches are expected to close between 2013 and 2020 as the digitalisation of banking takes hold, says consultancy firm Bain & Company. That would mean 65,000 fewer branches across the EU, based on European Central Bank data showing there were almost 218,000 bank branches across the region at the end of 2012. It's only the start of branch closures, said Bain's head of global retail banking, Dirk Vater. I've been a banking consultant for more than 20 years. For the first time, we'll really see some dramatic changes... The industry will be disrupted. The most drastic cuts have come in Spain, where many banks are still struggling to recover from a property crash and debt crisis and have taken a hatchet to costs. A September 2013 study by Deutsche Bank analysts found Spain had more branches per person than any other market they track. Bankia, cobbled together from seven failed Spanish regional banks and bailed out in 2012, has slashed 37 percent of its network, or 1,100 branches in 2013. The other four Spanish banks in the top 30 - Santander , CaixaBank, BBVA and Banco Popular Espanol - cut a combined 1,774 branches. Some went as banks sold foreign units, but most cuts were in Spain. Bank branch networks need to keep shrinking, Maria Dolores Dancausa, CEO of mid-sized Bankinter, said at a Madrid conference in April. I don't know if I would dare predict if that will be by half or if it needs to be more than half. Italy, Cyprus and Germany were also singled out for special mention as being over-branched in the Deutsche report, but banks from those countries, with the exception of Italy's UniCredit, cut at a slower rate than the 6 percent contraction across the 26 European banks. Branchless World? Online banks have already shown it is possible to do without an established retail network and traditional lenders are scaling up their online networks. The shift to internet banking means fewer people are choosing to visit their local bank. Royal Bank of Scotland, which has more branches than grocery chains Asda and Sainsbury's combined, said it has seen a 30 percent fall in branch transactions since 2010. Deutsche Bank analysts say retail banks can cut their expenses by up to 15 percent over the medium term by cutting branches and repositioning those that remain into smaller offices with fewer staff. Industry newcomers are embracing a branchless world. Metro Bank founder Anthony Thomson this week announced an online-only  UK bank dubbed 'Atom' to launch in 2015. Yet some banks have decided bricks-and-mortar networks are a vital part of their business and are not cutting deeply. Deutsche's head of European banks research, Jason Napier, believes a UK bank can get by with as few as 500 branches in the long term. But Lloyds has 2,254 and has committed to keeping them all open under a strategic plan that runs to the end of this year. In Germany, another market singled out as over-banked, Commerzbank cut just 0.43 percent of its network last year and executives have recently spoken of the bank's total commitment to its branch network. Cutting branches means fewer staff, lower business rents  and other overheads and can yield quick cash from the sale of valuable land and buildings. But it is not cheap to do. They've got exit costs relating to personnel and leases ... with branches and employment both sensitive (political) issues, said Napier. Ipads, Coffee, Armchairs Ian Walsh, global head of retail banking at Boston Consulting Group, said the future of bank branches wasn't just about closing them. Banks are looking to optimise their branch networks rather than eliminate it, he said. BNP Paribas added plant-covered wall, iPads for customer use and a touchscreen desk at its refurbished flagship branch near the Paris Opera in 2011. Visits to the branch had increased 40 percent by last year, the bank said. Virgin Money, one of a handful of challenger banks emerging in Britain, last month opened its fourth lounge for customers, where they can drink free coffee and fruit juice or biscuit, use iPads or watch television from an armchair. You can even play the piano or a board game. But staff do not process any banking transactions. There is free Wifi and customers get help logging onto their online accounts, but there are no tellers or ATMs. Walsh said relatively few bank customers want to do everything online and most still want branches for face-to-face conversations about complex products such as mortgages. RBS is refurbishing 250 branches to remove counters so staff can talk more easily to customers and investing 600,000 pounds in five extra mobile banks for clients with no branch on their doorstep, an approach long tried and tested in Spain. Efficiencies like mobile branches and part-time outlets can work well, Walsh said, but slashing branches can be dangerous. If you close branches .... before you ensure you still have reach into those customers, you risk cutting off the blood supply to the bank, said Walsh. We are bullish about the importance of branches as a key channel in retail banking.

Some 32 percent of U.S. bank customers use mobile banking at least once a month, half-again as many as last year, consulting firm Accenture said in a survey released on Tuesday. Of those who took out a car loan, 21 percent did so online, double the portion the year before. Twenty-five percent went online for a home mortgage, up from 15 percent. The shifts came even as almost four out of five people said they will visit bank branch offices just as frequently, if not more so, five years from now. Branch closings would be inconvenient, two-thirds said. Half said they would switch banks because of a branch closing. Having people want more digital banking and branches too, means trouble for bank executives, said Michael Goodson, an Accenture managing director for financial services. There is a risk of moving too slowly and a risk of moving too quickly, in terms of alienating customers, Goodson said. Accenture found that customers feel little loyalty to banks and would likely switch to a more appealing competitor if they thought the change would not be difficult. Branch real estate and staff cost the top 25 U.S. banks about $50 billion a year more than including information technology, call centers or other operating expenses, according to Accenture. Processing deposits digitally can cost 95 percent less than using human tellers. Gordon Smith, chief executive for consumer banking at JPMorgan Chase & Co, said at an investor conference last week that the company is adding about 100 branches a year to its network of 5,652, up 7 percent from 2010 and second in size only to Wells Fargo & Co's 6,217 locations. Branches continue to attract customers and deposits, Smith said. Still, JPMorgan's pace of building is one-third its former rate and the new branches are smaller and have 20 percent fewer employees. Bank of America has reduced its count by 10 percent since 2010 to 5,243. Full-service banks could lose as much as 35 percent of their market share to more digitally-adept peers and newcomers by 2020, said Wayne Busch, head of Accenture's banking practice in North America. The companies that take customers, Busch said, could include banks that are online only and retailers that partner with financial institutions. An example of that type of venture happened when Wal-Mart Stores Inc teamed up with American Express Co to offer a prepaid debit card in lieu of checking accounts.

The new monument includes mountains, forests, and the East Branch of the Penobscot River and will serve as a protected area. The White House said the designation was completed in honor of the centennial anniversary of the Park Service, which will be officially observed on Thursday. The President is quite proud that this piece of beautiful land in the United States will be protected for generations to come, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said at a press briefing. The monument was donated to the federal government by conservation philanthropist Roxanne Quimby's foundation. Quimby co-founded natural care product company Burt's Bees.    Obama has protected more than 265 million acres of public lands and waters during his time in office, more than any other president in history. But, Republican lawmakers have criticized his use of executive authority to set aside land as national monuments. They argue he has circumvented Congress and local groups, who should have more say in the process. Rob Bishop, the Republican chairman of the House natural resources committee, blasted the establishment of the Maine monument. The only votes taken on this proposal, at the local and state level, have demonstrated opposition from Mainers, Bishop said in a statement. If the president cared about local voices and improving our National Park system, he would have done this through the public process and not behind closed doors. Critics of the monument argue the designation could open the door to more federal restrictions on use of the land and eventually threaten neighboring logging operations. The White House defended the decision to protect the area in Maine. The administration worked very closely with the officials in Maine, both to reach this determination and to make sure that the concerns that were raised by Mainers in the area were addressed, Earnest said.

Earlier this week, it was announced that the PRA will be prepared to see Chinese banks open branches here... it should be clear that this is not a special arrangement for China, rather it is part of a broader policy, Bailey told a British Bankers' Association conference. Chinese banks were reported to have complained last year that rules imposing tight standards on capital and liquidity made it hard to operate in Britain, prompting them to move much of their business to Luxembourg.

Subsidiaries have to comply with tight standards on capital and liquidity, while branches are treated as extensions of the overseas bank, leaving the UK regulator with limited control. Cross-border banking has become fragmented since the 2007-09 financial crisis as regulators want to avoid having to use taxpayer money to shore up lenders again. This has led to a lack of trust among regulators, prompting them to force foreign as well as domestic banks to hold more capital locally.

He will expect very clear and credible assurances from parents of banks that want to open branches in Britain under the new policy.

Making smart credit decisions is critical now as the auto lending business heats up. U.S. consumers have $1 trillion of automobile loans outstanding, up from about $700 billion in the first quarter of 2010, according to data from the New York Federal Reserve. That represents much steeper growth than credit card loans, which have remained essentially flat. The fourth-largest U.S. bank has 56 branches for car and dealer financing, including one it recently opened in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, said Dawn Martin Harp, head of dealer services. The branches, called regional business centers serve car dealers exclusively. The bank is planning to add more offices, including one in the Southwest by the end of the year, but has no specific number that it is targeting, Martin Harp said.  The branches are not just sales offices. They include credit officers who approve or deny loans. Having credit officers who are in the regions where they are lending ensures that they know their customers better, Martin Harp said. It's a differentiator for us, she said. She added that the pace of growth depends on opportunities in different communities and in the overall car loan market. With the market's growth in recent years, regulators and bankers have grown concerned about risk in the sector. Wells Fargo's Chief Executive John Shrewsberry said on the bank's first-quarter earnings call in April that auto lending has gotten to be a more competitive market, adding, we've picked our spots, I think, a little bit more delicately.  On the second-quarter call in July, he said the sector is nonetheless providing a big opportunity because so many cars are being sold. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, one of the major U.S. banking regulators, said in a report earlier this year that it is closely watching auto lending, noting that extended rapid growth is difficult to maintain and can sometimes mask early signs of weakening credit quality.  Wells is taking a different tack from competitors including Ally Financial Inc (ALLY.N) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), which have centralized their auto lending operations to cut costs.     Reporting by Dan Freed; Editing by Alan Crosby"

RBS is preparing the business, code named Rainbow, for a stock market flotation but is open to the idea of first selling substantial stakes to strategic investors prior to an initial public offering. The investor would then stay on as a dominant force in the floated company after the IPO. The bank must sell 315 branches as a condition of receiving a 45.5 billion pound ($69.2 billion) government rescue in 2008 which left it 82 percent state-owned. Industry sources said RBS is considering proposals from 3 sets of investors who could serve as the strategic partner. One consortium is led by private equity firms Centerbridge and Corsair and has backing from the Church of England's investment fund, while another comprises several of Britain's biggest investment firms and is led by former Tesco finance director, Andy Higginson. A third proposal has been submitted by British private equity firm Anacap Financial Partners, in conjunction with U.S. private equity group, Blackstone (BX.N). RBS could also pursue a stock market flotation of the branches on its own without having additional investors on board, the sources said. RBS is not yet favoring a particular proposal. All bids have their merits and it is too early to say which bidder is most likely to succeed, said one source close to the sale process. RBS is aiming to tell potential investors what its plans are in the next month, the sources said, although that timetable is not set in stone. An IPO could happen any time in the next two years, the sources said, but the bank would like to go earlier to avoid competing against a glut of impending bank share sales. The government is planning to start selling its shares in Lloyds Banking Group soon while Lloyds is looking to spin off 630 branches via a stock market flotation. The deal adds to an increasingly busy block of UK bank assets seeking investment or new capital over the next year, raising questions of whether the market will be swallow everything. Spain's Santander (SAN.MC) and Virgin Money, the financial group that is part of Richard Branson's empire, are both planning to float their UK businesses. The sale of the RBS branches was halted in October when Santander (SAN.MC) pulled out of a deal to buy the whole portfolio for 1.65 billion pounds.

Our performance was underpinned by growth in our balance sheet, Gideon Muriuki, the bank's chief executive, told an investor briefing. The bank continued to enforce strict credit risk management especially with high interest rates. He is optimistic the bank can sustain its performance in 2012 despite high inflation and an any uncertainty from a forthcoming presidential election. Muriuki said the bank's loan book grew 26 percent to 109.4 billion shillings, and that it planned to open 30 new branches this year, and had also gained approval to start operating in neighbouring South Sudan. The establishment of Co-operative Bank South Sudan as a joint-venture has been approved by the government of South Sudan. We expect to play big in South Sudan, he said. Muriuki said the first branch would open in the next six months. The bank's earnings per share rose to 1.53 shillings from 1.31 shillings previously. It is a fair reflection of the banking sector especially in the second half with high interest, high inflation, said Renaldo D'souza, an analyst at Genghis Capital, I think it was a fairly disappointing second half for them ... it was below expectation since in the first half they had said they expected 8 billion (pretax) profit at the end of the year. The bank declared a dividend to 0.40 shillings a share, unchanged from 2010. Muriuki said this was done to build the bank's capital base. It also said it planned a bonus share issue of one for every five ordinary shares held. Kenyan commercial banks are reporting healthy growth in profits, despite a rough year in 2011 in which interest rates ate into bond holdings, and high inflation took its toll on general economic performance. Aggressive monetary tightening to curb inflation and prop up the east African country's currency has seen commercial banks raise lending rates to about 25 percent from 15 percent since October, and lawmakers are pushing a new law to cap the rates. It's not the way to go. Economies that want to grow do not control interest rates. They should let market fundamentals (set) ... the level of interest rates, said Muriuki.

The bank, which owns NatWest and Ulster Bank, said the money would be spent on refurbishments across its network of 2,066 branches and initiatives to improve services to its 15.4 million customers within the UK. RBS, 82 percent-owned by the government, said it would improve complaints handling, allow customers to open accounts more quickly, simplify the processing of mortgages and provide new self-service machines in its branches. The bank is concentrating on its routine retail operations  having cut back its huge investment banking business since it was rescued with a 45.5 billion-pound ($69 billion) state bailout following the 2008 financial crisis. The government wants it to focus on lending to British households and small businesses. The new initiatives are part of a strategy set by Ross McEwan, who was appointed head of RBS's UK retail business in August last year, joining from Commonwealth Bank of Australia, where he was in charge of retail banking services for 5 years. In a presentation to investors, McEwan said he planned to make RBS the best retail bank in Britain. There's a big space there for it. I've not met anyone who believes there's great retail banking in the UK, he said. McEwan said the bank will invest in rejuvenating its NatWest brand, which accounts for 80 percent of its business, and in re-building its RBS brand and growing market share in Scotland. McEwan faces a challenge in restoring the image of the bank after a computer systems failure caused disruption to millions of its customers last year while the bank faces a 3.5 billion pound compensation bill for mis-selling."

RBS was ordered to sell the UK branches as a condition of its 2008 taxpayer bailout, which left the bank 81 percent state-owned. A 1.65-billion-pound ($2.59 billion) sale of the branches to Spain's Santander (SAN.MC) collapsed in October 2012, triggering a fresh sale process that has been plagued by delays. In separate interviews with Reuters, senior figures from short-listed bidders W&G; Investments and Corsair said a deal needed to be agreed quickly so that the branch business, which has assets of about 20.5 billion pounds, can begin operating as a separate entity ahead of its change in ownership. Both laid out plans to expand the business by focusing on small business lending and said they were committed long-term investors who wanted to create a challenger bank in the UK. Headed by former Tesco Finance chief Andy Higginson, W&G; Investments is a UK-based group of institutional investors which will list on London's Alternative Investment Market (AIM) on Tuesday. It wants to pay between 1.1 and 1.5 billion pounds for the branches. U.S.-based private equity firm Corsair is bidding along with fellow private equity house Centre Point, and other investors including the Church of England's investment fund and Standard Life Investments. It wants to install former Lloyds Banking Group (LLOY.L) executive John Maltby as chief executive and pay between 600 million and 800 million pounds to become a cornerstone investor ahead of a stock market flotation that would value the new bank at more than 1.5 billion pounds. The third bid is headed by British private equity house AnaCap, with U.S. investor Blackstone. In a statement, they said they would work with RBS to achieve a premium valuation for the business through a stock market offering, but would give no detail on the value of their proposed deal. RBS declined to comment on the process. 'Slightly Neglected' Asked about the biggest challenge to their bid, W&G;'s Higginson said the most important thing was for the branches to get separate management as soon as possible so that value is preserved. Having been a division within RBS with a for-sale sign above it for five years, inevitably it's been slightly neglected, said Higginson. The staff have done a fantastic job in holding the customers, but you know this business needs separate focus, the management vigor that a for-sale sign doesn't allow you to have. Under the W&G; plan, RBS would ready the business for sale over about two years by giving it more autonomy, getting a banking license and making other necessary changes, before passing it over to the investors. Corsair would install Maltby as chief executive as soon as a deal was done, and he and RBS would work together to prepare the business for independence, a similar model to the one proposed by AnaCap/Blackstone. Maltby said both staff and customers had been living through a period of uncertainty. The quicker the process can come to a successful conclusion and we can get on and build this new bank the better it is for all parties, he said. Under the terms of its bailout, RBS must sell the branches by the end of 2013. Chief Financial Officer Bruce Van Saun said in February the bank had already told the European Commission it was likely to need an extension but would not apply formally until a preferred bidder was picked. In It for the Long Haul Higginson said his grouping had a very big group of powerful institutional investors that would create a business that would still be around in twenty years' time. The investors would be legally allowed to sell their equity once W&G;'s AIM trading goes 'live', he said, but stressed that they were long-term holders by nature. W&G;'s stock market listing begins on Tuesday based on the 15 million pounds that was raised to fund the bid's costs, but the shares are suspended until the bid is accepted and 1.1 billion pounds is raised from investors. Corsair and its fellow investors do not currently have any obligation to stay on after a flotation. The IPO (stock market sale) is the beginning of the process, not the end, said Maltby. Each of the investors is very long term and expect to continue to be investors long after the IPO. Both bidders see room for significant growth in the small business market, where the branches have a 5 percent market share, but neither would give details of their target market share. AnaCap/Blackstone said it has experience in SME lending through AnaCap's investment in UK SME lender Aldermore. The grouping's proposed management team, former Lloyds executive Mike Fairey and former First Direct boss Alan Hughes, have track records running major UK retail and SME banks, the statement added. Both Higginson and Maltby said jobs would increase under their plans and that they had no plan to follow a Europe-wide branch cutting trend that saw 5,500 outlets eliminated last year. We have no plans to slash the branch network, said Higginson, adding that they would institute longer, Tesco-style opening hours if that's what customers want.

Officials from Richard Stockton College in nearby Galloway Township, said in a statement they plan to convert some of the 1.4 million square foot building into dormitory space. The Showboat has 1,329 hotel rooms and sits on 28 beachfront acres. Four Atlantic City casinos have closed this year, and city officials have struggled find uses for the shuttered buildings. The former casino floor would be converted to administrative offices. Theaters at the building would, under the college's plans, house facilities for dance, music and drama programs, the school said. One of the three towers will remain a hotel holding some 479 rooms opening sometime in the spring of 2015. The college said dorm rooms could be used as hotel rooms during summer months, when demand is high and most students are away from campus. The college said the purchase price is far less expensive than new construction. The purchase was announced in November. Gaming companies, fearing new competition, have typically inserted deed restrictions prohibiting new owners from re-opening the properties as casinos. The diversification of activities available in AC stands to benefit all of the city's stakeholders, said Caesars Entertainment CEO Gary Loveman in a statement. Caesars Entertainment closed Showboat in August, even though it was profitable, to try to consolidate Atlantic City's deteriorating gaming market. Stockton College purchased the Seaview Resort in Galloway Township in 2010 for $20 million. It uses part of the property to train students in hospitality and generate revenue for the college, and to house students.

Britain's regulator is taking a tough line and requiring the mutually owned conglomerate Co-Operative Group to strengthen its systems and board to prepare for the deal. Several analysts have warned it might have a hard task in taking on and integrating the Lloyds branches. I think the Lloyds' statement is a warning shot to the Co-Op. It doesn't feel like a done deal, said Oriel Securities analyst Mike Trippitt. Lloyds said on Thursday it was making progress in its talks with the Co-Operative over the deal, codenamed Project Verde. However, given that this is a substantial business and a highly complex transaction, the group now anticipates providing a further update in Q2 2012, it added. Lloyds said last year it had started exclusive talks to sell the branches to the Co-Op - a conglomerate whose businesses range from a retail supermarket division to financial services. But it has always kept open the option of spinning off the assets and then listing them on the stock market, in case it could not pull off a sale, and one analyst said the chances of an initial public offering (IPO) had increased. I think it's edging more towards an IPO. It doesn't surprise me that it's been held up, said Shore Capital analyst Gary Greenwood. Lloyds reiterated on Thursday that while its preferred option remained a sale of the assets to the Co-Op, it would keep the fall-back option of an IPO. It remains our preference to sell the Verde business to The Co-operative Group. In addition, the group is continuing to prepare for a divestment through an initial public offering, Lloyds said. Co-Op also said it was making progress on the deal, but echoed Lloyds by noting the complexities of the transaction. Fsa Wants Reassurances Britain's Financial Services Authority (FSA) is expected to want reassurances that the Co-Op has strong enough capital, an experienced board and adequate systems and business plan before it gives a go-ahead for the deal. In December, credit ratings agency Standard & Poor's cut its outlook on Co-Op due to the risks associated with the Lloyds deal. Other analysts have said Co-Op may need to raise money through a debt issue to fund the acquisition, estimated to be worth some 1 billion pounds ($1.6 billion). Lloyds, which is part-owned by the British government and last year announced plans to cut 15,000 jobs, said it would create around 500 new posts in the Verde business. Co-Op beat off rival bidder NBNK - a new bank venture set up to acquire banking assets - in the Verde bid process last year. Acquiring the Lloyds branches would mark a further expansion in Co-Op's banking business after it bought Britannia Building Society in 2009. The sale of the Lloyds' Verde assets would create Britain's seventh-biggest bank, with the assets representing 4.6 percent of personal current or checking accounts and 5 percent of the mortgage market. They contributed about 500 million pounds of pretax profit in 2008 and income of about 1.4 billion. Lloyds said it remained on track to complete the transfer of the bank branches before the end of 2013, in line with a timetable laid out for the sale by the European Commission. European regulators ordered Lloyds to sell the assets as payback for getting a state bailout during the 2008 credit crisis, which left Britain with a 40 percent stake in the group. A sale of the Verde retail branch assets would mark an important step towards Britain's longer-term plans of selling off its 40 percent Lloyds holding and its 82 percent stake in rival bailed-out lender Royal Bank of Scotland. Lloyds shares closed down 1.7 percent at 35.25 pence - still well below the average 63 pence price at which the British taxpayer acquired its stake in the bank. "

I am more than confident - 100 percent confident, we're 1,000 percent confident that my colleagues here in the States will achieve that goal within a couple of years, Masaaki Tanaka, deputy president of MUFG, told Reuters in an interview. Tanaka, a key architect of the Japanese lender's expansion strategy, said MUFG does not have a particular target and did not say how big a deal it was prepared to fund. However, he said it is open to buying a bank on the West Coast, where its retail arm is based, or in other parts of the United States, to reach its top-10 target. MUFG management will provide capital if they need it, we will provide very strong support to the people who are running the show, said Tanaka. MUFG has been trying to grow its footprint outside of Japan for several years because the country's aging population offers dimmer growth prospects than countries abroad. Tanaka and Kyota Omori, who was then head of MUFG's U.S. operations, first set a goal of becoming a top-10 U.S. bank in 2007. MUFG has since made a series of acquisitions and developed strategic partnerships with Morgan Stanley (MS.N) in pursuit of that goal, which is internally dubbed Project Leones. Bankers and analysts have been predicting further consolidation in the U.S. banking sector for years, arguing that revenue pressure and new regulatory expenses will force smaller banks to merge or be acquired by larger rivals. However, few major deals have been struck since the 2007-2009 crisis, either because parties are wide apart on pricing, or because of regulatory scrutiny. Beyond acquisitions, MUFG is looking to expand its corporate lending through a partnership with Morgan Stanley, and its middle-market lending through its San Francisco-based retail banking arm, called UnionBanCal Corp. MUFG is in the process of integrating UnionBanCal with its MUFG Americas division, which is based in New York. Combined, the two entities would rank as No. 12 among the country's largest banks, behind large regional lenders like SunTrust Banks Inc (STI.N) and BB&T; Corp (BBT.N), according to data provided by MUFG.

RBS is preparing the business, code named Rainbow, for a stock market flotation but is open to the idea of first selling substantial stakes to strategic investors prior to an initial public offering. The investor would then stay on as a dominant force in the floated company after the IPO. The bank must sell 315 branches as a condition of receiving a 45.5 billion pound ($69.2 billion) government rescue in 2008 which left it 82 percent state-owned. Industry sources said RBS is considering proposals from 3 sets of investors who could serve as the strategic partner. One consortium is led by private equity firms Centerbridge and Corsair and has backing from the Church of England's investment fund, while another comprises several of Britain's biggest investment firms and is led by former Tesco finance director, Andy Higginson. A third proposal has been submitted by British private equity firm Anacap Financial Partners, in conjunction with U.S. private equity group, Blackstone. RBS could also pursue a stock market flotation of the branches on its own without having additional investors on board, the sources said. RBS is not yet favouring a particular proposal. All bids have their merits and it is too early to say which bidder is most likely to succeed, said one source close to the sale process. RBS is aiming to tell potential investors what its plans are in the next month, the sources said, although that timetable is not set in stone. An IPO could happen any time in the next two years, the sources said, but the bank would like to go earlier to avoid competing against a glut of impending bank share sales. The government is planning to start selling its shares in Lloyds Banking Group soon while Lloyds is looking to spin off 630 branches via a stock market flotation. The deal adds to an increasingly busy block of UK bank assets seeking investment or new capital over the next year, raising questions of whether the market will be swallow everything. Spain's Santander and Virgin Money, the financial group that is part of Richard Branson's empire, are both planning to float their UK businesses. The sale of the RBS branches was halted in October when Santander pulled out of a deal to buy the whole portfolio for 1.65 billion pounds. RBS has said a sale this year is now unlikely, meaning it will have to ask European regulators to extend a December 2013 deadline."
"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-barclays-gold-idUSBRE88Q18Z20120927","Barclays new vault opens for gold","","September 27, 2012 /  4:29 PM / 5 years ago","","LONDON (Reuters) - Too much gold and just nowhere to put it? A high security solution to bullion storage issues is at hand at a secret location somewhere inside London's orbital motorway - the first British bank-owned gold vault to open in over five years. Barclays (BARC.L) new vault anticipates demand from pension funds, central banks and sovereign wealth funds who have been scooping up the precious metal that has doubled in value since late 2008. Precious metals storage has shaken off its dusty image, emerging as a lucrative business. Gold is preparing for a twelfth consecutive annual price rise against the backdrop of a flagging global economy and the debt crisis that has engulfed Europe. London is the heart of the over-the-counter precious metals market, where millions of dollars in trade are cleared and settled daily, the benchmark prices for gold, silver, platinum and palladium are set and where thousands of ounces of metal are stored. Barclays, which quotes metals prices and clears over-the-counter trades, says the decision stemmed largely from its customers' desire to have all aspects of their investment in precious metals handled by one firm. Of the six (London) clearing members, only two have their own vault and we are the first bank to go out and build their own vault in over five years, which feeds back to it really being in response to client demand, Jonathan Spall, product manager for metals at Barclays, said in an interview. For many years, vaulting wasn't particularly interesting. It has changed dramatically along with why people want to do it. Ten years ago, people were not that bothered about gold or what it was or where it was held, but now they are very bothered. The prospect of the U.S. Federal Reserve pumping more money into the economy through purchases of bonds to encourage job creation has been instrumental in unleashing fresh demand for gold and other precious metals. The Fed, which announced its latest bond-buying program two weeks ago first employed this tactic, known as quantitative easing, in late 2008 following the collapse of U.S. bank Lehman Brothers. Investment in bullion through exchange-traded funds has hit record highs and central banks around the world have added an average of 400 metric tonnes (440.92 tons) of the metal to their reserves every year in that time, according to data from the International Monetary Fund. Security specialists such as Brinks Co. (BCO.N) have been the traditional safe-guards of metal owned by investors and investment banks, but financial institutions have branched out to include vaulting as part of their services. This has coincided also with the proliferation of ETFs, funds which issue shares backed by physical metal, for which banks such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N) and HSBC (HSBA.L) frequently act as custodians. In keeping with the opacity that shrouds the vaulting industry, Barclays did not specify how large their new facility is. The Bank of England, the world's fifteenth largest custodian of gold reserves, houses some 310 tonnes in its underground vault below the streets of the City of London. More Vaulting New vaults have proliferated, especially in Singapore, which lies between India and China, the world's two largest consumers of gold. Barclays says its decision to build its vault in London stems partly from the liquidity available in that market. So far in 2012, gold has risen by 12.5 percent to trade around $1,760 an ounce, Silver has gained nearly 25 percent, platinum has risen by 18 percent and palladium has lost 3.5 percent. It is uncertain whether the gold price will return to the record $1,920.30 an ounce hit last September, especially if the U.S. economy revives enough to boost the dollar and prompt the Fed to end its bond-buying. But enough investors are still drawn to the luster of precious metals to mean Barclays feels it is unlikely that the vault will gather many cobwebs. It's been remarkable enough since QE3 (was announced) that we've had people come on. I was on the phone to a sovereign wealth fund who haven't been involved with precious metals at all. So you are seeing new faces and new names come in like that, so there is no particular let-up, Spall said. In terms of prospective customers, he said: We are not just talking about sovereign wealth funds or central banks or investors or hedge funds. We are also talking about other banks with a presence in the market who we would regard as clients in that respect. For all that London offers a deep, active market and for all Barclays' clients have a one-stop shop for their precious metals needs, a vault is only as good as its security and secrecy is a vital ingredient, Barclays says. Clients are rarely invited to visit a facility and indulge in what the storage industry calls vault voyeurism. Security is key. This is a new, state-of-the-art facility and this is one of the things clients look at: security and cost, Spall said. Reporting by Amanda Cooper; Editing by Veronica Brown and William Hardy"

These divestments consist of the sale of selected UK branches, imposed because  they received capital injections from the UK government during the recent  financial crisis. The collapse of the EC-mandated sale by Lloyds to the Co-operative Bank, known  as Project Verde, leaves Lloyds with limited time to meet the EC's end-2013  deadline. Although Lloyds has worked on separating the business for over two  years, starting before the Co-operative Bank was announced as preferred bidder  in December 2011, we expect it would take longer to fully divest Verde through  an initial public offering. The IPO is the bank's fall-back option, which is  subject to regulatory and EC approval. RBS is undertaking a second bid process on the sale of its branches after the  collapse of the first deal with Santander UK in October. The business for sale  is substantially carved out, with a standalone management team. But execution  risk is high, as there is limited time to complete the transaction with a buyer  who can meet the UK regulatory hurdles. However, the recent relaxation of rules  for new entrants, such as reduced minimum core capital ratio and liquidity  requirements, could help this process. We would not rule out a flotation if a  sale is not achieved. An extension of the deadline avoids the need for a forced sale or flotation  while markets are weak. The longer the extension, the greater the chance of a  financial sector recovery and more buoyant market conditions in which to sell. The EC may be more open to agreeing changes to mandated sales in light of the  difficult market conditions. But we would not rule out additional EC measures to  compensate for any extension to the banks' restructuring plans. An extended  divestment timeframe could also keep other state aid restrictions in place for  longer, such as bans on acquisitions. We expect other amendments, such as downsizing the assets for sale as was the  case for ING's Westland Utrecht Bank divestment, or switching from sales to  run-downs as was the case for Commerzbank's Eurohypo, to be unlikely options for  Lloyds and RBS because of the size of their retail and SME franchises."

Saakashvili struck a conciliatory tone in remarks to thousands of supporters at their first big rally since his party was swept from power by Ivanishvili's opposition movement in a parliamentary election last October. The defeat set up a tense situation in the Caucasus state, a conduit for pipelines pumping Caspian Sea energy westward and a platform for geopolitical rivalry between the United States and Russia, which fought a brief war with Georgia in 2008. Saakashvili is barred by term limits from seeking re-election this autumn and the president's powers have already been reduced, but his United National Movement wants to remain relevant. I'd like to extend a hand of friendship to them, Saakashvili said of Ivanishvili's government, addressing more than 10,000 supporters in the centre of the capital Tbilisi. If we, your opposition, are optimistic, you should be optimistic too - and not angry, he said. But he got a cool reception from Ivanishvili's camp. Saakashvili could not become a president of the whole country. He is just a leader of one political team - and this team, as well as he himself, are in the past, said Eka Beselia, a lawmaker from Ivanishvili's Georgian Dream coalition. The rally was framed as a new start for Saakashvili's party and a show of support for the pro-Western course set by the president, who was first elected after leading the peaceful Rose Revolution protests in 2003 that swept out the old guard. Saakashvili cultivated close relations with Washington, and his efforts to bring Georgia into NATO were one of the factors that led to the five-day war with Russia in 2008. Ivanishvili, a billionaire who made his fortune in Russia, fought off suggestions from Saakashvili during the parliamentary election campaign that he was a Kremlin stooge. Demonstrators echoed that theme on Friday, holding posters that read, Any country but Russia - no way, but the West, Bidzina, go home! and Georgia's choice is Europe. Ivanishvili has pledged to make relations with the West a priority, following in Saakashvili's footsteps, but says he also wants to improve ties with Moscow. Russia recently agreed to open its market to Georgian wine and mineral water, which were banned in 2006 as tensions increased, and Ivanishvili wants an investigation into the war to see whether Saakashvili was partly to blame.

Russia is increasingly shifting its focus to Asian markets after Western sanctions this year targeted a number of Russian lenders and energy companies by limiting their access to funding over Moscow's role in the Ukraine crisis. This year a daughter unit of Vnesheconombank is expected to be established in Hong Kong and, in the longer term, possibly Sberbank and Promsvyazbank, Economy Minister Alexei Ulyukayev was quoted as saying by his ministry. Ulyukayev, part of a Russian state delegation to Beijing for an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit, said energy firms could list in Asian currencies, according to a statement posted on the ministry's website. The minister said steps are being taken that will allow the Russian companies to directly offer securities denominated in Hong Kong dollars, the statement said, following talks between Ulyukayev and Hong Kong's economic development minister. An unnamed official from Gazprom, Russia's top natural gas producer, said in June that the company was in talks to add a listing in Hong Kong. Relations between Russia and the West have hit their lowest level since the end of the Cold War over Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine and allegations that Moscow has sent troops and arms to pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine.

Five years later, Suncity has emerged as the dominant junket in the Chinese territory. It is planning to open its own resort, independent of casino stalwarts such as Las Vegas Sands, and is expanding into everything from mining to films. Macau's booming revenues that totaled $38 billion last year - six times that of the Las Vegas strip - are indebted to its unique VIP junket system, where licensed middlemen act on behalf of the casinos to attract big whale spenders by arranging their travel and accommodation and handle their gambling credit. Now the transformation of the former Portuguese colony from a hotbed of crime into a playground for China's nouveau riche has spawned a new breed of junkets, eager to shed the industry's shady image and establish themselves as multinational conglomerates. Suncity is a young and very energetic corporate. There is a need to be diversified, said YM Choong, a senior executive at the company, in an interview with Reuters. For future investments we would look to expand in different areas, particularly property, finance and media. We would look to list other parts of the business. The evolution of the junkets is welcomed by the authorities, who are eager to re-position Macau as an all-round international travel destination, but could shake-up the dynamics of the world's largest gambling market. The junkets have traditionally worked for the casinos, which rely on them for more than two-thirds of their revenue. Now, leveraging their extensive customer databases and sophisticated resources, they could one day start competing with them. Macau's junket operators are fully aware that their network and database of high net worth VIPs is valuable, said Edmund Lee, a partner at PwC in Hong Kong who focuses on the gaming sector. Suncity, headed by 39-year-old Alvin Chau, is one of more than 200 junket operators licensed in Macau, on China's southern coast, the only place in the country where locals are allowed to gamble in casinos. The biggest operators, which include Neptune, Golden Group, Jimei and Dore, account for more than half the monthly junket turnover of $75 billion. Despite robust mass market demand, a crackdown on corruption and pervasive graft has seen the supply of millionaire VIP players to Macau decline over the past year, prompting junkets to seek to diversify their income streams. Suncity, which makes around HK$135 billion ($17 billion) in monthly gaming turnover, according to Choong, has expanded into mining with iron ore operations in Indonesia. It has also branched out into financial services in Hong Kong with 24-hour securities, forex and commodities trading, real estate in China, food and beverage, film and media. The company has two listed arms, Sun International Resources Limited and Sun Century Group Limited. Golden Resorts Group, headed by Hong Kong billionaire Pollyanna Chu, has been invested in financial services through listed arm Kingston Financial Group since 2011. But the trend for larger junkets, flush with cash from the gambling boom over the past decade, to diversify as a hedge against the volatile VIP gaming sector has accelerated over the last year. New Image?

Neptune, which also uses the name Guangdong Group, sponsored a high profile poker tournament this month, while Dore Holdings announced it was buying a majority stake in a Chinese pawn loan business. Macau's junket system was created in the 1970s with the rise of Stanley Ho, an influential local businessman who opened the gaudy egg shaped Casino Lisboa. Ho gave the junkets control of the casinos' VIP rooms, sparking a turf war in the late 1990s as rival gangs fought to dominate. Since the liberalization of Macau's casino market in 2002, which marked the entry of foreign players such as Las Vegas moguls Steve Wynn and Sheldon Adelson, the junket industry has been a subject of scrutiny from U.S. regulators, who allege the operators have ties to organized crime and facilitate illicit money flows. To combat this image, Emilie Tran, a professor at the University of Saint Joseph Macau, says junkets are trying to associate with more wholesome activities, such as organizing community and youth events. Visitors stand opposite a limousine featuring the company logo of Suncity Group outside Macau Galaxy resort in Macau June 23, 2013.Paul YeungWorking for a junket is now seen as respectable and a job like any other, said Tran. The shift to sophisticated corporate entities with sizable business development, accounting and marketing teams is clearly visible. Shabby junket storefronts at the Hong Kong-Macau ferry terminal have been replaced with marble offices in prime business districts, while customized Hummer limousines owned by the operators are frequently seen parked outside Macau's newest casinos. Big Ambitions Politics is the next phase of the junkets' makeover, says Tran, who cites the example of Suncity's Chau, who joined the Guangdong provincial committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), China's parliamentary advisory body, this year. Chau, with his dapper appearance is often likened a famous Hong Kong movie star. An avid tennis player and gym-goer, he is frequently pictured in the local tabloids at parties. Pollyanna Chu of Golden Resorts Group, ranked by Forbes as the 35th richest billionaire in Hong Kong, sits on the CPPCC national committee, while Hoffman Ma, deputy chairman of Success Universe Group sits on the Chongqing Committee of the CPPCC. Manuel Neves, head of Macau's gaming body the DICJ, said junkets diversifying into other industries fitted into the government's attempts to wean the territory, home to 600,000 people, off the gambling industry that accounted for more than 80 percent of government revenues last year. For the government, when people talk about Macau, we want them to not talk about gaming. We are doing a very big effort to push the diversification. It's not an easy task, said Neves. Despite the move to diversify, the role of the junket is likely to remain critical to Macau gaming sector over the coming years, as gambling debts are not legally enforceable in China. Junkets bring in gamblers from the mainland and then find their own ways to collect debts. Suncity is massively expanding its gaming division, doubling its workforce to 1,200 over the past year and is still short staffed. But as major junkets move from operating one or two VIP rooms in Macau's flashy casinos to owning their own properties, Macau's licensed concessionaires Sands, Wynn, MGM, Melco Crown and Galaxy may have to find new ways to lure the customer. I think everybody is fighting for the customer, said Francis Lui, head of Galaxy Entertainment. We are doing the same thing, I am sure the junket would be thinking the same thing. We just have to offer more, a bit extra something new, something more creative to get them to come back again. Editing by Alex Richardson"

Whatever slip-ups or errors (regional branches)...may have committed are limited in number in the midst of mountains of good deeds and successes, said Hossam Abdul Raouf, an Egyptian veteran of the militant group. He said compensation and apologies had been given to unintended victimism but gave no details. Raouf, who served under assassinated leader Osama Bin Laden, said the group was expanding across the world. Al Qaeda faces a challenge to its leadership of the radical Islamist struggle with the West by the Islamic State group, and may be seeking to burnish its credentials as its rival girds for a fight to protect land it has seized in Iraq and Syria. The United States and Arab neighbors pledged to fight IS last week, and American warplanes have pounded its positions in Iraq for over a month. Is 'Caliphate' Islamic State's declaration of a caliphate, or religious state over its lands has not been recognized by al Qaeda, which has produced a series of videos in recent weeks detailing its own activities but shying away from criticizing IS. IS released a video on Saturday night showing the beheading of a British hostage. The U.S. State Department in its annual terrorism report published in April said: As a result of both ongoing worldwide efforts against the organization and senior leadership losses, AQ core's leadership has been degraded, limiting its ability to conduct attacks and direct its followers. The U.S. has repeatedly killed top al Qaeda leaders, including Bin Laden, in the group's haven on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, where its leaders live under the protection of local militants to whom they swear allegiance. Global affiliates of the group, however, have grabbed territory and harassed Western-backed governments in Somalia, Algeria and Yemen - attacking soldiers, bombing government installations and often killing civilians. How then can al Qaeda have shrunken greatly and lost many of its senior leaders at a time when it is expanding horizontally and opening new fronts dependent on it? Raouf said, although he said these groups had often erred. Al Qaeda fell out with IS - whose roots lie in Iraq - in 2013 over its expansion into Syria, where the militants have carried out beheadings, crucifixions, and mass executions. The global group's leader, Ayman al Zawahiri, designated the Nusra Front, another jihadi group which has clashed with IS, its representative in Syria. Counter-terrorism experts say al Qaeda's aging leadership is struggling to compete for recruits with Islamic State, which has galvanized young followers, seized advanced weapons from Iraqi and Syrian forces while accruing a vast store of cash.

Under the deal, the Hungarian state and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) will between them take a stake of up to 30 percent in the local unit of Austria's Erste Bank, hit by levies imposed by Orban's government. Orban said the deal would open a new chapter for banks in Hungary, though it was not clear if the pact could win over all foreign lenders, previously told the government would relent only to come under renewed pressure. The government has signed up to a number of very significant commitments, EBRD President Suma Chakrabarti told a news conference with Orban and Erste chief Andreas Treichl. The deal marks a U-turn, since Orban has for years accused foreign banks of duping borrowers, imposed heavy taxes and levies on them, and vowed to reduce their market share. This was part of a campaign in which he also took on foreign telecoms and retailers, fought the International Monetary Fund and reshaped the Hungarian state, bringing accusations, which he denies, of eroding democracy. But Orban's room for manoeuvre is shrinking. The economy needs investment, while Washington has accused senior Hungarian officials of corruption and cracks are showing in Orban's entourage. Monday's deal involves Hungary reducing the amount raised from its windfall tax on banks, which has raised about 2.5 billion euros since 2010, by about 60 billion forints ($221 million) in 2016. After that Hungary will strive to reduce the tax to the level usually applied in Europe, Orban said. The government also softened its stated objective of increasing Hungarian ownership of the banking sector to 60 percent, which could have meant at least some big foreign lenders selling up. The EBRD said Budapest agreed it does not intend to take direct or indirect majority stakes in systemically important local banks. The state has bought two banks but the deal states it would sell its holdings within three years. Bank shares rose on the Budapest bourse, with local lender OTP up 5 percent in late trade. Hungary's top banks also include Austria's Raiffeisen, Italy's Intesa SanPaolo and UniCredit, and Belgium's KBC. Erste said it had had difficult years in Hungary but wanted to focus on the future. It pledged to boost lending by over 550 million euros in the next three years.

Banks fell by as much as 1.2 percent in morning trade, led by those with significant exposure to the euro zone, such as Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds. But they staged a partial recovery to trade down just 0.2 percent after news of the Greek deal. With the European Union setting Cyprus a deadline of Monday to raise the billions of euros it needs to secure a bailout, traders were wary of piling in to any rally. The spin-off is a positive, but we do need to see more done. Traders are still on tenterhooks at the moment, and until we get a final resolution in Cyprus it will be quite jittery, Manoj Ladwa, head of trading at TJM Markets, said. However, you would have thought that with the week we've had investors would have sold off a bit more, so the market is proving resilient. At 1148 GMT, the FTSE 100 index was up 21.16 points, or 0.3 percent at 6,409.71 points, returning above its 30-day moving average. Trade was light, however, with just 30 percent of the 90-day average volume traded in the morning, which is usually the busiest period. Moreover, the index still looked set to snap a 5-week winning streak despite the session's gain. Three heavyweight risers accounted for the vast majority of the FTSE 100's gains. BP rose 2.6 percent, adding 8.8 points to the index, after announcing an $8 billion share buy-back programme to reward investors after it sold its stake in its Russian unit TNK-BP. The buyback of $8 billion of shares in BP has seen them up since the open, and when they're up, with the banks holding up too, that tends to hold the FTSE itself up as well, said Mark Foulds, trader at ETX Capital. AstraZeneca advanced 2.3 percent as new CEO Pascal Soriot received favourable reviews from analysts after a marathon eight-hour strategy update, and BT led the index with a 3.6 percent gain after a target price hike from Nomura. The two stocks combined to add over 6 points to the FTSE 100. Topping the fallers was Burberry, which fell 3.6 percent after peer Mulberry issued a profit warning, fuelling fears of a drop in spending among affluent tourists.     (Editing by Ruth Pitchford)"
"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-energy-hydropower-idUSKCN11H0SD","Exclusive: Hungry for power, Myanmar bets on hydro in new energy plan","","September 11, 2016 /  11:25 PM / a year ago","","YANGON (Reuters) - Electricity-starved Myanmar is looking to overhaul its long-term power strategy, aiming to hike the planned share of hydropower in its energy mix at the cost of polluting coal as it tries to attract foreign investment. The new democratically-elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi has made job creation one of its top priorities in what is Asia's sixth-poorest country. However, with half of its people without access to electricity and major cities experiencing blackouts, finding investors is tough. Even tougher is getting them to back coal-fired plants given environmental concerns. Myanmar's initial plan was to boost coal's share to a third by the end of the next decade from just 3 percent now and to slash the contribution of hydro to 38 percent from 63 percent, according to the plan shown to Reuters by officials at the Ministry of Electricity and Energy. But most people are reluctant to implement coal-fired power plants, that's why we won't be able to implement the planned coal power plant projects, said Aung Ko Ko, director of hydro and renewable energy planning branch at the ministry. Hopefully hydropower will be the majority in the new plan, he said, estimating its share at 50-55 percent by 2030-31. Imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) could make up for some of the drop in coal use, Aung Ko Ko added. Nine key ministries, including energy, industry and mining, have met in the capital of Naypyitaw to coordinate their energy strategy with the aim to have a draft master plan ready by the end of the month, and under scrutiny are 49 hydropower projects approved by the previous government. Myanmar is reviewing these to see how quickly - if at all -they can be completed, how many more would be needed and how to secure funds, as it seeks to boost its power capacity to make the most of an unprecedented economic revival after 49 years of military rule that ended in 2011 and to sustain an economic growth rate of about 8 percent - one of the world's fastest. The new government realizes these projects should be prioritized. She (Suu Kyi) allowed us to talk with potential international lending facilities like the ADB, a senior official at the department of hydropower implementation of the Ministry of Electricity and Energy said, referring to the Japan and U.S.-led Asia Development Bank. Several dams and power plants in Myanmar have until 2011 been financed by China and, while the West has since shown eagerness to provide financing for electricity projects in the country in a bid to increase its influence there, experts say shifting away from Beijing will not be easy. List of 49 A view shows Ban Sob Moei, a Thai village located at the confluence of Moei and Salween rivers, which is threatened by the planned Hatgyi dam in Myanmar, November 16, 2014.Thin Lei Win/File PhotoOf the projects under review, some 31 include Chinese investment and involve 11 Chinese companies. It lists names such as Beijing-based conglomerate Hanergy Holding Group Ltd and state-owned CPI Yunnan International Power Investment Co that is behind the controversial $3.6-billion Myitsone megadam project. The 2011 cancellation of the Myitsone remains a sore point between the two countries. Myanmar suspended the project citing environmental worries, but the decision was also seen as an attempt to distance itself from Beijing, an uncertainty that has stymied subsequent investment decisions. China has been asking to restart Myitsone, and finding a solution is crucial for Suu Kyi as she needs China's help in talks with ethnic minority armed groups, many of whom operate on the border between the two countries. A resolution could also help unlock more Chinese funds. In my opinion, the developers of these projects (on the list) cannot get loans from Chinese banks because of the problems with Myitsone, said the energy ministry official at the department of hydropower implementation. Five projects on the list that are sponsored from Myanmar's budget have faced delays because the country does not have enough money to finance them, the official said. Seven others are being built by local firms. The rest will need to be financed by cooperation with foreign investors. For some of the long-stalled hydropower projects, Myanmar may open fresh tenders and seek loans from international lending facilities, the official said, adding that the World Bank and ADB, among others, were interested in supporting electricity and energy projects in the country. The private-sector lending arm of the World Bank, the International Finance Corporation (IFC), is reluctant to finance coal projects because of environmental concerns, said Vikram Kumar, who heads the IFC's operation in Myanmar. As of now, power consumption in Myanmar is one of the lowest in the world. Its per capita use averaged 164 kilowatt hour in 2013, according to the World Bank, the 11th lowest in the world and roughly on par with Sudan and Togo. We need investment from abroad ... so many factors, so many risks, so many transactional challenges faced by the foreign investor - JICA (Japan International Cooperation Agency), IFC, World Bank and ADB have asked the government how to optimize and overcome these challenges, said Aung Ko Ko. But the government is very new and they need time to optimize the power sector development.  Additional reporting by Yimou Lee and Aung Hla Tun; Editing by Himani Sarkar"

Haftar's forces met little resistance as they seized the terminals at Ras Lanuf, Es Sider, Zueitina and Brega in an operation launched on Sunday, displacing a rival armed faction aligned with the U.N.-backed Government of National Accord (GNA) in Tripoli. The advance is the latest power struggle over the OPEC nation's energy assets, after the 2011 fall of Muammar Gaddafi and the chaos that followed left the North African country splintered into competing rival armed factions. Haftar opposes the Tripoli government and has resisted its attempts to integrate his self-styled Libyan National Army (LNA) into unified armed forces. His seizure of the ports risks a response from powerful western brigades allied with the government and a deepening of regional divisions. But Tripoli may seek a deal with Haftar - similar to the agreement it struck with the armed faction he has displaced - to restart the oil exports it needs to stave off a financial crisis that could paralyse government operations. Conflict and political disputes have reduced Libya's oil output and exports to a fraction of the level seen before an uprising toppled late dictator Gaddafi five years ago. In a statement signalling a willingness to get oil flowing, Haftar's LNA said late on Sunday it would secure the ports to return operational responsibility to the National Oil Corporation with a guarantee of non-interference by armed forces in operational activities and exports. Just a year ago, Libya had two rival governments, one in Tripoli and one in the east, each backed by competing factions of armed brigades and laying claims to the country's oil resources. A unity deal brokered by the United Nations, signed by rival factions in December despite opposition from hardliners, was meant to end the divide. As a result of the agreement, the GNA arrived in Tripoli in March, backed by Western powers to stabilise a country where lawlessness allowed Islamist militants and migrant smugglers to operate across swathes of territory. Since then, however, some political and tribal leaders in the east have withheld their support, worried that the new government is a vehicle for opponents in the west. The LNA has strengthened its position, making military gains in and around Benghazi against Islamist-led opponents before taking control of the ports. 'Swift Lightning' Many people in Tripoli and western Libya criticise Haftar as a new dictator in the making, but he has become a political figurehead for many in the east who feel abandoned by the capital. In seizing the ports, the LNA displaced units of Libya's Petrol Facilities Guard (PFG) led by Ibrahim Jathran, which struck a deal with the GNA in July to end its three-year blockade of the Ras Lanuf, Es Sider and Zueitina terminals. The LNA took Ras Lanuf and Es Sider, Libya's biggest export terminals, in a dawn operation on Sunday it dubbed Swift Lightning. Clashes broke out in Zueitina, but the LNA said overnight that it had secured that port as well as confirming its control of a fourth port, Brega. Residents in Zueitina and Brega told Reuters that LNA forces were in control on Monday. A commander allied to the LNA said an attempted counter-attack at Ras Lanuf by Jathran loyalists had been blocked on Monday. Jathran had lost much local support after switching allegiances to the GNA; there were few casualties during the port seizures as many of his men appeared to have responded to a call from eastern tribal leaders to hand over control peacefully. Haftar's forces could face a renewed backlash from Islamist-leaning groups in the east as result of the raids, but they have suffered heavy losses in previous battles with the LNA. His opponents in the western city of Misrata could prove the bigger threat. Misratan forces are close to finishing a four-month campaign to oust Islamic State from its former North African stronghold of Sirte. But the campaign has been costly, and Misrata also has to sustain a military presence in several other parts of the west, including Tripoli, where it has provided support for the GNA. Eastern Factions If the LNA retains military control over the terminals, eastern factions it is allied with could make a fresh attempt to export oil independently from the National Oil Company (NOC) in Tripoli. But previous efforts to do this through the NOC office in Benghazi and funnel money to an eastern branch of Libya's central bank have been blocked by international opposition. Claudia Gazzini, a Libya expert at International Crisis Group, said it was in Haftar's interests to have a working relationship with the NOC. I think this is what he's aiming for - to be the one who reopens the terminals, Gazzini said.

Haftar's forces met little resistance as they seized the terminals at Ras Lanuf, Es Sider, Zueitina and Brega in an operation launched on Sunday, displacing a rival armed faction aligned with the U.N.-backed Government of National Accord (GNA) in Tripoli. The advance is the latest power struggle over the OPEC nation's energy assets, after the 2011 fall of Muammar Gaddafi and the chaos that followed left the North African country splintered into competing rival armed factions. Haftar opposes the Tripoli government and has resisted its attempts to integrate his self-styled Libyan National Army (LNA) into unified armed forces. His seizure of the ports risks a response from powerful western brigades allied with the government and a deepening of regional divisions. But Tripoli may seek a deal with Haftar - similar to the agreement it struck with the armed faction he has displaced - to restart the oil exports it needs to stave off a financial crisis that could paralyse government operations. Conflict and political disputes have reduced Libya's oil output and exports to a fraction of the level seen before an uprising toppled late dictator Gaddafi five years ago. In a statement signalling a willingness to get oil flowing, Haftar's LNA said late on Sunday it would secure the ports to return operational responsibility to the National Oil Corporation with a guarantee of non-interference by armed forces in operational activities and exports. Just a year ago, Libya had two rival governments, one in Tripoli and one in the east, each backed by competing factions of armed brigades and laying claims to the country's oil resources. A unity deal brokered by the United Nations, signed by rival factions in December despite opposition from hardliners, was meant to end the divide. As a result of the agreement, the GNA arrived in Tripoli in March, backed by Western powers to stabilise a country where lawlessness allowed Islamist militants and migrant smugglers to operate across swathes of territory. Since then, however, some political and tribal leaders in the east have withheld their support, worried that the new government is a vehicle for opponents in the west. The LNA has strengthened its position, making military gains in and around Benghazi against Islamist-led opponents before taking control of the ports. 'Swift Lightning' Many people in Tripoli and western Libya criticise Haftar as a new dictator in the making, but he has become a political figurehead for many in the east who feel abandoned by the capital. In seizing the ports, the LNA displaced units of Libya's Petrol Facilities Guard (PFG) led by Ibrahim Jathran, which struck a deal with the GNA in July to end its three-year blockade of the Ras Lanuf, Es Sider and Zueitina terminals. The LNA took Ras Lanuf and Es Sider, Libya's biggest export terminals, in a dawn operation on Sunday it dubbed Swift Lightning. Clashes broke out in Zueitina, but the LNA said overnight that it had secured that port as well as confirming its control of a fourth port, Brega. Residents in Zueitina and Brega told Reuters that LNA forces were in control on Monday. A commander allied to the LNA said an attempted counter-attack at Ras Lanuf by Jathran loyalists had been blocked on Monday. Jathran had lost much local support after switching allegiances to the GNA; there were few casualties during the port seizures as many of his men appeared to have responded to a call from eastern tribal leaders to hand over control peacefully. Haftar's forces could face a renewed backlash from Islamist-leaning groups in the east as result of the raids, but they have suffered heavy losses in previous battles with the LNA. His opponents in the western city of Misrata could prove the bigger threat. Misratan forces are close to finishing a four-month campaign to oust Islamic State from its former North African stronghold of Sirte. But the campaign has been costly, and Misrata also has to sustain a military presence in several other parts of the west, including Tripoli, where it has provided support for the GNA. Eastern Factions If the LNA retains military control over the terminals, eastern factions it is allied with could make a fresh attempt to export oil independently from the National Oil Company (NOC) in Tripoli. But previous efforts to do this through the NOC office in Benghazi and funnel money to an eastern branch of Libya's central bank have been blocked by international opposition. Claudia Gazzini, a Libya expert at International Crisis Group, said it was in Haftar's interests to have a working relationship with the NOC. I think this is what he's aiming for - to be the one who reopens the terminals, Gazzini said. The unexpected outcome is that the terminals could open earlier than expected if there's no military counter attack.

Nigeria The Nigerian naira could slide to a record low when the new open-market foreign currency trading announced by the central bank starts on Monday, traders said. The central bank said on Wednesday it would abandon its 16-month fixed exchange rate policy. We are expecting an initial wide depreciation of the naira at the official window, but the rate could stabilise at around the present black market rate of 370 depending on how much dollars the central bank will be willing to push into the market, said a senior trader. Kenya The Kenyan shilling is expected to ease slightly due to dollar demand from the energy sector, traders said. At 0915 GMT, commercial banks quoted the shilling at 101.15/25, compared with last Thursday's close of 101.10/20. Appetite for dollars has picked up, but slightly. There's (demand from) the energy sector. We have seen it in the last few days, a trader at one commercial bank said. Zambia The Zambian kwacha is likely to remain under pressure against the dollar due to a limited inflow of hard currency into Africa's second-largest copper producer. At 0907 GMT, commercial banks quoted the kwacha at 10.8900 per dollar, weaker than a close of 10.7000 per dollar a week ago. Momentum remains to the upside as dollars in the market remain scarce, the Zambian branch of South Africa's First National Bank (FNB) said in a note. Ghana Ghana's cedi could rally against the dollar as corporate demand for dollars declines, while regular central bank sales continue, an analyst said. The local unit, which had been under pressure this month mainly due to repatriation of dollars by international companies, began to regroup this week. It was trading at 3.88 to the dollar at 1130 GMT, up from 3.9275 last week, according to Reuters data. The cedi is likely to continue its rally as demand remains weak and traders and institutions are given little or no reason to buy and hold the dollar, analyst Joseph Biggles Amponsah said. Uganda The Ugandan shilling is likely to strengthen, lifted by a central bank mop up of 657 billion shillings  ($196.47 million) worth of excess liquidity and subdued appetite for hard currency from firms. At 0930 GMT, commercial banks quoted the shilling at 3,344/3,354, little changed from last Wednesday's close of 3,340/3,350. Last Thursday was a national holiday in Uganda and markets were closed. The one week repo and also low interest in the dollar should help give (the shilling) considerable support, said a trader at a leading commercial bank. Tanzania The Tanzanian shilling is expected to trade in a stable range or appreciate marginally in the days ahead, underpinned by a slowdown in demand for U.S. dollars. Commercial banks quoted the shilling at 2,188/2,198 to the dollar on Thursday, weaker than 2,187/2,197 a week ago. We expect to see some demand for the shilling as we approach the end of the month because of the end of the current government fiscal year, said William Francis, a dealer at Commercial Bank of Africa Tanzania.

The investment will help Bank of Ayudhya, controlled by Japan's Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), to maintain its leading position in consumer finance and gain more share in mortgage lending, President and Chief Executive Officer, Noriaki Goto, told reporters. Bank of Ayudhya is one of the few Thai banks that have announced aggressive expansion plans as lenders are more cautious about investment due to weak domestic consumption and slower-than-expected economic growth. The bank would invest 2-3 billion baht per year on information technology upgrades and open 100 new branches, spending 8-10 million baht per new branch, Goto said. That will take its total number of branches to 755, closer to the top four Thai banks' average of 1,200 branches, he said. We have aspiration to be a top tier financial group in Thailand, Goto said during his first press conference after the integration with MUFG was completed in January. Its closest rival, fourth-ranked Kasikornbank, had 1,124 branches at end-2014. With assets of 1.6 trillion baht, Bank of Ayudhya is the market leader in the personal loan and credit card businesses with a share of 27 percent and 15 percent, respectively. Retail loans account for 40 percent of its total assets, with 60 percent from corporates and small and medium-sized business. Bank of Ayudhya, 76.88 percent owned by MUFG, is also looking for opportunities to expand into auto and consumer lending businesses in Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam as part of its three-year business expansion, he said. The bank maintained its 2015 loan growth target of 7-9 percent, despite a slight decline in retail lending in the first quarter, and will monitor an increase in non-performing loans to control bad debts, he said. It's a challenging target. But we have seen some opportunity, Goto said, adding that the partnership with MUFG would help it to broaden its customer base to include large companies.

Making smart credit decisions is critical now as the auto lending business heats up. U.S. consumers have $1 trillion of automobile loans outstanding, up from about $700 billion in the first quarter of 2010, according to data from the New York Federal Reserve. That represents much steeper growth than credit card loans, which have remained essentially flat. The fourth-largest U.S. bank has 56 branches for car and dealer financing, including one it recently opened in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, said Dawn Martin Harp, head of dealer services. The branches, called regional business centers serve car dealers exclusively. The bank is planning to add more offices, including one in the Southwest by the end of the year, but has no specific number that it is targeting, Martin Harp said. The branches are not just sales offices. They include credit officers who approve or deny loans. Having credit officers who are in the regions where they are lending ensures that they know their customers better, Martin Harp said. It's a differentiator for us, she said. She added that the pace of growth depends on opportunities in different communities and in the overall car loan market. With the market's growth in recent years, regulators and bankers have grown concerned about risk in the sector. Wells Fargo's Chief Executive John Shrewsberry said on the bank's first-quarter earnings call in April that auto lending has gotten to be a more competitive market, adding, we've picked our spots, I think, a little bit more delicately. On the second-quarter call in July, he said the sector is nonetheless providing a big opportunity because so many cars are being sold. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, one of the major U.S. banking regulators, said in a report earlier this year that it is closely watching auto lending, noting that extended rapid growth is difficult to maintain and can sometimes mask early signs of weakening credit quality. Wells is taking a different tack from competitors including Ally Financial Inc and JPMorgan Chase & Co, which have centralized their auto lending operations to cut costs.

Seibu applied earlier this month to relist its shares on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, sources have told Reuters. The offering could be worth more than $1 billion, making it one of the biggest in Japan this year. The two sides were locked in a bitter public feud last year, when Cerberus, unhappy with management and its plan to go public at a price the fund felt undervalued the company, failed in an attempt to take control of Seibu's board. While Seibu does not technically need Cerberus' blessing to press on with an IPO, a lack of cooperation would likely make the offering difficult. Hiring the executives, who would be involved in operations but not sit on the board, would signal to investors that Seibu was willing to work with the fund in an effort to improve performance, the people said. The thawing in relations is the result of negotiations between Seibu President Takashi Goto and Cerberus founder Stephen Feinberg over the last month, the people said. They declined to be identified because the discussions are not public. Seibu was delisted in 2004 in the wake of a disclosure scandal and Cerberus led its bailout with a $1 billion-plus investment. The U.S. fund currently owns 35.48 percent of Seibu and has one representative on the company's board. The fund has not yet agreed to sell into the IPO, the people said. Sources have previously told Reuters that Cerberus  could sell a stake of up to 20 percent, depending on the price. It paid 1,400 yen per share in a public tender offer last year but now believes the share price is worth 2,000 yen or more, the sources said, implying a market value of 684 billion yen ($6.7 billion). A Seibu spokesman said nothing had been decided on potential hires, and declined to comment on its listing plans. Cerberus also declined to comment. Test Case The relationship between the two has been viewed as a key test case of Japan's openness to foreign capital and the opportunities for investors to influence management. Seibu has been eager to go public quickly to fulfil a pledge to return to the market after its delisting and give its shareholders an opportunity to cash out of their investment. But Cerberus has pushed for governance and strategic changes first in the hopes of raising the value of Seibu's businesses, which include a large railway network in Japan, a vast property portfolio, and Prince brand hotels and resorts. The handful of hires now under consideration include some executives who left last year as well as some new ones to offer expertise in its core businesses, the people said. The list of candidates includes Stan Brown, 54, who was effectively ousted last year when Seibu did not put him up for reelection as a member of its hotel division board. Brown, a former Marriott executive, was also on the Cerberus slate of directors rejected by Seibu Holdings shareholders in June. Brown could not be reached for comment. Cerberus will be making some changes to its Asian and Japanese operations. Louis Forster, a 15-year Cerberus veteran who was often the public face for the fund in its dispute with Seibu, is retiring as senior managing director and as chairman of Cerberus Asia Pacific Advisors Ltd, though he will stay on as an adviser.

In a keynote speech to a selected audience of businessmen and members of his ruling Fidesz party, Orban said his reforms were irreversible and had laid the foundations for a new Hungary. We have stood and will stand for Hungary and Hungarians, in  a determined and unshakeable way, but always reasonably. We are ready to fight if needed, but also to agree in the interest of the country, he said. His conservative government faces vital aid talks with the European Union and IMF that Hungary needs to avert a market crisis and potential insolvency. Hungary wants an international credit line of 15 to 20 billion euros to rebuild market confidence before it has to borrow nearly 5 billion euros, on top of regular forint-debt refinancing, to pay back bondholders and an earlier IMF/EU loan package this year. Orban is struggling to repair tattered ties with the EU so it can secure the creditline, after his government was sharply criticised for reforms that critics say threaten the independence of the media, the judiciary and the central bank. The changes, rammed through parliament with Fidesz' huge parliamentary majority, came on top of unorthodox economic policies which have repeatedly unnerved investors over the past two years. Under pressure from a plunging forint currency and Brussels, Orban backed down in January and pledged to change some of the laws passed late last year. That represented a political defeat for the prime minister, whose Fidesz party has seen its public support decline sharply, even though it remains the strongest political force in the central European country of 10 million. Economic Woes The European Commission gave Orban until Feb. 17 to address concerns over new laws or face legal action and the risk of more delay in aid talks. He referred to the need for the agreement with the IMF, it was clear from his speech in several points that he would like to reach a deal, said Zoltan Kiszelly, a political analyst. Kiszelly said Orban also sent a clear message to the middle class, which is Fidesz' core voter base and also to undecided voters who account for more than half of the population, by defending the flat rate 16 percent income tax. Orban says the flat tax encourages people to work and pay their taxes, while critics say it favours the rich and put a huge hole in the budget while it has not helped the economy. Late last month Orban said he would bring a new law on the central bank in line with EU demands on nearly all contested points, prompting a big rally in Hungarian markets and pushing the forint close to a four-month high. But after a string of ratings downgrades to junk status, yields on Hungarian debt are still stuck above 8 percent. In his speech Orban also pledged fiscal discipline as Hungary targets a budget deficit of 2.5 percent this year. A sharp economic slowdown could jeopardise this goal, however. With the economy stagnating, many ordinary Hungarians are already feeling the pinch of austerity previously pushed through. But the IMF likely to seek further spending cuts under a new funding deal, leaving Orban with a political dilemma. In neighbouring Romania, Prime Minister Emil Boc resigned on Monday after protests against austerity measures taken under a similar International Monetary Fund-led aid deal. Some voters were fatalistic about the government's room for manoeuvre. He (Orban) can say what he wants, the important things are decided in Brussels anyway. We fought this freedom fight so fiercely we now find that the EU and the IMF dictates to us again, Marcell Koves, 23, a student, said. Carpenter Jozsef Gyore, 32, said he was worried by the economic slowdown, especially in the construction sector which has seen a 40 percent plunge in orders since November 2010. They should do something, especially with the construction sector. (Despite) all these great reforms the economy is yet to get back on track, he said."

BNP and its rival Societe Generale are cutting costs in their branch networks, where a stagnant economy and consumer belt-tightening have hit revenues and raised the likelihood of branch closures. Although France's biggest bank already offers online banking for its regular retail customers, the new project will be entirely digital, the sources said. French daily Les Echos, which reported the plan on Wednesday, said the new brand might be called Hello Bank. The project has a target of 25,000 customers by the end of 2013, one of the union sources said. 25,000 clients by the end of this year and 500,000 in five years, he said, citing discussions held with BNP's management. This is what we have been told. A BNP spokeswoman declined to comment.

Daiwa Securities Group and the Tokyo Stock Exchange signed an agreement in May 2012 to help set up the exchange after Myanmar started to open up the previous year following almost half a century of military rule. Necessary arrangements have been well under way to open a stock market with a few qualified public companies in Yangon in October 2015, Deputy Finance Minister Maung Maung Thein, who chairs the exchange's preparation committee, told Reuters. He said half a dozen companies would be listed in the early stages, including Myanma Agro-business Public Co (MAPCO) and Asia Green Development Bank (AGDB). Now Daiwa Institute of Research from Japan is helping them prepare systematically for listing after signing agreements with these companies, while a few more public companies including Myanmar Thilawa SEZ Holdings Public Ltd are expected to follow suit soon, he added. The Thilawa economic zone outside Yangon is still being developed. An industrial estate is expected to open in mid-2015 and the zone should eventually have a port, a power plant and waste water treatment plants. AGDB opened its first branch in August 2010 in the capital, Naypyitaw, and it now has 48 around the country, according to its website. Ye Min Aung, managing director of MAPCO, confirmed his company's interest in listing. Daiwa is now helping us to be in line with the standards and practices of international public companies, he said. The new stock exchange will be located in a former central bank building on the corner of Merchant Street and Sule Pagoda Road in the centre of Yangon.

Leasing companies, car parks and technology companies are among the markets opening up to the business, Rolf Bulander said in an interview on the eve of the Frankfurt car show. Bosch's expertise in sensors in particular is helping the company to expand beyond is core business of providing components such as spark plugs to combustion engines, he said. Thanks to onboard sensors, vehicles can detect a free parking space and cars can report the position and size of the gap, Bulander said, adding networked vehicles opened the door to a parking space management business and other services. By the end of the year, Bosch will have 200,000 networked cars offering new kinds of services to client groups such as leasing companies. The companies can monitor the distance driven and set up an early appointment with a garage if parts are suffering from wear and tear, Bulander said. Bosch already expects sales of radar and video sensors -- used in driver assistance systems such as emergency braking and sophisticated cruise control -- to double this year. Annual sales of automated driving assistance systems will reach 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) by 2016, Bosch said. The emergence of electric cars has also created new opportunities. The increased availability of electric powertrains in the market is definitely advantageous and makes it easier for new players to enter the market, Bulander said. For us, new market entrants are customers just like established carmakers. Two examples, we supply Tesla with driver assistance systems and provided Google with important components for its vehicles such as the electric powertrain, steering and sensors. In 2025, Bosch expects 125 million cars to be produced, of which 8 million will be electric cars, 8.3 million plug-in hybrids and more than 5 million hybrid vehicles. Battery technology is critical for the breakthrough. We expect battery costs to halve by 2020 and for the energy density to double. That would be double the range at half the price, Bulander said. If this technological breakthrough is achieved, we will think about manufacturing battery cells, he said, adding it would take two or three years before a decision was reached. Asked where Bosch would locate battery production, Bulander said it would be close to the demand. Battery cells are subject to special rules on transportation. You can't just send a battery like you could a piece of steel. Keeping a short distance to the customer will be decisive.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-ftz-idUSBRE98S02K20130929","China opens new trade zone in Shanghai, reform plans unveiled","","September 29, 2013 /  7:32 AM / in 4 years","","SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China opened a new free trade zone in Shanghai on Sunday in what has been hailed as potentially the boldest reform in decades, and gave fresh details on plans to liberalize regulations governing finance, investment and trade in the area. Officials gave no details on when specific initiatives will be implemented but the government has said most will be introduced in the next three years. The Shanghai FTZ, which covers an area of nearly 29 sq km on the eastern outskirts of the commercial hub, was approved by China's State Council, or cabinet, in July. State-run Xinhua news agency quoted Commerce Minister Gao Hucheng as saying that the creation of the FTZ was a crucial decision for China's next wave of reform and opening-up. It follows the trend of global economic developments and reflects a more active strategy of opening-up, Gao said at the launch ceremony. The State Council said on Friday it would open up its largely sheltered services sector to foreign competition in the zone and use it as a test bed for bold financial reforms, including a convertible yuan and liberalized interest rates. Economists consider both areas key levers for restructuring the world's second-largest economy and putting it on a more sustainable growth path. Some Chinese and foreign firms are already setting up subsidiaries in the zone. A total of 25 companies so far have been approved to start operations in a variety of sectors, alongside 11 financial institutions, most of which are domestic banks but including the mainland subsidiaries of Citibank and DBS. Ralph Haupter, corporate vice president of Microsoft Corp, speaking on the sidelines of the opening ceremony, said Microsoft was excited about the zone's potential. Details and sizes of business are hard to predict at this stage. But business is continuously growing and the entertainment business is very important for us at Microsoft. A Xinhua report quoted a document from China's Ministry of Culture saying the ministry would remove a 13-year old ban on video game console manufacture and sale for companies registered in the zone, provided the products were approved. Foreign game machine manufacturers will be eligible to sell their products in China, merely via their entities registered in the zone, the report said. High Hopes, or Not? Some have compared the FTZ, which integrates three existing zones, to Deng Xiaoping's creation of a similar zone in Shenzhen in 1978 which was crucial to China's economy opening up to foreign trade and investment. Optimism among mainland investors that the zone will trigger fresh investment and infrastructure spending has sent property prices and FTZ-related stocks soaring in recent weeks. Skeptics point to a similar scheme launched last year near Shenzhen, in Qianhai, that so far has failed to meet expectations. But analysts and economists say that the Shanghai plan is more ambitious and specific, such as in regulations on how foreign and Chinese individuals can invest across borders. Foreign and Chinese investors have only been allowed to invest cross-border by buying into funds regulated through either the Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (QFII) program or the Qualified Domestic Institutional Investor (QDII) program, both of which are restricted by quotas. But Dai Haibo, deputy director of the zone administrative committee, said on Sunday foreigners and Chinese in the zone would be allowed to invest funds directly for the first time. He did not say whether they would also be subject to a quota. Shanghai Municipality Communist Party Secretary Han Zheng inaugurates the Shanghai Free Trade Zone during a ceremony in Pudong district, Shanghai September 29, 2013.Carlos BarriaHe also said that foreign banks in the zone would be allowed to issue bonds in the domestic market. Officials said China would develop an international oil futures trading platform in the zone and encourage foreign participation, part of attempts to upgrade commodities markets and hedge risk in the world's largest energy consumer. The insurance regulator added on Sunday that it would support allowing foreign health insurance providers to operate in the zone and would also back the development of yuan-denominated cross-border reinsurance, among other reforms. Regulatory Requirements for Foreign Banks Regulations of Chinese and foreign banks will also be eased, said Liao Min, head of the Shanghai branch of the China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC), adding the CBRC will adjust loan-to-deposit ratios and other regulatory requirements related to cross-border financing for banks in the zone. Cross-border financing could potentially drastically reduce funding costs for Chinese firms and expose domestic banks to more foreign competition, but would also provide Chinese banks an outlet to find new clients overseas. Slideshow (5 Images)Liao said that the government would consider easing regulatory requirements for foreign banks when they apply to upgrade representative offices to full-fledged branches in the zone, and it would accelerate the application process for foreign banks applying for yuan settlement licenses. Both functions are key for foreign banks seeking to do business in China, and the slow pace of approval has been a subject of frequent complaints from foreign bankers. Given the mixed history of other capital account reform projects and the current speculative environment, regulators have been signaling caution in recent weeks. The project is widely considered to be a pet program of Premier Li Keqiang but he did not attend the opening ceremony. The heads of the central bank and the foreign exchange regulator were also absent. The highest ranking official from the central government was Commerce Minister Gao. State media have run commentaries warning against undue property speculation, and have said that the most dramatic reforms were unlikely to be enacted this year. All reforms to interest rate and exchange rate systems will be based on the premise of risk control, Zhang Xin, head of the Shanghai branch of the People's Bank of China, told a press conference on Sunday. Experts also doubt Beijing will be able to implement major changes in the zone without them spilling over into the rest of the country. Numerous high profile academics and officials have argued publicly against introducing them in this way. There have also been reports of bureaucratic turf wars over which agency will drive financial reform. Liao Qun, China chief economist at Citic Bank International, said the tone of the master planning document remains cautious given the challenges. Liberalization may not be realized all at once. Foreign investors continue to await the publication of a negative list of banned investment targets and industries. In the past foreign investors were put off by vague explanations of what industries could be invested in and what remained off limits. The negative list concept would allow free foreign investment in any industry not specifically on the list. Shanghai government officials told Reuters the list would be published at some point on Sunday. Reuters was unable to find such a list on any major government website at time of reporting.

The largest Islamic bank in the United Arab Emirates will start operating at a time when Kenyan banks have come under closer scrutiny from the regulator because of increasing bad debts, prompting officials and analysts to conclude the sector is ripe for consolidation. Three medium-sized and small banks have been taken over by the regulator since August last year, with the latest, Chase Bank Kenya, taken over earlier this month after a run on deposits. In November the central bank placed a moratorium on the licensing of new commercial banks in an attempt to bring stability to an industry that has more than 40 banks. But DIB had been in talks with the regulator before then, meaning a decision on its licence would not be affected by the moratorium, the sources said. DIB is now awaiting the final go-ahead from Kenya's central bank, said the sources, as it has already been granted outline approval for a commercial banking licence having planned to open in Kenya last year, only to find the process had taken longer than expected. In a statement the central bank said on Monday it was processing an application for a banking licence from DIB Bank Kenya, without elaborating. A separate source at the central bank said DIB was one of a couple of banks expected to start operations in the country this year. No one at DIB responded to a request for comment. DIB has already recruited staff for its Kenyan operation, which will initially comprise three branches offering consumer, corporate and treasury services, the sources said. Kenya will not be DIB's first foray overseas. It holds stakes in banks in Pakistan, Sudan, Jordan, Bosnia and late last year raised its stake in Bank Panin Syariah, the Indonesian sharia-compliant lender, to 39.6 percent, according to a presentation on the bank's website.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bnp-paribas-retail-idUSKCN0ZN0ES","BNP Paribas to outline new retail banking investments next year","","July 7, 2016 /  6:20 AM / a year ago","","PARIS (Reuters) - BNP Paribas will unveil new investments in its retail banking business when it presents a new plan early next year, the head of the unit said as France's biggest bank aims to turn its sprawling European network into a more Internet-driven service. New regulations since the financial crisis, volatile markets and low interest rates have dented banks' profitability, forcing them to step up cost-cutting efforts and revamp retail operations to invest in online and mobile services. We have three, four, five years to carry out (the transformation)... by making investments and by delivering every quarter a qualitative transformation for our clients as part of a plan to be announced, said Thierry Laborde, BNP Paribas' Deputy Chief Operating Officer and Head of Domestic Markets told Reuters. That is the biggest issue. Our profitability depends on it, not vice versa. Following a reduction in retail branches over the last few years, BNP Paribas now plans to increase the share of sales in retail banking that come through digital channels, such as its online bank Hello Bank!, to 50 percent in 2020 versus 15 percent currently. Lenders are trying to come up with alternatives even as they close branches in a bid to bring in customer deposit without a costly bricks-and-mortar branch network which weighs on profitability. We have an integrated model, we offer all kinds of products, and now it's necessary to put them together in order to produce solutions for our clients, Laborde said. BNP Paribas shook up senior management this week at its retail banking and services division, naming Sophie Heller, the former head of retail at Dutch lender ING's ING.AS ING Direct, as chief operating officer. ING Direct is the leading mobile bank in France with more than 1 million clients. Hello Bank!, launched in late 2013, had 257,000 clients in France as of end-March 2016 and 2.5 million clients overall in Germany, Belgium, France, Italy and Austria. Last year Hello Bank! acquired 400,000 new clients in the five countries it operates in and the service should see a similar trend this year, Laborde said, adding that the online bank was profitable. We are going to continue to develop our Hello Bank! model, but we will also transform traditional banking in a very serious way, Laborde said. Banks and insurers are seeing their business models challenged by fintech start-ups and non-bank players such as Apple, which are reshaping what consumers and businesses expect from financial services. We had to open ourselves up ... it means to open up for fintechs, for partnerships with internet giants, with big industrials in our sector, Laborde said. BNP Paribas works in cooperation with French retailer Carrefour on an application which allows customers to pay for purchases with their mobile phones, while combining standard services with the payment options. More retailers could join them, Laborde said. Reporting by Maya Nikolaeva; Editing by Leigh Thomas"

The bank, owned by part-nationalised Royal Bank of Scotland , opened the branches between 0800 GMT and 1100 GMT, having already extended its opening hours on Saturday, drafting in more than 7,000 staff to deal with the crisis. NatWest is battling to get on top of a huge backlog of failed payments after a software upgrade on Tuesday night went wrong, resulting in the bank being unable to process payments for its personal and business customers. In a message to customers published on the bank's website, Chief Executive Stephen Hester apologised for the enormous disruption and inconvenience for millions of our customers as well as for many customers of other banks. I am very sorry for the difficulties people are experiencing. Our customers rely on us day in and day out to get things right, and on this occasion we have let them down badly. This should not have happened. Hester said. Although the software problem was fixed by Friday, NatWest has been unable to say how long it will take for all the outstanding customer issues to be rectified. Hester said the bank's staff were working around the clock to resolve the problems and said affected customers would not lose out financially, raising the possibility that RBS could face hefty compensation claims. I want to be clear that where our customers are facing hardship or difficulty we can and will help them. I also want to reassure customers that no one will be left permanently out of pocket as a result of this and they should contact us directly about this, he said. RBS, 82 percent owned by the government, is already facing a bill of over 1 billion pounds ($1.6 million) to compensate customers for the mis-selling of loan insurance.

Uchumi, Kenya's second-largest retail chain by sales, has 25 stores across east Africa, where fast-expanding economies are creating a growing middle class. It plans to list its shares on the Tanzanian, Ugandan and Rwandan bourses and then offer investors 100 million shares in a rights issue. The company, which already operates some stores in neighbouring Uganda and Tanzania, said it planned to use the cash from the rights issue to pay for expansion in its existing markets and open its first supermarkets in Rwanda and newly-independent South Sudan. In the next one year or so, we plan to open around 13 retail branches across east Africa in a bid to competitively and strategically position our business, and these will also require substantial capital spend, Uchumi Chief Executive Jonathan Ciano said in a statement. The funds will also be used to refurbish some of its stores in Kenya, Ciano told a news conference at one of the chain's stores in the capital Nairobi. The retailer picked Faida Investment Bank as the lead transaction advisor for the rights issue and cross-listing of shares in the neighbouring countries. Kenya is part of an East African Community common market with Rwanda, Burundi, Tanzania and Uganda. Other Kenyan firms such as Kenya Airways have also cross-listed their shares in the regional bourses. Ciano said the cross-listings would take place before the rights issue and required the approval of financial market regulators in those countries.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/china-ftz-idUSL4N0HP0A020130929","UPDATE 3-China opens new trade zone in Shanghai, reform plans unveiled","","September 29, 2013 /  12:35 PM / 4 years ago","","* Restrictions lifted on individual cross-border investment * Loan-to-deposit ratios, other regs on banks to be eased * Intl oil futures trading platform planned * Deeper reforms subject to risk control implementation - c.banker By Gabriel Wildau and Pete Sweeney SHANGHAI, Sept 29 (Reuters) - China opened a new free trade zone in Shanghai on Sunday in what has been hailed as potentially the boldest reform in decades, and gave fresh details on plans to liberalise regulations governing finance, investment and trade in the area. Officials gave no details on when specific initiatives will be implemented but the government has said most will be introduced in the next three years. The Shanghai FTZ, which covers an area of nearly 29 sq km on the eastern outskirts of the commercial hub, was approved by China's State Council, or cabinet, in July. State-run Xinhua news agency quoted Commerce Minister Gao Hucheng as saying that the creation of the FTZ was a crucial decision for China's next wave of reform and opening-up. It follows the trend of global economic developments and reflects a more active strategy of opening-up, Gao said at the launch ceremony. The State Council said on Friday it would open up its largely sheltered services sector to foreign competition in the zone and use it as a test bed for bold financial reforms, including a convertible yuan and liberalised interest rates. Economists consider both areas key levers for restructuring the world's second-largest economy and putting it on a more sustainable growth path. Some Chinese and foreign firms are already setting up subsidiaries in the zone. A total of 25 companies so far have been approved to start operations in a variety of sectors, alongside 11 financial institutions, most of which are domestic banks but including the mainland subsidiaries of Citibank  and DBS. Ralph Haupter, corporate vice president of Microsoft Corp , speaking on the sidelines of the opening ceremony, said Microsoft was excited about the zone's potential. Details and sizes of business are hard to predict at this stage. But business is continuously growing and the entertainment business is very important for us at Microsoft. A Xinhua report quoted a document from China's Ministry of Culture saying the ministry would remove a 13-year old ban on video game console manufacture and sale for companies registered in the zone, provided the products were approved. Foreign game machine manufacturers will be eligible to sell their products in China, merely via their entities registered in the zone, the report said. High Hopes, or Not? Some have compared the FTZ, which integrates three existing zones, to Deng Xiaoping's creation of a similar zone in Shenzhen in 1978 which was crucial to China's economy opening up to foreign trade and investment. Optimism among mainland investors that the zone will trigger fresh investment and infrastructure spending has sent property prices and FTZ-related stocks soaring in recent weeks. Sceptics point to a similar scheme launched last year near Shenzhen, in Qianhai, that so far has failed to meet expectations. But analysts and economists say that the Shanghai plan is more ambitious and specific, such as in regulations on how foreign and Chinese individuals can invest across borders. Foreign and Chinese investors have only been allowed to invest cross-border by buying into funds regulated through either the Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (QFII) programme or the Qualified Domestic Institutional Investor (QDII) programme, both of which are restricted by quotas. But Dai Haibo, deputy director of the zone administrative committee, said on Sunday foreigners and Chinese in the zone would be allowed to invest funds directly for the first time. He did not say whether they would also be subject to a quota. He also said that foreign banks in the zone would be allowed to issue bonds in the domestic market. Officials said China would develop an international oil futures trading platform in the zone and encourage foreign participation, part of attempts to upgrade commodities markets and hedge risk in the world's largest energy consumer. The insurance regulator added on Sunday that it would support allowing foreign health insurance providers to operate in the zone and would also back the development of yuan-denominated cross-border reinsurance, among other reforms. Regulatory Requirements for Foreign Banks Regulations of Chinese and foreign banks will also be eased, said Liao Min, head of the Shanghai branch of the China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC), adding the CBRC will adjust loan-to-deposit ratios and other regulatory requirements related to cross-border financing for banks in the zone. Cross-border financing could potentially drastically reduce funding costs for Chinese firms and expose domestic banks to more foreign competition, but would also provide Chinese banks an outlet to find new clients overseas. Liao said that the government would consider easing regulatory requirements for foreign banks when they apply to upgrade representative offices to full-fledged branches in the zone, and it would accelerate the application process for foreign banks applying for yuan settlement licences. Both functions are key for foreign banks seeking to do business in China, and the slow pace of approval has been a subject of frequent complaints from foreign bankers. Given the mixed history of other capital account reform projects and the current speculative environment, regulators have been signalling caution in recent weeks. The project is widely considered to be a pet programme of Premier Li Keqiang but he did not attend the opening ceremony. The heads of the central bank and the foreign exchange regulator were also absent. The highest ranking official from the central government was Commerce Minister Gao. State media have run commentaries warning against undue property speculation, and have said that the most dramatic reforms were unlikely to be enacted this year. All reforms to interest rate and exchange rate systems will be based on the premise of risk control, Zhang Xin, head of the Shanghai branch of the People's Bank of China, told a press conference on Sunday. Experts also doubt Beijing will be able to implement major changes in the zone without them spilling over into the rest of the country. Numerous high profile academics and officials have argued publicly against introducing them in this way. There have also been reports of bureaucratic turf wars over which agency will drive financial reform. Liao Qun, China chief economist at Citic Bank International, said the tone of the master planning document remains cautious given the challenges. Liberalisation may not be realised all at once. Foreign investors continue to await the publication of a negative list of banned investment targets and industries. In the past foreign investors were put off by vague explanations of what industries could be invested in and what remained off limits. The negative list concept would allow free foreign investment in any industry not specifically on the list. Shanghai government officials told Reuters the list would be published at some point on Sunday. Reuters was unable to find such a list on any major government website at time of reporting."

The move follows a complaint brought by developer Windreich  and is part of a wider clash between the German government spurring offshore wind projects and TenneT, the firm responsible for linking them to the grid. If TenneT was found to have acted negligently, this could trigger high indemnity claims in a civil law case, said a BnetzA spokeswoman, who added that a hearing is scheduled for Sept. 12. TenneT did not respond to requests for comment. Windreich Chairman Willi Balz said his company submitted a complaint because TenneT took no action after it requested a branch line be run from an existing North Sea cable to its Deutsche Bucht wind park. TenneT had operated satisfactorily in providing links to Windreich's MEG1 and Global Tech 1 wind parks, Balz said. TenneT has said it has started preparing links to 5.5 gigawatts (GW) of planned offshore wind capacity involving investment of 6 billion euros but that it lacks the funds to build all the power cables required by Germany's planned offshore wind park expansion. Media have put the funding shortfall at 15 billion euros ($18.48 billion). Last week, a media report said the German government wants Dutch firm TenneT to sell its German unit to investors such as insurance companies to secure the necessary finance, citing sources familiar with the negotiations. TenneT said it was interested in attracting money for the offshore projects but had no plans to sell its German onshore grid. Separately, BnetzA last month submitted a draft on the status of grid operator certifications to the European Commission required under new EU regulations in which it threatened to deny certification to TenneT. The BnetzA spokeswoman said that the authority aimed to raise pressure on TenneT to ensure it fulfils its obligation to provide power connections for new plants. The authority has repeated its call on TenneT to look for financially powerful partners, she said. TenneT and its three peers operating German long-distance grids say the finance crisis makes it hard for them to get loans.

For Stratton, 49, the move into the independent advisory space is a return to his advising roots, where he began his career at a small practice with his father back in the late 1980s. I always kept in touch with what was going on in that environment, Stratton said in an interview. I was always that lone Merrill guy at the conferences for RIAs (registered investment advisers). Stratton left last Friday from Merrill, where he was a resident director managing 45 employees, 35 of which were financial advisers who generated about $17.5 million in annual revenue. Stratton himself produced about $550,000 in annual revenue and managed $75 million in client assets. He opened for business this week in his new office in Overland Park, Kansas, launching his firm with CONCERT Wealth Management, a start-up firm that works with independent advisers. Stratton said he left Merrill due to a number of cultural and structural changes at the firm since Bank of America bought the brokerage three years ago. New management led to restructuring of the firm's branch management system, which eliminated certain non-producing managerial roles, and consolidated offices. Stratton said his new firm has the capacity to add about seven more financial advisers, he said. Stratton's departure comes soon after Reuters reported last week that former complex director Stephen Bearden left Merrill for Morgan Stanley Smith Barney after about 18 years at the firm.

In December, U.S. President Barack Obama said he was seeking to improve diplomatic and commercial relations with Cuba's communist government because years of policies designed to isolate the Caribbean island have failed to achieve change. The White House recently announced it was taking Cuba off the terrorism list by the end of this month and officials from the two countries are due to hold talks on Thursday with both sides saying they had narrowed differences over reopening embassies.     Cuba blamed its unusual bank-less status on the longstanding U.S. economic embargo against the communist island, as well as sanctions resulting from it being included on the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism.  Resulting regulations, and potential fines, make banks reluctant to accept such toxic accounts, experts say.     The Cuban government did not immediately respond to calls for comment on the news, first reported by the cable business channel CNBC.  The public relations firm Kreps DeMaria in Miami, which represents Stonegate, said it had no immediate comment. A bank branch representative told Reuters employees received word on Wednesday about the account, but said she could not discuss any details.  Based in Pompano Beach, Stonegate is a full-service commercial bank with 22 offices in south and west Florida. It has a market value of about $300 million and reported $1.67 billion in assets and $1.41 billion in deposits as of Sept. 30. New York-based M&T; Bank Corp canceled its services with Cuba's Interests Section in Washington in 2013. Havana blamed the move on U.S. sanctions.  M&T;'s decision presented an unusual diplomatic quandary for Cuba and the U.S. just as secret talks to improve relations were underway between the two former Cold War enemies. Cuba briefly ceased almost all consular services in the United States, disrupting Cuba-U.S. travel programs and the issuing of visas and passports for Cubans exiles seeking to visit relatives. Cuba's mission at the United Nations was not affected as its diplomats there are allowed access to a special credit union limited to U.N. business only. Stonegate's outlets across south Florida made it attractive to Cuba because its consular business is concentrated in the area's large Cuban-American exile community, the Florida banking industry source said.

The Shanghai FTZ, which covers an area of nearly 29 sq km on the eastern outskirts of the commercial hub, was approved by China's State Council, or cabinet, in July. State-run Xinhua news agency quoted Commerce Minister Gao Hucheng as saying that the creating FTZ was a crucial decision made in the new era of China's reform and opening-up. It follows the tendency of global economic developments and reflects a more active strategy of opening-up, Gao said at the launch ceremony. The State Council said on Friday it would open up its largely sheltered services sector to foreign competition in the zone and use it as a testbed for bold financial reforms, including a convertible yuan and liberalised interest rates. Economists consider both areas key levers for restructuring the world's second-largest economy and putting it on a more sustainable growth path. Some Chinese and foreign firms have already moved to set up subsidiaries in the zone. A total of 25 companies so far have been approved to set up operations in a variety of sectors, alongside 11 financial institutions, most of which are domestic banks but including the mainland subsidiaries of Citibank and DBS. Some have trumpeted the FTZ, which integrates three existing zones, as comparable to Deng Xiaoping's creation of a similar zone in Shenzhen in 1978. Many credited that move as being crucial to China's economy opening up to foreign trade and investment. High Hopes, or Not? Sceptics, however, point to a similar scheme launched near Shenzhen, in Qianhai, last year, but that has so far failed to live up to expectations. Qianhai was presented as place for radical experimentation with China's capital account. Analysts and economists say that the plans for Shanghai, at least, are more specific and ambitious. For example, one major planned change officials described on Sunday will be in the regulations governing how foreign and Chinese individuals can invest across borders. Previously foreign and Chinese investors were only allowed to invest across the border by buying into funds regulated through either the Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (QFII) programme or the Qualified Domestic Institutional Investor (QDII) programme, both of which are restricted by quotas. But Dai Haibo, deputy director of the zone administrative committee, said on Sunday that this requirement would be waived for foreign and Chinese individuals within the zone, who will be allowed to invest funds directly for the first time. He did not say whether they would also be subject to a quota. He also said that foreign banks in the zone would be allowed to issue bonds in the domestic market. Officials also said that China will develop an international oil futures trading platform in the zone and encourage foreign participation, part of attempts to upgrade commodities markets and hedge risk in the world's largest energy consumer. Regulatory Requirements for Foreign Banks Regulations of Chinese and foreign banks will also be eased, said Liao Min, head of the Shanghai branch of the China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC), adding the CBRC will adjust loan-to-deposit ratios and other regulatory requirements for banks in the zone. He said that the government will consider easing regulatory requirements for foreign banks when they apply to upgrade representative offices to full-fledged branches in the zone, and it will accelerate the application process for foreign banks applying for yuan settlement licences. Both functions are key for foreign banks seeking to do business in China, and the slow pace of approval has been the subject of frequent complaints from foreign bankers. He added that China will allow domestic and foreign banks to engage in cross-border business including cross-border investment banking services."

Alchemist at the court of the Medici, Ruggieri, the story goes, created the ice-cream that Catherine De Medici took to Paris in the 1530s to wow the French. And that's why he ended up in the world's first ever museum of gelato culture and technology which has just opened its doors to local dignitaries and businessmen in the small northern town of Anzola dell'Emilia, near Bologna. Gelato was a symbol of power, used at courts to enhance the prestige of noble families. Ice and salt were key ingredients and were expensive and so only aristocrats could afford it, ice-cream expert Luciana Polliotti said. Polliotti is historical curator at the Carpigiani Gelato Museum, a shiny more than 1,000 square metre space built at a cost of 1.5 million euros to showcase the history of a product that has become a Made in Italy success story the world over. The museum, built by gelato machine maker Carpigiani Group, tracks the history of gelato from the early snow-wells of antiquity, to the ice and salt sherbets developed by the Chinese through to the new technologies of the 1900s. Exhibits include the world's first-written recipe for the shrb, Arabic for sugar syrup, the 'De Sorbetti' treatise on the curative powers of gelato, written by Neapolitan physician Filippo Baldini, and 20 vintage gelato-making machines including the first automatic Cattabriga machine introduced in 1931. But if the gelato has its distant origins in Mesopotamia it was Italy that developed the modern creamier version we serve today on our tables, some time in the 1500s in Florence. And it was another Italian, Francesco Procopio Cuto, who, the museum says, sold the first sorbets to the public in 1686 when he opened Le Procope in Paris - still there today. Since then gelato eating has become much more democratic. Food-producing association Coldiretti estimates Italians will spend 2.5 billion euros on gelati this year with more than 600 flavours to choose from. And visitors to Anzola can taste some of those at the gelato shop outside the museum which serves treats like fig gelato with balsamic drizzle, strawberry and raspberry sorbets from an early 1800 recipe and coffee sorbet first drafted in 1854. Going Global It was Carpigiani that took the gelato business global. Founded in 1945, the company, today part of catering equipment group Ali, has grown to become the world's No. 1 gelato machine maker with branches in 12 countries, sales of 146 million euros and a payroll of over 400. Every day more than 150 million gelati from its machines are eaten worldwide. Like other Made in Italy businesses, the gelato trade has bucked the recessionary trend by focusing on quality and distinguishing itself from the fatter, more industrialised ice-cream. In Bologna one of the few things that has grown in recent years is gelato, said Gabriele Cavina, a Catholic church monsignor speaking at Thursday's museum inauguration as he blessed the building. Italians are deadly serious about their gelato. Walk around any Italian town late afternoon or evening and you'll find plenty of people strolling round with gelatos of every shade and colour. But with one gelato parlour for every 3,000 inhabitants, Italy is now a mature market and 80 percent of Carpigiani's business is now generated abroad with emerging markets in the Middle East and Asia a natural choice. Especially China. Gelato is not really in their culture but for the Chinese it's more a choice of tasting Made in Italy than food as such. I see strong growth there, Carpigiani General Manager Andrea Cocchi told Reuters. To help overseas expansion, Carpigiani also set up a Gelato University in 2003. Sat next to the museum, it is bustling with foreign students who come to the laboratories to learn the ins and outs of gelato making before going back home to set up their own businesses - possibly with a Carpigiani machine. I want to open up my own gelato shop in Manila, said 31-year-old Philippine Lily Agito who is doing a one-month internship at the Univesity. It's been great. They don't spoonfeed you everything so you have to think for yourself. Then there's the Gelato Pioneers. Every year Carpigiani selects a group of highly motivated Italians ready to leave everything to open gelato shops abroad. Besides funding scholarships for the programme, the company also covers half the price of buying a new Carpigiani machine and will buy it back inside a year if the business folds. Andrea Morelli, a 38-year old former bank manager from Bologna, has no regrets. In 2011 I gave up everything and through the programme spent time abroad including Malaysia.

The museum, built by gelato machine maker Carpigiani Group, tracks the history of gelato from the early snow-wells of antiquity, to the ice and salt sherbets developed by the Chinese through to the new technologies of the 1900s. Exhibits include the world's first-written recipe for the shrb, Arabic for sugar syrup, the 'De Sorbetti' treatise on the curative powers of gelato, written by Neapolitan physician Filippo Baldini, and 20 vintage gelato-making machines including the first automatic Cattabriga machine introduced in 1931. But if the gelato has its distant origins in Mesopotamia it was Italy that developed the modern creamier version we serve today on our tables, some time in the 1500s in Florence. And it was another Italian, Francesco Procopio Cuto, who, the museum says, sold the first sorbets to the public in 1686 when he opened Le Procope in Paris - still there today. Since then gelato eating has become much more democratic. Food-producing association Coldiretti estimates Italians will spend 2.5 billion euros on gelati this year with more than 600 flavors to choose from. And visitors to Anzola can taste some of those at the gelato shop outside the museum which serves treats like fig gelato with balsamic drizzle, strawberry and raspberry sorbets from an early 1800 recipe and coffee sorbet first drafted in 1854. Going Global It was Carpigiani that took the gelato business global. Founded in 1945, the company, today part of catering equipment group Ali, has grown to become the world's No. 1 gelato machine maker with branches in 12 countries, sales of 146 million euros and a payroll of over 400. Students work with fresh fruit at the Carpigiani Gelato University in the northern town of Anzola dell'Emilia , near Bologna September 27, 2012.Stefano RellandiniEvery day more than 150 million gelati from its machines are eaten worldwide. Like other Made in Italy businesses, the gelato trade has bucked the recessionary trend by focusing on quality and distinguishing itself from the fatter, more industrialized ice-cream. In Bologna one of the few things that has grown in recent years is gelato, said Gabriele Cavina, a Catholic church monsignor speaking at Thursday's museum inauguration as he blessed the building. Italians are deadly serious about their gelato. Walk around any Italian town late afternoon or evening and you'll find plenty of people strolling round with gelatos of every shade and color. But with one gelato parlor for every 3,000 inhabitants, Italy is now a mature market and 80 percent of Carpigiani's business is now generated abroad with emerging markets in the Middle East and Asia a natural choice. Slideshow (6 Images)Especially China. Gelato is not really in their culture but for the Chinese it's more a choice of tasting Made in Italy than food as such. I see strong growth there, Carpigiani General Manager Andrea Cocchi told Reuters. To help overseas expansion, Carpigiani also set up a Gelato University in 2003. Sat next to the museum, it is bustling with foreign students who come to the laboratories to learn the ins and outs of gelato making before going back home to set up their own businesses - possibly with a Carpigiani machine. I want to open up my own gelato shop in Manila, said 31-year-old Philippine Lily Agito who is doing a one-month internship at the University. It's been great. They don't spoonfeed you everything so you have to think for yourself. Then there's the Gelato Pioneers. Every year Carpigiani selects a group of highly motivated Italians ready to leave everything to open gelato shops abroad. Besides funding scholarships for the program, the company also covers half the price of buying a new Carpigiani machine and will buy it back inside a year if the business folds. Andrea Morelli, a 38-year old former bank manager from Bologna, has no regrets. In 2011 I gave up everything and through the program spent time abroad including Malaysia. I was aiming to open in the U.S. but it could be somewhere else, he said. ($1 = 0.7773 euros) Reporting By Stephen Jewkes, editing by Paul Casciato"

On the summit sidelines, the leaders of Egypt, Turkey and Iran gathered for talks on the Syria crisis. The Iranian foreign minister came out of the meeting expressing optimism about the prospects for a resolution. The head of the Syrian opposition, in Cairo but not at the summit, told BBC Arabic that Iran was making the decisions in Damascus, and gave the Syrian government until Sunday to release women detainees or else his offer of talks would lapse. The summit of the 57-member Organisation of Islamic Cooperation opened on a day when the assassination of a leading Tunisian opposition politician highlighted the fragility of Arab Spring democratic revolutions in North Africa. Tunisian President Moncef Marzouki canceled his trip to the Cairo meeting after Shokri Belaid, a staunch secular opponent of the moderate Islamist government, was shot dead outside his home, triggering street protests. With Mahmoud Ahmadinejad making an ice-breaking visit to Egypt, the first by an Iranian president since the 1979 Islamic revolution, the two-day meeting was focusing on how to stop the bloodshed in Syria, where President Bashar al-Assad counts Tehran as one of his last allies. In a keynote address, Egyptian President Mohamed Mursi called on the ruling regime in Damascus to learn the lessons of history and not put its interests above those of the nation, saying that rulers who did so were inevitably finished. Mursi urged all OIC members to support the Syrian opposition's efforts to unite and bring about change. Heavy fighting erupted in Damascus on Wednesday as rebels launched an offensive against Assad's forces, breaking a lull in the conflict, opposition activists said. Ahmadinejad earlier told Egyptian journalists there could be no military solution and he was encouraged that the Syrian government and opposition were moving towards negotiations to end a conflict in which at least 60,000 people have died. His foreign minister, Ali Akbar Salehi, told Egypt's state news agency he believed the Syrian government was ready to negotiate with the opposition. We are optimistic, he added after the meeting with the leaders of Turkey and Egypt. Offer of Talks In an interview with BBC Arabic on Wednesday, opposition Syrian National Coalition leader Moaz Alkhatib said Iran was the real power in Damascus. Alkhatib had on Sunday offered to meet Assad's ceremonial deputy, Farouq al-Shara, for peace talks if the authorities released thousands of prisoners. Iran's Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi (2nd R) talks with other attendees before the start of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) summit in Cairo February 6, 2013.Asmaa WaguihBut in his interview, he said his proposal for talks with Shara had been rejected. He demanded the release of all women detainees by Sunday, or else his initiative would have been broken, the BBC reported. Underlining the deep regional divisions over the Syria conflict, Saudi Arabia, a key supporter of the Syrian rebels and a member of an Islamic Quartet formed by Mursi last August to try to broker a solution, did not attend the Syria crisis meeting in Cairo, diplomats said. Saudi Crown Prince Salman told the summit the Syrian regime was committing ugly crimes against its people. He said the U.N. Security Council, which has so far been paralyzed by Russian and Chinese opposition to sanctions, should act to finalize the transition of power. A communiqué drafted by OIC foreign ministers and seen by Reuters blames Assad's government for most of the slaughter and urges it to open talks on a political transition. Diplomats said Iran had objected to the wording and it might be toned down to spread responsibility more evenly. Slideshow (9 Images)Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshiyar Zebari said the statement had to be adopted by consensus and would stress the need for dialogue and a political solution. The draft text also urged the opposition to speed up the creation of a transitional government to be ready to assume responsibility in full until the completion of the desired political change process. Without mentioning Assad, it says: We urge the Syrian regime to show wisdom and call for serious dialogue to take place between the national coalition of the Syrian revolution, opposition forces, and representatives of the Syrian government committed to political transformation in Syria and those who have not been directly involved in any form of oppression... Spotlight on Mursi Mursi, a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, sought to project his country as the leader of the Islamic world in his speech, seven months after becoming Egypt's first democratically elected head of state. He told the assembled kings, presidents and prime ministers that the glorious January 25 revolution that toppled Egypt's autocrat Hosni Mubarak in 2011 forms the cornerstone in the launching of this nation to new horizons of progress. Egypt is taking over the OIC chair at a time of upheaval in the Arab world and sectarian tension between the main branches of Islam. Mursi is also grappling with sustained protests at home by liberal and leftist opponents who accuse him of seeking to monopolize power. On Tuesday, he embraced Ahmadinejad and gave him a red-carpet airport welcome, but his foreign minister hastened to assure Gulf Arab states that Egypt would not sacrifice their security in opening to Tehran. Syria was not present at the Islamic summit after being suspended from the OIC last August. The Syrian opposition said it had not received an invitation and would not be attending.

Fortunately in Syria at the moment matters between the two parties - the opposition and the government - are heading towards establishing the idea of dialogue and talking together, al-Ahram daily quoted him as saying. Opposition Syrian National Coalition leader Moaz Alkhatib offered on Sunday to meet Assad's ceremonial deputy, Farouq al-Shara, for peace talks if the authorities released thousands of prisoners. There has been no response from Damascus so far. A communique drafted by OIC foreign ministers and seen by Reuters blames Assad's government for most of the slaughter and urges it to open talks on a political transition. Diplomats said Iran had objected to the wording and it might be toned down to spread responsibility more evenly. Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari said the statement had to be adopted by consensus and would stress the need for dialogue and a political solution. Call to Accelerate Transition Process Turkish President Abdullah Gul attends the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) summit in Cairo February 6, 2013.Asmaa WaguihThe draft text also urged the opposition Syrian National Coalition (SNC) to speed up the creation of a transitional government to be ready to assume responsibility in full until the completion of the desired political change process. Without mentioning Assad, it says: We urge the Syrian regime to show wisdom and call for serious dialogue to take place between the national coalition of the Syrian revolution, opposition forces, and representatives of the Syrian government committed to political transformation in Syria and those who have not been directly involved in any form of oppression... Spotlight on Mursi Mursi, a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, sought to project his country as the leader of the Islamic world in his speech seven months after becoming Egypt's first democratically elected head of state. Slideshow (3 Images)He told the assembled kings, presidents and prime ministers that Egypt's glorious January 25 revolution that toppled autocrat Hosni Mubarak in 2011 forms the cornerstone in the launching of this nation to new horizons of progress. Egypt is taking over the OIC chair at a time of upheaval in the Arab world and sectarian tension between the main branches of Islam. Mursi is also grappling with sustained protests at home by liberal and leftist opponents who accuse him of seeking to impose Islamist rule. On Tuesday, he embraced Ahmadinejad and gave him a red-carpet airport welcome on the Iranian leader's arrival, but his foreign minister hastened to assure Gulf Arab states that Egypt would not sacrifice their security in opening to Tehran. Syria was not present at the Islamic summit after being suspended from the OIC last August. The Syrian opposition said it had not received an invitation and would not be attending. Some members of the opposition coalition have called for an emergency meeting of the coalition to discuss Alkhatib's proposal for talks. The moderate cleric who heads the SNC's 70-member assembly made the offer after meeting the foreign ministers of Iran and Russia, Assad's main allies, at a weekend conference in Germany. On Syria's battlegrounds, heavy fighting erupted in Damascus on Wednesday as rebels launched an offensive, breaking a lull in the conflict, opposition activists said. Assad's forces also came under attack in the east of Syria where a suicide car bomb struck a military intelligence compound in the city of Palmyra, causing dozens of casualties. The OIC summit also discussed fighting in Mali. Mursi praised former colonial power France for intervening militarily in support of the government last month to drive out al-Qaeda-linked insurgents who had captured the north of the West African country and were advancing towards the capital Bamako.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-italy-gelato-museum-idUSLNE89002D20121001","Italy opens world's first gelato culture museum","","October 1, 2012 /  2:56 PM / 5 years ago","","MILAN (Reuters) - Who knows what Cosimo Ruggieri would have thought about ending up in a gelato museum? Alchemist at the court of the Medici, Ruggieri, the story goes, created the ice-cream that Catherine De Medici took to Paris in the 1530s to wow the French. And that's why he ended up in the world's first ever museum of gelato culture and technology which has just opened its doors to local dignitaries and businessmen in the small northern town of Anzola dell'Emilia, near Bologna. Gelato was a symbol of power, used at courts to enhance the prestige of noble families. Ice and salt were key ingredients and were expensive and so only aristocrats could afford it, ice-cream expert Luciana Polliotti said. Polliotti is historical curator at the Carpigiani Gelato Museum, a shiny more than 1,000 square metre space built at a cost of 1.5 million euros to showcase the history of a product that has become a Made in Italy success story the world over. The museum, built by gelato machine maker Carpigiani Group, tracks the history of gelato from the early snow-wells of antiquity, to the ice and salt sherbets developed by the Chinese through to the new technologies of the 1900s. Exhibits include the world's first-written recipe for the shrb, Arabic for sugar syrup, the 'De Sorbetti' treatise on the curative powers of gelato, written by Neapolitan physician Filippo Baldini, and 20 vintage gelato-making machines including the first automatic Cattabriga machine introduced in 1931. But if the gelato has its distant origins in Mesopotamia it was Italy that developed the modern creamier version we serve today on our tables, some time in the 1500s in Florence. And it was another Italian, Francesco Procopio Cuto, who, the museum says, sold the first sorbets to the public in 1686 when he opened Le Procope in Paris - still there today. Since then gelato eating has become much more democratic. Food-producing association Coldiretti estimates Italians will spend 2.5 billion euros on gelati this year with more than 600 flavours to choose from. And visitors to Anzola can taste some of those at the gelato shop outside the museum which serves treats like fig gelato with balsamic drizzle, strawberry and raspberry sorbets from an early 1800 recipe and coffee sorbet first drafted in 1854. Going Global It was Carpigiani that took the gelato business global. Founded in 1945, the company, today part of catering equipment group Ali, has grown to become the world's No. 1 gelato machine maker with branches in 12 countries, sales of 146 million euros and a payroll of over 400. Every day more than 150 million gelati from its machines are eaten worldwide. Like other Made in Italy businesses, the gelato trade has bucked the recessionary trend by focusing on quality and distinguishing itself from the fatter, more industrialised ice-cream. In Bologna one of the few things that has grown in recent years is gelato, said Gabriele Cavina, a Catholic church monsignor speaking at Thursday's museum inauguration as he blessed the building. Italians are deadly serious about their gelato. Walk around any Italian town late afternoon or evening and you'll find plenty of people strolling round with gelatos of every shade and colour. But with one gelato parlour for every 3,000 inhabitants, Italy is now a mature market and 80 percent of Carpigiani's business is now generated abroad with emerging markets in the Middle East and Asia a natural choice. Especially China. Gelato is not really in their culture but for the Chinese it's more a choice of tasting Made in Italy than food as such. I see strong growth there, Carpigiani General Manager Andrea Cocchi told Reuters. To help overseas expansion, Carpigiani also set up a Gelato University in 2003. Sat next to the museum, it is bustling with foreign students who come to the laboratories to learn the ins and outs of gelato making before going back home to set up their own businesses - possibly with a Carpigiani machine. I want to open up my own gelato shop in Manila, said 31-year-old Philippine Lily Agito who is doing a one-month internship at the University. It's been great. They don't spoonfeed you everything so you have to think for yourself. Then there's the Gelato Pioneers. Every year Carpigiani selects a group of highly motivated Italians ready to leave everything to open gelato shops abroad. Besides funding scholarships for the programme, the company also covers half the price of buying a new Carpigiani machine and will buy it back inside a year if the business folds. Andrea Morelli, a 38-year old former bank manager from Bologna, has no regrets. In 2011 I gave up everything and through the programme spent time abroad including Malaysia. I was aiming to open in the U.S. but it could be somewhere else, he said. (Reporting By Stephen Jewkes, editing by Paul Casciato)"
"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-labour-idUSKBN0FC0OK20140707","French labor summit opens with boycott threat","","July 7, 2014 /  8:51 AM / 3 years ago","","PARIS (Reuters) - French unions threatened on Monday to boycott a labor summit designed to combat record-high unemployment, while ruling Socialist officials accused employers of giving nothing in return for billions of euros in tax credits. Prime Minister Manuel Valls said the two-day summit should launch reforms including greater use of apprenticeships and simplify a 3,200-page labor code to ease rules on worker representation which firms say are too costly and complex. But hours before the opening, the hardline FO and CGT unions threatened to walk out of sessions scheduled on Tuesday over what they said was unfair behavior by employers due to reap an unprecedented 40 billion euros ($55 billion) in tax credits over the next three years. Today our main problem is Medef's attitude, Socialist Party chief Jean-Christophe Cambadelis told France Info radio, echoing government sources who criticized the Medef. Their culture is 'take the money and run'. French corporate margins are among the lowest in the euro zone. However economists say labor costs have in recent years been rising less quickly than in neighboring Germany, which has just backed the introduction of a minimum wage. Last week the Medef employers' union threatened to boycott the meeting unless the government delayed the implementation of an early retirement scheme for workers in strenuous jobs. It got the concession - a one-year delay until 2016 - but at the price of irking the unions and the government. We will decide this morning on what we do... We can still decide to not attend tomorrow, FO chief Jean-Claude Mailly told iTele news channel. Participants and company executives said talks would focus mostly on difficulties implementing past reforms like President Francois Hollande's responsibility pact, under which firms agreed to hiring targets in return for lower labor costs. The conference is less about moving ahead than ensuring what we already agreed can be implemented, Philippe Louis, president of the reform-minded CFTC union, told Reuters. Asked if he expected any breakthrough deals, he added: No, we can feel that feet are firmly on the brake pedals. Reform Fatigue While the lead-up to the summit was marked by a series of strikes, unions and employers accused each other of not putting into practice a labor cost reform voted into law in April. Credits have begun to flow, but negotiations on how to apply counterparties on hiring in hundreds of job sectors have barely got off the ground. Only ten branches have started the talks. While Medef says credits are coming too slowly, Laurent Berger of the moderate CFDT union argued the flow should be cut off altogether in 2016 and 2017 unless employers live up to vows on investment and hiring. Tranches of tax credits to companies are to be voted each year as part of the budget. Berger added he had no clear backing from the government on his proposed ultimatum. Deutsche Bank economist Gilles Moec hailed the government's willingness to cut employer costs as significant - saying the reforms could help companies more than those being undertaken by Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi - but questioned whether they would result in more hiring. If the government thought for one second there was a reality behind the counterparties, it was mistaken, Moec said of the hiring promises made by employer representatives when they signed the responsibility pact earlier this year.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-italy-mafia-crisis-idUSTRE80C16320120113","Italy's crisis opens doors to cash-rich mafia","","January 13, 2012 /  2:58 PM / 6 years ago","","MILAN (Reuters) - When Italian construction group Perego was struggling back in 2008, a white knight flush with cash rode to its rescue. Unfortunately the knight was a powerful mafia organization, the 'Ndrangheta, which went on to take control of the family-owned Lombardy business and tried to steer it on an expansion path, Italian justice authorities say. Luckily it failed, said Milan judge Giuseppe Gennari. The group has since collapsed and former chairman Ivano Perego is awaiting trial for opening his door to the crime syndicate. As the Italian economy slips into a recession and its banks answer regulatory pressure by curbing loans, more troubled firms could be tempted to follow in Perego's footsteps. Former Bank of Italy governor Mario Draghi warned back in March 2011 that the economic crisis of the last three years had made companies more vulnerable to the mafia. Since then, the situation has only worsened. Italy has reacted to spiraling costs linked to the euro zone debt crisis with 76 billion euros of belt-tightening measures aimed at balancing the budget in 2013. The economy is set to shrink in 2012. Facing funding strains, capital shortfalls and rising bad loans, Italian banks have started passing on higher financing costs to customers. Many fear they could turn the taps off altogether. Italy's mafia organizations, whose revenues from money laundering activities alone are estimated at around 150 billion euros, are delighted to step into the breach. In this crisis, those who have liquidity have power, Italy's chief anti-mafia prosecutor Pietro Grasso warned on state television in November. Italian crime syndicates have moved in recent years out of the southern regions where they originated into the richer north, and their tentacles now reach deep into the world of local businesses and politics. In particular the 'Ndrangheta, based in Calabria in the foot of Italy's boot, has grown in importance as its role in international drug trafficking has increased. With the cocaine trade estimated to yield returns of at least 50 times the initial investment, money laundering is one of the its key concerns. Anti-mafia investigative authority DIA has said that the economic potential of Milan's Lombardy region, which accounts for a fifth of Italy's domestic gross domestic product, made it an obvious target for the 'Ndrangheta. They are in a position to help troubled businesses. They have the money to set things right and can help firms win orders, for example by threatening competitors, said judge Gennari. Usury's Best Ally The economic crisis is usury's best ally and it has increased the mafia's share in this business, said Lino Busa, chairman of the anti-racketeering association SOS Impresa. Bankruptcies among Italian companies rose nearly 10 percent in the first nine months of 2011, according to business information group Cerved, which said they were relatively more frequent in Lombardy than elsewhere. Rising bad loans on lenders' balance sheets also point to Italian companies struggling to stay afloat. The gross total was 102 billion euros in September with a 40 percent annual increase, Italian banking association ABI said. The head of Confidi Lombardia said defaults were growing again on loan guarantees provided by the regional cooperative, which helps member firms borrow from banks. The past two years have been really bad and defaults are back on the rise. Small businesses are definitely feeling the pinch, credit is no longer cheap and no longer for everyone, said Managing Director Andrea Crovato. Small Italian companies, the backbone of the economy, are often blind to the dangers hidden behind the mafia's helping hand. Sums borrowed hardly ever top 10,000 euros, but a 2,000 euro loan turns into a 25,000 euro debt within six months, said Ilaria Ramoni, a lawyer with anti-mafia association Libera. Then the threats start, but many have a hard time realizing that a familiar face who helped in a moment of need is now a torturer. SOS Impresa's Busa said small businesses were keen to quickly pay back banks when they went into the red on their bank accounts for fear of eventually losing access to credit. They don't turn to usurers to fund an investment if a bank says 'no', nobody is that crazy, he said. But they will turn to them for small sums needed to avoid being flagged as risky clients and denied all credit in the future. Bank lending to Italian households and firms stalled in October from September, ABI data showed. The average rate on loans to companies of up to 1 million euros was 4.42 percent in October from 4.16 percent in September, the Bank of Italy said. In an online forum on the website of leading daily Corriere della Sera, business owners complained of being squeezed between bills that clients left unpaid and loan repayments to banks. That bank manager who used to wish me 'Happy Birthday' every year now shuns me, small-business owner Matteo wrote in the online forum. He'd ask if I wanted money for a new warehouse or to build. Now you don't take my calls and your assistant tells me you're busy or sick and reminds me of my overdraft and my mortgage. Criminal Role in Economy A study published by Milan's Bocconi University estimated that criminal economic activity accounted on average for 10.9 percent of Italy's annual gross domestic product in 2005-2008. Construction, logistics, hospitality, retail and wholesale commerce are traditionally the sectors with stronger mafia infiltrations, said Michele Polo, an economics professor at Bocconi. These sectors do not require sophisticated business skills and often complement the mafia's illegal businesses. Construction sites can become graves for its enemies, cafes and restaurants meeting places for its members. And trucks are useful if you need to transport drugs. The long-distance freight business for example offers great synergies with drug trafficking, Polo said. Last year a Milan court took temporary control of four Lombardy branches of Dutch freight and delivery group TNT Express that it said had been infiltrated by the 'Ndrangheta. The court has since restored management to TNT, which TNT head of communication Ersnt Moeksis told Reuters was a direct consequence of the transparent and positive relation between TNT Express Italy and the judicial administrator. In November a Milan court convicted 110 people of mafia-related activities following one of the biggest anti-'Ndrangheta operations in recent years, judicial sources said. The suspects had opted for a fast-track trial that may yield a reduced prison term and hearings were not open to the public. The 'Ndrangheta's presence in the north goes back at least two generations when it moved families up from the south, dividing Milan and its surroundings into areas of influence in the same way they control their home turf, acquiring direct or indirect control of companies and gaining political influence. This is not just 'a peripheral off-shoot of the Calabrian crime syndicate', prosecutors wrote in a court document. It is an autonomous organization ... with a criminal program.

The financial regulator said in a statement on its website it was asking for public comments until March 27 and would present results of the consultation a month afterwards. Japanese lenders are already allowed to provide Islamic financial products through their overseas subsidiaries, and Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ (BTMU) recently became the first Japanese commercial bank to issue Islamic bonds, or sukuk. Non-Muslim countries like Luxembourg, Britain and South Africa also issued sukuk last year as the structure gains acceptance beyond its core markets of the Middle East and Southeast Asia, making it more useful as a funding tool. A move to allow sukuk and similar products to be bought and sold in Japan, Asia's largest bond market, would give the sector a further boost. BTMU, Japan's largest lender, expects a relaxation of the rules after the spring and is preparing an operational framework to commence booking business as soon as possible. BTMU regards this as a positive development and is keen to further develop the Islamic market globally, it said in a statement to Reuters. Any regulatory changes would present Japan with a challenge shared by other jurisdictions new to Islamic finance: taxation. Certain Islamic finance structures, particularly sukuk, can attract double or even triple tax duties because they require multiple transfers of title of the underlying asset. But this hasn't stopped Japanese banks from increasing their activity in Islamic finance outside of Japan. In September, BTMU sold debut sukuk deals in two tranches under a multi-currency programme in Malaysia, including the world's first yen-denominated sukuk. It is now considering offering Islamic financial services through its Dubai branch, subject to regulatory approval, the lender said. Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp is also offering Islamic financial products through its Malaysian subsidiary; it set up an in-house sharia advisory board in December. In October, the Japan International Cooperation Agency signed an agreement with the private sector arm of the Jeddah-based Islamic Development Bank to develop sharia-compliant transactions, with a focus on sukuk.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-dbs-danamon-idUSBRE83100A20120402","DBS to test Indonesian openness with $7.2 billion takeover","","April 2, 2012 /  12:40 AM / 5 years ago","","SINGAPORE/JAKARTA (Reuters) - Singapore's DBS Group (DBSM.SI), Southeast Asia's biggest bank, is to buy Indonesia's Bank Danamon (BDMN.JK) for $7.24 billion, in a deal that could stir nationalist opposition stoked by anxious local rivals. DBS, part-owned by Singapore sovereign investment arm Temasek Holdings TEM.UL, said on Monday it agreed to take over Danamon in a cash-and-shares transaction that would rank as Asia's fourth-largest banking deal. Temasek is on both sides of the transaction as it also owns 67.4 percent of Danamon, and has had additional exposure to Indonesia through the DBS franchise there. If the deal is approved, Temasek will be invested in a single bank in Indonesia, rather than two - something that should please government officials in Jakarta, sources familiar with the deal said. But Indonesia's biggest foreign takeover could become a test of its openness to overseas capital, a month after Jakarta moved to curb foreign ownership of mines and less than a year since it voiced concerns over foreign bank holdings. It could also trigger more foreign bank takeovers, with shares in Bank Panin Indonesia (PNBN.JK) jumping 6 percent on Monday on bets that it, too, could become a target. However, some Indonesian bankers said they would try to block the deal and were considering a media campaign targeting public opinion in the hope of influencing politicians. Local rivals face stiffer competition from expanding foreign banks. You're going to see some movements to halt this deal in the coming days, said a senior executive of a rival local bank, who asked not to be named because of what he called the sensitivity of the issue. This is about nationalism. We don't have to be afraid of Singapore ... We're going to raise this case to parliament, the central bank and (banking regulator) Bapepam, he added. Bankers and industry analysts agreed there was little scope for a rejection of the deal on strict regulatory grounds, but a politically focused campaign could prove unpredictable. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ GRAPHIC on deal r.reuters.com/tep47s ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Related CoverageDBS boss Gupta faces biggest test in IndonesiaBig Premium DBS is buying most of Danamon, at a hefty 52 percent premium, in the form of new DBS shares from Temasek, which in turn will become an even bigger owner of DBS. It would make Singapore-based DBS the fifth-biggest lender in Indonesia, one of southeast Asia's hottest markets, where bank penetration is low and annual loan growth runs at 20 percent. However, Danamon has lower returns on equity than some peers and a heavy exposure to auto financing, an area vulnerable to recently announced steps by policymakers to curb excessive lending in the region's largest economy. We have the capacity to unshackle these businesses, DBS's CEO Piyush Gupta said in Jakarta on Monday, briefing investors on his first major deal since becoming boss in 2009. This changes our growth profile, Gupta said, adding the move would triple DBS's exposure to high-growth markets from 11 percent now. The price was fair, he said, and the Indonesian growth story was reflected in Danamon not being a cheap deal. Minorities' Windfall A security officer stands at the entrance of a branch of Bank Danamon in Jakarta, in this March 15, 2011 file picture.Enny Nuraheni/FilesGupta said DBS would cut Danamon's funding costs, expand its business into regional trade and corporate finance - and break the perception of DBS as a low-margin, mature-market bank. The price - S$6.2 billion ($4.93 billion) in shares for Temasek and the rest in cash for minority investors - initially surprised some investors, with the offering at 7,000 rupiah ($0.77) per Danamon share, which last traded at 4,600 rupiah. Danamon minorities are in for a windfall, said Anand Pathmakanthan, an analyst at Nomura Securities in Singapore, predicting DBS shares would suffer as a result. But the price looked less generous using another valuation yardstick: at 2.6 times book value, it was below some other big banking takeovers in Indonesia - although previous benchmarks were set before the 2008-09 global financial crisis. Temasek already owns about 29 percent of DBS and its stake would rise to about 40 percent after the deal. Temasek has obtained a regulatory waiver from having to make a general offer for the remaining DBS shares. Trade in DBS and Danamon shares was halted on Monday, pending the announcement. Danamon stock has fallen by a quarter over the past 12 months, while the wider Indonesian market .JKSE has gained ground. DBS has fallen 2 percent over the same period. Looking to Expand in Malaysia A man walks past Danamon Bank in Jakarta, in this October 30, 2009 file picture.Beawiharta/FilesDBS signaled on Monday it also aimed to expand in neighboring Malaysia, saying it had approval to negotiate to buy a 14 percent interest in Alliance Financial Group (ALFG.KL) - again from Temasek. The Alliance stake is worth about $270 million. Shares in the Malaysian bank jumped 3 percent on the news. Gupta said Danamon suffered from high funding costs due to its weaker deposit base and use of wholesale markets, where interest rates had jumped since the global crisis. According to its website, Danamon and its subsidiaries operate some 2,900 branches and points of sale, and employ close to 62,000 staff and non-permanent workers. Net income last year rose 16 percent to 3.3 trillion rupiah ($367 million). Gupta, 52, aims to expand DBS beyond Singapore and Hong Kong, which make the bulk of its profits, but one DBS shareholder, Aberdeen Asset Management, questioned whether Jakarta would have any concerns over the Danamon deal. It will be interesting to see the reaction of Indonesian authorities, said Hugh Young, Aberdeen's Asia chief. Indonesia's central bank last year considered a law to limit bank ownership, putting some deals on ice, but the state deposit agency recently said policymakers would not go ahead with it. Some bankers said Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (ANZ.AX) would also be watching the Danamon takeover closely. ANZ, which owns 38.5 percent of Bank Panin, is keen to increase its stake, but valuation differences derailed talks with the founding Gunawan family, which holds 46 percent. Gupta said he expected the Danamon deal to close in the second half of the year, subject to regulatory approval. The deal's implied price-to-book ratio of 2.6 times is below the 4.2 times paid by HSBC (HSBA.L) for Indonesia's Bank Ekomomi Raharaja in 2008. It is also below the multiple paid by Maybank (MBBM.KL) for Bank Indonesia Internasional.

Export Development Canada's branch will allow the agency to facilitate structured finance and corporate finance in local currencies, rather than Canadian dollars, while avoiding delays caused by the time difference, its regional vice-president Bill Brown told Reuters. The TPP, which originally covered some 40 percent of global gross domestic product, was effectively torpedoed in its current form when President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from the agreement in January. The deal included Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, United States and Vietnam. Canada's largest trading partner is the U.S. but the fastest growing economies are in this part of the word, Brown said. The base case for putting this branch here remains very strong regardless of whether there's a TPP or not. EDC aims to facilitate transactions between Canadian and Asian businesses worth 3.5-4 billion Canadian dollars ($2.7-$3.00 billion) annually for the next four years. It sees opportunities in natural resources, clean energy, transportation and other sectors. Annual two-way trade between Canadian and Asian businesses and consumers stands at around 170 billion Canadian dollars. Brown said Canada was looking for other opportunities to expand its ties with the region in the absence of the TPP. There will be various forms of trade agreements in the region and Canada wants to be part of that, he said. There is still momentum with other countries that have signaled that they want some kind of trade agreements. Brown said EDC was looking to open at least four other global branches outside Asia, potentially next year. ($1 = 1.3317 Canadian dollars) Reporting by Marius Zaharia"

The ruling Communist Party views NGOs, especially from abroad, with suspicion. Rights activists say the new law is part of a broader trend under President Xi Jinping's administration to rein in dissent. The draft was altered after some localities and departments pushed for change, noting there were already important science and technology-related international NGOs operating in China, the website of the National People's Congress said. It was recommended that the provisions be more flexible, said the notice, dated on Wednesday. The draft was discussed by the leadership of the rubber-stamp parliament on Thursday. An earlier draft of the law, seen by Reuters in March, barred foreign NGOs from activities that violate Chinese society's moral customs and from setting up branches in China under any circumstances. The new draft allows foreign NGOs to open branch offices only with permission from the State Council, or China's cabinet. The draft must be given a third reading and a vote in the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the China Daily newspaper reported on Friday. Since last June, foreign NGOs have faced closer scrutiny. State security agents have interviewed them about funding, representatives said.

Iran threatened last week to stop the flow of oil through the Strait of Hormuz if foreign sanctions were imposed on its crude exports over its nuclear ambitions, a move that could trigger military conflict with economies dependent on Gulf oil. Alongside the U.S. 5th Fleet in the Gulf, we have naval assets, we have mine counter-measures capability, we have a frigate present there, and we are an integrated part of the allied naval task force in the Gulf and one of the missions of that task force is to ensure that those shipping lanes remain open, British Defence Secretary Philip Hammond told Sky News. Iran had made similar threats before, but there should be no miscalculation by the Iranians about the importance that the international community attaches to keeping the Straits of Hormuz open, Hammond said, speaking from Washington where he has gone for talks with his U.S. counterpart Leon Panetta. Fears of supply disruptions due to rising tensions between the West and Iran have sent oil prices higher. Any attempt to close the Straits of Hormuz would be illegal and we need to send a very clear message to Iran that we are determined that the straits should remain open, Hammond said. Britain's Royal Navy participates in the Combined Maritime Forces, a U.S.-led, Bahrain-based naval flotilla drawn from 25 nations whose missions include counter-piracy, counter-terrorism and security in the Gulf. The Strait of Hormuz was one of the world's great commercial arteries and its closure would have very significant consequences for the economies of the world, Hammond said. He said in a speech in Washington earlier that any attempt by Iran to close the strait would fail. Olive Branch At the same time, Hammond held out an olive branch to Iran by urging it to return to negotiations to find a peaceful solution to its nuclear dispute with the West. The West suspects Iran of seeking to develop a nuclear bomb although Tehran insists its nuclear program is peaceful. The last round of talks between Iran and six major powers, including Britain, in Istanbul a year ago, got nowhere. Turkey delivered a Western offer for a resumption to Tehran on Thursday and expressed hope they could restart soon. Britain shut Iran's embassy in London and expelled all its staff after the British Embassy in Tehran was attacked last November by a crowd angry at British sanctions. Britain also closed its Tehran embassy and evacuated its staff. Hammond, appointed to the job last October, made his first trip to Washington as defence secretary as President Barack Obama unveiled a new defence strategy in line with Pentagon plans to cut spending after a decade of war. British troops fought alongside Americans in Iraq and still do so in Afghanistan. Hammond said there was a clear view both in the UK and the U.S. and indeed in many other allied countries that we will be seeking to avoid prolonged boots-on-the-ground engagements ... of the type that we had in Iraq and that we currently have in Afghanistan (and) that we should invest more in prevention. At the same time, of course, the U.S. has to have an eye on the emerging strength of China as a new major military power, he said. Reporting by Adrian Croft; Editing by Mohammed Abbas"

GIFT City is the culmination of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's dream to create an international financial centre in the western state, where he was chief minister from 2001 to 2014. So far, 10 banks have applied for licences to the Reserve Bank of India. They include Bank of Baroda, Bank of India, Canara Bank, Corporation Bank, IDFC Bank and RBL Bank, according to a market source. Yes Bank was the first to get a licence at GIFT City in July last year. ICICI Bank, IDBI Bank, Indusind Bank, Federal Bank, ICICI Bank and State Bank of India have since also received approvals to open branches. The GIFT City branch will enable us to cater to domestic companies that need dollar resources, said the head of financial markets at one of the latest applicants. Banks that do not have overseas branch licences will be able to offer a palette of offshore products to their clients from GIFT. Yes Bank did not have a full-fledged branch overseas, said Arun Agrawal, group president of international banking. The GIFT City branch has helped us in catering to the cross-border requirement of clients in India and their overseas outfits. Offshore Financing From the GIFT branch, banks will be able to offer foreign currency loans, project finance, loan syndication, trade finance, buyers' credit, and external commercial borrowings. We want to evaluate opportunities at the early stages and harness benefits in the long term, said Rajiv Mohan, senior executive vice president of balance sheet management unit and treasury at Kotak Mahindra Bank, which was granted RBI approval to open a branch at GIFT City in April. Banks that already have branches at GIFT City plan to issue dollar bonds to fund their operations. We intend to raise $400-$500 million in dollar bonds from the GIFT City branch as part of our MTN programme in calendar year 2017, said Yes Bank's Agrawal. The private-sector bank also aims to participate in offshore offerings of dollar bonds from Indian companies through its GIFT branch. Business transactions of International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) banking units at GIFT City crossed the $1 billion landmark in the year to October 2016. Yes Bank alone did $650 million of offshore transactions. There is huge scope to relocate offshore business to India. Offshore financial transactions from India totalled $50 billion in 2015 and are expected to grow to $120 billion come 2025. Some of these transactions can now be done onshore from the GIFT City branch, said Dipesh Shah, head (IFSC & Strategy) at GIFT City. Given that opportunities from IFSC can be converted, transactional volume has exponential potential, touching $10 billion over the next three years, said Kotak's Mohan. Some banks are also using their GIFT City branches to become active in offshore rupee, or Masala, bonds. The GIFT branch will enable us to act as underwriters and arrangers for Masala bonds, just like any other foreign banks like Credit Suisse and Nomura, and domestic private banks with offshore branches like Axis Bank, said Agrawal. This is likely to boost Masala bond issuance as more Indian banks will be able to pitch for offshore rupee deals. We want to play a meaningful role in the Masala bond market and be a part of such offshore transactions, said Agrawal. Yes Bank was one of the arrangers for Indiabulls Housing Finance's Masala bond issue in September. Earlier, banks could only arrange Masala deals, but were not able to underwrite them, unless they had access to a foreign branch.  COST BENEFITS  Banks are eager to set up shop in GIFT City because obtaining offshore branch licences is very difficult, according to one banker. So far only three private-sector banks have been awarded offshore branch licences. GIFT City also offers cost benefits. There is 100 percent income tax exemption for the first five years and 50 percent income tax exemption for the next five years. The branches had to pay minimum alternate tax of 9 percent on profit from the operations at the GIFT City branch, said Shah at GIFT City. These branches will also be cheaper to run than overseas ones, helping banks to keep their costs under control. Banks will be able to save costs on compliance, infrastructure and administration, since it is cheaper to open a branch in India, and manpower is easily available, said Manish Vora, senior president and chief executive officer of IFSC Banking Unit at Yes Bank. Despite its early success, GIFT City still has a long road ahead. For one, bankers are awaiting clarity on more taxation matters. Withholding tax on interest has been clarified, while clarification on dividends, royalties and service payments are expected to follow, said Mohan at Kotak. The tax and regulatory regimes are important considerations for international investors to operate from GIFT IFSC, which is still work in progress. GIFT City has the potential to become an international financial centre. GIFT city is a new initiative in India, on the lines of the financial and IT services hubs at Tokyo, Shanghai, Paris, London etc, and can become a regional financial hub, Mohan said. Situated between the commercial city of Ahmedabad and the state capital of Gandhinagar, GIFT City is looking to attract both financial and IT services companies and aims to provide half a million direct jobs and half a million indirect jobs by 2020.

Iran threatened last week to stop the flow of oil through the Strait of Hormuz if foreign sanctions were imposed on its crude exports over its nuclear ambitions, a move that could trigger military conflict with economies dependent on Gulf oil. Alongside the U.S. 5th Fleet in the Gulf, we have naval assets, we have mine counter-measures capability, we have a frigate present there, and we are an integrated part of the allied naval task force in the Gulf and one of the missions of that task force is to ensure that those shipping lanes remain open, British Defence Secretary Philip Hammond told Sky News. Iran had made similar threats before, but there should be no miscalculation by the Iranians about the importance that the international community attaches to keeping the Straits of Hormuz open, Hammond said, speaking from Washington where he has gone for talks with his U.S. counterpart Leon Panetta. Fears of supply disruptions due to rising tensions between the West and Iran have sent oil prices higher. Any attempt to close the Straits of Hormuz would be illegal and we need to send a very clear message to Iran that we are determined that the straits should remain open, Hammond said. Britain's Royal Navy participates in the Combined Maritime Forces, a U.S.-led, Bahrain-based naval flotilla drawn from 25 nations whose missions include counter-piracy, counter-terrorism and security in the Gulf. The Strait of Hormuz was one of the world's great commercial arteries and its closure would have very significant consequences for the economies of the world, Hammond said. He said in a speech in Washington earlier that any attempt by Iran to close the strait would fail. Olive Branch At the same time, Hammond held out an olive branch to Iran by urging it to return to negotiations to find a peaceful solution to its nuclear dispute with the West. The West suspects Iran of seeking to develop a nuclear bomb although Tehran insists its nuclear programme is peaceful. The last round of talks between Iran and six major powers, including Britain, in Istanbul a year ago, got nowhere. Turkey delivered a Western offer for a resumption to Tehran on Thursday and expressed hope they could restart soon. Britain shut Iran's embassy in London and expelled all its staff after the British Embassy in Tehran was attacked last November by a crowd angry at British sanctions. Britain also closed its Tehran embassy and evacuated its staff. Hammond, appointed to the job last October, made his first trip to Washington as defence secretary as President Barack Obama unveiled a new defence strategy in line with Pentagon plans to cut spending after a decade of war. British troops fought alongside Americans in Iraq and still do so in Afghanistan. Hammond said there was a clear view both in the UK and the U.S. and indeed in many other allied countries that we will be seeking to avoid prolonged boots-on-the-ground engagements ... of the type that we had in Iraq and that we currently have in Afghanistan (and) that we should invest more in prevention. At the same time, of course, the U.S. has to have an eye on the emerging strength of China as a new major military power, he said.    	 	  (Reporting by Adrian Croft; Editing by Mohammed Abbas)"

For Stratton, 49, the move into the independent advisory space is a return to his advising roots, where he began his career at a small practice with his father back in the late 1980s. I always kept in touch with what was going on in that environment, Stratton said in an interview. I was always that lone Merrill guy at the conferences for RIAs (registered investment advisers). Stratton left last Friday from Merrill, where he was a resident director managing 45 employees, 35 of which were financial advisers who generated about $17.5 million in annual revenue. Stratton himself produced about $550,000 in annual revenue and managed $75 million in client assets. He opened for business this week in his new office in Overland Park, Kansas, launching his firm with CONCERT Wealth Management, a start-up firm that works with independent advisers. Stratton said he left Merrill due to a number of cultural and structural changes at the firm since Bank of America bought the brokerage three years ago. New management led to restructuring of the firm's branch management system, which eliminated certain non-producing managerial roles, and consolidated offices. Stratton said his new firm has the capacity to add about seven more financial advisers, he said. Stratton's departure comes soon after Reuters reported last week that former complex director Stephen Bearden left Merrill for Morgan Stanley Smith Barney after about 18 years at the firm."

The bank, owned by part-nationalised Royal Bank of Scotland , opened the branches between 0800 GMT and 1100 GMT, having already extended its opening hours on Saturday, drafting in more than 7,000 staff to deal with the crisis. NatWest is battling to get on top of a huge backlog of failed payments after a software upgrade on Tuesday night went wrong, resulting in the bank being unable to process payments for its personal and business customers. In a message to customers published on the bank's website, Chief Executive Stephen Hester apologised for the enormous disruption and inconvenience for millions of our customers as well as for many customers of other banks. I am very sorry for the difficulties people are experiencing. Our customers rely on us day in and day out to get things right, and on this occasion we have let them down badly. This should not have happened. Hester said. Susan Allen, director of customer services at RBS, said on Sunday that most customer accounts should be back to normal by Monday but acknowledged some customers face more problems. I'm cautiously optimistic that RBS and NatWest customer account balances will be largely back to normal from tomorrow. The knock-on effects of this technical failure mean there will be bumps in the road. We will do everything we can to minimise further disruption to our customers, she said. Allen said the bank will automatically waive any overdraft fees or charges on current accounts and will work directly with credit agencies to ensure customers' credit ratings are not damaged as a result of missed payments. Hester said the bank's staff were working around the clock to resolve the problems and said affected customers would not lose out financially, raising the possibility that RBS could face hefty compensation claims. I want to be clear that where our customers are facing hardship or difficulty we can and will help them. I also want to reassure customers that no one will be left permanently out of pocket as a result of this and they should contact us directly about this, he said. RBS, 82 percent owned by the government, is already facing a bill of over 1 billion pounds ($1.6 million) to compensate customers for the mis-selling of loan insurance. The episode is a public relations disaster for NatWest, which could prompt customers to switch to other banks. New entrants into Britain's retail banking sector, such as Metro Bank, Virgin Money and Aldermore, are looking to take disaffected customers from the biggest high street banks - RBS, Lloyds, Barclays, HSBC and Santander UK Many Britons became disillusioned with the established banks following the financial crisis, angered by what they saw as excessive pay for executives and the stifling of credit while the country slid into a double-dip recession. It is also a further embarrassment for Hester, who admitted in February he had considered resigning following a public outcry over a proposed 1 million pound bonus payment which he opted to waive after coming under pressure from politicians. Labour finance spokeswoman Rachel Reeves called on the bank to get a grip on this situation. It's causing real hardship at the moment, and to say 'we'll put it all right in the end' isn't really good enough, she told Sky News. "

I'm open to anything that will move energy efficiency, Reid said in response to a reporter's question, referring to a bipartisan bill on promoting energy savings through revised building codes. The Senate is expected to debate the efficiency bill this week. It is sponsored by Senators Jeanne Shaheen, a New Hampshire Democrat, and Rob Portman, an Ohio Republican. The bill will likely be the last legislation debated on energy before midterm elections on November 4, and Reid's comment suggested that a measure addressing Keystone approval could be added. Reid said that talks with Republicans are continuing and initially he thought there would be a vote on a non-binding sense of the Senate resolution expressing support for TransCanada Corp's pipeline. But now, Reid said, Republicans are asking for legislation that would have the force of law. Earlier this month, the State Department said it would again delay a decision on the pipeline, approval of which has been pending for more than five years, until the Nebraska Supreme Court settles a dispute over what path the pipeline should take. The State Department leads the approval process because the pipeline would cross the national border. The White House has threatened to veto previous attempts by Congress to force approval of the project, which would bring more than 800,000 barrels per day of Canada's oil sands petroleum to refiners along the U.S. Gulf. The northern leg of the pipeline would link to a southern branch that is already operational. The project divides Obama's base between environmentalists, who say the project would lead to an increase in emissions linked to climate change, and union members who say Keystone XL would create thousands of construction jobs. Even if a measure attached to the Shaheen-Portman bill passed the Senate and a similar bill passed in the House of Representatives, it is unlikely the Senate would have enough votes to overcome any veto by President Barack Obama. Senator John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, said Keystone supporters want more than a symbolic vote. We ought to have a vote that matters, he said. There should be a full blown debate on energy policy in the Senate, he added. Reporting By Richard Cowan, Timothy Gardner and Tom Ferraro; Editing by Ros Krasny and Sandra Maler"

In December, U.S. President Barack Obama said he was seeking to improve diplomatic and commercial relations with Cuba's communist government because years of policies designed to isolate the Caribbean island have failed to achieve change. The White House recently announced it was taking Cuba off the terrorism list by the end of this month and officials from the two countries are due to hold talks on Thursday with both sides saying they had narrowed differences over reopening embassies. Cuba blamed its unusual bank-less status on the longstanding U.S. economic embargo against the communist island, as well as sanctions resulting from it being included on the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism. Resulting regulations, and potential fines, make banks reluctant to accept such toxic accounts, experts say. The Cuban government did not immediately respond to calls for comment on the news, first reported by the cable business channel CNBC. The public relations firm Kreps DeMaria in Miami, which represents Stonegate, said it had no immediate comment. A bank branch representative told Reuters employees received word on Wednesday about the account, but said she could not discuss any details. Based in Pompano Beach, Stonegate is a full-service commercial bank with 22 offices in south and west Florida. It has a market value of about $300 million and reported $1.67 billion in assets and $1.41 billion in deposits as of Sept. 30. New York-based M&T; Bank Corp canceled its services with Cuba's Interests Section in Washington in 2013. Havana blamed the move on U.S. sanctions. M&T;'s decision presented an unusual diplomatic quandary for Cuba and the U.S. just as secret talks to improve relations were underway between the two former Cold War enemies. Cuba briefly ceased almost all consular services in the United States, disrupting Cuba-U.S. travel programs and the issuing of visas and passports for Cubans exiles seeking to visit relatives. Cuba's mission at the United Nations was not affected as its diplomats there are allowed access to a special credit union limited to U.N. business only. Stonegate's outlets across south Florida made it attractive to Cuba because its consular business is concentrated in the area's large Cuban-American exile community, the Florida banking industry source said.

Peter Luger said in the lawsuit that Dickert, who once worked at its branch in Great Neck, New York, made up the name Carl von Luger to piggyback off its reputation. It also said Dickert has sown confusion by touting his restaurant's age old family tradition continuing since 1887 in its marketing materials and logo.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed-stimulus-idUSBRE87P03820120826","Fed mulls open season on bond buys to help economy","","August 26, 2012 /  12:05 PM / 5 years ago","","WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve is considering a new approach to unconventional monetary policy that would give it more leeway to tailor the scale of its stimulus to changing economic winds. While fresh measures are not assured and the timing of any potential moves are still in question, some officials have said any new bond buying, or quantitative easing, could be open-ended, meaning it would not be bound by a fixed amount or time frame. I am inclined to think that if the Fed decides on more QE it would be of the open-ended variety, said Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan and a former Fed economist. Because it would have no set limit other than the supply of Treasury or mortgage securities available, this method could eventually lead to very aggressive action, particularly if it is tied to an economic target - such as bringing the nation's 8.3 percent jobless rate down beneath, say, 7 percent. But Feroli believes the Fed, still smarting from Republican criticism of its $600 billion bond-buying spree last year, probably wants to start small. A more plausible outcome would actually be more cautious than past shock-and-awe QEs: most likely they commit to just doing more QE until the next meeting or two, and then re-assess after that without specifying stopping conditions, he said. After spending $2.3 trillion on two rounds of bond purchases, the Fed suggested in minutes of its August meeting last week that more stimulus would be in the offing unless the economy perked up quickly. Open-ended bond buying could help officials avoid the sticker shock of a large upfront commitment, potentially winning over some reluctant inflation hawks on the policy committee and shielding the Fed from political pushback ahead of the November 6 presidential election. Economists said it would give the Fed a more nimble method of influencing the economy, but it could also add new intensity to the institution's sometimes-controversial approach of keeping long-term interest rates down through large-scale bond buying. The economy doesn't listen to fixed time dates, it has its own ebb and flow, said Michael Gapen, senior U.S. economist at Barclays Capital in New York. St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard has long backed the idea of using the central bank's balance sheet as a meeting-to-meeting tool in the same way interest rates worked before officials brought them down to zero in late 2008. Markets have this idea that, there's QE1 and QE2, so QE3 must be the same as those previous ones. It's not that clear to me that this is the way this is going, Bullard told CNBC on Thursday, explaining how his preferred approach might work. It would just be to do balance sheet policy as the exact analogue of interest rate policy, he said. The possibility appears more likely after the minutes showed officials yearning for greater wiggle room. Many participants indicated that any new purchase program should be sufficiently flexible to allow adjustments, as needed, in response to economic developments or to changes in the committee's assessment of the efficacy and costs of the program, the minutes released on Wednesday said. That reference raised the odds of an open-ended program to 60 percent, higher than the chances of the Fed doing traditional quantitative easing, said Anthony Chan, chief economist at Chase Wealth Management in New York. An unlimited sum would eliminate the tricky question of how much the Fed should spend. If the central bank overshoots, it unnecessarily inflates its balance sheet, but if the amount of purchases is too small, it runs the risk of not achieving its goal of improving the economy. They get the best of all possible worlds, said Chan. By keeping it open-ended, you can't by definition disappoint the market. Others see it a bit differently. James Marple, economist at TD Securities, thinks a constant reassessment on the Fed's part could heighten volatility in the bond market, thereby lessening the beneficial effects of the Fed's efforts to keep rates down. Olive Branch or Attack of the Doves? Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart, who is seen as a bellwether policy centrist, told reporters on Tuesday an open-ended stimulus is among the options being considered, though he added that he had not made up his mind about whether the likely benefits of more monetary support outweigh the potential costs. Other officials like John Williams, Charles Evans and Eric Rosengren, the dovish presidents of, respectively, the San Francisco, Chicago and Boston regional Fed banks, have also voiced their support for such an approach. Fed Vice Chair Janet Yellen would likely also be open to the idea. The August minutes set a low bar for the Fed to act. Many policymakers were inclined to take new easing measures fairly soon barring substantial and sustained improvement in the economic backdrop, they said. Still, a raft of better economic data since the meeting have prompted some analysts to pare back the chances of further Fed stimulus. The fluidity of an open-ended approach could prove particularly attractive as European leaders scramble to find the right policy response to resolve their region's debt problems. If somehow the European Central Bank is more aggressive, then I don't think it really takes a rocket scientist to figure out that means the Federal Reserve has to be less aggressive, said Chan. Nonetheless, open-ended QE would be a fairly radical move, said Steve Wyatt, a professor of finance at Miami University's Farmer School of Business. It would be akin to setting explicit targets for bond yields, or even setting a target for the level of prices that forces policymakers to make up for deviations from their policy goal. That means the central bank could effectively be willing to tolerate a little bit higher inflation to jolt economic activity enough to bring down unemployment, something Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke has repeatedly ruled out. The Fed's only previous experience with such a policy of rate-targeting, in the aftermath of World War II, suggests it can be done. An academic study of the post-war period conducted in the 1990s, however, finds the policy was employed for a different purpose - to stabilize what had been highly volatile interest rates rather than to jumpstart a persistently weak recovery. Bernanke, when he was a central bank board governor in 2003, gave a now famous speech on the threat of deflation called Making sure it doesn't happen here in which he backed yield-targeting as a deflation-fighting tool. A more direct method, which I personally prefer, would be for the Fed to begin announcing explicit ceilings for yields on longer-maturity Treasury debt, he said. For now, deflation does not appear to be a threat, though inflation is sufficiently subdued to give central bankers comfort as they consider more stimulus to lower unemployment. A speech by Bernanke this coming Friday at the Fed's annual gathering in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, could offer some hints on whether Bernanke will want to test his own theory.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-military-women-idUSKCN0RV3AM20151001","U.S. military chiefs to report on opening combat roles to women","","October 1, 2015 /  2:48 AM / 2 years ago","","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Top U.S. military leaders were expected to deliver their recommendations on Wednesday on opening combat jobs to women, teeing up a historic but delicate decision by Defense Secretary Ash Carter on how far to move gender boundaries in the world's most formidable military. Carter has until year's end to decide whether to agree to a Marine Corps request that it be partially exempt from a January 2013 Department of Defense directive that military services allow women to compete for virtually all jobs, including the toughest and most dangerous roles on the frontlines of wars. The services' recommendations, due by Oct. 1, were not made public, but a U.S. official confirmed that the Marine Corps had requested to keep some combat jobs open only to men. Officials from the other services - the Army, Navy, and Air Force - have hinted that they will not seek exemptions. The decision could force Carter to choose between the views of his own top military adviser and advocates who say there should be clear, gender-neutral standards for combat roles that anyone can try to meet. Gen. Joseph Dunford, the new chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, recommended the Marine Corps exemption earlier in September, when he was still the service's commandant. In his new post, Dunford will have to approve any exceptions barring women from combat roles. The stakes are high: some argue that including women in combat roles such as the infantry could upend, at least temporarily, the Marines' strong fighting culture. You have a cultural formula there that works. You've got Coca-Cola classic, said Elliot Ackerman, a writer and Marine Corps veteran who said he does not consider himself an advocate for either side. If you add ingredients into that...it will not be the same formula...it will unequivocally change the culture. If he agrees, Carter risks alienating those who say the time for equal treatment is long overdue. Opening ground combat jobs to women would strengthen the military, they argue, by ensuring the broadest possible pool of candidates. Certainly it's one of the last ways that women are treated differently in our law, said Elizabeth Gill, an attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union. To have the door closed totally based on gender is unique in the federal government. Carter - who has hinted he favors minimal, if any, exceptions - said Wednesday that he would carefully review reports from all four services and the Special Operations Command. Everyone who is able and willing to serve and can meet the standards we require should have the full opportunity to do so, he told a news briefing. I am going to be very facts-based and analysis-based. I want to see the grounds upon which any actions that we take at the first of the year are going to be made. Since 2013, about 111,000 military jobs have opened to women, mostly in the Army. About 220,000 jobs still remain closed, said Matthew Allen, a Department of Defense spokesman. The greatest resistance has come from the Marines, an elite force that prides itself on its ability to react quickly and conduct frontline assaults. It is the only service branch that has gender-segregated basic training. Just seven percent of Marines are women, compared with about 15 percent across the military. As of March 2015, 25 percent of Marine Corps positions remain closed to women, compared with 18 percent of Army positions, two percent of Navy positions, and one percent of Air Force positions, according to a July GAO report. Differences between military and civilian leaders on this issue have played out unusually publicly. After the Marine Corps released a summary of a study this month that found mixed-gender units performed worse in replications of ground combat than all-male ones, Navy Secretary Ray Mabus, who is in charge of the Marines, said he thought the study was flawed.  That sort of public disagreement between a service chief and a service secretary, they happen but they're rare, said Captain Lory Manning, a Navy veteran and fellow at the Women's Research and Education Initiative, who favors allowing women in combat roles. Even as more positions open to women, the gender make-up of the military leadership – drawn largely from those who have served in combat – will barely budge in the coming decades. That is because it can take 25 to 30 years to reach the highest ranks, said Vice Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Michelle Howard, speaking at a think tank event in Washington last week.

The cautious reopening of the banks, and an increase in value added tax on restaurant food and public transport from Monday, are aimed at restoring trust inside and outside Greece after an aid-for-reforms deal last week averted bankruptcy. Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras is trying to turn a corner after he reluctantly agreed to negotiate a third bailout, allowing the European Central Bank to top up bank credit lines but prompting a rebellion in his leftist Syriza party. Capital controls and restrictions on withdrawals will remain in place but we are entering a new stage which we all hope will be one of normality, the head of Greece's banking association Louka Katseli told Skai television. Greeks will be able to withdraw 420 euros a week at once instead of just 60 euros a day, but the limit will effectively remain the same and capital controls will also stay in place. That's not a normal life so we have to negotiate quickly, Merkel said in extracts from an interview with German public broadcaster ARD.     Merkel said it would be possible to talk about changing the maturities of Greece's debt or reducing the interest Athens has to pay after the first successful review of the new bailout package to be negotiated. Berlin, the biggest contributor to eurozone bailouts, would do all it could to bring talks to a successful conclusion but would negotiate hard to ensure Athens stuck to agreements, she said. That certainly won't be easy because there are things that we have discussed with all of the Greek governments since 2010 that have never been done but that have been done in other countries like Portugal and Ireland, she said. Related CoverageAthens stock exchange to remain closed on Monday: officialElections Acceptance of the bailout terms that meant the banks could reopen marked a turnaround for Tsipras after months of difficult talks and a referendum that rejected a less stringent deal proposed by the lenders. He sacked party rebels in a government reshuffle on Friday and is seeking a swift start to talks on the bailout accord with European partners and the IMF before elections which Interior Minister Nikos Voutsis said were likely in September or October.      But while opinion polls suggest the prime minister's popularity remains high, on the streets of Athens some were sceptical that the bank reopening would change much in a recession-hit country with over 25 percent unemployment rate. The banks opening tomorrow won't change anything for me, said 31-year old hotel worker Joanna Arvanitaki. I never used to withdraw 60 euros a day - 60 euros is what I had a week for my expenditure. Women withdraw money from an ATM outside a National Bank branch in Athens, Greece, July 19, 2015.Yiannis KourtoglouGreeks will be able to deposit, although not cash, cheques, pay bills as well as have access to safety deposit boxes and withdraw money without an ATM card.     Deposit boxes are not affected by the capital restrictions and clients can therefore take whatever they want from them, bank officials said.  We are expecting queues in our branches in the first two or three days. Many people will ask to open their safe deposit boxes, an official at EFG Eurobank (EURBr.AT), the country's third-largest bank by assets, said.             German Scepticism Slideshow (4 Images)EU officials hope the bailout deal will be in place by mid-August when Greece needs to make new payments to the European Central Bank to redeem its maturing debt. A 7.16 billion euro bridge financing is enough to see Athens through July - including a July 20 ECB repayment - but not through August. German Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel said this deal could succeed where previous ones failed because the European Union now emphasises growth and investment rather than just austerity. It would depend on reforms being enacted and convincing the population that this is a path that allows Greece to assert itself rather than becoming a permanent alms-receiver, he said in extracts from a television interview. French President Francois Hollande, who pushed hard for a deal, said the Greek crisis had weakened Europeans' faith in the European project. What threatens us is not an excess of Europe but its insufficiency, he wrote in an op-ed in the Journal du Dimanche newspaper, reiterating calls for the creation of a euro zone government. Gabriel rejected accusations Germany had been too hard on Athens and criticised Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble for suggesting Greece could quit the euro zone temporarily. But in a sign of the challenge for euro zone leaders to convince their electorates of the merits of the deal, more than half of Germans think the planned deal with Greece is bad and many would have preferred it left the euro zone, a YouGov survey seen by German newspaper Welt am Sonntag showed. European Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis called on the Greek parliament to pass laws on reforms very quickly, in an interview due to be published in German newspaper Bild on Monday. He said negotiations on a third bailout for Greece would take several weeks, according to comments released ahead of publication.  Dombrovskis defended the decision to grant Greece bridge financing even though the Greek parliament had not yet passed its whole reform program, saying that the funds were important to prevent the country from sliding into insolvency and had only been granted once the Greek parliament had passed some reforms‎. But he warned that the EU would in the worst case scenario hold off paying funds to Greece from the EU budget if Greece broke agreements and did not pay back the emergency loan. He said a Greek exit from the euro zone is not on our agenda, but Athens needed to stick to its agreements and carry out reforms in return for solidarity.

Eataly, which began with the idea that there should be a place to buy, eat and study high-quality Italian food and wine, has 25 food emporiums in the United States, Turkey, Japan and Dubai. The company, which plans to float shares in 2017, is taking advantage of investor appetite for Italian companies that make artisanal or luxury products. Milan's main stock market has seen four share sales in the past three years and all have been high-end consumer goods firms. The 5,000 square-metre space, one of the chain's largest, is important for the company as Milan is Italy's most metropolitan city, where it previously had only one 250-square-metre store, founder Oscar Farinetti said at the event. From here we will branch out around the world, to Moscow, Sao Paolo, London, Paris, Los Angeles, Farinetti said. Shoppers queued outside the four-storey converted theatre, where jars of pesto and pureed tomato lined the shelves and open-plan restaurants offered cuts of raw meat and fish. Farinetti said the company sourced local goods from the Lombardy region surrounding Milan, in line with its stated aim to educate people about what they consume. We have celebrated the beauty of agriculture and food in Lombardy, which hardly anyone knows is Italy's most important region for agriculture, Farinetti said. Farinetti expects the shop, which resounded with the music of a piano played on a balcony under a glass ceiling, to reach a turnover of 40 million euros ($55.7 million) a year. This is a flagship for the country, said 60 year-old retiree Rosella Assandri, eyeing the fish counter. Tourists can come here and try new things and appreciate the best of Italy. Products from tinned tuna to jars of pasta sauce made from hare meat had placards explaining the origins of their brands, highlighting the diverse nature of Italy's food industry. Behind this big operation is the work of thousands and thousands of small artisans, that face challenges like bureaucracy but still keep the image of Italy alive, said Carlo Petrini, founder of non-profit organisation Slow Food, which promotes the idea of sourcing ingredients locally without harming the environment and treating small producers fairly. Other institutions in Italy, struggling to emerge from its longest recession in seventy years, could learn from Eataly's example in promoting part of the national identity, art critic and former junior culture minister Vittorio Sgarbi told Reuters. How can we make the most of our cultural heritage? Look around you, Sgarbi said, gesturing towards a kitchen area where aproned chefs rolled dough into pasta shapes. We could bring our artistic heritage to life in this way too. 1 = 0.7180 Euros

The decision to close the banks and impose capital controls from Monday was difficult, yet re-opening them and finding a way to lift the measures could prove even tougher, experts warned. Creditors said the door to negotiations remained open despite the government's decision to break off talks and put their latest cash-for-reforms offer to a referendum next Sunday, but that a no vote would signal an exit from the euro. In the best case scenario they manage the bank holiday, find a way to reopen the banks, stabilise the system like Cyprus, and deal with the fallout of higher NPLs (non-performing loans) and liquidity crunch. You find a path through, said a restructuring industry source who was not allowed to speak publicly. But the risk is you effectively have a state bankruptcy, and the banking system going bankrupt as well, he added. A Greek bank industry source concurred: Under a bad scenario we are in uncharted waters, (it) could end up with ruins, nationalised banks, he said. Greece said on Sunday it was closing banks all this week and capping withdrawals from ATMs at 60 euro a day to stem the outflow of cash from banks, from which about 40 billion euros  ($44.7 billion) of savings have flooded out this year, or a quarter of deposits. As the prospects for a deal receded, the European Central Bank (ECB) began refusing Greece's requests to raise the amount of emergency cash it is giving Greek banks, although the ECB is expected to let them keep using existing funds until the referendum, people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters. Greece is not the first European country to impose capital controls since the 2007/09 financial crisis, and Iceland and neighbor Cyprus showed such controls are rarely short-term. Cyprus closed its banks for two weeks in spring 2013 and limited withdrawals. Controls remained in place for two years, but the country was praised for stabilising its financial system and preventing a long, deep recession. Iceland imposed controls in 2008 after the collapse of its banks, and only this month started to ease restrictions. Things Move Quickly... On Monday, most retail staff were not working in branches, but all other bank employees were at work, and so were staff responsible for replenishing ATMs. Closing banks and restricting the flow of capital can build pressure for a solution as finances get squeezed. Once you start the closing of the banking system, things move quickly because every day you keep it closed you are aware of the consequences of doing so, the restructuring source said. It's easier to close the banks than it is to reopen them. You need a very clear plan for what's going to happen next when you reopen them, he said. The liquidity position of Greece's banks and the strength of their balance sheets are crucial to how severe and lengthy  capital controls will be. Greek banks are relying on 89 billion euros of emergency liquidity assistance (ELA) authorised by the ECB, but they are estimated to be near to using that capacity. While Greek authorities need to limit outflows, they also need to avoid crippling cash flow in the economy or squeezing the population too hard. Planning how far to go and how to re-open banks next week is also made near impossible by uncertainty about whether the ECB will extend liquidity, the threat Sunday's referendum may lead to Grexit, or the potential for another spell of political limbo following the referendum. A week of harsh controls might be enough to jolt the Greek people into reality over the dangers of not reworking a deal with public sector creditors, a second restructuring industry source said. While solving banks' liquidity position is most urgent, their solvency will need speedy attention, analysts said. Greek banks' core capital ratios (excluding tax credits) are all below 9 percent - the level investors typically want as a minimum - and range from just 4.9 percent at Eurobank  to 8.3 percent for Alpha Bank, Citigroup analyst Ronit Ghose estimated. And as the economy struggles, losses from bad loans and sovereign bonds could build. Recapitalization risks are high, Ghose said. In the event ELA funding is stopped, banks could be nationalised and carved into new banks alongside a multi-year workout of Greece's finances and economy, analysts and restructuring sources said. Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras is likely to be well aware of the political risks of capital control moves. When Argentina froze access to bank deposits in December 2001, for example, the popular backlash was so severe its president and his successor had resigned within a month.

The Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, which has been largely dormant since 2008, held its first full-fledged meeting on Wednesday after the Senate confirmed David Medine as its chairman last month. The meeting was behind closed doors to review classified information about the vast and controversial Internet and phone monitoring programs. But Medine told Reuters that the board is aiming to hold a public event around July 9 to get legal insight from experts, academics and advocates. Based on what we've learned so far, the board believes further questions are warranted, said Medine, who previously was a partner at the law firm WilmerHale and served as an associate director at the Federal Trade Commission. Still without formal email, a website or permanent staff, the five board members have in recent weeks acquired security clearances and last week, received a classified briefing with federal authorities including the National Security Agency, the FBI and the Director of National Intelligence, Medine said. The top-secret surveillance programs were revealed earlier this month after former NSA contractor Edward Snowden leaked documents to media outlets showing how the U.S. government uses vast amounts of phone and internet records to guard against potential attacks. The Obama administration and high-profile lawmakers have defended the programs as vital national security tools that are vigorously overseen by the administration, Congress and a special court. Privacy advocates have argued they infringe on Americans' civil liberties and say the oversight is insufficient. Obama said earlier this week that he plans to meet with the privacy board to discuss ways to balance the need for U.S. surveillance with privacy concerns. The board, established at the recommendation of the 9/11 Commission in 2004, is an independent watchdog that resides within the executive branch and is tasked with ensuring that U.S. anti-terrorism activity respects Americans' privacy. A civil liberties advocate said the board will largely be charting new territory with its review. The board has been defunct for so long, so I don't think that we have any precedent for how something like this plays out, said Michelle Richardson, legislative counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union. The president nominates members to the bipartisan board, who must then be confirmed by the Senate. President Barack Obama did not nominate his first two choices until December 2010, then a year later put forward three more names. Beside Medine, the other current members are: Rachel Brand, former lawyer at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and at the Justice Department; Elisebeth Collins Cook, a lawyer and former assistant attorney general at the Justice Department; James Dempsey, former public policy vice president at the Center for Democracy and Technology; and Patricia Wald, a former federal appeals court judge. Fight for Access Medine withheld judgment on Wednesday about the surveillance programs, saying the board will continue to study them and eventually issue a report and recommendations. He did not speculate on the timing but pledged to be as transparent and public about these issues as possible. Both he and civil liberties advocates acknowledge the board's transparency is limited by the classified status of much of the data about the programs. But Medine said Obama has asked the government to declassify as much as possible. A 2007 law restructured the board to be independent of the White House and gave it power to request subpoenas for the private sector. It also required all executive branch agencies to comply with the board's requests for reports, records and various other documents. We have been doing and plan to do it, Medine said, when asked whether the oversight board was exercising that power over federal agencies. The executive branch has been very responsive to our requests, he added. Civil liberties advocates are cautiously optimistic the board will shed more light on the surveillance programs. I think the key will be how fast can they staff up, how hard will they be willing to fight for the access to information and what type of leverage they'll be able to exercise to make more information public, said ACLU's Richardson. The ACLU, in coalition with 33 other advocacy groups, on Tuesday wrote to Medine and his colleagues, seeking more transparency of the legal standards involved in the issue. The letter, reviewed by Reuters on Wednesday, urged the board to ask Obama for public disclosure of sufficient information for Americans to understand the existing legal authorities for national security surveillance of Americans and the administration's interpretation of their scope.

Taiwan's cabinet is studying the proposal in response to requests from brokers to help them expand in the yuan business, chairman Chen Yuh-Chang of the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) told reporters at a briefing on Tuesday. This is a completely new business, especially when they start to do underwriting for yuan products in future, he said, adding no timetable or details were yet available. Taiwan's central bank maintains strict control over the convertibility of the island's dollar, limiting foreign exchange business to banks under a strict reporting regime designed to keep the currency stable for the island's exporters and discourage speculation. However with China's currency becoming more international and with China now Taiwan's top trading partner, the island's financial institutions are clamouring for an entry into the yuan business, mindful of how their Hong Kong rivals have a head start. After some three years of talks, Taiwan and China are close to signing a memorandum of understanding on a first step: allowing settlement of trade transactions directly in each other's currency, avoiding the current system of first having to convert either currency into U.S. dollars. Such an agreement would give a boost to Taiwan's financial institutions in their dealings with China, helping them into a growing market to offset a mature, slow growing one at home. Last month the Taiwan head of China's Bank of Communications (BoComm), one of only two mainland banks with branch status in Taiwan, said he thought the island was in a good position to become a centre for offshore trading in the yuan. .

While fresh measures are not assured and the timing of any potential moves are still in question, some officials have said any new bond buying, or quantitative easing, could be open-ended, meaning it would not be bound by a fixed amount or time frame. I am inclined to think that if the Fed decides on more QE it would be of the open-ended variety, said Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan and a former Fed economist. Because it would have no set limit other than the supply of Treasury or mortgage securities available, this method could eventually lead to very aggressive action, particularly if it is tied to an economic target - such as bringing the nation's 8.3 percent jobless rate down beneath, say, 7 percent. But Feroli believes the Fed, still smarting from Republican criticism of its $600 billion bond-buying spree last year, probably wants to start small. A more plausible outcome would actually be more cautious than past shock-and-awe QEs: most likely they commit to just doing more QE until the next meeting or two, and then re-assess after that without specifying stopping conditions, he said. After spending $2.3 trillion on two rounds of bond purchases, the Fed suggested in minutes of its August meeting last week that more stimulus would be in the offing unless the economy perked up quickly. Open-ended bond buying could help officials avoid the sticker shock of a large upfront commitment, potentially winning over some reluctant inflation hawks on the policy committee and shielding the Fed from political pushback ahead of the Nov. 6 presidential election. Economists said it would give the Fed a more nimble method of influencing the economy, but it could also add new intensity to the institution's sometimes-controversial approach of keeping long-term interest rates down through large-scale bond buying. The economy doesn't listen to fixed time dates, it has its own ebb and flow, said Michael Gapen, senior U.S. economist at Barclays Capital in New York. St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard has long backed the idea of using the central bank's balance sheet as a meeting-to-meeting tool in the same way interest rates worked before officials brought them down to zero in late 2008. Markets have this idea that, there's QE1 and QE2, so QE3 must be the same as those previous ones. It's not that clear to me that this is the way this is going, Bullard told CNBC on Thursday, explaining how his preferred approach might work. It would just be to do balance sheet policy as the exact analogue of interest rate policy, he said. The possibility appears more likely after the minutes showed officials yearning for greater wiggle room. Many participants indicated that any new purchase program should be sufficiently flexible to allow adjustments, as needed, in response to economic developments or to changes in the committee's assessment of the efficacy and costs of the program, the minutes released on Wednesday said. That reference raised the odds of an open-ended program to 60 percent, higher than the chances of the Fed doing traditional quantitative easing, said Anthony Chan, chief economist at Chase Wealth Management in New York. An unlimited sum would eliminate the tricky question of how much the Fed should spend. If the central bank overshoots, it unnecessarily inflates its balance sheet, but if the amount of purchases is too small, it runs the risk of not achieving its goal of improving the economy. They get the best of all possible worlds, said Chan. By keeping it open-ended, you can't by definition disappoint the market. Others see it a bit differently. James Marple, economist at TD Securities, thinks a constant reassessment on the Fed's part could heighten volatility in the bond market, thereby lessening the beneficial effects of the Fed's efforts to keep rates down. Olive Branch or Attack of the Doves? Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart, who is seen as a bellwether policy centrist, told reporters on Tuesday an open-ended stimulus is among the options being considered, though he added that he had not made up his mind about whether the likely benefits of more monetary support outweigh the potential costs. Other officials like John Williams, Charles Evans and Eric Rosengren, the dovish presidents of, respectively, the San Francisco, Chicago and Boston regional Fed banks, have also voiced their support for such an approach. Fed Vice Chair Janet Yellen would likely also be open to the idea. The August minutes set a low bar for the Fed to act. Many policymakers were inclined to take new easing measures fairly soon barring substantial and sustained improvement in the economic backdrop, they said. Still, a raft of better economic data since the meeting have prompted some analysts to pare back the chances of further Fed stimulus. The fluidity of an open-ended approach could prove particularly attractive as European leaders scramble to find the right policy response to resolve their region's debt problems. If somehow the European Central Bank is more aggressive, then I don't think it really takes a rocket scientist to figure out that means the Federal Reserve has to be less aggressive, said Chan. Nonetheless, open-ended QE would be a fairly radical move, said Steve Wyatt, a professor of finance at Miami University's Farmer School of Business. It would be akin to setting explicit targets for bond yields, or even setting a target for the level of prices that forces policymakers to make up for deviations from their policy goal. That means the central bank could effectively be willing to tolerate a little bit higher inflation to jolt economic activity enough to bring down unemployment, something Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke has repeatedly ruled out. The Fed's only previous experience with such a policy of rate-targeting, in the aftermath of World War II, suggests it can be done. An academic study of the post-war period conducted in the 1990s, however, finds the policy was employed for a different purpose - to stabilize what had been highly volatile interest rates rather than to jumpstart a persistently weak recovery. Bernanke, when he was a central bank board governor in 2003, gave a now famous speech on the threat of deflation called Making sure it doesn't happen here in which he backed yield-targeting as a deflation-fighting tool. A more direct method, which I personally prefer, would be for the Fed to begin announcing explicit ceilings for yields on longer-maturity Treasury debt, he said. For now, deflation does not appear to be a threat, though inflation is sufficiently subdued to give central bankers comfort as they consider more stimulus to lower unemployment. A speech by Bernanke this coming Friday at the Fed's annual gathering in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, could offer some hints on whether Bernanke will want to test his own theory."

The cautious reopening of the banks, and an increase in value added tax on restaurant food and public transport from Monday, are aimed at restoring trust inside and outside Greece after an aid-for-reforms deal last week averted bankruptcy. Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras is trying to turn a corner after he reluctantly agreed to negotiate a third bailout, allowing the European Central Bank to top up bank credit lines but prompting a rebellion in his leftist Syriza party. Capital controls and restrictions on withdrawals will remain in place but we are entering a new stage which we all hope will be one of normality, the head of Greece's banking association Louka Katseli told Skai television. Greeks will be able to withdraw 420 euros a week at once instead of just 60 euros a day, but the limit will effectively remain the same and capital controls will also stay in place. That's not a normal life so we have to negotiate quickly, Merkel said in extracts from an interview with German public broadcaster ARD.     Merkel said it would be possible to talk about changing the maturities of Greece's debt or reducing the interest Athens has to pay after the first successful review of the new bailout package to be negotiated. Berlin, the biggest contributor to eurozone bailouts, would do all it could to bring talks to a successful conclusion but would negotiate hard to ensure Athens stuck to agreements, she said. That certainly won't be easy because there are things that we have discussed with all of the Greek governments since 2010 that have never been done but that have been done in other countries like Portugal and Ireland, she said. Elections Acceptance of the bailout terms that meant the banks could reopen marked a turnaround for Tsipras after months of difficult talks and a referendum that rejected a less stringent deal proposed by the lenders. He sacked party rebels in a government reshuffle on Friday and is seeking a swift start to talks on the bailout accord with European partners and the IMF before elections which Interior Minister Nikos Voutsis said were likely in September or October.      But while opinion polls suggest the prime minister's popularity remains high, on the streets of Athens some were sceptical that the bank reopening would change much in a recession-hit country with over 25 percent unemployment rate. The banks opening tomorrow won't change anything for me, said 31-year old hotel worker Joanna Arvanitaki. I never used to withdraw 60 euros a day - 60 euros is what I had a week for my expenditure. Women withdraw money from an ATM outside a National Bank branch in Athens, Greece, July 19, 2015.Yiannis KourtoglouGreeks will be able to deposit, although not cash, cheques, pay bills as well as have access to safety deposit boxes and withdraw money without an ATM card.     Deposit boxes are not affected by the capital restrictions and clients can therefore take whatever they want from them, bank officials said.  We are expecting queues in our branches in the first two or three days. Many people will ask to open their safe deposit boxes, an official at EFG Eurobank (EURBr.AT), the country's third-largest bank by assets, said.             German Scepticism Slideshow (4 Images)EU officials hope the bailout deal will be in place by mid-August when Greece needs to make new payments to the European Central Bank to redeem its maturing debt. A 7.16 billion euro bridge financing is enough to see Athens through July - including a July 20 ECB repayment - but not through August. German Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel said this deal could succeed where previous ones failed because the European Union now emphasises growth and investment rather than just austerity. It would depend on reforms being enacted and convincing the population that this is a path that allows Greece to assert itself rather than becoming a permanent alms-receiver, he said in extracts from a television interview. French President Francois Hollande, who pushed hard for a deal, said the Greek crisis had weakened Europeans' faith in the European project. What threatens us is not an excess of Europe but its insufficiency, he wrote in an op-ed in the Journal du Dimanche newspaper, reiterating calls for the creation of a euro zone government. Gabriel rejected accusations Germany had been too hard on Athens and criticised Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble for suggesting Greece could quit the euro zone temporarily. But in a sign of the challenge for euro zone leaders to convince their electorates of the merits of the deal, more than half of Germans think the planned deal with Greece is bad and many would have preferred it left the euro zone, a YouGov survey seen by German newspaper Welt am Sonntag showed. European Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis called on the Greek parliament to pass laws on reforms very quickly, in an interview due to be published in German newspaper Bild on Monday. He said negotiations on a third bailout for Greece would take several weeks, according to comments released ahead of publication.  Dombrovskis defended the decision to grant Greece bridge financing even though the Greek parliament had not yet passed its whole reform program, saying that the funds were important to prevent the country from sliding into insolvency and had only been granted once the Greek parliament had passed some reforms‎. But he warned that the EU would in the worst case scenario hold off paying funds to Greece from the EU budget if Greece broke agreements and did not pay back the emergency loan. He said a Greek exit from the euro zone is not on our agenda, but Athens needed to stick to its agreements and carry out reforms in return for solidarity.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-security-oversight-idUSBRE95J01220130620","Head of revived watchdog pledges open look at U.S. surveillance","","June 20, 2013 /  12:29 AM / 4 years ago","","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of a newly revived federal privacy oversight board pledged on Wednesday to be as transparent and public as possible as the board reviews recently exposed U.S. government secret surveillance programs. The Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, which has been largely dormant since 2008, held its first full-fledged meeting on Wednesday after the Senate confirmed David Medine as its chairman last month. The meeting was behind closed doors to review classified information about the vast and controversial Internet and phone monitoring programs. But Medine told Reuters that the board is aiming to hold a public event around July 9 to get legal insight from experts, academics and advocates. Based on what we've learned so far, the board believes further questions are warranted, said Medine, who previously was a partner at the law firm WilmerHale and served as an associate director at the Federal Trade Commission. Still without formal email, a website or permanent staff, the five board members have in recent weeks acquired security clearances and last week, received a classified briefing with federal authorities including the National Security Agency, the FBI and the Director of National Intelligence, Medine said. The top-secret surveillance programs were revealed earlier this month after former NSA contractor Edward Snowden leaked documents to media outlets showing how the U.S. government uses vast amounts of phone and internet records to guard against potential attacks. The Obama administration and high-profile lawmakers have defended the programs as vital national security tools that are vigorously overseen by the administration, Congress and a special court. Privacy advocates have argued they infringe on Americans' civil liberties and say the oversight is insufficient. Obama said earlier this week that he plans to meet with the privacy board to discuss ways to balance the need for U.S. surveillance with privacy concerns. The board, established at the recommendation of the 9/11 Commission in 2004, is an independent watchdog that resides within the executive branch and is tasked with ensuring that U.S. anti-terrorism activity respects Americans' privacy. A civil liberties advocate said the board will largely be charting new territory with its review. The board has been defunct for so long, so I don't think that we have any precedent for how something like this plays out, said Michelle Richardson, legislative counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union. The president nominates members to the bipartisan board, who must then be confirmed by the Senate. President Barack Obama did not nominate his first two choices until December 2010, then a year later put forward three more names. Beside Medine, the other current members are: Rachel Brand, former lawyer at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and at the Justice Department; Elisebeth Collins Cook, a lawyer and former assistant attorney general at the Justice Department; James Dempsey, former public policy vice president at the Center for Democracy and Technology; and Patricia Wald, a former federal appeals court judge. Fight for Access Medine withheld judgment on Wednesday about the surveillance programs, saying the board will continue to study them and eventually issue a report and recommendations. He did not speculate on the timing but pledged to be as transparent and public about these issues as possible. Both he and civil liberties advocates acknowledge the board's transparency is limited by the classified status of much of the data about the programs. But Medine said Obama has asked the government to declassify as much as possible. A 2007 law restructured the board to be independent of the White House and gave it power to request subpoenas for the private sector. It also required all executive branch agencies to comply with the board's requests for reports, records and various other documents. We have been doing and plan to do it, Medine said, when asked whether the oversight board was exercising that power over federal agencies. The executive branch has been very responsive to our requests, he added. Civil liberties advocates are cautiously optimistic the board will shed more light on the surveillance programs. I think the key will be how fast can they staff up, how hard will they be willing to fight for the access to information and what type of leverage they'll be able to exercise to make more information public, said ACLU's Richardson. The ACLU, in coalition with 33 other advocacy groups, on Tuesday wrote to Medine and his colleagues, seeking more transparency of the legal standards involved in the issue. The letter, reviewed by Reuters on Wednesday, urged the board to ask Obama for public disclosure of sufficient information for Americans to understand the existing legal authorities for national security surveillance of Americans and the administration's interpretation of their scope.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/denmark-banks-idUSL6N0SH32Q20141024","Analysts see Danish banks' merger opening way to bigger deal","","October 24, 2014 /  12:05 PM / in 3 years","","COPENHAGEN, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Plans for two middle-sized Danish lenders to merge could prompt bigger rival Spar Nord  to step in to buy them both in a new round of consolidation for the country's fragmented banking industry, analysts said. Norresundby Bank and Nordjyske Bank, both with branches in the northwestern part of Denmark, said earlier this month they would merge. A dream scenario would be in our view for Spar Nord to use this event as a trigger to launch a bid for Norresundby Bank and, if there is an opening from Nordjyske Bank, on it as well, analysts from Danske Bank said in a note. However, Spar Nord could wait until the current merger is complete and then kill two birds with one stone. For decades Spar Nord has owned 50.2 percent of Norresundby Bank but the smaller rival has kept its distance from its Jutland neighbour due to a historical anomaly that has left Spar Nord with the voting rights equivalent to a holder of just seven ordinary shares. Spar Nord might want to wait until the two smaller rivals have merged and then take over the new combined bank, analyst Steffen Torvits from banking newsletter Bankinfo said. Combined, the three would have a market capitalisation of 9.68 billion Danish crowns ($1.64 billion), putting them within reach of the country's third-biggest lender, Sydbank,  with 13 billion crowns. The merger of the two smaller banks alone would create the country's sixth biggest bank. Complicating the matter, a merger between the two smaller rivals still needs Spar Nord's backing despite its lack of simple voting rights, as the deal needs the approval of a two-thirds majority in terms of economic as well as voting interest. Spar Nord has said before it sees a potential for big synergies from a takeover of Norresundby Bank but a spokesman said this week the bank does not have any comments to make on the current situation. Nordjyske Bank's chairman, Hans Jorgen Kaptain, said a deal with Spar Nord was not on the agenda. Norresundby Bank's chairman was not immediately available for comment. Spar Nord could end up fighting off a larger suitor itself -- analysts have long speculated that Nykredit, the second biggest financial institution in Denmark, might buy up the Aalborg-based bank since it already controls 10 percent of Spar Nord. The speculation was fuelled further when both banks said separately but just a day apart two weeks ago that they would switch to using the same digital platform operated by Bankernes EDB Central (BEC). Analysts have said running operations on different platforms stand in the way of mergers because of the time and money needed to move combined banks onto a single platform, whereas more mergers are definitely needed in Denmark. More than 60 banks have disappeared since the financial crisis began in 2008 but the country's 5.5 million inhabitants still have 88 financial institutions to choose from. My guess is that the number of banks in Denmark will continue to decline and by 2020 we will have less than 40 left, said Nicholas Rohde, an analyst at Niro Invest. 1 US dollar = 5.8791 Danish crowns

Last month, SAT scores were withheld for thousands of students across Asia who took the SAT in January, the fourth consecutive exam in as many months to see widespread delays because of alleged cheating.  Students are aware of the cheating scandals and nervous that their scores will be canceled after spending so many hours preparing for the examination, said Edward Dunnigan, director of the SAT and ACT programs at New Pathway Education, which has centers in China and New York.  College testing and admissions is big business in Asia, and growing: 150,000 students from China and South Korea went to U.S. colleges last year, 40 percent of all international undergraduates in America, according to the Institute of International Education. The number of Chinese students in U.S. colleges grew 18 percent.  The scandal over the SAT scores is the latest factor spurring demand for the ACT, which has already seen an increase in test takers from China and South Korea in recent years. With the SAT's upcoming redesign in 2016, students have been gravitating towards the ACT, for which there are abundant preparatory materials and retired exams that they can practise on.  Exam prep companies with existing ACT curriculums are scrambling to take advantage of the test's increased popularity. In Seoul's wealthy Gangnam district, a branch of the Princeton Review is offering ACT courses for the first time this summer.   The company has also added ACT courses throughout China and South Korea, according to vice president of international programs Steven Chou, who said demand for ACT prep has grown in all regions, not just the Asia-Pacific.  Kaplan, a division of Graham Holdings Co, says its international ACT business has expanded more than 15 percent in the past year. New Oriental Education & Technology Group Inc, which tutors 2.5 million students for various tests throughout China, says its ACT business jumped 220 percent from 2013 to 2014.  The College Board, which owns the SAT, declined to provide last year's growth figures for the exam, though spokesman Zach Goldberg said its registrations have doubled in Asia over the past five years.           Fighting Cheats     While the ACT is more popular in the United States, the SAT has dominated the market abroad. In Korea and China, an industry of cram schools have built up around the SAT, where students spend hundreds of hours taking and retaking practice tests.  Competition is fierce, and some companies illegally obtain unpublished tests that have been previously used in America, giving their students the edge when the exam is recycled in Asia.  Stress levels rose even higher when the College Board held back from releasing January's SAT scores. It said in December that some people and organizations had illegally obtained and shared test materials.  The SAT has a responsibility to deliver test scores with integrity to colleges and universities. A vital part of that responsibility is identifying, stopping and mitigating against security breaches, said the College Board's Goldberg.  Some test prep tutors warned that the ACT is just as vulnerable to cheating scandals because it also recycles tests previously administered in the United States.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eurozone-greece-banks-controls-idUSKCN0P92M720150629","Greece may find it is easier to close banks than re-open them","","June 29, 2015 /  7:49 PM / 2 years ago","","ATHENS/LONDON (Reuters) - Capital controls imposed in Greece are likely to stay in place for months and its banks may need billions of euros of new capital or even face nationalization under a lengthy financial rebuilding, industry sources said. The decision to close the banks and impose capital controls from Monday was difficult, yet re-opening them and finding a way to lift the measures could prove even tougher, experts warned.     Creditors said the door to negotiations remained open despite the government's decision to break off talks and put their latest cash-for-reforms offer to a referendum next Sunday, but that a no vote would signal an exit from the euro. In the best case scenario they manage the bank holiday, find a way to reopen the banks, stabilize the system like Cyprus, and deal with the fallout of higher NPLs (non-performing loans) and liquidity crunch. You find a path through, said a restructuring industry source who was not allowed to speak publicly. But the risk is you effectively have a state bankruptcy, and the banking system going bankrupt as well, he added. A Greek bank industry source concurred: Under a bad scenario we are in uncharted waters, (it) could end up with ruins, nationalized banks, he said. Greece said on Sunday it was closing banks all this week and capping withdrawals from ATMs at 60 euro a day to stem the outflow of cash from banks, from which about 40 billion euros  ($44.7 billion) of savings have flooded out this year, or a quarter of deposits. As the prospects for a deal receded, the European Central Bank (ECB) began refusing Greece's requests to raise the amount of emergency cash it is giving Greek banks, although the ECB is expected to let them keep using existing funds until the referendum, people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.  Greece is not the first European country to impose capital controls since the 2007/09 financial crisis, and Iceland and neighbor Cyprus showed such controls are rarely short-term. Cyprus closed its banks for two weeks in spring 2013 and limited withdrawals. Controls remained in place for two years, but the country was praised for stabilizing its financial system and preventing a long, deep recession. Iceland imposed controls in 2008 after the collapse of its banks, and only this month started to ease restrictions. Things Move Quickly... On Monday, most retail staff were not working in branches, but all other bank employees were at work, and so were staff responsible for replenishing ATMs.  Closing banks and restricting the flow of capital can build pressure for a solution as finances get squeezed. Once you start the closing of the banking system, things move quickly because every day you keep it closed you are aware of the consequences of doing so, the restructuring source said. It's easier to close the banks than it is to reopen them. You need a very clear plan for what's going to happen next when you reopen them, he said. The liquidity position of Greece's banks and the strength of their balance sheets are crucial to how severe and lengthy  capital controls will be. Greek banks are relying on 89 billion euros of emergency liquidity assistance (ELA) authorized by the ECB, but they are estimated to be near to using that capacity. While Greek authorities need to limit outflows, they also need to avoid crippling cash flow in the economy or squeezing the population too hard. Planning how far to go and how to re-open banks next week is also made near impossible by uncertainty about whether the ECB will extend liquidity, the threat Sunday's referendum may lead to Grexit, or the potential for another spell of political limbo following the referendum. A week of harsh controls might be enough to jolt the Greek people into reality over the dangers of not reworking a deal with public sector creditors, a second restructuring industry source said. While solving banks' liquidity position is most urgent, their solvency will need speedy attention, analysts said. Greek banks' core capital ratios (excluding tax credits) are all below 9 percent - the level investors typically want as a minimum - and range from just 4.9 percent at Eurobank (EURBr.AT) to 8.3 percent for Alpha Bank (ACBr.AT), Citigroup analyst Ronit Ghose estimated.  And as the economy struggles, losses from bad loans and sovereign bonds could build. Recapitalization risks are high, Ghose said. In the event ELA funding is stopped, banks could be nationalized and carved into new banks alongside a multi-year workout of Greece's finances and economy, analysts and restructuring sources said. Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras is likely to be well aware of the political risks of capital control moves. When Argentina froze access to bank deposits in December 2001, for example, the popular backlash was so severe its president and his successor had resigned within a month.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/bankia-idUSL6E8I44KR20120704","UPDATE 5-Spain opens fraud case on ex-Bankia chief Rato","","July 4, 2012 /  12:11 PM / 5 years ago","","* Lawsuit accuses 33 former executives * Accusations include fraud and price fixing * Rato is former IMF chief, Spanish minister * Bankia seeking 19-billion-euro bailout By Andrés  González and Blanca Rodríguez Piedra MADRID, July 4 (Reuters) - A Spanish court opened a fraud case on Wednesday against former executives of state-rescued lender Bankia, including one-time IMF chief Rodrigo Rato, as public rage engulfs a bank which is in line for the biggest share of an EU bailout. The lawsuit was brought by one of Spain's smaller political parties and accuses 33 officials including Rato - a former government minister who stood down as Bankia chairman in May - of fraud, price-fixing and falsifying accounts. Under Spanish law, the crimes carry jail sentences ranging from six months to six years but commentators said that while corporate corruption cases grab the headlines in Spain, they rarely resulted in convictions. It will be a long-running, complicated case, said Pedro Schwartz, economics professor at San Pablo University in Madrid. Spaniards are angry with the political and business elites in general as the government of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has  imposed austerity policies and had to seek European Union aid to save a series of banks including Bankia from collapse. Fury is particularly directed at Bankia as hundreds of thousands of small savers were persuaded to buy shares in the lender when it was floated on the stock market in 2011, only to see their investments all but wiped out in less than a year. Protesters have staged street demonstrations in their thousands, banging pots and pans and blowing whistles outside Bankia branches. Hoodwinked There are many citizens who feel they were hoodwinked, said Joaquim Bosch, spokesman for judges group 'Judges for Democracy'. It's too early to say whether there were crimes committed or criminal responsibilities, but it calls for a thorough investigation. The case, brought by minority political party UPyD led by charismatic Basque politician Rosa Diez, is one of many complaints brought against Bankia, which requested 19 billion euros ($24 billion) in state aid in May. Two sources who know the judge assigned to the Bankia case, Fernando Andreu, say he is likely to handle the probe aggressively. Andreu is friendly with human rights investigator Baltasar Garzon, best known for ordering the arrest of former Chilean military leader Augusto Pinochet in 1998. The judge will probably group together other cases with this one, a source with knowledge of the matter said. In the case brought by the UPyD party, the High Court is demanding that Rato and other executives appear in person. Bankia Chief Executive Francisco Verdu, the only director left at the bank since Rato stepped down in May, announced his resignation late Wednesday after learning about the probe. The court also wants former Bank of Spain governor Miguel Angel Fernandez Ordonez to appear as a witness, alongside the partner in auditor Deloitte who was in charge of signing off on Bankia's results, and the chairman of the Spanish stock market regulator. It's a good sign, said a spokesman for a group of shareholders looking to launch a similar case. We still have to be a little cautious because there aren't any formal charges yet. Selling Tickets for the Titantic The syndicate of banks selling shares in Bankia's initial public offering was led by Bank of America/Merrill Lynch , Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan and UBS . Other banks had smaller roles in the deal. One source at a bank involved in the IPO said it had to hand over files on the deal. A banker at one of the global coordinators of the IPO said the banks behind the listing believed they were safe from legal challenges because risks had been explained to investors in a prospectus. It's like attacking the people who sold the tickets for the Titanic, he said, asking not to be identified. The government took over Bankia in May after it became clear the bank could not cope with losses on indiscriminate lending during a property boom that collapsed four years ago. Rato, who was in a former government of the ruling centre-right People's Party which is now led by Rajoy, was IMF managing director in 2004-2007. A spokesman for the Spanish government said: Regarding Bankia all we can say is that one must respect an assumption of innocence and judicial independence. Bankia holds more than 10 percent of Spanish deposits and is the biggest bank likely to receive a capital injection when  European bailout funds materialise later this year. It is unclear in what form the lender will continue trading once it receives bailout funds, but there is no doubt its image has been severely damaged by the rescue. The name is finished, they will have to find a new one, said a high-ranking source at the bank."

A little-noticed provision tucked into the latest Iran sanctions bill may have done just that for American victims of a 1983 bombing of the U.S. Marine Corps barracks in Beirut. The sanctions bill, signed by President Barack Obama on August 10, set out additional penalties against Tehran to curb the country's nuclear ambitions. The bill also specifically disarms claims the Central Bank of Iran has made in a legal battle in federal court in Manhattan over $1.75 billion in securities frozen in a New York bank account that the central bank says it owns. The plaintiffs in that case are trying to get Tehran, through the Central Bank of Iran, to pay damages for Iran's suspected role in helping Hezbollah carry out the barracks attack during the civil war in Lebanon. The $1.75 billion was uncovered by the U.S. Treasury Department in 2008 and sits in a New York branch of Citibank, part of Citigroup. Treasury says the money is effectively Iranian funds. The Beirut plaintiffs' lawsuit, filed in 2010, argues that the funds should go toward paying a $2.65 billion damages award they obtained against Iran in 2007 and have so far been unable to collect. In court papers, the Central Bank of Iran has argued that the funds are off limits from seizure under the doctrine of sovereign immunity, which holds that foreign states or their agents are not subject to another nation's laws. But Section 502 of the sanctions law, officially known as the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012, takes direct aim at that defense. The section specifically declares that the Central Bank of Iran is not immune under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976, the U.S. law that Iran's central bank claims protects its funds from seizure. It also states that the financial assets that are identified in the Manhattan case shall be subject to execution or attachment ... to satisfy any judgment to the extent of any compensatory damages awarded against Iran. Over the years, there have been billions of dollars in default judgments against Iran levied by U.S. courts in favor of Americans, but never collected. Language in the latest sanctions bill, which could be subject to legal challenge, appears to have brought the plaintiffs in the Manhattan case closer to seizing actual funds than in any other case. David Lindsey, a New York-based lawyer for the Central Bank of Iran, also known as Bank Markazi, acknowledged that the new sanctions law could affect the Manhattan case. The purpose of this 10th inning change in the law was to do away with our defenses, Lindsey said. No allegations have ever been made that the Central Bank of Iran was involved in the 1983 attack, he said. Steven Perles, a lawyer for the Beirut plaintiffs, declined comment. The case was brought on behalf of Deborah Peterson, the personal representative of one of the deceased servicemen, and encompasses hundreds of individual plaintiffs. If this section stands, it does seem to overcome any defenses Iran might have, said Julian Ku, a professor at Hofstra University's School of Law. Ku, who called the statute modification unusual, said that if the payment is made, I think it would be the first such payment, and certainly the largest ever paid out in a U.S. court against Iran. To be sure, the plaintiffs must file supplemental briefs in light of the new legislation, and the judge must eventually decide whether to order that the funds be turned over - a process that could still take years. A Big Assist from Congress While Congress has previously intervened to help terrorism victims obtain compensation from foreign states, it is rare for a law to directly address an active case, legal experts said. There is precedent for massive payouts, but this is a little bit unusual because it changes a law about Iranian sovereign immunity in just one case, said Roger Alford, a professor at the University of Notre Dame Law School. How did the lawyers get Congress to do that? U.S. President Barack Obama signs the Iran Sanctions Act at the White House in Washington July 1, 2010.Kevin LamarqueThe amendment was introduced last winter by Senator Robert Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat. A senior aide to Menendez said the lawmaker's efforts were spurred on by a visit from a victim's family from his home state. The aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the purpose of the legislation was to ensure that claims against Iran were in fact actionable. The amendment sends a message not just to Iran but to the other states that support terrorism that the U.S. will allow the seizure and attachment of assets to satisfy judgments against those countries, the aide said. Experts and lawyers involved in such cases said the defendants in the Manhattan case may seek to challenge the constitutionality of Congress changing the statute, but that this would likely be a losing battle. One way would be to argue that the legislative branch had improperly interfered with judicial matters. Lindsey, the lawyer for the Iran bank, would say only that Iran is studying the new legislation to decide its next steps in the litigation. 'Innocent Third Party' There is another wrinkle in the claims over the $1.75 billion held in a Citibank account. The money was deposited there by Luxembourg-based bank Clearstream, which holds Iranian funds in accounts in Luxembourg. Clearstream said in court papers in July that if it is forced to turn over the $1.75 billion in New York, it may be barred from docking an equivalent sum from a Bank Markazi account in Europe because of European sanctions against Iran. Clearstream has argued that since the Iranian assets were booked in Europe, they could not be considered to be in the United States. The sanctions law, however, said that a sum held in the United States that was equal in value to Iranian assets held abroad could be attached. A spokesman for Clearstream's law firm, White & Case, declined comment. Feeding Frenzy Ever since the Menendez amendment was introduced, other groups of plaintiffs who have won judgments against Iran have expressed interest in getting a piece of any possible payout. Lawyers close to the case in New York say the $1.75 billion would currently be shared among about 1,350 people, which includes families of victims of a 1996 truck bomb attack at a U.S. military complex in Khobar near the Saudi Arabian oil city of Dhahran. The attack killed 19 soldiers and injured nearly 400. The aide to Menendez said lawyers for the 1,350 people had brokered a sharing agreement for the funds should they be turned over. Five days after Obama signed the sanctions bill, the Peterson plaintiffs sued London-based bank Standard Chartered seeking compensation over its concealment of Iran-linked transactions, citing the Beirut bombing, which killed 241 U.S. servicemen. Iran denies that it wants to develop nuclear weapon technology. But its refusal to limit and be more transparent about its nuclear activity has led to increasingly tough sanctions. Experts say the U.S. State Department has been reluctant to push for enforcement of existing money judgments against Iran because they could serve as a potential lever in negotiations with Tehran, while levying the $1.75 billion would have only a minimal impact. While the assets involved are substantial, said Suzanne Maloney, a former State Department adviser who now works at the Brookings Institution's Saban Center for Middle East Policy, I don't believe they are perceived as a meaningful bargaining chip with Tehran on the nuclear issue or other elements of concern with respect to Iranian policy. The case is Peterson v. Islamic Republic of Iran, U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, No. 10-cv-04518.

But only if they rode up to five hours by bus or motorcycle over muddy roads could they actually use them for their primary purpose: to make phone calls or send messages. And they're not alone. According to a study released in October by the GSM Association GSMA.L, a grouping of mobile operators, 1.5 billion people lack access to a cellphone signal. This is primarily because cellular operators haven't considered connecting remote communities such as Mambi worth the cost. But with demand for cellphone services in rural parts of the developing world rising, and the cost of the technology to connect them falling, the equation is changing. That means rural folk like those in Mambi will form the bulk of some 700 million new cellular subscriptions in the next five years, reckon the GSMA. The barrier to entry is no longer the device but the availability of the network, says Prashant Gokarn, chief strategy and planning officer at Indosat Tbk PT (ISAT.JK), Indonesia's second largest operator. This shift has led to a rash of moves by operators to reach beyond the low-hanging fruit of urban subscribers to connect the unsignalled. Driving this shift are small companies like Ireland's Altobridge, which offers base stations at a fraction of the cost of traditional ones designed for urban environments. They are powered by solar panels, removing the need for regular shipments of diesel to keep them going, and also reduce the load on traffic back to the network - called backhaul. While installing an urban base station with tower, power and air conditioning in remote areas would cost around $250,000, says Altobridge's marketing director Peter Tuomey, his solar powered station costs a fifth that. And the monthly costs are reduced in part by routing local calls back through the base station - rather than sending them over the satellite backhaul. Not all such technology is exclusive to smaller players such as Altobridge, but their willingness to share some of the risk has helped them carve a niche away from main players like Nokia NOK1V.HE, Siemens Networks, Ericsson (ERICb.ST) and Huawei. India's Vihaan Networks Ltd VNL.L, for example, has deployed hundreds of thousands of such base stations across the developing world. Says founder and CEO Rajiv Mehrotra of his bigger rivals: We start where they stop. In Indonesia Indosat and Altobridge have jointly installed base stations in nearly 100 sites, including Mambi. That's only a start: Altobridge estimates 35 million Indonesians - about 14 percent of the population - do not have access to a cellphone network. But it's already making a difference. In Mambi, for example, Altobridge sent one of its engineers, Australian Sean Heffernan, at the beginning of the year to set up two base stations covering a cluster of villages. He was surprised at what he found: not only was he told he was the first white man many of the villagers had seen, but he observed a relatively prosperous life. Mambi had a paved high street, school and restaurants, all partly funded by thriving cocoa, coffee and rice growing and remittances from relatives working overseas. But soon after the network was up and running, the change was visible. Residents could phone doctors in the regional capital, Makassar, check market prices of goods they sold like chillies and lemons rather than guess them, and order supplies from town instead of trekking several hours there and back. It basically changed their lives, he said. That may only be the start. In Indonesia's far east region of Papua, where base stations have been in place longer, their deployment has been followed by the arrival of bank branches, government services and retail businesses, says Indosat's Gokarn.

Djemi Suhenda, deputy president director of Indonesia's Bank BTPN, said his bank was keen to reach out to such communities, but must first wait for the telephone operators, or telcos. As the economy grows, as the middle income grows, these are the future customers of telcos, he says. And for us, it's simple: we're a mass market bank and so these are the customers we'd like to see. Indeed, research indicates the arrival of a cellphone signal does have an economic impact. A study for Nordic telecoms group Telenor (TEL.OL) by Deloitte in 2008 suggested that a 10 percent rise in mobile penetration would boost the long-term GDP rate of a developing country by 1.2 percent. Indian researchers came to similar conclusions in 2009. Key, though, to any wider deployment is going to be whether such moves pay off for operators. Indosat's Gokarn said that while his company recognises the benefits of being the first to arrive in a village like Mambi, figuring out pricing is key. Charge local users too much and you hit miscall culture - where users call a distant friend but hang up before he or she answers. That prompts the friend to call back, potentially losing the operator revenue to a rival network. Instead, Indosat cut tariffs. While the average revenue per user didn't necessarily rise, the increased traffic pushed up a more relevant metric: the average revenue per base station. It's probably not a good model to price it very high, Gokarn said. This seems to match Altobridge's broader experience. Mobile spend levels in these newly connected rural villages is generally on par with the national average, says Tuomey. However, in some cases, we are actually seeing average monthly spend in rural villages exceeding the national average. For some the technology has more ways to go. University of California, Berkeley, PhD student Kurtis Heimerl has spent the past few months in a remote Papuan village testing a base station he helped develop that powers down when it's not in use, saving up to 80 percent of the energy usually required. Incoming calls automatically wake up the unit, while outgoing callers can activate it with modified cellphones. It's not about the cost of the base station anymore, he said. It's power. Others would like to see telecommunications spread to rural areas more quickly by turning to open source software that in effect replaces much of the traditional hardware needed for cellular telephony. Indonesia technology activist Onno Purbo, for example, has been pushing the government to allow his open-source base stations to connect to existing providers. Deploying such technology is not only cheaper, he says, but it means communities don't have to wait for operators. The long-term goal is to bring connectivity to those who don't have it, he says. The normal strategy is to ask commercial operators to do these things. Onno has had little luck so far. More promising is the commercial deployment of technology allowing faster 3G connections to rural areas. While most solar-powered base stations only support voice, short message service and very rudimentary 2G services, the next step is to add more power-hungry 3G data. Altobridge's Tuomey says he's working to commercially deploy mobile broadband with Malaysia's Maxis. Whether its 2G or 3G, says VNL's Mehrotra, there's no question that there's pent-up demand. We see the traffic and it's unbelievable, he says. They talk, talk, talk. They want to talk to everyone. (Editing by Mark Bendeich)"

But only if they rode up to five hours by bus or motorcycle over muddy roads could they actually use them for their primary purpose: to make phone calls or send messages. And they're not alone.

Monday following a pull-back on Wall Street, although German equities were set
inch higher after the re-election of Chancellor Angela Merkel.
    On Sunday, Angela Merkel won a landslide personal victory in Germany's
election, although her conservatives appeared just short of the votes needed to
rule on their own and may have to convince leftist rivals to join a coalition
government. 
    Her re-election is a sign of political stability and markets love
stability. It's one less risk event to worry about, said David Thebault, head
of quantitative sales trading, at Global Equities.
    Her really good score will also give her room for manoeuvre, and hopefully
we will see the focus for Europe shifting from austerity to stimulus. We're just
getting out of the debt crisis, what we need now is measures to boost consumer
spending.

UK's FTSE 100 down 0.1 percent, for Germany's DAX up 0.1 percent
and for France's CAC down 0.1 percent.
    U.S. shares dropped on Friday, with the Dow Jones industrial average 
falling 1.2 percent and the S&P; 500 losing 0.7 percent, as investors
started to worry about the reasons behind the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to
maintain its stimulus measures as they heard opposing viewpoints from top Fed
officials. 
    Last week, equity markets worldwide strongly rallied after the Fed decided
not to trim down its quantitative easing programme, but the euphoria was
short-lived as investors started to see the Fed's decision as a sign that the
U.S. economy was losing steam.
    Commodity-related shares could find support on Monday in
better-than-expected manufacturing data from China. Figures showed the country's
factory sector grew at its fastest pace in six months in September, adding
momentum to China's tentative turnaround in economic growth. 
    Investors were also awaiting a raft of manufacturing data from France,
Germany and the euro zone on Monday, set to confirm an improvement in the
region's economy.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bankia-idUSBRE8630RT20120704","Spain opens fraud case on ex-Bankia chief Rato","","July 4, 2012 /  11:22 PM / 5 years ago","","MADRID (Reuters) - A Spanish court opened a fraud case on Wednesday against former executives of state-rescued lender Bankia (BKIA.MC), including one-time IMF chief Rodrigo Rato, as public rage engulfs a bank which is in line for the biggest share of an EU bailout. The lawsuit was brought by one of Spain's smaller political parties and accuses 33 officials including Rato - a former government minister who stood down as Bankia chairman in May - of fraud, price-fixing and falsifying accounts. Under Spanish law, the crimes carry jail sentences ranging from six months to six years but commentators said that while corporate corruption cases grab the headlines in Spain, they rarely resulted in convictions. It will be a long-running, complicated case, said Pedro Schwartz, economics professor at San Pablo University in Madrid. Spaniards are angry with the political and business elites in general as the government of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has imposed austerity policies and had to seek European Union aid to save a series of banks including Bankia from collapse. Fury is particularly directed at Bankia as hundreds of thousands of small savers were persuaded to buy shares in the lender when it was floated on the stock market in 2011, only to see their investments all but wiped out in less than a year. Protesters have staged street demonstrations in their thousands, banging pots and pans and blowing whistles outside Bankia branches. Hoodwinked There are many citizens who feel they were hoodwinked, said Joaquim Bosch, spokesman for judges group 'Judges for Democracy'. It's too early to say whether there were crimes committed or criminal responsibilities, but it calls for a thorough investigation. The case, brought by minority political party UPyD led by charismatic Basque politician Rosa Diez, is one of many complaints brought against Bankia, which requested 19 billion euros ($24 billion) in state aid in May. Two sources who know the judge assigned to the Bankia case, Fernando Andreu, say he is likely to handle the probe aggressively. Andreu is friendly with human rights investigator Baltasar Garzon, best known for ordering the arrest of former Chilean military leader Augusto Pinochet in 1998. The judge will probably group together other cases with this one, a source with knowledge of the matter said. In the case brought by the UPyD party, the High Court is demanding that Rato and other executives appear in person. Bankia Chief Executive Francisco Verdu, the only director left at the bank since Rato stepped down in May, announced his resignation late Wednesday after learning about the probe. The court also wants former Bank of Spain governor Miguel Angel Fernandez Ordonez to appear as a witness, alongside the partner in auditor Deloitte who was in charge of signing off on Bankia's results, and the chairman of the Spanish stock market regulator. It's a good sign, said a spokesman for a group of shareholders looking to launch a similar case. We still have to be a little cautious because there aren't any formal charges yet. Selling Tickets for the Titantic The syndicate of banks selling shares in Bankia's initial public offering was led by Bank of America/Merrill Lynch (BAC.N), Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE), JPMorgan (JPM.N) and UBS UBSN.VX. Other banks had smaller roles in the deal. One source at a bank involved in the IPO said it had to hand over files on the deal. A banker at one of the global coordinators of the IPO said the banks behind the listing believed they were safe from legal challenges because risks had been explained to investors in a prospectus. It's like attacking the people who sold the tickets for the Titanic, he said, asking not to be identified. The government took over Bankia in May after it became clear the bank could not cope with losses on indiscriminate lending during a property boom that collapsed four years ago. Rato, who was in a former government of the ruling centre-right People's Party which is now led by Rajoy, was IMF managing director in 2004-2007. A spokesman for the Spanish government said: Regarding Bankia all we can say is that one must respect an assumption of innocence and judicial independence. Bankia holds more than 10 percent of Spanish deposits and is the biggest bank likely to receive a capital injection when European bailout funds materialize later this year. It is unclear in what form the lender will continue trading once it receives bailout funds, but there is no doubt its image has been severely damaged by the rescue. The name is finished, they will have to find a new one, said a high-ranking source at the bank.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/dbs-danamon-idUSL3E8F201R20120402","UPDATE 5-DBS to test Indonesian openness with $7.2 bln takeover","","April 2, 2012 /  3:00 AM / 5 years ago","","* Deal would be Indonesia's largest foreign takeover * Local bank rivals talk of rousing political opposition * If successful, deal could spark more Indonesia bank takeovers * DBS looking to accelerate growth through Indonesia * Singapore's Temasek selling controlling stake in Danamon By Saeed Azhar and Neil Chatterjee SINGAPORE/JAKARTA, April 2 (Reuters) - Singapore's DBS Group , Southeast Asia's biggest bank, is to buy Indonesia's Bank Danamon for $7.24 billion, in a deal that could stir nationalist opposition stoked by anxious local rivals. DBS, part-owned by Singapore sovereign investment arm Temasek Holdings, said on Monday it agreed to take over Danamon in a cash-and-shares transaction that would rank as Asia's fourth-largest banking deal. Temasek is on both sides of the transaction as it also owns 67.4 percent of Danamon, and has had additional exposure to Indonesia through the DBS franchise there. If the deal is approved, Temasek will be invested in a single bank in Indonesia, rather than two - something that should please government officials in Jakarta, sources familiar with the deal said. But Indonesia's biggest foreign takeover could become a test of its openness to overseas capital, a month after Jakarta moved to curb foreign ownership of mines and less than a year since it voiced concerns over foreign bank holdings. It could also trigger more foreign bank takeovers, with shares in Bank Panin Indonesia jumping 6 percent on Monday on bets that it, too, could become a target. However, some Indonesian bankers said they would try to block the deal and were considering a media campaign targetting public opinion in the hope of influencing politicians. Local rivals face stiffer competition from expanding foreign banks. You're going to see some movements to halt this deal in the coming days, said a senior executive of a rival local bank, who asked not to be named because of what he called the sensitivity of the issue. This is about nationalism. We don't have to be afraid of Singapore ... We're going to raise this case to parliament, the central bank and (banking regulator) Bapepam, he added. Bankers and industry analysts agreed there was little scope for a rejection of the deal on strict regulatory grounds, but a politically focused campaign could prove unpredictable. Big Premium DBS is buying most of Danamon, at a hefty 52 percent premium, in the form of new DBS shares from Temasek, which in turn will become an even bigger owner of DBS. It would make Singapore-based DBS the fifth-biggest lender in Indonesia, one of southeast Asia's hottest markets, where bank penetration is low and annual loan growth runs at 20 percent. However, Danamon has lower returns on equity than some peers and a heavy exposure to auto financing, an area vulnerable to recently announced steps by policymakers to curb excessive lending in the region's largest economy. We have the capacity to unshackle these businesses,         DBS's CEO Piyush Gupta said in Jakarta on Monday, briefing investors on his first major deal since becoming boss in 2009. This changes our growth profile, Gupta said, adding the move would triple DBS's exposure to high-growth markets from 11 percent now. The price was fair, he said, and the Indonesian growth story was reflected in Danamon not being a cheap deal. Minorities' Windfall Gupta said DBS would cut Danamon's funding costs, expand its business into regional trade and corporate finance - and break the perception of DBS as a low-margin, mature-market bank. The price - S$6.2 billion ($4.93 billion) in shares for Temasek and the rest in cash for minority investors - initially surprised some investors, with the offering at 7,000 rupiah ($0.77) per Danamon share, which last traded at 4,600 rupiah. Danamon minorities are in for a windfall, said Anand Pathmakanthan, an analyst at Nomura Securities in Singapore, predicting DBS shares would suffer as a result. But the price looked less generous using another valuation yardstick: at 2.6 times book value, it was below some other big banking takeovers in Indonesia - although previous benchmarks were set before the 2008-09 global financial crisis. Temasek already owns about 29 percent of DBS and its stake would rise to about 40 percent after the deal. Temasek has obtained a regulatory waiver from having to make a general offer for the remaining DBS shares. Trade in DBS and Danamon shares was halted on Monday, pending the announcement. Danamon stock has fallen by a quarter over the past 12 months, while the wider Indonesian market  has gained ground. DBS has fallen 2 percent over the same period. Looking to Expand in Malaysia DBS signalled on Monday it also aimed to expand in neighbouring Malaysia, saying it had approval to negotiate to buy a 14 percent interest in Alliance Financial Group  - again from Temasek. The Alliance stake is worth about $270 million. Shares in the Malaysian bank jumped 3 percent on the news. Gupta said Danamon suffered from high funding costs due to its weaker deposit base and use of wholesale markets, where interest rates had jumped since the global crisis. According to its website, Danamon and its subsidiaries operate some 2,900 branches and points of sale, and employ close to 62,000 staff and non-permanent workers. Net income last year  rose 16 percent to 3.3 trillion rupiah ($367 million). Gupta, 52, aims to expand DBS beyond Singapore and Hong Kong, which make the bulk of its profits, but one DBS shareholder, Aberdeen Asset Management, questioned whether Jakarta would have any concerns over the Danamon deal. It will be interesting to see the reaction of Indonesian authorities, said Hugh Young, Aberdeen's Asia chief. Indonesia's central bank last year considered a law to limit bank ownership, putting some deals on ice, but the state deposit agency recently said policymakers would not go ahead with it. Some bankers said Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd would also be watching the Danamon takeover closely. ANZ, which owns 38.5 percent of Bank Panin, is keen to increase its stake, but valuation differences derailed talks with the founding Gunawan family, which holds 46 percent. Gupta said he expected the Danamon deal to close in the second half of the year, subject to regulatory approval. The deal's implied price-to-book ratio of 2.6 times is below the 4.2 times paid by HSBC for Indonesia's Bank Ekomomi Raharaja in 2008. It is also below the multiple paid by Maybank  for Bank Indonesia Internasional. Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley are joint financial advisers to DBS, while WongPartnership LLP and Hadiputranto, Hadinoto & Partners are legal advisers. Temasek is advised by Bank of America-Merrill Lynch  and UBS. Danamon is advised by Citigroup and Deutsche Bank. "

European regulators originally told RBS to sell the branches by 2013 to prevent the state-backed bank, Britain's largest small-business lender, from having an unfair advantage. The sale was one of the conditions attached to RBS's 45.5 billion pound  ($55.87 billion) state bailout in the financial crisis. RBS has spent more than 1.5 billion pounds and seven years trying to spin-off the branches - which were to be branded Williams & Glyn - but has struggled to separate them from its IT system.       Now British finance minister Philip Hammond is pushing for RBS to be let off the EU's demand to sell the branches in return for providing around 750 million pounds ($931.73 million) to help to boost competition in banking. For the plan to work, the EU would have to approve changes to the terms of RBS's government bailout, which included the sale of the branches and other divestments. The British government and the European Commission say they have had constructive discussions over the matter.  RBS shares surged to a one-year high on Monday as investors bet the proposals would be accepted. An end to the bank's state aid commitments is seen as a big milestone on the path towards the bank's recovery and the restoration of dividends. But the plan still needs to be vetted by the European Commissioners, who may reject the British government's proposals and seek to impose tougher conditions on RBS to free it from the branch sale obligation, according to sources familiar with the matter. The Commission will have to assess whether the measures that RBS will take are equivalent to selling the branches, a process likely to take at least several weeks. On paper, analysts said the proposals looked to be very much in the bank's favour, given it was expected to have had to sell Williams & Glyn with a hefty writedown.  The 750 million pounds RBS is proposing to spend on alternative measures to help so-called challenger banks and boost competition is substantially less than the charge that many had expected it would have to book for a distressed sale,  Sandy Chen, an analyst at Cenkos Securities, said. EU officials said on Monday that they were still waiting for formal notice of RBS's plan, but that it would go through thorough vetting.   In order to gather information on this proposal, the Commissioner responsible for EU competition policy, Margrethe Vestager, will in the coming weeks propose to the college of commissioners to open proceedings, a spokesman said on Monday. The Treasury said in a statement the plan provided a blueprint to increase competition and any final decision about what RBS must do would be made following the Commission's investigation and reaction to the plan from smaller banks. RBS declined to comment.  The British government will argue that the new plan would deal with the state-owned bank's EU obligations more quickly and with more certainty than selling off the branches. The government will also say that the current plans would boost competition to a larger number of smaller banks, according to government officials.    The Treasury began working on an alternative plan in the autumn soon after RBS abandoned an idea to build an independent technology platform for Williams & Glyn, according to people with knowledge of the talks. It hired investment firm Rothschild and law firm Slaughter and May to help find alternative ways to meet the state aid requirements, according to sources. Rothschild and Slaughter and May declined to comment.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/italy-mafia-crisis-idUSL6E8CB5CI20120113","FEATURE-Italy's crisis opens doors to cash-rich mafia","","January 13, 2012 /  2:15 PM / 6 years ago","","* Mafia has boosted presence in Italy economy, expanded north * Central bank says crisis makes companies more vulnerable * Italy economy to contract next year * Liquidity squeeze puts mafia in privileged position By Valentina Za MILAN, Jan 13 (Reuters) - When Italian construction group Perego was struggling back in 2008, a white knight flush with cash rode to its rescue. Unfortunately the knight was a powerful mafia organisation, the 'Ndrangheta, which went on to take control of the family-owned Lombardy business and tried to steer it on an expansion path, Italian justice authorities say. Luckily it failed, said Milan judge Giuseppe Gennari. The group has since collapsed and former chairman Ivano Perego is awaiting trial for opening his door to the crime syndicate. As the Italian economy slips into a recession and its banks answer regulatory pressure by curbing loans, more troubled firms could be tempted to follow in Perego's footsteps. Former Bank of Italy governor Mario Draghi warned back in March 2011 that the economic crisis of the last three years had made companies more vulnerable to the mafia. Since then, the situation has only worsened. Italy has reacted to spiralling costs linked to the euro zone debt crisis with 76 billion euros of belt-tightening measures aimed at balancing the budget in 2013. The economy is set to shrink in 2012. Facing funding strains, capital shortfalls and rising bad loans, Italian banks have started passing on higher financing costs to customers. Many fear they could turn the taps off altogether. Italy's mafia organisations, whose revenues from money laundering activities alone are estimated at around 150 billion euros, are delighted to step into the breach. In this crisis, those who have liquidity have power, Italy's chief anti-mafia prosecutor Pietro Grasso warned on state television in November. Italian crime syndicates have moved in recent years out of the southern regions where they originated into the richer north, and their tentacles now reach deep into the world of local businesses and politics. In particular the 'Ndrangheta, based in Calabria in the foot of Italy's boot, has grown in importance as its role in international drug trafficking has increased. With the cocaine trade estimated to yield returns of at least 50 times the initial investment, money laundering is one of the its key concerns. Anti-mafia investigative authority DIA has said that the economic potential of Milan's Lombardy region, which accounts for a fifth of Italy's domestic gross domestic product, made it an obvious target for the 'Ndrangheta. They are in a position to help troubled businesses. They have the money to set things right and can help firms win orders, for example by threatening competitors, said judge Gennari. Usury's Best Ally The economic crisis is usury's best ally and it has increased the mafia's share in this business, said Lino Busa, chairman of the anti-racketeering association SOS Impresa. Bankruptcies among Italian companies rose nearly 10 percent in the first nine months of 2011, according to business information group Cerved, which said they were relatively more frequent in Lombardy than elsewhere. Rising bad loans on lenders' balance sheets also point to Italian companies struggling to stay afloat. The gross total was 102 billion euros in September with a 40 percent annual increase, Italian banking association ABI said. The head of Confidi Lombardia said defaults were growing again on loan guarantees provided by the regional cooperative, which helps member firms borrow from banks. The past two years have been really bad and defaults are back on the rise. Small businesses are definitely feeling the pinch, credit is no longer cheap and no longer for everyone, said Managing Director Andrea Crovato. Small Italian companies, the backbone of the economy, are often blind to the dangers hidden behind the mafia's helping hand. Sums borrowed hardly ever top 10,000 euros, but a 2,000 euro loan turns into a 25,000 euro debt within six months, said Ilaria Ramoni, a lawyer with anti-mafia association Libera. Then the threats start, but many have a hard time realising that a familiar face who helped in a moment of need is now a torturer. SOS Impresa's Busa said small businesses were keen to quickly pay back banks when they went into the red on their bank accounts for fear of eventually losing access to credit. They don't turn to usurers to fund an investment if a bank says 'no', nobody is that crazy, he said. But they will turn to them for small sums needed to avoid being flagged as risky clients and denied all credit in the future. Bank lending to Italian households and firms stalled in October from September, ABI data showed. The average rate on loans to companies of up to 1 million euros was 4.42 percent in October from 4.16 percent in September, the Bank of Italy said. In an online forum on the website of leading daily Corriere della Sera, business owners complained of being squeezed between bills that clients left unpaid and loan repayments to banks. That bank mananger who used to wish me 'Happy Birthday' every year now shuns me, small-business owner Matteo wrote in the online forum. He'd ask if I wanted money for a new warehouse or to build. Now you don't take my calls and your assistant tells me you're busy or sick and reminds me of my overdraft and my mortgage. Criminal Role in Economy A study published by Milan's Bocconi University estimated that criminal economic activity accounted on average for 10.9 percent of Italy's annual gross domestic product in 2005-2008. Construction, logistics, hospitality, retail and wholesale commerce are traditionally the sectors with stronger mafia infiltrations, said Michele Polo, an economics professor at Bocconi. These sectors do not require sophisticated business skills  and often complement the mafia's illegal businesses. Construction sites can become graves for its enemies, cafes and restaurants meeting places for its members. And trucks are  useful if you need to transport drugs. The long-distance freight business for example offers great synergies with drug trafficking, Polo said. Last year a Milan court took temporary control of four Lombardy branches of Dutch freight and delivery group TNT Express that it said had been infiltrated by the 'Ndrangheta. The court has since restored management to TNT, which TNT head of communication Ersnt Moeksis told Reuters was a direct consequence of the transparent and positive relation between TNT Express Italy and the judicial administrator. In November a Milan court convicted 110 people of mafia-related activities following one of the biggest anti-'Ndrangheta operations in recent years, judicial sources said. The suspects had opted for a fast-track trial that may yield a reduced prison term and hearings were not open to the public. The 'Ndrangheta's presence in the north goes back at least two generations when it moved families up from the south, dividing Milan and its surroundings into areas of influence in the same way they control their home turf, acquiring direct or indirect control of companies and gaining political influence. This is not just 'a peripheral off-shoot of the Calabrian crime syndicate', prosecutors wrote in a court document. It is an autonomous organisation ... with a criminal programme."

Peter Luger is famed for its dry-aged steaks, especially its porterhouse, and has been named New York City's top steakhouse by Zagat's every year since 1979. Its fans have included the former late night talk show host Johnny Carson, who said he ate the best meal of his life there. Peter Luger said in the lawsuit that Dickert, who once worked at its branch in Great Neck, New York, made up the name Carl von Luger to piggyback off its reputation. It also said Dickert has sown confusion by touting his restaurant's age old family tradition continuing since 1887 in its marketing materials and logo. Carl von Luger has a restaurant in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and plans late next year to open a branch in North Palm Beach, Florida, according to a news article this month. Peter Luger said it has been fielding inquiries since the article's publication about whether it was expanding into Florida, where many customers have primary residences. Defendants' infringement and false advertising has already engendered a good deal of confusion in the marketplace and will continue to do so unless stopped, the lawsuit said.

Scotiabank is investing in new digital technologies in response to customers transacting far less in branches and using mobile banking apps much more. The bank has said it plans to cut 5 percent of branches in the next two years. The bank said last year a cost efficiency program would deliver a 200-250 basis point improvement in its productivity ratio by 2019. It said Thursday the changes are expected to result in additional 100 basis point improvement beyond 2019, giving it a productivity ratio of about 50 percent by 2021. The majority of the additional efficiency improvements relate to lower operating costs, and progress made so far have increased its confidence in its ability to meet its medium-term financial targets, the bank said, adding that the changes should contribute to improved profitability in the medium term. Scotiabank, which has the biggest international presence of Canada's banks, is planning to focus on introducing new digital technologies not only in Canada but in its key overseas markets of Mexico, Peru, Colombia and Chile. The bank last week announced it had opened new facilities to develop technology such as blockchain and artificial intelligence as it looks to position itself ahead of rivals in the hotly competitive fintech sector.

Jonathan Velline, Wells Fargo's head of ATM and branch banking, said that the San Francisco-based bank decided to apply the smartphone technology to all of its 13,000 cash machines after piloting the idea in select locations across the country. Bank of America Corp and JPMorgan Chase & Co are among the big banks that have announced digital upgrades to their ATM infrastructure, but Wells Fargo is the first U.S. bank to roll out cardless machines across its entire network.

The new feature allows customers to withdraw cash at any time, even when they don't have their cards on them, Velline said.  The new option will also improve protections against data theft, Velline said. Security certainly was a big aspect of the cardless feature and the two-step identification helps reduce the risk of fraud, Velline said, adding that the elimination of cards prevented so-called skimming techniques that criminals employ to read and store data of cards inserted into ATMs. Wells Fargo, the third-largest U.S. bank, was once the envy of Wall Street, able to seemingly sell its customers a range of different products and highly regarded for its stock price which had once made it the world's most valuable bank.

The government-driven move to merge State Bank of Bikaner and Jaipur, State Bank of Hyderabad, State Bank of Mysore, State Bank of Patiala and State Bank of Travancore with SBI, which already owned majority stakes in the units, is seen as the beginning of consolidation in India's public sector banks. SBI also took over Bharatiya Mahila Bank, a niche lender to women, as regulators aim to strengthen the sector with fewer but better-capitalised lenders at a time when Indian banks are battling record bad loans and need billions of dollars in new capital. The merger will catapult SBI to the league of the top 50 global banks by assets, the lender said, with a far bigger presence in all corners of the country, with some 24,000 branches and 370 million customers. The bank will relocate some 1,800 branches to better utilise resources, go slow on opening new branches and shuffle staff in a bid to save costs, said its Chairman Arundhati Bhattacharya and other senior executives at a news conference on Monday. The more than 200-year-old bank has also begun a voluntary retirement scheme to rationalise its headcount. Bhattacharya took the helm of the parent bank in late 2013 and has since surprised the market by managing bad loans better than its state-run peers, who together account for bulk of India's $149 billion soured assets. She sought to assure investors at the conference that there will be no nasty surprises on bad loans going forward. The subsidiaries have a higher bad-loan ratio than the parent. SBI started preparing early, and has made additional provisions of about 86 billion rupees ($1.3 billion) over and above what it needed to make after the asset quality review ordered by the Reserve Bank of India, Bhattacharya said. To that extent we are very well-positioned for taking the merged group forward, she said. After it reports annual results in May, SBI will set some quantitative goals including the absolute savings they can achieve for the merged group, Bhattacharya said. The banks aim to merge all their databases by May 27, while a complete integration will happen in the June quarter, senior executives said.

Under a deal agreed with investment firm China Media Capital (CMC), Merlin, the world's second-biggest visitor attractions group behind Walt Disney Co, plans to open a Legoland branch in the Shanghai area, as well as additional brands throughout China. Legoland is aimed at younger children and features rides as well as models of landmarks from around the world, made of millions of the Lego bricks whose popularity as toys has been recently boosted by the success of the Lego Movie. Merlin Chief Executive Nick Varney told Reuters the Legoland park in Shanghai would be a similarly sized investment to the $300 million parks it is building in Japan, Korea and Dubai. Merlin will also develop some of its existing brands, such as The Dungeons, which showcase murky historic events and scenes, for the Chinese market, as well new brands including DreamWorks Tours, Kung Fu Panda Adventures and others. The Merlin announcement came during Xi's state visit to Britain, promoted as boosting business ties between the two countries and promised to involve more than 30 billion pounds ($46 billion) worth of deals. The company already operates five attractions in China including Madame Tussauds and the Chang Feng Ocean World aquarium. It had also announced plans for three further attractions to open in the next 18 months, including a smaller Legoland site. $1 = 0.6483 pounds

Giving up real estate, the analysts said, was an obvious way the bank could save money when interest income was flagging and regulatory and legal costs were climbing.     But executives at the largest U.S. bank resisted. They argued that branches are great billboards for the Chase brand and essential to attracting people who want to open accounts or make major transactions in person.     Now it looks like the executives were right, or at least closer than other banks to delivering the right mix of physical and digital customer service.     JPMorgan has grown deposits over the last five years faster than major competitors and twice as fast as the industry, according to analysts at Bernstein Research.     Deposits in the Chase consumer bank grew in 2016 by 11 percent, or some $61 billion, the bank said when reporting quarterly results last week. Chase now has $607 billion in deposits, setting it up for a massive payoff if it can keep those funds and the company can lend them at higher interest rates in a stronger economy.     We've been growing our deposits very strongly and we're going to enjoy the benefits,” Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said on Friday.     For the first time in roughly a decade, banks’ ability to gather deposits is poised to matter mightily to financial performance.     Interest rates are rising and the U.S. economy, which has been on the mend for a while, is expected to improve even more with stimulus from federal spending and tax cuts under the new government in Washington. Banks that did not take steps to grow deposits while loan demand was sluggish and interest rates were low may struggle to catch up in the coming years, experts said.     “JPMorgan has invested through the slower times,” said Mike Mayo, an analyst at CLSA who has questioned JPMorgan’s branch office strategy in the past.  “Now it's time for them to try to achieve a greater payoff.”      Struggles Ahead     The full payoff is not a sure thing.    Loan demand and lending rates could fall short. The economy might become so strong that depositors put their money to better use. Or, lending could be so attractive that JPMorgan rivals lure deposits away with higher and higher rates.    Wary of fickle customers, JPMorgan executives say they are not offering high rates for deposits in a widespread, indiscriminate manner.    “We have among the lowest rates paid for deposits in the industry,” Lake said in a conference call with journalists on Friday. “We've been very disciplined.”      The Bernstein analysis concurred, finding that JPMorgan offers relatively little for deposits.    Still, the bank has been using promotions to get more people in the door.     For example, in recent months, Chase has been mailing offers of a $500 cash payment to new depositors who meet certain conditions, such as holding at least $15,000 in a savings account for three months.     Such come-ons are a marketing expense and do not lower the profit margin the bank reports for its deposits, Lake said.     Chase’s consumer deposit profit margin has fallen for at least five years, reaching 1.8 percent in the fourth quarter, compared with 2.76 percent in the same period in 2011. It is difficult for outsiders to assess how customer-acquisition costs would depress that rate, or how many depositors lured through promotions will stay with the bank for the long haul, taking out the loans and paying the fees Chase expects.     Flexing Muscle     Much of JPMorgan's deposit growth was born through mistakes, the financial crisis and sheer necessity.     Before 2007, Chase, like many banks, would lose a lot of customers each year because of poor service. Replacing them was expensive, but the churning expense could be covered by assorted fees, such as for overdrafts. That was sharply curtailed by post-crisis reform. Since then, banks have focused on better service to keep customers.     JPMorgan also took over Washington Mutual during the crisis. WaMu had a branch network full of holes in California and Florida, which Chase has tried to plug with new locations. Deposit growth has been a byproduct.    Regulator demands that banks shore up funding has also been a factor. Deposits are more stable than short-term financing from capital markets, and new requirements on banks favor deposits from consumers.     A big chunk of Chase’s additional deposits have also come from the bank's push to gain more investment management business from “mass affluent” individuals, who may not be multi-millionaires but still have a meaningful level of household wealth. They are often Chase customers already, who open Chase Private Client accounts through branches and are offered perks for higher balances.

We have leverage. They want what we have, Lael Brainard, Treasury's undersecretary for international affairs, told a congressional hearing to examine U.S. access to Chinese markets. At the annual U.S.-China economic and diplomatic meetings earlier in May, China agreed to raise foreign ownership limits in certain securities firms and said it was willing to force its government-owned banks to pay higher dividends. But lawmakers expressed frustration with the Fed's recent decision to give Chinese banks a bigger presence in the United States when U.S. firms face strict ownership limits and are competing against government-owned firms in China. We offer the Chinese more than they are offering us, said Republican representative Donald Manzullo. We don't have anything mutual going on, he said. Fellow Republican lawmaker Bill Huizenga said: It seems that we take two or three steps forward and China takes one step forward and we declare that a tie. U.S. firms are only allowed to take minority stakes in Chinese financial institutions. Foreign investment in Chinese banks is capped at a 20 percent ownership stake and only eight U.S. banks are operating in China. Last week, the Fed gave the biggest bank in China, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd (ICBC), approval to take over the Bank of East Asia (U.S.A.) in New York. The central bank also allowed Bank of China Ltd  , the third-largest Chinese bank that already has two branches in New York and a limited branch in Los Angeles, to set up a branch in Chicago. And the fourth-largest bank in China, Agricultural Bank of China Ltd, was given Fed approval to set up a branch in New York. It's a tough pill for Americans to swallow, said Gary Miller, chairman of the House Financial Services subcommittee on international monetary policy and trade, which held the hearing. But Brainard said the Obama administration was working very hard with China to level the playing field and said the United States still had leverage given the size of the U.S. market and strength of the domestic private sector among other things. Although China has started to loosen its hold on its markets by boosting the value of the yuan and raising foreign ownership limits on domestic joint venture securities firms, Brainard reiterated that those reforms were not enough. The United States has been pushing Beijing to reform its financial system, where four large state-owned banks account for about 40 percent of the country's total loans and have a monopoly over every part of China's financial services industry."

The company has been focusing on Africa due to growing demand for well-known accommodation brands, such as its Radisson Blu hotels. Such brands are estimated at about a third of the available room capacity in the region. The rest are independently-run hotels. Other global chains that have opened branches in markets such as Kenya in recent years include Marriott and Kempinski. Rezidor's regional support office in South Africa employs dozens of staff, up from just three employees a decade ago. For the last two years, every 60 days we have opened a new hotel in Africa, Andrew McLachlan, the group's senior vice president for Africa, told Reuters during the opening of its second hotel in the Kenyan capital. We really felt that there was an imbalance between supply and demand in a lot of African countries and a lot of African cities, he said. The group opened a five-star hotel under its Radisson Blu brand in Nairobi last year, to cater for wealthy clients. The second hotel, a Park Inn Radisson, offers 140 rooms to mid-scale consumers in a smart suburb of the city. A third hotel is under construction in Kenya and will open next year, McLachlan said, adding they also wanted to have five hotels in both Tanzania and Ethiopia in the expansion phase. We have 16,500 rooms in Africa today. By the end of 2020 we would like to get to 23,000 rooms in Africa, said McLachlan. McLachlan said Rezidor's strategy on the continent was about 80 percent focused on business travel to help ride out the occasional dampener on the leisure market, including the outbreak of diseases such as Ebola or militant attacks.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/jpmorgan-deposits-idUSL1N1F40DX","RPT-JPMorgan looks for big payoff from lead in deposit race","","January 16, 2017 /  12:02 PM / 6 months ago","","(Repeats story without changes) By David Henry NEW YORK, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Over the past five years, stock analysts have challenged JPMorgan Chase & Co executives for keeping so many branches open as customers did more and more banking online. Giving up real estate, the analysts said, was an obvious way the bank could save money when interest income was flagging and regulatory and legal costs were climbing. But executives at the largest U.S. bank resisted. They argued that branches are great billboards for the Chase brand and essential to attracting people who want to open accounts or make major transactions in person. Now it looks like the executives were right, or at least closer than other banks to delivering the right mix of physical and digital customer service. JPMorgan has grown deposits over the last five years faster than major competitors and twice as fast as the industry, according to analysts at Bernstein Research. Deposits in the Chase consumer bank grew in 2016 by 11 percent, or some $61 billion, the bank said when reporting quarterly results last week. Chase now has $607 billion in deposits, setting it up for a massive payoff if it can keep those funds and the company can lend them at higher interest rates in a stronger economy. We've been growing our deposits very strongly and we're going to enjoy the benefits, Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said on Friday. For the first time in roughly a decade, banks' ability to gather deposits is poised to matter mightily to financial performance. Interest rates are rising and the U.S. economy, which has been on the mend for a while, is expected to improve even more with stimulus from federal spending and tax cuts under the new government in Washington. Banks that did not take steps to grow deposits while loan demand was sluggish and interest rates were low may struggle to catch up in the coming years, experts said. JPMorgan has invested through the slower times, said Mike Mayo, an analyst at CLSA who has questioned JPMorgan's branch office strategy in the past. Now it's time for them to try to achieve a greater payoff. Struggles Ahead The full payoff is not a sure thing. Loan demand and lending rates could fall short. The economy might become so strong that depositors put their money to better use. Or, lending could be so attractive that JPMorgan rivals lure deposits away with higher and higher rates. Wary of fickle customers, JPMorgan executives say they are not offering high rates for deposits in a widespread, indiscriminate manner. We have among the lowest rates paid for deposits in the industry, Lake said in a conference call with journalists on Friday. We've been very disciplined. The Bernstein analysis concurred, finding that JPMorgan offers relatively little for deposits. Still, the bank has been using promotions to get more people in the door. For example, in recent months, Chase has been mailing offers of a $500 cash payment to new depositors who meet certain conditions, such as holding at least $15,000 in a savings account for three months. Such come-ons are a marketing expense and do not lower the profit margin the bank reports for its deposits, Lake said. Chase's consumer deposit profit margin has fallen for at least five years, reaching 1.8 percent in the fourth quarter, compared with 2.76 percent in the same period in 2011. It is difficult for outsiders to assess how customer-acquisition costs would depress that rate, or how many depositors lured through promotions will stay with the bank for the long haul, taking out the loans and paying the fees Chase expects. Flexing Muscle Much of JPMorgan's deposit growth was born through mistakes, the financial crisis and sheer necessity. Before 2007, Chase, like many banks, would lose a lot of customers each year because of poor service. Replacing them was expensive, but the churning expense could be covered by assorted fees, such as for overdrafts. That was sharply curtailed by post-crisis reform. Since then, banks have focused on better service to keep customers. JPMorgan also took over Washington Mutual during the crisis. WaMu had a branch network full of holes in California and Florida, which Chase has tried to plug with new locations. Deposit growth has been a byproduct. Regulator demands that banks shore up funding has also been a factor. Deposits are more stable than short-term financing from capital markets, and new requirements on banks favor deposits from consumers. A big chunk of Chase's additional deposits have also come from the bank's push to gain more investment management business from mass affluent individuals, who may not be multi-millionaires but still have a meaningful level of household wealth. They are often Chase customers already, who open Chase Private Client accounts through branches and are offered perks for higher balances. Perhaps the most substantial driver of Chase's deposit growth? Sheer size and scale: it has more resources than competitors to spend to build up deposits. It is about flexing their muscle, said Mayo.

The sukuk would add to the bank's previous taps of Turkey's domestic market, after it raised a combined 650 million lira via public and subordinated sukuk in 2016. It also raised $500 million via dollar-denominated sukuk in October. Kuveyt Turk, 62 percent owned by Kuwait Finance House , would sell the lira-denominated sukuk to qualified investors through its asset-leasing company, KT Kira Sertifikalari Varlik Kiralama, according to a regulatory filing. No timeframe or tenor were given for a potential deal from the latest sukuk programme. New funding could help the bank's plans to expand its branch network to 400 offices this year from a current 385, after it increased its net profit by 22 percent and total assets by 15 percent in 2016. In December, however, the bank said it would terminate all activities of its wholly-owned subsidiary in Dubai, which it setup in 2009, as it had not established a commercial advantage.

As Chinese companies have expanded overseas, the country's lenders, led by its big state-owned banks, have followed their customers, pushing their offshore loans to nearly $1 trillion at the end of 2015, up from more than $600 billion in 2010, according to the International Monetary Fund. That has exposed them to increasing scrutiny by overseas regulators trying to root out weaknesses that allow organised criminals and terrorist organisations to launder money. In a consent order published on Friday, New York's Department of Financial Services (DFS) said AgBank, China's third-biggest lender, violated anti-money-laundering (AML) laws by deliberately obscuring potentially suspicious transactions and silencing its compliance officer. It is not the first Chinese financial institution to find itself in the crosshairs of U.S. regulators. Bank of China Ltd  agreed with the U.S. Treasury Department in December to improve its AML procedures, and a few months earlier the U.S. Federal Reserve issued an enforcement action against China Construction Bank Corp   for similar issues. Chinese banks don't understand that by having a footprint in the United States they have to comply with U.S. regulations, said Philippa Allen, CEO of Hong Kong compliance consultancy ComplianceAsia. Even though they are often operating globally, these banks still tend to think of themselves as being Chinese, subject to Chinese rules. They have also been keeping prosecutors busy in Europe. Six Industrial and Commercial Bank of China   bankers were arrested in Spain in February, suspected of facilitating money laundering and fraud. The bank has said it implemented AML regulations and operated within the law. In Italy, prosecutors are preparing to bring Bank of China and its officials to preliminary hearings after a money-laundering investigation involving billions of euros allegedly smuggled back into China. BoC has denied any wrongdoing. Global Financial Integrity, a Washington-based watchdog, estimated that from 2004 to 2013 China was the world's biggest source of illicit outflows, accounting for about 28 percent of the $4.885 trillion in illicit funds moving from the 10 biggest source economies. Anti-money laundering and know-your-customer oversight at Chinese banks is not taken as seriously as it should be, said Fraser Howie, an independent China market analyst and co-author of the book Red Capitalism. The nature of Chinese business is often opaque in the best of times, so you have opaque businesses dealing with poorly supervised banks, Howie said. Earlier this year China's own banking regulator warned its commercial banks to strengthen risk controls in their overseas branches, including making adequate checks of borrowers. Agbank Failings In Friday's consent order, AgBank has agreed to install an independent monitor to review compliance for at least two years, signalling it is unlikely to open more branches or undertake new business in the United States during that time. The DFS found credible evidence of wrongdoing and serious and persistent compliance failures during its examinations in 2014, 2015 and 2016, the order said. AgBank declined to comment. In September, the U.S. Federal Reserve also ordered AgBank's New York branch to improve its AML safeguards, giving the lender 60 days to draw up a comprehensive plan. AgBank, which also operates branches in Frankfurt, Sydney, Tokyo and Seoul, obtained its New York licence in 2012 and holds about $9.5 billion in assets at the branch, according to the consent order. It is AgBank's only U.S. branch. The branch's core business remained helping mainland clients that are going global, Zhang Jian, head of the branch's business department, told China Business News in August. Among the findings in the consent order, AgBank failed to investigate unusually large round-number dollar transfers between Chinese trading companies and Russian lumber companies, payments from Yemen to Chinese firms in Zhejiang province, and from companies in the United Arab Emirates. AgBank also failed to adequately monitor transactions remitted by a Turkish Bank customer for its Afghan Bank client, which was known by the U.S. Treasury Department for its links to a network associated with narcotics traffickers and illicit cash flows. Invoices obtained by compliance personnel to investigate potentially suspicious transactions involving China and Russia appeared to be counterfeit or falsified, the order said. Other documents suggested U.S. dollar trade with Iranian counterparties, including a sanctioned Iranian party. Many dollar-denominated transactions using the SWIFT wire messaging system contained numeric codes that prevented AgBank compliance officials and regulators from properly screening the transactions or parties involved. When the chief compliance officer (CCO) shared those concerns with bank officials and the Fed, the bank moved to improperly curtail the CCO's independence, the consent order said. The branch CCO at the time, Natasha Taft, filed an $8 million whistleblower and gender discrimination suit that was settled in September. Taft did not return requests for comment.

William Dudley, president of the New York Fed branch that acts as the U.S. central bank's eyes and ears on Wall Street, has complained about rotten bank culture for years. In a speech to bankers and regulators in London, he said the Wells case showed that compensation, once again, seems to be at the center of a scandal. It was revealed last year that thousands of employees at the U.S.-based bank had opened perhaps millions of unauthorized customer accounts, a scandal that rocked the bank and led its chief executive, John Stumpf, to resign.

I'm open to anything that will move energy efficiency, Reid said in response to a reporter's question, referring to a bipartisan bill on promoting energy savings through revised building codes. The Senate is expected to debate the efficiency bill this week. It is sponsored by Senators Jeanne Shaheen, a New Hampshire Democrat, and Rob Portman, an Ohio Republican. The bill will likely be the last legislation debated on energy before midterm elections on Nov. 4, and Reid's comment suggested that a measure addressing Keystone approval could be added. Reid said that talks with Republicans are continuing and initially he thought there would be a vote on a non-binding sense of the Senate resolution expressing support for TransCanada Corp's pipeline. But now, Reid said, Republicans are asking for legislation that would have the force of law. Earlier this month, the State Department said it would again delay a decision on the pipeline, approval of which has been pending for more than five years, until the Nebraska Supreme Court settles a dispute over what path the pipeline should take.  The State Department leads the approval process because the pipeline would cross the national border. The White House has threatened to veto previous attempts by  Congress to force approval of the project, which would bring more than 800,000 barrels per day of Canada's oil sands petroleum to refiners along the U.S. Gulf. The northern leg of the pipeline would link to a southern branch that is already operational. The project divides Obama's base between environmentalists, who say the project would lead to an increase in emissions linked to climate change, and union members who say Keystone XL would create thousands of construction jobs. Even if a measure attached to the Shaheen-Portman bill passed the Senate and a similar bill passed in the House of Representatives, it is unlikely the Senate would have enough votes to overcome any veto by President Barack Obama. Senator John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, said Keystone supporters want more than a symbolic vote. We ought to have a vote that matters, he said. There should be a full blown debate on energy policy in the Senate, he added.    (Reporting By Richard Cowan, Timothy Gardner and Tom Ferraro; Editing by Ros Krasny and Sandra Maler)"

Anthony Thomson, who stepped down as Metro Bank chairman in 2012, said he would lead the new venture called Atom alongside Mark Mullen, who last month resigned as chief executive of First Direct, the online bank run by HSBC. Britain's financial regulator and lawmakers are keen to see new banks emerge to break the dominance of the country's biggest banks - Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays, HSBC and Royal Bank of Scotland - which control about three-quarters of the personal current account market. They believe a lack of competition was a factor in scandals such as the mis-selling of loan insurance and complex interest rate hedging products, which have cost banks around 25 billion pounds in compensation payouts. Thomson said on Wednesday there was a growing trend for customers to bank online instead of in branches and the marketplace had changed dramatically since 2010, when Metro became Britain's first new high-street bank for over a century. Bank branch usage has fallen off a cliff. Telephony as a means of accessing bank accounts is in decline. All of the explosive growth is in digital generally and mobile in particular, Thomson said. Thomson is one of several British retail bank executives to have told Reuters that the proportion of transactions taking place within branches is falling and that the pace of that decline is accelerating. A senior executive at one of Britain's biggest banks said the number of transactions taking place inside branches was falling by about 8 percent a year and that number was corroborated by other industry sources. RBS said this month that branch footfall had fallen 30 percent in the last three years and announced the closure of 44 branches. Industry sources say hundreds more could be shut by Britain's biggest banks in the next few years. The biggest five British banks have cut 912 UK branches since 2007. Lloyds, Britain's biggest retail bank with the largest branch network, pledged in February 2012 to keep all of its 2,900 branches open for at least three years, but industry sources expect Chief Executive Antonio Horta-Osorio to re-assess that commitment as part of a strategic update later this year. HSBC has cut 284 branches, or 19 percent of its network, and Santander, RBS and Barclays have cut 9-12 percent. The reduction has been gradual - Barclays, for example, has closed about 30 branches in each of the last five years. Thomson said he still believed there was a role for branch banking but forecast that the proportion of transactions taking place online will continue to rise. He intends to retain his significant shareholding in Metro Bank which has 22 branches and plans to expand to 150 by 2020. There is absolutely a space for Metro Bank because there are still people who use branches. We're not saying Atom is a bank for everyone, he said. Banks are expected to encourage customers to stop using branches for routine transactions and are changing layouts to better use technology, and will increasingly consolidate several branches into a more open flagship site. Thomson expects Atom, which will have no branches, to open for business in 2015. It will offer a full range of services to personal and business customers including current accounts.

The cautious reopening of the banks, and an increase in value added tax on restaurant food and public transport from Monday, are aimed at restoring trust inside and outside Greece after an aid-for-reforms deal last week averted bankruptcy. Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras is trying to turn a corner after he reluctantly agreed to negotiate a third bailout, allowing the European Central Bank to top up bank credit lines but prompting a rebellion in his leftist Syriza party. Capital controls and restrictions on withdrawals will remain in place but we are entering a new stage which we all hope will be one of normality, the head of Greece's banking association Louka Katseli told Skai television. Greeks will be able to withdraw 420 euros a week at once instead of just 60 euros a day, but the limit will effectively remain the same and capital controls will also stay in place. That's not a normal life so we have to negotiate quickly, Merkel said in extracts from an interview with German public broadcaster ARD. Merkel said it would be possible to talk about changing the maturities of Greece's debt or reducing the interest Athens has to pay after the first successful review of the new bailout package to be negotiated. Berlin, the biggest contributor to eurozone bailouts, would do all it could to bring talks to a successful conclusion but would negotiate hard to ensure Athens stuck to agreements, she said. That certainly won't be easy because there are things that we have discussed with all of the Greek governments since 2010 that have never been done but that have been done in other countries like Portugal and Ireland, she said. Elections Acceptance of the bailout terms that meant the banks could reopen marked a turnaround for Tsipras after months of difficult talks and a referendum that rejected a less stringent deal proposed by the lenders. He sacked party rebels in a government reshuffle on Friday and is seeking a swift start to talks on the bailout accord with European partners and the IMF before elections which Interior Minister Nikos Voutsis said were likely in September or October. But while opinion polls suggest the prime minister's popularity remains high, on the streets of Athens some were sceptical that the bank reopening would change much in a recession-hit country with over 25 percent unemployment rate. The banks opening tomorrow won't change anything for me, said 31-year old hotel worker Joanna Arvanitaki. I never used to withdraw 60 euros a day - 60 euros is what I had a week for my expenditure. Greeks will be able to deposit, although not cash, cheques, pay bills as well as have access to safety deposit boxes and withdraw money without an ATM card. Deposit boxes are not affected by the capital restrictions and clients can therefore take whatever they want from them, bank officials said. We are expecting queues in our branches in the first two or three days. Many people will ask to open their safe deposit boxes, an official at EFG Eurobank, the country's third-largest bank by assets, said. German Scepticism EU officials hope the bailout deal will be in place by mid-August when Greece needs to make new payments to the European Central Bank to redeem its maturing debt. A 7.16 billion euro bridge financing is enough to see Athens through July - including a July 20 ECB repayment - but not through August. German Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel said this deal could succeed where previous ones failed because the European Union now emphasises growth and investment rather than just austerity. It would depend on reforms being enacted and convincing the population that this is a path that allows Greece to assert itself rather than becoming a permanent alms-receiver, he said in extracts from a television interview. French President Francois Hollande, who pushed hard for a deal, said the Greek crisis had weakened Europeans' faith in the European project. What threatens us is not an excess of Europe but its insufficiency, he wrote in an op-ed in the Journal du Dimanche newspaper, reiterating calls for the creation of a euro zone government. Gabriel rejected accusations Germany had been too hard on Athens and criticised Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble for suggesting Greece could quit the euro zone temporarily. But in a sign of the challenge for euro zone leaders to convince their electorates of the merits of the deal, more than half of Germans think the planned deal with Greece is bad and many would have preferred it left the euro zone, a YouGov survey seen by German newspaper Welt am Sonntag showed. European Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis called on the Greek parliament to pass laws on reforms very quickly, in an interview due to be published in German newspaper Bild on Monday. He said negotiations on a third bailout for Greece would take several weeks, according to comments released ahead of publication. Dombrovskis defended the decision to grant Greece bridge financing even though the Greek parliament had not yet passed its whole reform program, saying that the funds were important to prevent the country from sliding into insolvency and had only been granted once the Greek parliament had passed some reforms. But he warned that the EU would in the worst case scenario hold off paying funds to Greece from the EU budget if Greece broke agreements and did not pay back the emergency loan. He said a Greek exit from the euro zone is not on our agenda, but Athens needed to stick to its agreements and carry out reforms in return for solidarity.

Quarterback Tom Brady was sacked four times, hit six times and hurried into poor throws. Such treatment has not often been the reality for Brady and the Patriots. The last time Bill Belichick's team lost on opening day was ten years ago. We're a long ways from the team that we're going to be, Brady said. We hate losing. It's a terrible feeling.

Hopefully it motivates us to go out there and have a great week of practice and prepare for this game. Go out there and try to beat a very good team.

I don't think there are any excuses for the way the outcome of the game was, Brady said. Hopefully we're better this week. Brady finds himself and his team in sole possession of last place in the AFC East for the first time in his 14-year career as a starter. The reasons for the loss in many ways are both simple and complex. The team put itself in long-yardage situations in a second half in which it failed to move the ball or score points. The running game never got going and the passing game was very much disrupted by a Cameron Wake-led pass rush. All that saw a 20-10 halftime advantage wilt into to defeat in the oppressive Miami heat. We have to be able to sustain it for 60 minutes, Brady said. We played a decent half of football. Then the second half we didn't play very well, the third quarter we played not well. That led into a fourth quarter where we were kind of playing from behind. That's always tough to do in the NFL. We just have to sustain it for 60 minutes, be consistent over the course of the entire game. And all just do our job better for an entire game. That's what leads to victory. You can't play 30 minutes and have a great outcome, especially against a good team, on the road. You have to play well for 60 minutes. That's what we're going to work toward doing. Things won't get a whole lot easier this week. Mike Zimmer joins the Vikings as head coach after a successful run leading the Bengals defense. That's a Zimmer-schemed Cincinnati unit that held Brady and Co. to just 6 points and one of 12 on third down in a loss last October. Minnesota brings a pressure defensive front that includes rising star Everson Griffen, who opened up the new season and his role replacing long time edge force Jared Allen by recording a pair of sacks in the win over the Rams. We know what we're up against, Brady said. We have to go out and play a lot better than we did last week. I have a lot of confidence in our guys. I have a lot of confidence in what we're doing. Now we just have to go out and do it. As competitive as any player in the league, and as distasteful as losing is to Brady, the Patriots quarterback certainly isn't planning on bringing an air of increased intensity to this work week in Foxborough. It may not be business as usual given the rare opening day loss and even rarer spot in last place, but it's also not time for emotion to overtake reason. I try to be pretty consistent with...hopefully my enthusiasm and excitement of being out there, Brady said. Nobody likes to lose. But it happens. It's happened before. We just have to figure out how to make some improvements and go out there and do a lot better next week. The only question is whether that's easier said than done. SERIES HISTORY: 12th regular-season meeting. Patriots lead series, 7-4. New England has won three straight in the infrequent series with the Vikings. The last victory, a 28-18 win in 2010, was notable in that it was Randy Moss' return to Foxborough shortly after having been trade from the Patriots to the Vikings. New England's 26-20 overtime win at old Foxboro Stadium back in 1994 saw Drew Bledsoe set NFL records with 45 completions on 70 passing attempts to come all the way back from the 20-point deficit for the victory. ----------------------------------------------- NFL Team Report - New England Patriots - NOTES, QUOTES --QB Tom Brady spent four years working alongside now Vikings starting QB Matt Cassel. Cassel went from surprise seventh-round draft pick after not playing in college at USC to leading the Patriots to 11 wins in 2008 after Brady went down to a torn ACL in the first quarter of action that season. Though Cassel is now in his sixth season away from New England - four with the Chiefs and now his second with the Vikings - but Brady still holds his former backup in very high regard. He's always been one of my great friends, Brady said. He's just a special guy, special friend. We're great buddies. I'm so happy for him for what he's been able to accomplish, but I hope we beat him up this week. It's just the way it goes. --Bill Belichick doesn't sound like he's completely in love with the tablets that all NFL teams are using on the sidelines this season to display digital photos of game action. He's praised the clarity and quality of the photos, but the reliability of the technology continues to be a concern for the New England coach. When it works, (I'm) comfortable with it. When it doesn't work, you have to find something else, Belichick said. It's no different than what we talked about after the first or second preseason game, it's the same issue now as it was then. It's probably going to be the same issue all year. The wireless system on the field, if it's connected then you can see what's on there. If it's not connected, then you can't see what's on there. That's really the issue. I'd say every game that we've used them in there have been times where it works fine. There are other times where you lose the connection and you don't have it. I'm sure that's probably true of most other teams, too, at least other coaches that I've talked to made the same type of comments. That's what it is. --WR Brandon LaFell was targeted six times in his New England debut against the Dolphins, but failed to register a single reception. The veteran free agent addition also was called for a pass interference penalty that negated a reception to teammate Danny Amendola because LaFell was blocking before the short catch. Clearly the newcomer is still trying to get comfortable in the Patriots offense and find a rapport with Brady. We're just continuing to work at it and going out in practice working on our routes and working on our communication and timing, and hopefully it pays off in the game, Brady said of the relationship. It's something we've been working on since we got here, and hopefully it shows up better this week than it did last week. BY THE NUMBERS: 1 - Number of weeks, including this week, that Tom Brady and the Patriots have spent in sole possession of last place in the AFC East since No. 12 took over as the starter in New England back in 2001. QUOTE TO NOTE: We know him; he knows us. - Bill Belichick on preparing for Vikings QB Matt Cassel, who spent the first four years of his career in New England. ----------------------------------------------- NFL Team Report - New England Patriots - STRATEGY AND PERSONNEL Player Notes --QB McLeod Bethel-Thompson was released from the New England practice squad Sept. 9. --DE Cameron Henderson joined the Patriots practice squad Sept. 9. The 6-4, 270-pounder entered the league as an undrafted rookie out of Central Florida with the Falcons in 2013. He spent time on the Browns practice squad last fall and was with the team this summer before being cut. --DE Michael Buchanan was limited in practice on Wednesday after missing the opener due to the injury. --TE Rob Gronkowski was limited in practice once again as the veteran continue to work back to full health from the torn ACL that had him seeing limited reps in the season opener in Miami. --DT Chris Jones was limited in practice on Wednesday due to the ankle injury suffered in the preseason opener that saw him sit out the regular season opener on Sunday. --DT Sealver Siliga was once again limited in practice due to the hand injury suffered in preseason action that required him to wear a cast in the regular season opener against the Dolphins. --C Ryan Wendell was limited in practice on Wednesday due to a knee injury suffered on Sunday against the Dolphins. --QB Tom Brady was not listed on the injury report and was a full participant in the first practice of the week. He missed practice last Thursday with a calf injury and was questionable last Sunday's game, a contest in which he struggled with his accuracy in the second half. Official Friday Injury Report (9-12-14) NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS at MINNESOTA VIKINGS New England Patriots --QUESTIONABLE: DE Michael Buchanan (ankle), LB Jamie Collins (thigh), DT Chris Jones (ankle), DT Sealver Siliga (hand), C Ryan Wendell (knee) --PROBABLE: TE Rob Gronkowski (knee) Minnesota Vikings --INACTIVE: RB Adrian Peterson (personal, legal issues) --OUT: LB Brandon Watts (knee) --QUESTIONABLE: DT Sharrif Floyd (shoulder), CB Xavier Rhodes (groin), WR Rodney Smith (hamstring) --PROBABLE: T Mike Harris (shoulder), G Charlie Johnson (ankle), RB Zach Line (ankle), LB Michael Mauti (foot), CB Jabari Price (hamstring) GAME PLAN: Initially, run defense was surely a focal point for the Patriot, who allowed 191 yards rushing against Miami. And although the Vikings have deactivated star running back Adrian Peterson, who was indicted for child abuse, perhaps the Patriots should still focus on stopping the run. Peterson had 21 carries for 75 yards in the Vikings' 34-6 season opening victory over the Rams last week. But he barely played in preseason and Mike Asiata, expected to start in Peterson's place Sunday had two carries for ten yards in the openers. That is, after all, five yards a carry against a Patriots team that has not prove it can stop a running back regardless of his name. For Asiata it will be his third start in three seasons. He had an impressive training camp and preseason leading up to the season, receiving praise from offensive coordinator Norv Turner as a do-it-all running back. Also available is rookie Jerick McKinnon, who had only three offensive snaps last week and is still adjusting to the offense. However, he is a shifty runner who can cause problems for a defense that takes him lightly. The Vikings have the option to activate Joe Banyard off the practice squad as the third running back. Regardless of who carries the ball for the Vikings, the Patriots need to declare whether or not to continue with the 3-4 front deployed in the opener despite a seeming lack of the requisite big bodies for the defensive line, or to return to the 4-3 front the team has used the last three seasons. Based solely on personnel, the latter would be the more likely solution. Offensively the Patriots will likely try to be a bit more consistent and committed to the running game a week after Stevan Ridley found little success and was held to eight attempts against the Dolphins. More consistency on the ground would not only balance out the offensive attack, but also take some of the pressure off an offensive line that is a work in progress and struggled mightily against the Dolphins. Given the pressure nature of the Vikings front, look for New England's passing attack to being with quick throws to get the ball out of Tom Brady's hands quickly and bring some efficiency to the air early on before branching out. MATCHUPS TO WATCH: Patriots LT Nate Solder vs. Vikings DE Everson Griffen. Pass protection was a major problem in the Patriots offensive struggles in the second half last week in Miami. Cameron Wake, Olivier Vernon and the Miami front was all over Tom Brady. While there is uncertainty on the interior line in New England, Solder is supposed to be developing into a Pro Bowl left tackle. He needs to be able to win battles with top opposing pass rushers, and that's what Griffen now is in Minnesota after the departure of Jared Allen. Griffen had a pair of sacks on opening day and would like nothing more to keep the momentum going as tries to prove himself worth of the $40 million extension he signed this spring. --Patriots tacklers vs. Vikings WR Cordarrelle Patterson. The Patriots didn't tackle all that well in Miami last Sunday and Patterson is a dynamic young athlete who has proven himself dangerous in a season-plus as a pass catcher, ball carrier or return man. Patterson rushed for more than 100 yards on opening day and will challenge the edge of the Patriots defense with his speed. In the passing game, Cordarrelle will probably see some of veteran Patriots CB Darrelle Revis, who wasn't exactly dominant in his opening-day battle with Mike Walace. Without Peterson, Patterson still remains a dangerous weapon for the Vikings."

The cautious reopening of the banks, and an increase in value added tax on restaurant food and public transport from Monday, are aimed at restoring trust inside and outside Greece after an aid-for-reforms deal last week averted bankruptcy. Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras is trying to turn a corner after he reluctantly agreed to negotiate a third bailout, allowing the European Central Bank to top up bank credit lines but prompting a rebellion in his leftist Syriza party. Capital controls and restrictions on withdrawals will remain in place but we are entering a new stage which we all hope will be one of normality, the head of Greece's banking association Louka Katseli told Skai television. Greeks will be able to withdraw 420 euros a week at once instead of just 60 euros a day, but the limit will effectively remain the same and capital controls will also stay in place. That's not a normal life so we have to negotiate quickly, Merkel said in extracts from an interview with German public broadcaster ARD. Merkel said it would be possible to talk about changing the maturities of Greece's debt or reducing the interest Athens has to pay after the first successful review of the new bailout package to be negotiated. Berlin, the biggest contributor to eurozone bailouts, would do all it could to bring talks to a successful conclusion but would negotiate hard to ensure Athens stuck to agreements, she said. That certainly won't be easy because there are things that we have discussed with all of the Greek governments since 2010 that have never been done but that have been done in other countries like Portugal and Ireland, she said. Elections Acceptance of the bailout terms that meant the banks could reopen marked a turnaround for Tsipras after months of difficult talks and a referendum that rejected a less stringent deal proposed by the lenders. He sacked party rebels in a government reshuffle on Friday and is seeking a swift start to talks on the bailout accord with European partners and the IMF before elections which Interior Minister Nikos Voutsis said were likely in September or October. But while opinion polls suggest the prime minister's popularity remains high, on the streets of Athens some were sceptical that the bank reopening would change much in a recession-hit country with over 25 percent unemployment rate. The banks opening tomorrow won't change anything for me, said 31-year old hotel worker Joanna Arvanitaki. I never used to withdraw 60 euros a day - 60 euros is what I had a week for my expenditure. Greeks will be able to deposit, although not cash, cheques, pay bills as well as have access to safety deposit boxes and withdraw money without an ATM card. Deposit boxes are not affected by the capital restrictions and clients can therefore take whatever they want from them, bank officials said. We are expecting queues in our branches in the first two or three days. Many people will ask to open their safe deposit boxes, an official at EFG Eurobank, the country's third-largest bank by assets, said. German Scepticism EU officials hope the bailout deal will be in place by mid-August when Greece needs to make new payments to the European Central Bank to redeem its maturing debt. A 7.16 billion euro bridge financing is enough to see Athens through July - including a July 20 ECB repayment - but not through August. German Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel said this deal could succeed where previous ones failed because the European Union now emphasises growth and investment rather than just austerity. It would depend on reforms being enacted and convincing the population that this is a path that allows Greece to assert itself rather than becoming a permanent alms-receiver, he said in extracts from a television interview. French President Francois Hollande, who pushed hard for a deal, said the Greek crisis had weakened Europeans' faith in the European project. What threatens us is not an excess of Europe but its insufficiency, he wrote in an op-ed in the Journal du Dimanche newspaper, reiterating calls for the creation of a euro zone government. Gabriel rejected accusations Germany had been too hard on Athens and criticised Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble for suggesting Greece could quit the euro zone temporarily. But in a sign of the challenge for euro zone leaders to convince their electorates of the merits of the deal, more than half of Germans think the planned deal with Greece is bad and many would have preferred it left the euro zone, a YouGov survey seen by German newspaper Welt am Sonntag showed. European Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis called on the Greek parliament to pass laws on reforms very quickly, in an interview due to be published in German newspaper Bild on Monday. He said negotiations on a third bailout for Greece would take several weeks, according to comments released ahead of publication. Dombrovskis defended the decision to grant Greece bridge financing even though the Greek parliament had not yet passed its whole reform program, saying that the funds were important to prevent the country from sliding into insolvency and had only been granted once the Greek parliament had passed some reforms. But he warned that the EU would in the worst case scenario hold off paying funds to Greece from the EU budget if Greece broke agreements and did not pay back the emergency loan. He said a Greek exit from the euro zone is not on our agenda, but Athens needed to stick to its agreements and carry out reforms in return for solidarity.

The decision to close the banks and impose capital controls from Monday was difficult, yet re-opening them and finding a way to lift the measures could prove even tougher, experts warned. Creditors said the door to negotiations remained open despite the government's decision to break off talks and put their latest cash-for-reforms offer to a referendum next Sunday, but that a no vote would signal an exit from the euro. In the best case scenario they manage the bank holiday, find a way to reopen the banks, stabilise the system like Cyprus, and deal with the fallout of higher NPLs (non-performing loans) and liquidity crunch. You find a path through, said a restructuring industry source who was not allowed to speak publicly. But the risk is you effectively have a state bankruptcy, and the banking system going bankrupt as well, he added. A Greek bank industry source concurred: Under a bad scenario we are in uncharted waters, (it) could end up with ruins, nationalised banks, he said. Greece said on Sunday it was closing banks all this week and capping withdrawals from ATMs at 60 euro a day to stem the outflow of cash from banks, from which about 40 billion euros  ($44.7 billion) of savings have flooded out this year, or a quarter of deposits. As the prospects for a deal receded, the European Central Bank (ECB) began refusing Greece's requests to raise the amount of emergency cash it is giving Greek banks, although the ECB is expected to let them keep using existing funds until the referendum, people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters. Greece is not the first European country to impose capital controls since the 2007/09 financial crisis, and Iceland and neighbor Cyprus showed such controls are rarely short-term. Cyprus closed its banks for two weeks in spring 2013 and limited withdrawals. Controls remained in place for two years, but the country was praised for stabilising its financial system and preventing a long, deep recession. Iceland imposed controls in 2008 after the collapse of its banks, and only this month started to ease restrictions. Things Move Quickly... On Monday, most retail staff were not working in branches, but all other bank employees were at work, and so were staff responsible for replenishing ATMs. Closing banks and restricting the flow of capital can build pressure for a solution as finances get squeezed. Once you start the closing of the banking system, things move quickly because every day you keep it closed you are aware of the consequences of doing so, the restructuring source said. It's easier to close the banks than it is to reopen them. You need a very clear plan for what's going to happen next when you reopen them, he said. The liquidity position of Greece's banks and the strength of their balance sheets are crucial to how severe and lengthy  capital controls will be. Greek banks are relying on 89 billion euros of emergency liquidity assistance (ELA) authorised by the ECB, but they are estimated to be near to using that capacity. While Greek authorities need to limit outflows, they also need to avoid crippling cash flow in the economy or squeezing the population too hard. Planning how far to go and how to re-open banks next week is also made near impossible by uncertainty about whether the ECB will extend liquidity, the threat Sunday's referendum may lead to Grexit, or the potential for another spell of political limbo following the referendum. A week of harsh controls might be enough to jolt the Greek people into reality over the dangers of not reworking a deal with public sector creditors, a second restructuring industry source said. While solving banks' liquidity position is most urgent, their solvency will need speedy attention, analysts said. Greek banks' core capital ratios (excluding tax credits) are all below 9 percent - the level investors typically want as a minimum - and range from just 4.9 percent at Eurobank  to 8.3 percent for Alpha Bank, Citigroup analyst Ronit Ghose estimated. And as the economy struggles, losses from bad loans and sovereign bonds could build. Recapitalization risks are high, Ghose said. In the event ELA funding is stopped, banks could be nationalised and carved into new banks alongside a multi-year workout of Greece's finances and economy, analysts and restructuring sources said. Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras is likely to be well aware of the political risks of capital control moves. When Argentina froze access to bank deposits in December 2001, for example, the popular backlash was so severe its president and his successor had resigned within a month.

Paytm Payments Bank will help the firm reach tens of millions of Indians who use mobile phones and cheap data services in the world's fastest-growing internet services market but do not have access to the formal banking sector. The payments bank will open 31 branches and 3,000 customer points in its first year, the company said in a statement. A payments bank is an institution that can take deposits and remittances but cannot lend. Paytm became a household name across India after New Delhi's shock move to ban high-value currency notes late last year resulted in a cash crunch and boosted the use of its electronic wallet. Paytm says more than 220 million clients use its e-wallet. Its success has attracted deep-pocketed investors such as Japan's SoftBank, which last week invested $1.4 billion in  Paytm parent One97 Communications. The firm's digital wallets will fold into its payment bank. The bank will offer an interest of 4 percent a year on savings accounts and also provide current account facility to merchants. It will have no minimum balance requirements and all online transactions will be free, the company said. The bank accounts will initially be available only through an invite. Chairman Vijay Shekhar Sharma, who owns a majority stake in the banking firm, said Paytm Payments Bank will invest its deposits in government bonds. None of our deposits will be converted into risky assets, Sharma said in the statement.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-crisis-police-idUSKCN0Y80WN","New police force finds old habits die hard in Ukraine","","May 17, 2016 /  8:59 AM / in a year","","KIEV (Reuters) - The launch of Ukraine's new police patrol force last year sparked an internet craze of citizens posting selfies with newly recruited officers. Their popularity stemmed not from their uniforms, body cameras and tablets, but the fact they did not demand bribes. The most visibly successful reform to have emerged from the pro-European Maidan protests in 2014 is now under threat, serving and former law enforcement officials say, accusing vested interests of seeking to obstruct and discredit the force. Vladyslav Vlasiuk, a lawyer by training who rose through patrol police ranks to become Chief of Staff of the National Police, quit in March, exhausted by the pushback against change, he told Reuters in his first media interview since. The experience he described shows how fragile Ukraine's progress in transforming itself into a Western-facing free market democracy could prove to be.  The police reform, possibly for the first time in the former Soviet republic's history, showed international partners that we in Ukraine are actually able to carry out some reforms, Vlasiuk said. Before Maidan, police would always do what the prosecutors say. Then it changed, he said. The National Police positioned itself as a separate and equal law enforcement power. Prosecutors did not like it. We are seeing the prosecution service chasing patrol officers for wrongdoings. There is now a tension which is blocking the reform of the national police. Deputy Minister Quits In Ukraine, prosecutors have the power to launch investigations into public servants suspected of wrongdoing -- a power which police officers say is being abused.  When you are working within any public service in Ukraine you have to be ready to deal with a lot of inspections, a lot of bullshit, a lot of irrelevant regulations, Vlasiuk said. And the prosecution is a controlling organ which can punish you for, in their opinion, improper actions, he said. The General Prosecutor's office did not provide immediate comment when asked about the allegations.  The United States and European Union, which are helping to fund a $40 billion aid-for-reform program for Ukraine, have repeatedly called for a clean-up of the General Prosecutor's office, which they see as a key obstacle to fighting corruption. Several high-profile reformers have been sacked from the government and prosecution service or resigned in frustration. First Deputy Interior Minister Eka Zguladze has also quit, to take on an advisory role in the ministry. Her resignation statement on Wednesday gave no reason but contained a warning over the fate of reforms.  I want to emphasize that these islands of success will drown in the ocean of corruption, nihilism, the bureaucracy, if we do not build bridges between them, creating a continent, she said. And if in Ukraine we do not have the strength to go forward, the door, that we just opened, may close forever. The System Strikes Back With the help of U.S. money and training, and headed by a former Georgian minister, the new police force was set up as part of a root-and-branch reform to weed out endemic corruption.  Members of the newly created special police team KORD take part in a demonstration as part of a ceremony to commemorate finishing their training course at a base outside Kiev, Ukraine, May 6, 2016.Valentyn OgirenkoThe new patrol section was launched in July and incorporated into a revamped National Police force. The patrol officers seemed to be everything those dreaming of a new Ukraine after Maidan hoped: committed, trustworthy, less susceptible to bribes and not afraid to go after the rich and the powerful.  Drawn from all walks of life, they carried smart tablets as well as body cameras to make police work transparent. In a sign of changing times, Energy Minister Ihor Nasalik announced on Friday he'd been given a parking fine -- and willingly paid.  Vlasiuk, 27, was part of a new generation of Young Turks entering public service after Maidan. He is in the process of setting up an NGO to provide legal assistance to officers and burnish the police's image nationally. His former boss, a Georgian technocrat called Khatia Dekanoidze in charge of the National Police, described in a separate interview cases of vested interests undermining change. An initiative to fire corrupt or incompetent officers by vetting them in a reattestation process has led to hundreds of lawsuits by sacked officers, some of whom got their jobs back.  Dekanoidze said judges were deliberately reinstating discredited officers for fear the judiciary could be next. This is a revenge of the old system, because the judiciary system, especially courts, they are part of the old system, Dekanoidze said.  Slideshow (5 Images)There are other obstacles to reforms. The police budget is tight in a country at war with Russian-backed separatists and an economy that shrank by a tenth last year. Keep Calm and Support Police An incident that has grown into a cause celebre for the police occurred on the night of Feb 7. A police car chased a speeding BMW through the streets of Kiev, recorded on a black and white police camera in footage later broadcast on TV.  Starting with warning shots, three police officers fired a total of 34 bullets at the car during the course of a 40 minute chase, according to an interior ministry spokesman. Eventually, one of the bullets killed a 17-year-old passenger inside.  Prosecutors accused the officer of wilful murder and abuse of authority; he is under house arrest while they investigate.  Police said the officer was trying to protect the public from a driver who was drunk. Their supporters protested in Kiev holding banners saying Keep Calm and Support Patrol Police and the hashtag #savepolice appeared on Twitter. Anton Gerashchenko, a lawmaker and member of the interior ministry council, said the case was an example of prosecutors seeking to show they remained in control by discrediting police. Dekanoidze echoed that view. Police reform is the only reform that is visible, that is a real reform for Ukrainians, she said. So when prosecutors went after those defending the lives of ordinary Ukrainians, it looked like The Inquisition. She added there were other cases when police had gone after illegal gambling rackets -- only for prosecutors to open criminal cases against the officers.  A Western diplomat, who did not want to be identified by name, said the fight back by prosecutors showed reforms were starting to have a real impact. Prosecutors here are millionaires, the diplomat said.  They are powerful people who will fight to the very end to protect the resources vertical they created.  Much will hinge on the performance of the new General Prosecutor, Yuriy Lutsenko, a former interior minister whose appointment on Thursday raised eyebrows because he had no legal background. Dekanoidze said she hopes prosecutors under Lutsenko will cooperate with the police. Because ... without a good and fair prosecution, police can't do anything.

    John Stumpf, the company's CEO when the scandal broke, also announced his retirement in
October, following weeks of intense public pressure. He was succeeded by Tim Sloan.

the U.S. Department of Justice, as well as a number of private lawsuits, according to

"https://www.reuters.com/article/morgan-stanley-wealth-idUSL2N1GL1E7","Morgan Stanley hiring hundreds into wealth unit to train technophobe advisers","","March 13, 2017 /  6:38 PM / 4 months ago","","(Reuters) - Morgan Stanley is hiring hundreds of tech-savvy specialists at its wealth management branches to train advisers on the firm's new digital tools, the bank's co-head of wealth management Andy Saperstein said in an interview.      The digital adviser associates will help advisers get up to speed on new products, such as software that recommends customized investment ideas and apps that let advisers text or video chat with clients. They will also help advisers promote their presence through social media, Saperstein added.      The effort is part of a broader technology push by Morgan Stanley, which has been investing heavily in new digital tools and products, many of which will be rolled out later this year.    Although the tools will not necessarily generate revenue, they will help financial advisers do their jobs better, Morgan Stanley Chief Executive James Gorman said in January. They may also attract and retain customers who prefer digital options.     “We’ve realized that our ability to invest resources in tools and technology is only as good as the advisers’ ability to implement this into their practices, Saperstein said on Friday. We need to figure out ways to support advisers in that change. The digital specialists will be trained at Morgan Stanley's Purchase, New York wealth headquarters. They will then move to branches throughout the U.S. beginning this summer. They may eventually be incorporated onto adviser teams, Saperstein said.      Morgan Stanley’s digital revamp reflects a broader industry effort to keep wealth management relevant to younger Americans, who are accustomed to conducting their financial lives online and may not see the need for professional advisers.     The average age of a wealth management customer industry-wide is 62, according to data services company Pricemetrix, while the average age of a financial adviser is 51, according to research firm Cerulli Associates. Only 11 percent of advisers are under the age of 35.  As traditional brokerages get older, several wealth-management startups have been launched, offering automated, low-cost investment advice geared at younger clients. These so-called “robo-advisers,” like Wealthfront and Betterment, manage clients’ money using algorithms and allow clients to see and alter their investments online, bypassing human advisers.     Morgan Stanley plans to introduce its own digital-only investment platform later this year, geared primarily toward children of existing clients. It is also using technology to automate some of the rote processes in branches, like opening accounts, to free advisers to spend more time with clients.     Morgan Stanley has made a number of key hires to build out its digital department, including Naureen Hassan, who joined as chief digital officer for the wealth business from Charles Schwab & Co Inc last year. It has also hired several technology executives from Bank of America's Corp Merrill Lynch wealth unit. Reporting by Olivia Oran in New York"

Nigeria The Nigerian naira is seen easing slightly against the dollar on the parallel market in the coming days as the central bank moves to release details of its new flexible exchange rate policy. The local currency was quoted at 368 to the dollar on the black market on Friday, compared with 350 last week. The naira was trading at 197.50 a dollar on the official interbank market, around the peg rate of 197. The head of United Bank for Africa (UBA) Philips Oduoza said on Thursday details of Nigeria's flexible currency model will be ready in a short while, after chief executives of the country's lenders met with central bank officials. The announcement halted the free fall of the naira, while many traders expecting that the announcement of the detail would spur the alignment of the parallel market rate and the official window. Kenya The Kenyan shilling was expected to weaken next week because of emerging demand for dollars from energy and telecommunications firms, traders said. They said the shilling was likely to slip to between 101.50 and 102.20 to the dollar. At 1004 GMT, commercial banks quoted the shilling at 101.05/25 compared with 100.90/101.00 at Thursday's close. Uganda The Ugandan shilling was seen weakening over the coming days, with a government anouncement of a cut back in planned domestic borrowing fuelling hopes of better credit flow to the private sector and an uptick in dollar purchases. At market close on Wednesday commercial banks quoted the shilling at 3,345/3,355, stronger than last Thursday's close of 3,355/3,365.  Markets were closed in Uganda on Thursday as it was a national holiday. In a budget speech on Wednesday, finance minister Matia Kasaija said the government would borrow 612 billion Ugandan shillings in the 2016/2017 (July-June) fiscal year, down from 1.4 trillion shillings in the previous period. Ghana Ghana's cedi could remain under pressure next week on unmet dollar demand from local importers, an analyst said. The local unit, which has been under pressure this month, opened Thursday's trading at 3.9275 to the dollar, compared to 3.8900 last week. The cedi is expected to be on the back foot in the week ahead on growing demand for the greenback, analyst Joseph Biggles Amponsah of the Accra-based Dortis Research said. He projected that the dollar-cedi rate could breach 3.95 levels. Zambia The kwacha is expected to remain under pressure versus the U.S dollar next week due to limited dollar inflows. At 1254 GMT, the kwacha was trading at 10.7550 per dollar, softer than a close of 10.5000 a week ago. Supply (of dollars) has been thin going for extended periods with no major inflows, the Zambian branch of South Africa's First National Bank (FNB) said in a note.

But the move, detailed at Wells Fargo's investor day, failed to impress Wall Street, because management also indicated that revenue growth is suffering from the scandal, which involved employees creating as many as 2.1 million unauthorized accounts in customers' names to hit sales targets. The San Francisco-based bank's stock was down 1.7 percent at $53.81 in afternoon trading. Wells Fargo plans to reduce expenses by another $2 billion through the end of 2019, on top of a $2 billion cost-cutting target management previously announced. The cuts come after repeated questions from analysts and investors about why Wells Fargo was not doing more to reduce costs, which have been high by some measures when compared to U.S. banking rivals. But the scandal has only increased costs, as the bank has tried to fix practices internally and respond to regulatory inquiries and public backlash. During the investor day event, executives said they understood investor concerns and would take action. Chief Executive Tim Sloan used the word unacceptable at least twice, in reference to prior sales practices and expense levels. Management had been trying to keep expenses in a range of 55 percent to 59 percent of revenue, but in the first quarter that ratio soared to 62.7 percent. Operating at this level is completely unacceptable, Sloan said. As Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry began his presentation, he joked to the crowd: Raise your hand if you're interested in hearing about expenses at Wells Fargo. He said the bank plans to get back into its targeted ratio in the coming years. A Wells Fargo logo is seen in New York City, U.S. January 10, 2017.Stephanie KeithThe sales abuses in Wells Fargo's branch banking operation led to a $190 million regulatory settlement, launches of other government probes, the firing of several bankers, the departure of CEO John Stumpf and shareholders offering scant support for most directors at the bank's annual meeting last month. Nearly all of the executives speaking on Thursday, including Sloan, are in new positions entered after the scandal erupted in September. Wells Fargo's investor day is typically a biannual event, but management held it a year early to provide more information about how they are running the bank. Sloan and his deputies indicated that the scandal had impacted revenue, either because some customers may be less inclined to do business with the bank or because reforms to business practices have hurt sales.  For instance, Wells Fargo has changed pay structures so that instead of being incentivized to boost sales figures, employees are encouraged to deliver products and services customers actually need. While executives have described such reforms as necessary, they may also be hurting revenue. We had an incentive program and high-pressure sales culture in our community bank that drove behavior that was at times inappropriate and inconsistent with our values, Sloan said, noting that management took too long to appreciate seriousness of the problem. Wells Fargo bankers are getting fewer referrals from branches for personal loans and home-equity loans, said Franklin Codel, an executive in the consumer lending unit. That has led to a 3 percent decline in business, though trends appear to be stabilizing, he said. The credit card business has also been hurt by the scandal, said Avid Modjtabai, who heads Wells Fargo's payments, virtual solutions and innovation group. The rate of new credit card account openings has recently picked up, but Modjtabai did not say when she expects the business to fully recover. Overall, Wells Fargo expects net interest income to grow in the low-to-mid single percentage points this year, which some analysts characterized as disappointing, as were executives' assertions that Wells will not hit its cost efficiency ratio this year. The new cost-cutting guidance fell roughly in the middle of analyst expectations. A big chunk of the savings will come from Wells Fargo's plan to close 450 branches in 2017 and 2018, roughly 10 percent more than its previous target. Wells Fargo has been slower to cut branches than rivals like Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) or Citigroup Inc (C.N). It is a quick way to slash expenses, though some banks, including JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), have been cautious about trimming branch networks because doing so can hurt revenue. Through Wednesday's close, Wells Fargo's shares had risen 6 percent over the past six months, lagging gains of 14.1 percent for JPMorgan and 28.7 percent for Bank of America.

During a question-and-answer session before the Colorado Rockies beat the New York Mets 10-3, leaving them with a 15-13 record, Selig was asked if he had any concern about the Mets, who despite playing in New York began the season with a payroll of about $89 million that ranked 22nd in the majors. I just talked to Sandy Alderson on the field, who I have enormous respect for, Selig said. I think the Mets are playing better. I think the Mets feel that they're better. And I have a lot of faith not only in the Wilpons, but in Sandy Alderson. And he tells me the farm system will produce the kind of talent they need to do better. Selig said rebuilding a farm system is a slow process and recalled how Branch Rickey said it takes three to five years before a farm system or a trade can be judged and that Rickey was right. I'm watching a lot of organizations, because this question comes up not only about the Mets but about other clubs, and you can see the byproducts of the true farm system working, Selig said. They may not work as fast as you'd like, but the Mets have played much better so far this year. And the independent people that I talk to -- and I do have other people grading other clubs' farm systems -- give the Mets very high marks. Selig was then asked whether the Mets had the capacity to spend more and raise their payroll to a level more typical of New York. He answered, I said to you, and I mean this sincerely, and if I didn't I wouldn't say it: I am not the last bit concerned about the Mets' ability to compete at the major league level. ----------------------------------------------- MLB Team Report - New York Mets - NOTES, QUOTES Record: 15-13 STREAK: Lost two NEXT: Mets (Jenrry Mejia, 3-0, 3.49) at Rockies (Franklin Morales, 3-1, 4.40) Player Notes: --RHP Zach Wheeler, who made his 23rd career start and sixth this season, lasted four innings and allowed seven runs, six earned. This was the shortest outing of his career and the most runs he has allowed in any career start. --CF Juan Lagares went 2-for-5 with a double for his second consecutive multi-hit game since coming off the disabled list Thursday. Lagares, who pulled his right hamstring April 14, extended his hitting streak to 11 games since April 5. During his streak, Lagares is hitting .333 (15-for-45) with four doubles, six RBI and five runs scored. --C Travis d'Arnaud went 1-for-4. After going hitless in his first six games d'Arnaud is hitting .303 (10-for-33) over his past 10 games. He hit a three-run homer in the ninth inning Thursday off Chad Bettis that resulted in the final score as the Mets lost 7-4. Manager Terry Collins said of d'Arnaud, He's using the field to hit, not trying to do anything special. The at-bats at home, I thought he used the middle of the field better. (Thursday) night, I thought he took a good swing at a pitch that you've got to take a good swing at. When he first got here last year, he wanted to prove that he was an outstanding defensive catcher. That was his goal. Now, he's accomplished that, and it's about trying to make his offense a part of his game. --2B Daniel Murphy's streak of 28 consecutive stolen bases ended in the first. He got a big running lead from second base, but pitcher Jorge De La Rosa stepped off the mound and threw Murphy out at third. Murphy's streak dated to June 9, 2013 and was the second-longest streak in club history, behind Kevin McReynolds' 33 straight stolen bases from 1987-1989. QUOTE TO NOTE: All my balls were running. My two-seamer was cutting (rather than sinking.) When they did hit it, they found holes. It was one of those days that I got my ground balls, but they found holes. -- RHP Zack Wheeler, after a 10-3 loss to the Rockies on Friday. ----------------------------------------------- MLB Team Report - New York Mets - ROSTER REPORT Medical Watch: --RHP Bobby Parnell (Tommy John surgery in April 2014) went on the 15-day disabled list retroactive to April 1. He will miss the entire season. --RHP Matt Harvey (Tommy John surgery in October 2013) went on the 60-day disabled list March 30. He was throwing off flat ground in Port St. Lucie, Fla., during spring training, and he will rehab in New York during the season.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/china-debt-bonds-idUSL3N1861HC","Shanghai breaks new ground with free-zone renminbi bonds","","May 9, 2016 /  2:56 AM / a year ago","","* Market participants puzzled by positioning of new market segment By Ina Zhou HONG KONG, May 9 (IFR) - China is drawing up a pilot scheme to give foreign investors easier access to renminbi-denominated bonds in the Shanghai Free Trade Zone as soon as this month. The initiative will allow foreign investors to clear and settle the bonds using an international central securities depository account with a link to the Shanghai Clearing House. Many observers see the move as the first step to link the broader onshore bond market to offshore investors. However, market participants are also raising questions over the need for such a middle-ground market between the existing offshore Dim Sum market and the massive onshore bond market, predicting that FTZ bond activity will be limited by a number of barriers. While bonds issued in the FTZ will give issuers more freedom to move capital, there are concerns that the extra approvals investors require will end up limiting domestic demand and fragmenting further China's bond market.   Shortcut  SCH, one of the three central securities depositories in China, held a conference in London a week ago to promote renminbi bonds in the FTZ and explain the scheme. Domestic and foreign entities need to file with the People's Bank of China or register with the National Association of Financial Market Institutional Investors to issue FTZ bonds. They have to release information on the website of the clearing house. The procedure does not differ much from the steps needed to issue regular onshore bonds or Panda bonds in the interbank bond market. However, the scheme offers foreign investors the option to open settlement accounts via an international or local central securities depository, freeing them from having to deal with Chinese clearing houses as is the case for foreign investors that invest in regular onshore bonds outside the FTZ. The programme also allows approved pilot commercial banks to transfer existing bonds from the domestic market to the FTZ, according to the presentation. SCH did not respond to IFR's request for more details on the plan.      Limited interest SCH claims in the presentation that FTZ bonds will provide a new market for offshore renminbi, offering corporate bonds with full range of credit profiles and yields. Nevertheless, market participants are not convinced the FTZ will be an attractive venue. If issuers want offshore renminbi, they can tap the Dim Sum bond market, which is market-driven and has a diverse international investor base. Furthermore, issuers may need to pay higher yields to issue FTZ bonds compared to regular onshore bonds, given the far lower liquidity in the offshore renminbi market and in the FTZ. Chinese banks studied the feasibility of issuing renminbi bonds from their branches in the FTZ, but such plans were finally dropped, an onshore lawyer said. Issuers would not get any benefit from issuing the FTZ bonds, he said. The procedures are the same as that of regular interbank bonds. Potential foreign issuers want FTZ bonds to be more aligned with international standards. If we see FTZ renmimbi bonds as an extension to the offshore market, foreign issuers should be able to use their existing international MTN programmes in the FTZ, said a banker at a foreign bank. Market participants also doubt that Chinese credits will be of huge interest to foreign investors, as most of them do not venture beyond Chinese government bonds and financial bonds. However, as the majority of the bonds now deposited in the SCH are corporate bonds, it means that the majority of credits available in the FTZ for investors will be, too. Liquidity is another obstacle to the development of the FTZ market. Not all domestic or foreign institutions are able to open FTZ accounts (cash accounts) in order to trade FTZ bonds, which means the renminbi liquidity flowing to the zone will be limited, said a Shanghai-based onshore underwriter who took part in early discussions with the SCH on the FTZ bonds.  Test ground  So, why bother creating a new market if the prospect of success is dim? According to the bond underwriter, the Shanghai municipal government has been mulling the introduction of more financial innovations partly to save face, as the Shanghai FTZ, set up in 2013, has yet to deliver on its great promise. The government had thought of issuing municipal bonds in the FTZ, but the plan was not carried out, he said. Looking at the initiative in a broader context, it could be the testing ground for greater liberalisation of capital accounts as mainland Chinese entities and FTZ entities can move renminbi freely between them. They (SCH) don't intend to develop a huge market of FTZ bonds, said a source close to interbank regulators. What they are trying to do, I think, is to try out innovations that currently cannot be replicated across the country. For instance, direct access for foreign investors to renminbi bonds. Rules remain vague, though SCH has said the renminbi business will be launched this month. More clues may emerge soon as Shanghai International Port Group is marketing a debut FTZ renminbi bond after securing domestic ratings a few months ago, according to market sources. The market is eagerly waiting for the first issue and, if a precedent is set that an issuer has to use the SCH, that would make things more complicated for foreign issuers, said the banker at a foreign bank. For offshore renminbi bonds, foreign issuers want to use Clearstream. They don't want to use SCH, unless there are good and compelling economic reasons to do so.

Anthony Thomson, who stepped down as Metro Bank chairman in  2012, said he would lead the new venture called Atom alongside Mark Mullen, who last month resigned as chief executive of First Direct, the online bank run by HSBC. Britain's financial regulator and lawmakers are keen to see new banks emerge to break the dominance of the country's biggest banks - Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays, HSBC and Royal Bank of Scotland - which control about three-quarters of the personal current account market. They believe a lack of competition was a factor in scandals such as the mis-selling of loan insurance and complex interest rate hedging products, which have cost banks around 25 billion pounds in compensation payouts. Thomson said on Wednesday there was a growing trend for customers to bank online instead of in branches and the marketplace had changed dramatically since 2010, when Metro became Britain's first new high-street bank for over a century. Bank branch usage has fallen off a cliff. Telephony as a means of accessing bank accounts is in decline. All of the explosive growth is in digital generally and mobile in particular, Thomson said. Thomson is one of several British retail bank executives to have told Reuters that the proportion of transactions taking place within branches is falling and that the pace of that decline is accelerating. A senior executive at one of Britain's biggest banks said the number of transactions taking place inside branches was falling by about 8 percent a year and that number was corroborated by other industry sources. RBS said this month that branch footfall had fallen 30 percent in the last three years and announced the closure of 44 branches. Industry sources say hundreds more could be shut by Britain's biggest banks in the next few years. The biggest five British banks have cut 912 UK branches since 2007. Lloyds, Britain's biggest retail bank with the largest  branch network, pledged in February 2012 to keep all of its 2,900 branches open for at least three years, but industry sources expect Chief Executive Antonio Horta-Osorio to re-assess that commitment as part of a strategic update later this year. HSBC has cut 284 branches, or 19 percent of its network, and Santander, RBS and Barclays have cut 9-12 percent. The reduction has been gradual - Barclays, for example, has closed about 30 branches in each of the last five years. Thomson said he still believed there was a role for branch banking but forecast that the proportion of transactions taking place online will continue to rise. He intends to retain his significant shareholding in Metro Bank which has 22 branches and plans to expand to 150 by 2020. There is absolutely a space for Metro Bank because there are still people who use branches. We're not saying Atom is a bank for everyone, he said. Banks are expected to encourage customers to stop using branches for routine transactions and are changing layouts to better use technology, and will increasingly consolidate several branches into a more open flagship site. Thomson expects Atom, which will have no branches, to open for business in 2015. It will offer a full range of services to personal and business customers including current accounts.

The name of the whistleblower was not disclosed. We take seriously the concerns of current and former team members, wrote Wells Fargo spokeswoman Richele Messick in an emailed statement to Reuters. This decision is a preliminary order and to date there has been no hearing on the merits of this case. We disagree with the findings and will be requesting a full hearing of the matter. Wells Fargo was fined last year for opening up to 2.1 million customer accounts without their knowledge over several years to meet aggressive sales targets.  The revelation damaged the bank's reputation, spurred investors to sell its shares for several weeks and led to the resignation of its chief executive last year. Despite news reports and lawsuits claiming the bank had retaliated against whistleblowers, an investigative report by the bank's board of directors released on April 10 said based on a limited review completed to date, outside law firm Shearman & Sterling had not identified a pattern of retaliation against employees in Wells Fargo's branch banking unit who complained about sales pressure or practices. In a different case, the Department of Labor in April ordered Wells Fargo to reinstate a whistleblower, though that former staffer's concerns related to bank, mail and wire fraud -things that were not at issue in the sales practices scandal. Wells Fargo still faces probes from federal, state and local government agencies including the U.S. Department of Justice, as well as a number of private lawsuits, according to its quarterly securities filing in May.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-banks-strategy-analysis-idUSKBN1852PF","As China's banks swap corporates for retail borrowers, risks rise","","May 9, 2017 /  11:08 PM / 3 months ago","","SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's lenders are swapping struggling corporates for more promising retail borrowers - restructuring branches, teams and even overhauling bankers' commissions in an unprecedented push that is fuelling a record jump in home loans. Yet the speed of the switch, the pressure to pull in more borrowers and soaring house prices are also worrying loan officers, analysts and regulators, with the central bank governor among those sounding a note of caution. Corporate lending has long made up the bulk of many Chinese banks' loan books: the deals are larger and loans have more attractive rates. But with firms faltering, economic growth slowing for key sectors and banks under pressure to deleverage, lenders are eyeing other options. While retail lending also includes credit cards and consumer loans, mortgage lending has been a focus for China's big five banks since the push began in earnest last year.  Mortgage lending was up around 30 percent for the big five in 2016, the fastest growth in five years, while property lending in China accounted for 40.4 percent of new loans in the first quarter, data from the People's Bank of China (PBOC) showed. Mortgages in China are among the safest loans - they are secured, of course, and conservative borrowing also means loan-to-value ratios (LTV) as low as under 40 percent. However, bankers, investors and analysts say the latest retail push has seen unprecedented pressure, tough targets and hard-hitting sales tactics - with some drawing comparisons to the pre-financial crisis years in the United States. There was quite a lot of (skirting mortgage rules) last year, said Chen Shujin, a banking analyst from Huatai Securities. We do think this will have an impact on the quality of mortgages and bank assets.  Mortgage growth is also set to slow this year, credit analysts say. Many cities have introduced a raft of measures to cool property prices that have surged beyond the reach of many Chinese, posing growing financial risks.  China's central bank did not respond to requests for comment, though governor Zhou Xiaochuan has cautioned on the need for balance as mortgages jump, according to local media. The China Banking Regulatory Commission also did not respond to requests for comment.      More Loans, More Trouble? Among the concerns is the pressure on bankers to radically accelerate the number of loans they push through.  It doesn’t matter whether you were from the corporate team, or SME team, now 50 percent of your targets are retail borrowing targets, said one banker at Ping An Bank (000001.SZ).  FILE PHOTO: A customer takes her bankbook from a smart banking machine at a branch of ICBC bank in Beijing, China, April 13, 2016.Kim Kyung-Hoon/File PhotoPing An increased its retail assets under management by 13.6 percent in the first quarter alone as part of a major strategic shift in focus from corporate to retail.  At one branch, many bankers now have to open 60 retail accounts a year, two Ping An bankers said. Bankers with retail experience have been promoted to head many of the lender's sub-branches, they added. To incentivise bankers, Ping An is providing higher commissions for retail wins. Bankers who don't hit their targets for the sale of an unpopular product face penalties, according to the Ping An bankers.  There was no suggestion bankers at Ping An had skirted mortgage rules. Ping An said it disputed some elements of the bankers' account, without clarifying which parts. But similar accounts emerge across the sector.  Rival lender CITIC Bank has changed its sub-branches from handling both corporate and retail lending to just focusing on one or the other, with more in some areas focused on retail, according to the website and two bankers. We're slowly moving towards retail by hiring more bankers with retail experience, said one vice-president of a CITIC Bank sub-branch. CITIC Bank did not respond to requests for comment. Again, there was no evidence its bankers were side-stepping loan rules. While the high pressure practices have drawn some comparisons to the U.S. property bubble, analysts noted Beijing can exert far more control on its banking system, much of which is state owned. Mortgage-backed securities and other financial instruments that helped aggravate the U.S. problems are also less developed in China, although volumes are growing steadily. Residential mortgage-backed securities in 2016 tripled from a year earlier to 138.2 billion yuan ($20 billion), according to China Central Depository & Clearing Co Ltd.     With average property deposits last year of close to 50 percent, risks are manageable, said Huatai's Chen. Still, a report by Moody's Investors Services this month  noted that while Chinese mortgages have historically shown very low risk, the latest loan originations are likely to entail a high level of risk, because of the sharp rise in property prices in 2016.

The new restaurant, whose opening in a Vatican-owned building on Dec. 30 upset some purists, donated dozens of meals on Monday to a charity which distributed them at a walk-in clinic in Rome. Pope Francis has made defence of the poor and needy a cornerstone of his papacy, setting up shower stalls for the homeless near the Vatican, offering meals and even a VIP-style visit to the Sistine Chapel. On Monday, homeless and needy people came to claim their double cheeseburger, chopped apple and bottle of water. Pierfrancesco Spiga, 46, a Rome native who lost his job as a gardener and now sleeps in a residence run by a cooperative, said other companies should take up the initiative. It would be good if these multi-national companies gave food at the end of the day to poor people who don't have any, instead of throwing it away, Spiga said. Some cardinals disapproved of the Vatican's leasing the building on the cobble-stoned Borgo Pio to the U.S. chain, and one said the space would be better used to shelter the needy. McDonald's, which did not comment on the initiative, pledged 1,000 meals which will be distributed by the Medicina Solidale charity over the next six months. The project was born when Medicina Solidale's director wrote to McDonald's after the controversy over the site, charity representative Fotini Iordanoglou said outside the restaurant just steps from St. Peter's Square. McDonald's responded, giving us this chance to help, Iordanoglou said. We absolutely won't resolve hunger but we are trying to give a small meal to people who need it. Fifty lunches were served on Monday. A spokesman for the non-profit group said they hope to offer 100 once a week, and will look into whether the project can be made permanent.

Trudeau, 45, came to power in November 2015 promising to run an open and accountable administration but has been dogged by repeated questions about his luxury Bahamas vacation over the New Year, which his officials first declined to talk about. Opposition legislators say the holiday was inappropriate since Ottawa helps fund the Aga Khan's foundation, and shows Trudeau is out of touch with ordinary Canadians at a time when the economy is struggling. The travel back and forth from (the Bahamian capital) Nassau to the island happens on the Aga Khan's private helicopter, which he offered us the use of ... we don't see an issue on that, he told a televised news conference in Kingston, Ontario, during a cross-country tour to meet voters. The Aga Khan, the wealthy leader of the Ismaili branch of Shi'ite Islam, is a close Trudeau family friend. Under ethics rules which Trudeau himself introduced in 2015, government ministers may not take private flights without first getting approval from Mary Dawson, the country's conflict of interest and ethics commissioner. Asked why he flew on the helicopter without consulting Dawson, Trudeau said he would happily answer any questions she might have. Dawson has already opened a preliminary inquiry into opposition complaints about the vacation. Trudeau, who faces a separate probe by Dawson into fundraising by his Liberal party, last week scrapped a trip to the World Economic Forum in Davos and announced the cross-country tour.

Retail banking has been strong throughout, Soren Kring Nikolajsen told Reuters. Our retail market share is around 3 to 5 percent. We have taken a fair bit of market share. Banks in the kingdom have faced a sluggish economy in the past year or two, with lending slipping by 0.1 percent in March as companies and consumers stall investment decisions in the face of low oil prices and concern over government austerity policy. Despite the difficult operating conditions, Alawwal Bank, which is in merger talks with Saudi British Bank, has expanded its branch network by 50 percent in the past three years to 69 and doubled its number of ATMs. The retail bank now accounts for about 20 percent of the  bank's business, roughly doubling over the same period. Nikolajsen was speaking at the bank's new digital branch, a    windowless open-plan site inside one of Riyadh's largest shopping malls, where customers can drink coffee while using terminals to conduct their online banking transactions. You have to find products for a young and tech-savvy population, he said, referring to the fact that around two thirds of the Saudi population is under the age of 30. Internet banking is now used by around two thirds of retail customers, with usage growing by around 30 percent annually. Speaking of the kingdom's overall banking market, Nikolajsen said flat loan growth for 2017 would be a decent result. Activity right now is slower than we would like it to be generally across the board and that's a follow-through from the lower activity levels we saw at the back end of last year, he said. Alawwal Bank and Saudi British Bank last week agreed to start talks about a merger that could create the kingdom's third biggest bank with assets of nearly $80 billion. British banks are the biggest shareholders in both lenders with RBS having acquired a 40 percent stake in Alawwal Bank when it bought ABN AMRO in 2007. RBS has been trying sell the holding for a number of years as it retreats from international operations. Meanwhile HSBC Holdings owns 40 percent of Saudi British Bank (SABB), which is the kingdom's sixth largest bank by assets. Nikolajsen declined to comment on the merger talks or Alawwal Bank's outlook for 2017 because of the uncertainty over the negotiations. Editing by Greg Mahlich"

Wells Fargo was fined last year for opening up to 2.1 million customer accounts without their knowledge over several years to meet aggressive sales targets.  The revelation damaged the bank's reputation, spurred investors to sell its shares for several weeks and led to the resignation of its chief executive last year. Despite news reports and lawsuits claiming the bank had retaliated against whistleblowers, an investigative report by the bank's board of directors released on April 10 said based on a limited review completed to date, outside law firm Shearman & Sterling had not identified a pattern of retaliation against employees in Wells Fargo's branch banking unit who complained about sales pressure or practices. In a different case, the Department of Labor in April ordered Wells Fargo to reinstate a whistleblower, though that former staffer's concerns related to bank, mail and wire fraud -things that were not at issue in the sales practices scandal.

Two weeks into the job, Stephen Barclay, a former financial regulator who has worked in banking, struck a conciliatory tone, saying it was very clear that the pace of regulation has not abated. In government we need to be mindful of the cumulative impact, Barclay told a British Bankers' Association conference. Banks face new rules to prevent money laundering, requiring them to ring-fence their retail arms with their own layer of capital, and opening up the payments services market with new EU rules to boost innovation, Barclay said. He wanted to give banks as much time as possible to implement the new EU rules and said he had asked officials to lay out the regulations before parliament's summer break. The banking sector faces potential upheaval with Britain's departure from the European Union in 2019, given the cross-border activities in the sector. In leaving the EU we need to prioritise British prosperity, recognising the need for an implementation period, so we have a slope, not a sudden cliff edge, Barclay said, reiterating a view already expressed by finance minister Philip Hammond. The government will respond quickly and constructively to the banking sector, mindful of the 71 billion pounds ($92 billion) of tax the financial services contributes to public services and the million people it employs, he said. I am conscious of the way the industry is often portrayed – with the Wall Street image of bankers far removed from the experience of cashiers and the many other staff in retail branches across the country, Barclay said.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/wells-fargo-lawsuit-idUSL1N1KH236","Lawyers for ex-Wells Fargo broker ordered to hand over client data","","July 26, 2017 /  8:48 PM / 2 days ago","","NEW YORK (Reuters) - A New Jersey court on Wednesday ordered lawyers for a former Wells Fargo & Co employee to hand over reams of customer information that the bank's outside counsel accidentally provided the lawyers in response to a subpoena. Lawyers for the former employee, Gary Sinderbrand, must give court authorities a disc that one of the lawyers said contains the names, Social Security numbers and account balances of tens of thousands of Wells Fargo clients, according to the order. The New Jersey decision follows a separate ruling by a New York court on Tuesday that required Sinderbrand's lawyers to halt any review of or planned action to use or share the data, and scheduled a hearing for arguments as to whether the lawyers should be required to return the disc to the bank. Sinderbrand is suing his brother, whom he worked with at Wells Fargo Advisors, in New Jersey over the separation of their joint business and in New York for defamation. Sinderbrand's lawyers have said that a lawyer for Wells, Angela Turiano, of law firm Bressler, Amery & Ross, shared the data in response to a subpoena in the New Jersey case. Wells Fargo is not a party to the New Jersey case, although its brokerage, Wells Fargo Advisors, is a party to the New York case. Although Turiano apparently shared the information by mistake, Sinderbrand's lawyer Aaron Zeisler argued in a letter filed in the New York case that the data should not be handed over to Wells to be destroyed because disclosure of the data may have violated privacy laws. The matter has embarrassed Wells Fargo, which has struggled to restore trust after an unrelated sales scandal in which branch employees opened as many as 2.1 million phony deposit and card accounts in customers' names without their permission. Shea Leordeanu, a spokeswoman for Wells Fargo Advisors, said the bank takes responsibility for releasing the information. This was the unfortunate result of an unintentional human error involving a spreadsheet, Leordeanu said in a statement. The rulings are a positive result of our ongoing efforts to make things right, she added. Wells Fargo has determined what went wrong, and all information that is released in connection with legal matters will now undergo increased review, she said. The bank is now reviewing whether any client information was shared more widely and will contact clients if so. The New Jersey order requires that Sinderbrand and his lawyer delete any digital file copies they made from the information disclosed in the subpoena, and that they give the court the encrypted CD Turiano provided and any copies. The court will safeguard the CD until a hearing on Wells' requests scheduled for September. The data release was first reported by The New York Times last week in a story citing one of Sinderbrand's lawyers as a source."
"https://www.reuters.com/article/britain-banks-competition-idUSL6E8HR8ID20120629","RBS computer fiasco a gift for UK's new banks","","June 29, 2012 /  2:56 PM / 5 years ago","","* Challenger banks picking up trade from RBS IT glitch * New banks focusing on enhanced customer service * Face challenge to expand and be profitable By Matt Scuffham and Kylie MacLellan LONDON, June 29 (Reuters) - The software debacle that caused chaos for millions of Royal Bank of Scotland customers is a gift for new arrivals such as Metro Bank and Aldermore, aiming to grab business from Britain's established but unpopular lenders. Last week's fiasco, which led to media reports of house purchases falling through and workers going unpaid, was followed this week by an interest-rate rigging scandal that hammered Barclays and could spread to others including RBS. These public relations disasters have added to the already poor perception of Britain's dominant high street banks - Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds, RBS and Santander UK  - a situation that new competitors are hoping to exploit. Although a fraction of the size of the incumbents, challengers such as Metro Bank, Virgin Money and Aldermore are looking to pick up customers unhappy with the service they're getting or who have been shunned by the bigger players as they focus on shrinking their balance sheets and building up capital reserves to meet new regulations. For years, Britain's banking system has been dominated by a handful of large lenders. But after taxpayers had to bail out Lloyds and RBS during the 2008 global financial crisis, the government decided to stimulate competition. Consumers have typically been reluctant to move banks because they think it will be difficult. The 2012 World Retail Banking Report from Capgemini found that, although 40 percent of customers were unsure if they would stay with their main bank in the long term, only 9 percent planned to switch in the next six months. Later this year, the government will launch an initiative to make it easier and faster to switch current accounts. Both Metro and Aldermore hope for a future where British retail banking is dominated by a number of medium-sized, more narrowly focused operators competing with slimmed down versions of the current giants. I would like to see in the next five to ten years a scene in the UK where, instead of having four or five big banks, you've got a dozen medium sized banks none of which are too big to fail in their own right, said Aldermore founder Philip  Monks. Though keen not to be seen to be benefiting from the misery endured by customers of RBS and its NatWest unit, Metro Bank's Chairman and Co-founder Anthony Thomson told Reuters it presented a chance to pick up disgruntled account holders. Anything which causes customer dissatisfaction with their existing banks provides an opportunity for us, Thomson said in an interview at the bank's flagship branch in Holborn, central London. It's just another example of where customers have felt that the bank is not meeting their needs and they're starting to look elsewhere. Staff at the branch said several RBS customers had enquired about switching since the bank suffered a computer systems meltdown last week preventing it from processing payments for individuals and businesses. Like a Prison The challenger banks have looked to differentiate themselves by offering a more personal touch, although maintaining this as they grow could become both more difficult and costly. A new financial firm typically does have to offer things that the incumbents don't if they want to pick up a reasonable amount of business, said Phil Molyneux, Professor of banking and finance at Bangor University. Metro, the first new high street bank in Britain for over a hundred years when it opened in 2010, markets itself on being open every day and for longer hours than traditional high street names. It also makes it easier for customers to switch by giving them their new bank cards on the day they open an account. I've already recommended it to five colleagues, fast food shop owner Asif Riaz, 31, told Reuters. It's the convenience that they like, the long hours and opening at weekends. Riaz said he liked the look of the Holborn branch, whose glass windows and high ceilings contrasted with the relatively dowdy appearance of a NatWest branch across the road. They don't look like the old style banks which almost feel like a prison, he said. Aldermore, set up by former Barclays banker Monks with private equity backing in 2009, has adopted an entirely different model. It has no branches and doesn't offer current accounts, instead focusing on savings products and lending to small businesses and homeowners. We don't have any desire to open branches. We have nine regional offices. The pleasure of being a banker is going out and visiting your customers rather than them trudging into a city centre to come and see you, Monks said. Unhampered by the cost of running branches, Aldermore broke even in July 2011. Metro Bank is still lossmaking. It is harder in the short run to be profitable because you have got to pick up business, said Molyneux. Time and Effort The process of setting up a new bank is arduous.    Newcomers must convince Britain's financial regulator, the Financial Services Authority, they have the necessary capital, expertise and infrastructure. The FSA quite rightly has its focus on the safety of depositors' money. We take hard earned deposits and lend them out to borrowers, Monks said. Another challenge facing newcomers is from more lightly regulated lenders. Pay-day firms such as Wonga, which offers short-term business loans, and peer-to-peer lenders which allow members of the public to lend directly to small firms have  become increasingly common. I think there will be non-banks that will eat away at the overall banking proposition, said Metro's Thomson. Metro Bank, whose investors include fund management company Fidelity and property investors the Reuben brothers, plans to open nine more branches in London this year to bring it to a total of 20 and has ambitions to have 200 in greater London. The bank raised 126 million pounds this month to fund expansion. Other new ventures have found it difficult to a get a foothold in the sector. NBNK, set up by former Lloyd's of London insurance head Peter Levene and run by former Barclays and Northern Rock executive Gary Hoffman threw in the towel after failing in a bid to buy 630 branches being sold by Lloyds. The Lloyds branches look set to be purchased by the Co-operative Group, creating a medium-sized competitor into the market which will have about 7 percent of Britain's current account market."

Banks, especially those still nursing losses from the financial crisis, are under pressure to cut costs and are balancing the need to pare back branch networks by sprucing up select outlets. But branches are still the first point of contact for many customers and are still the primary location for product sales like mortgages, new accounts and insurance, underlining the importance of upgrading them for a more tech-savvy generation.

The U.S. military said it killed 14 militants in a raid on a powerful al Qaeda branch that has been a frequent target of U.S. drone strikes. Medics at the scene, however, said around 30 people, including 10 women and children, were killed. Two more U.S. servicemen were injured when an American military aircraft was sent to evacuate the wounded commandos but came under fire and had to be intentionally destroyed in place, the Pentagon said.   The new U.S. president called the operation a success and said intelligence gathered during the operation would help the United States fight terrorism.  Americans are saddened this morning with news that a life of a heroic service member has been taken in our fight against the evil of radical Islamic terrorism, Trump said in a statement. The gunbattle in the rural Yakla district of al-Bayda province killed a senior leader in Yemen's al Qaeda branch, Abdulraoof al-Dhahab, along with other militants, al Qaeda said. Eight-year-old Anwar al-Awlaki, the daughter of U.S.-born Yemeni preacher and al Qaeda ideologue Anwar al-Awlaki, was among the children killed in the raid, according to her grandfather. Her father was killed in a U.S. drone strike in 2011. She was hit with a bullet in her neck and suffered for two hours, Nasser al-Awlaki told Reuters. Why kill children? This is the new (U.S.) administration - it's very sad, a big crime. In a statement, the Pentagon did not refer to any civilian casualties, although a U.S. military official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they could not be ruled out. The Defense Department said the raid netted information that will likely provide insight into the planning of future terror plots. The American elite forces did not seize any militants or take any prisoners offsite, the official said, adding that the group had come under fire. The Pentagon did not say how the team's one death occurred, and the U.S. military official declined to give details on the fatality. The operation's goal was to gather intelligence on al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which is regarded as one of the global militant group's most dangerous branches, the official said. Dawn Attack The operation began at dawn when a drone bombed the home of Abdulraoof al-Dhahab and then helicopters flew up and unloaded paratroopers at his house and killed everyone inside, said one resident, who spoke on condition of anonymity.  Next, the gunmen opened fire at the U.S. soldiers who left the area, and the helicopters bombed the gunmen and a number of homes and led to a large number of casualties. A Yemeni security officer and a local official corroborated that account. Fahd, a local resident who asked that only his first name be used, said several bodies remained under debris and that houses and the local mosque were damaged in the attack. In a message on its official Telegram messaging account, al Qaeda mourned al-Dhahab as a holy warrior and other slain militants, without specifying how many of its fighters were killed. American forces have not conducted any special operations in Yemen since December 2014, months before nearly two years of civil war rendered the country even more dangerous and offered al Qaeda leeway to expand into more lawless areas. The United States conducted dozens of drone strikes in Yemen throughout Barack Obama's presidency to combat al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, regarded as one of the global militant group's most dangerous branches. The local al Qaeda unit organized the Charlie Hebdo magazine attack in Paris in 2015 and has repeatedly tried to down U.S. airliners.

Lawyers for the former employee, Gary Sinderbrand, must give court authorities a disc that one of the lawyers said contains the names, Social Security numbers and account balances of tens of thousands of Wells Fargo clients, according to the order. The New Jersey decision follows a separate ruling by a New York court on Tuesday that required Sinderbrand's lawyers to halt any review of or planned action to use or share the data, and scheduled a hearing for arguments as to whether the lawyers should be required to return the disc to the bank. Sinderbrand is suing his brother, whom he worked with at Wells Fargo Advisors, in New Jersey over the separation of their joint business and in New York for defamation.  Sinderbrand's lawyers have said that a lawyer for Wells, Angela Turiano, of law firm Bressler, Amery & Ross, shared the data in response to a subpoena in the New Jersey case. Wells Fargo is not a party to the New Jersey case, although its brokerage, Wells Fargo Advisors, is a party to the New York case.  Although Turiano apparently shared the information by mistake, Sinderbrand's lawyer Aaron Zeisler argued in a letter filed in the New York case that the data should not be handed over to Wells to be destroyed because disclosure of the data may have violated privacy laws. The matter has embarrassed Wells Fargo, which has struggled to restore trust after an unrelated sales scandal in which branch employees opened as many as 2.1 million phony deposit and card accounts in customers' names without their permission. Shea Leordeanu, a spokeswoman for Wells Fargo Advisors, said the bank takes responsibility for releasing the information. This was the unfortunate result of an unintentional human error involving a spreadsheet, Leordeanu said in a statement. The rulings are a positive result of our ongoing efforts to make things right, she added. Wells Fargo has determined what went wrong, and all information that is released in connection with legal matters will now undergo increased review, she said. The bank is now reviewing whether any client information was shared more widely and will contact clients if so. The New Jersey order requires that Sinderbrand and his lawyer delete any digital file copies they made from the information disclosed in the subpoena, and that they give the court the encrypted CD Turiano provided and any copies. The court will safeguard the CD until a hearing on Wells' requests scheduled for September. The data release was first reported by The New York Times last week in a story citing one of Sinderbrand's lawyers as a source.

The funding will help UNTUCKit open 15 new U.S. stores and expand into women's and children's apparel. Founded in New York in 2011 as an internet retailer, it started opening physical stores in 2015 as part of a clicks-to-bricks strategy.

Like some of its competitors, UNTUCKit is blurring the lines between online and physical stores. Several e-commerce companies that have built a growing customer base have started to turn to retail outlets to market their products. UNTUCKit now has eight brick-and-mortar stores. We always knew we would have a physical presence since a large percent of male consumers still are uncomfortable shopping for a new brand digitally, chief executive Aaron Sanandres said in an interview. Mood Rowghani, a Kleiner Perkins general partner, said in a statement that UNTUCKit having both a digital and physical presence has profound benefits to merchandising, design, marketing, and customer happiness.” Bonobos, another men's retailer which sources have said is in talks to be acquired by Wal-Mart Inc, runs guideshops that allow customers to try on clothes before having them shipped to their home. Eyewear company Warby Parker and clothing rental service Rent the Runway have made similar moves. But running retail outlets has its challenges, including managing inventory, human resources and marketing strategies. Online retailer NastyGal shuttered its physical stores as part of its bankruptcy process earlier this year. Sanandres said UNTUCKit is looking to open 100 stores over the next five years, and is in discussions with mall developers Simon Property Group Inc, Macerich Co and Taubman Centers Inc about these plans. UNTUCKit was founded by Sanandres and Chris Riccobono, two students who met at Columbia business school. The company had previously raised $200,000 from friends and family. Its first marketing dollars were invested in radio and magazine advertisements, as it sought to establish its brand.

The deal by Hungary's second-largest lender by assets would be the second such major transaction after Austrian Erste Group Bank's sale of distressed mortgages to Sweden-based Intrum Justitia in October. Press officers for UniCredit in Budapest declined comment. APS officials in Prague and Budapest also would not comment. Many Hungarians took out mortgages before the financial crisis, but loan default rates surged in subsequent years when tens of thousands of borrowers were unable to service their loans, dragging on local banks. With the economy improving and investors hunting for higher yields in a record-low interest rate environment, the tide is slowly turning and specialist loan recovery firms are moving in. UniCredit has reached an agreement, only the technical details need to be ironed out, one of the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The source said Hungary's move to end a lengthy foreclosure moratorium and reduced country risk following last year's credit rating upgrades have also boosted appetite for local assets. APS deals with investment, management and recovery of loan portfolios and real estate in Central and South-Eastern Europe, managing claims with a total value of over 4.5 billion euros ($4.80 billion) according to information on its website. UniCredit's Bulgarian subsidiary sold a non-performing credit portfolio worth 93 million euros earlier this week. Italy's largest bank, UniCredit is raising 13 billion euros through a share sale, cutting jobs and offloading bad loans. More to Come Hungary's stock of non-performing mortgages stood at 752 billion forints ($2.6 billion), or 18 percent of total, in the first half of 2016 based on central bank figures, down from 808 billion at the end of 2015. Despite increased efforts by local banks to ditch sour mortgages, fully cleansing their books of such legacy assets could take another five to six years at that kind of pace, the Hungarian central bank said in a November survey. These kinds of deals could accelerate now, another unnamed source said. It is a herd mentality. If one buys, the rest will follow. Company records show APS Holding established an asset management and advisory unit in Budapest in November. On Monday APS posted new openings for workout and foreclosure specialists at its new branch on online jobs board profession.hu. Mihaly Patai, the Chairman of the Hungarian Banking Association and the local head of UniCredit, told Reuters last month that six lenders in Hungary were preparing to sell large chunks of soured mortgages. Financial sector sources say CIB, the local unit of Intesa SanPaolo and Raiffeisen Bank Hungary, both of which are among the country's eight biggest lenders, could also be among those coming to market this year. CIB told Reuters that its non-performing loan (NPL) stock fell substantially last year, due in part to a large-scale distressed corporate loan portfolio disposal. We would like to continue the downsizing of our NPL stock in 2017 with the further possible sale of NPL portfolios, CIB's press office said in an emailed response to questions about the potential sale of bad mortgages.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-afghanistan-taliban-usa-idUSKCN0YG31Z","Naming of new Taliban chief seen dimming Obama's hopes for Afghan peace talks","","May 25, 2016 /  11:17 PM / a year ago",""," (This version of the May 26 story has been refiled to fix spelling in paragraph 2) By Jonathan Landay and Idrees Ali WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The selection of a hard-line cleric as the new Taliban chief on Wednesday all but dashes U.S. President Barack Obama's hopes for opening peace talks before he leaves office, one of his top foreign policy goals, current and former U.S. defense and intelligence officials said.The Taliban leadership council tapped Mullah Haibatullah Akhundzada, a conservative Islamic scholar from the group's stronghold in southern Afghanistan, to succeed Mullah Akhtar Mansour, four days after Mansour was killed in a U.S. drone strike. U.S. officials had called Mansour a major impediment to peace talks, and some had expressed hope his death would eliminate an obstacle to peace negotiations between the Taliban and the government of Afghan President Ashraf Ghani. Instead, some experts said, Akhundzada is likely to pursue aggressive attacks throughout the summer, intensifying the pressure on Obama to reconsider his plan to withdraw U.S. military trainers and special forces and leave the decision on how to end America's longest war to his successor. Late last year, Obama announced he would keep 9,800 U.S. military personnel in Afghanistan through most of 2016. He added that U.S. troops would be drawn down to 5,500 by the start of 2017.Obama has made extracting the United States from its 15-year war in Afghanistan a top priority, unsuccessfully pursuing efforts to bring the Taliban into talks with successive Afghan governments. Prospects for the Afghan peace process remain poor. The Taliban leadership, including the new commander, Mullah Akhundzada, believe military victory is only a matter of time, said Bruce Riedel, a Brookings Institution expert and former CIA officer who headed Obama's first Afghanistan policy review. Riedel said Pakistan's powerful Inter-Services Intelligence agency also believed that the Taliban, which ruled Afghanistan for five years before their ouster in a U.S.-led invasion in 2001, could win a military victory. The war is entering a more violent phase, he added, his prediction punctuated by a suicide bombing in Kabul that killed 11 people shortly after Akhundzada's selection was announced. Troop Plan Under Review Confronted with Taliban gains, a weak Kabul government and the emergence of an Islamic State branch, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan is reviewing the withdrawal plan and is expected to complete his findings within a month. The administration remains committed to its strategy of pressing for peace talks while providing funds and military advice, training and equipment to Afghan forces, said Defense Secretary Ash Carter, who indicated the U.S. troop drawdown would resume.  The Taliban should realize that they cannot win, that the Afghan security forces aided by us are going to be stronger than them and are going to be able to defend the state of Afghanistan and the government of national unity there, and therefore that the alternative to coming across and making peace with the government is their certain defeat on the battlefield, Carter said on Wednesday in Rhode Island. But current and former U.S. government experts and independent analysts said they saw little chance of that happening, with one U.S. defense official noting the Taliban announcement of Akhundzada's accession made no mention of negotiations. 'What Have They Been Smoking?' “Whenever I hear anyone in the administration talking about the prospects for peace negotiations or how killing Mullah Mansour could improve them, I have to ask what they’ve been smoking, a U.S. military officer with extensive experience in Afghanistan, said on condition of anonymity. Regardless of who leads them, the Taliban have zero incentive to negotiate on their determination to restore their brand of Islamic rule. He and other U.S. military and intelligence officials pointed out that the Taliban had been making steady battlefield gains against Afghan security forces, who have been suffering high casualty rates. Moreover, the coalition government brokered by the United States between Ghani and Abdullah Abdullah, his former rival and now the country's chief executive, is riddled by disputes and deeply unpopular. The insurgents have little reason to trust the coalition government or Obama's successor, who takes office in January, to keep any agreement, said a U.S. official with experience in Afghanistan.

Among planned strikes this month are walkouts by airline cabin staff, baggage handlers, rail conductors and Post Office counter workers. If these strikes share one thing in common, it's a shared contempt for ordinary people who are just trying to go about their daily lives, May's spokesman said on Monday, adding that parties should negotiate to avoid action. He said the government would not rule anything out in terms of changing legislation to make striking more difficult. British Airways (BA) said on Monday it would not be cancelling flights on Dec. 25 and 26 as the airline, owned by International Airlines Group, holds talks at the conciliation service Acas with the Unite union in an attempt to avert walkouts by more than 2,500 cabin staff. We have been working on detailed contingency plans to ensure that we are able to operate our normal flight program from all our airports on both Christmas Day and Boxing Day, BA chief executive Alex Cruz said. The BA strike over a pay dispute is being staged by members of the airline's Mixed Fleet, Unite has said, referring to cabin crew staff who have joined the airline since 2010. They make up about 15 percent of BA's 16,000 cabin crew. Unite also said over 1,500 check-in staff, baggage handlers and cargo crew at airports across Britain will walk out for 48 hours from Friday in a long-running pay dispute. Conductors on the Southern railway line were also taking strike action on Monday and Tuesday, the latest of over a dozen walkouts during a long-running dispute over whose job it is to open and close train doors.  Meanwhile post office counter workers on Monday began a two-day strike over job security and pensions, during one of the busiest weeks of their year. The action will affect almost 300 Crown Post Offices, the larger branches usually found on high streets, but the rest of the Post Office's network of 11,600 local branches, and Royal Mail's delivery services, are not involved.

The next room, though, is filled with customers queueing up in front of tellers or waiting on benches. Outside, more line up to use the ATMs. The facelift reflects Citigroup Chief Executive Michael Corbat's ambition to turn the group's Mexican operation into a state-of-the-art bank. The lines symbolize the challenge: overcoming the legacy of years of underinvestment and a series of scandals that left the 133-year-old institution lagging rivals in technology, profitability, market share and customer satisfaction. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2plZLom) Despite upbeat assurances from Citi's New York headquarters, the view from the ground is that the bank has yet a lot of ground to recover and local and regional executives acknowledge they have catching up to do. Jane Fraser, who heads Citigroup's Latin America businesses, told Reuters a visit to an overcrowded branch shortly after she took on her role in 2015 convinced her the bank's service required a thorough overhaul. The ultimate goal was for people to say, Okay, they're back to being the best bank again, Fraser said. The bank is now reorganizing branches to make service more efficient, adding 2,500 ATMs to its network of 7,600 and partnering with startups to improve customer experience, she said. To broaden its reach, Citibanamex introduced Saldazo, a card distributed at the OXXO convenience store chain, which allows for deposits and money transfers. Saldazo is not yet profitable, but it is popular, with 8,500 cards issued daily, said Pedro Solano, director of financial inclusion at Citibanamex. Edgardo del Rincon, Citibanamex's general manager for consumer banking, said rivals now had an edge in digital services, but that should change once his bank adopts new, better systems. “Most banks in Mexico updated their core technology platforms seven, eight, nine years ago. We’re doing it now, but the technology that’s available is much different, he said. For Corbat, Mexico is a big bet. Even as he disposed of nearly two dozen other foreign units, Corbat has resisted calls to sell the Mexican operation and return proceeds to shareholders, citing its hearty profit margins, strong local brand and growth potential. Last October, he pledged to add $1 billion to a $1.5 billion extra outlay dedicated to Mexico and underscored his commitment by adding Citi to the bank's previous name - Banamex. While Citi does not break out Citibanamex profits, analysts estimate that it delivers nearly one-tenth of Citigroup's profits and produces a 15 percent return on equity, almost double what the entire bank reported last year. That makes Mexico crucial for the whole company to hit a 10 percent target Corbat initially set for 2015 but now aims to reach by 2019. Because of the missed targets, Citigroup's shares have lagged other big U.S. banks since Corbat took the helm in 2012. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2qAdmHQ) Slipping Share Much of Mexico's appeal is its potential for growth given that only half of its adult population has a bank account and many people visit banks to pay utility bills in cash. In fact, its banking sector has been expanding by more than 10 percent a year, according to economic research from BBVA. Yet a review of government data and dozens of interviews with current and former executives and competitors show Citi has struggled to capitalize on that growth. Citibanamex has lost market share to Spanish-owned BBVA Bancomer and Santander Mexico, as well as locally owned Banorte , and fallen behind in return on assets and service ratings.(Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2r9v32p) Competitors are also spending more. BBVA, for instance, started investing $3.5 billion in Bancomer branches in 2013, and recently committed another $1.5 billion. Citibanamex's lineage dates back to late 19th century and its assets include the Palace of Iturbide, where Mexico's first emperor lived, and one of the largest private collections of Mexican art. Previously owned by the federal government and known as Banco Nacional de Mexico, it was once the nation's No. 1 bank and enjoyed a high degree of autonomy even after Citi acquired it in 2001. That changed three years ago after it was rocked by a $500 million loan fraud, a U.S. criminal investigation into possible money-laundering violations, losses on loans to Mexican homebuilders, and problems with expense reporting and rogue traders. Citigroup responded by installing new local management, adopting new risk controls and starting to upgrade the bank's technology and its branches. Francisco Tobias, Citibanamex's finance chief, said losing market share was an inevitable consequence of the changes, but they should pay off in the long run. I'm more focused on having a profitable business with the right metrics that will take us where we need to be than obsessing about the market share that we lost, Tobias said. Young, educated Mexicans are a key target, said Citibanamex CEO Ernesto Cantu. Twenty-something years later, a little over half of them are still going to bank with the bank that gave them their first credit card, Cantu told Reuters. To accomplish that, Cantu will have to win over people like Claudia Hernandez, a 26-year-old college student from Mexico City. Hernandez said she switched to Citibanamex two years ago because her employer would only deposit paychecks at that one bank - a common practice among Mexican companies - and has been frustrated by slow service ever since. They took a whole month just to set up the account, she said. I'd rather be at Santander or Bancomer. They don't have as much red tape. At the Del Valle location, lines have not disappeared but more customers are using ATMs and waiting less, branch manager Maria Isabel Rodriguez Madrid said. Customers used to have to visit three different windows for three different transactions, she said. Now they can get everything done by waiting in just one line.

The region where the incident happened is close to China. The FSB, the successor organization to the Soviet KGB, said the attacker had been killed and that another person had been injured in the incident. An unknown person entered the reception of the FSB's Khabarovsk regional branch and started shooting at people inside, the FSB said in a statement. The Site Intelligence Group, a U.S.-based monitoring service, said that Islamic State had claimed responsibility for the attack. It said that the claim of responsibility had been made through the militant group's Amaq news agency.  That contradicted earlier media reports, which said the FSB believed the gunman was a nationalist. The TASS news agency cited an unnamed FSB official as saying that the gunman was a local resident and born in 1999. The visitor who was killed and the one who was injured were from former Soviet states outside Russia, according to the security service. Russia was this month shaken by a suicide bombing of the St Petersburg metro, which killed 16 people. The suspected suicide bomber and his alleged accomplices were from Central Asia. The man Russian police believe was the suicide bomber had developed an interest in Islam and soon after traveled to Turkey, two people who knew him told Reuters.

Lawyers for the former employee, Gary Sinderbrand, must give court authorities a disc that one of the lawyers said contains the names, Social Security numbers and account balances of tens of thousands of Wells Fargo clients, according to the order. The New Jersey decision follows a separate ruling by a New York court on Tuesday that required Sinderbrand's lawyers to halt any review of or planned action to use or share the data, and scheduled a hearing for arguments as to whether the lawyers should be required to return the disc to the bank. Sinderbrand is suing his brother, whom he worked with at Wells Fargo Advisors, in New Jersey over the separation of their joint business and in New York for defamation.  Sinderbrand's lawyers have said that a lawyer for Wells, Angela Turiano, of law firm Bressler, Amery & Ross, shared the data in response to a subpoena in the New Jersey case. Wells Fargo is not a party to the New Jersey case, although its brokerage, Wells Fargo Advisors, is a party to the New York case.  Although Turiano apparently shared the information by mistake, Sinderbrand's lawyer Aaron Zeisler argued in a letter filed in the New York case that the data should not be handed over to Wells to be destroyed because disclosure of the data may have violated privacy laws. The matter has embarrassed Wells Fargo, which has struggled to restore trust after an unrelated sales scandal in which branch employees opened as many as 2.1 million phony deposit and card accounts in customers' names without their permission. Shea Leordeanu, a spokeswoman for Wells Fargo Advisors, said the bank takes responsibility for releasing the information. This was the unfortunate result of an unintentional human error involving a spreadsheet, Leordeanu said in a statement. The rulings are a positive result of our ongoing efforts to make things right, she added. Wells Fargo has determined what went wrong, and all information that is released in connection with legal matters will now undergo increased review, she said. The bank is now reviewing whether any client information was shared more widely and will contact clients if so. The New Jersey order requires that Sinderbrand and his lawyer delete any digital file copies they made from the information disclosed in the subpoena, and that they give the court the encrypted CD Turiano provided and any copies. The court will safeguard the CD until a hearing on Wells' requests scheduled for September. The data release was first reported by The New York Times last week in a story citing one of Sinderbrand's lawyers as a source.

Jane Fraser, who heads Citigroup's Latin America businesses, told Reuters a visit to an overcrowded branch shortly after she took on her role in 2015 convinced her the bank's service required a thorough overhaul. The ultimate goal was for people to say, Okay, they're back to being the best bank again, Fraser said. The bank is now reorganizing branches to make service more efficient, adding 2,500 ATMs to its network of 7,600 and partnering with startups to improve customer experience, she said. To broaden its reach, Citibanamex introduced Saldazo, a card distributed at the OXXO convenience store chain, which allows for deposits and money transfers. Saldazo is not yet profitable, but it is popular, with 8,500 cards issued daily, said Pedro Solano, director of financial inclusion at Citibanamex. Edgardo del Rincon, Citibanamex's general manager for consumer banking, said rivals now had an edge in digital services, but that should change once his bank adopts new, better systems.    “Most banks in Mexico updated their core technology platforms seven, eight, nine years ago. We’re doing it now, but the technology that’s available is much different, he said. For Corbat, Mexico is a big bet. Even as he disposed of nearly two dozen other foreign units, Corbat has resisted calls to sell the Mexican operation and return proceeds to shareholders, citing its hearty profit margins, strong local brand and growth potential. Last October, he pledged to add $1 billion to a $1.5 billion extra outlay dedicated to Mexico and underscored his commitment by adding Citi to the bank's previous name - Banamex.  While Citi does not break out Citibanamex profits, analysts estimate that it delivers nearly one-tenth of Citigroup's profits and produces a 15 percent return on equity, almost double what the entire bank reported last year.  That makes Mexico crucial for the whole company to hit a 10 percent target Corbat initially set for 2015 but now aims to reach by 2019. Because of the missed targets, Citigroup's shares have lagged other big U.S. banks since Corbat took the helm in 2012. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2qAdmHQ) Slipping Share Much of Mexico's appeal is its potential for growth given that only half of its adult population has a bank account and many people visit banks to pay utility bills in cash.  In fact, its banking sector has been expanding by more than 10 percent a year, according to economic research from BBVA.  Yet a review of government data and dozens of interviews with current and former executives and competitors show Citi has struggled to capitalize on that growth. Citibanamex has lost market share to Spanish-owned BBVA Bancomer and Santander Mexico, as well as locally owned Banorte, and fallen behind in return on assets and service ratings.(Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2r9v32p) Customers queueing wait to be served by employees inside at a Citibanamex branch in Mexico City, Mexico May 8, 2017. Picture taken May 8, 2017.Henry RomeroCompetitors are also spending more. BBVA, for instance, started investing $3.5 billion in Bancomer branches in 2013, and recently committed another $1.5 billion. Citibanamex's lineage dates back to late 19th century and its assets include the Palace of Iturbide, where Mexico's first emperor lived, and one of the largest private collections of Mexican art. Previously owned by the federal government and known as Banco Nacional de Mexico, it was once the nation's No. 1 bank and enjoyed a high degree of autonomy even after Citi acquired it in 2001. That changed three years ago after it was rocked by a $500 million loan fraud, a U.S. criminal investigation into possible money-laundering violations, losses on loans to Mexican homebuilders, and problems with expense reporting and rogue traders. Citigroup responded by installing new local management, adopting new risk controls and starting to upgrade the bank's technology and its branches.  Francisco Tobias, Citibanamex's finance chief, said losing market share was an inevitable consequence of the changes, but they should pay off in the long run. I'm more focused on having a profitable business with the right metrics that will take us where we need to be than obsessing about the market share that we lost, Tobias said. Slideshow (8 Images)Young, educated Mexicans are a key target, said Citibanamex CEO Ernesto Cantu. Twenty-something years later, a little over half of them are still going to bank with the bank that gave them their first credit card, Cantu told Reuters. To accomplish that, Cantu will have to win over people like Claudia Hernandez, a 26-year-old college student from Mexico City.  Hernandez said she switched to Citibanamex two years ago because her employer would only deposit paychecks at that one bank - a common practice among Mexican companies - and has been frustrated by slow service ever since. They took a whole month just to set up the account, she said. I'd rather be at Santander or Bancomer. They don't have as much red tape. At the Del Valle location, lines have not disappeared but more customers are using ATMs and waiting less, branch manager Maria Isabel Rodriguez Madrid said.  Customers used to have to visit three different windows for three different transactions, she said. Now they can get everything done by waiting in just one line. <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Lost ground    tmsnrt.rs/2plZLom Citigroup's underperformance    tmsnrt.rs/2qAdmHQ Service ratings     tmsnrt.rs/2r9v32p) ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^> Reporting by Dan Freed and David Henry; Editing by Lauren Tara LaCapra and Tomasz Janowski"

The bank said on Tuesday it expects the settlement to resolve claims in 11 other pending class actions, and will cover claims between Jan. 1, 2009, through the date the agreement is executed.

The Lugano-based bank raked in money from high growth markets like Latin America and Asia and reported solid inflows in Switzerland, lifting assets 11 percent to 86.3 billion Swiss francs. Private bank revenues have been hit hard by flaccid client activity and low interest rates since the onset of the financial crisis. BSI's net profit rose 22 percent to 71 million francs as the company kept a lid on costs and a growing emerging market client base lifted revenues. Asian and Middle Eastern customers remained active, compensating partially for the (trading) inactivity of European and Latin American customers, BSI Chief executive Stefano Coduri told Reuters by telephone. He said assets booked in Singapore had reached around $10 billion, hitting a five-year target two years early, and that the branch was profitable as of early 2013. He said the bank was still taking on staff, and would open a branch in Milan on April 2. He said BSI was also investing to develop its business in Zurich and Geneva. Coduri declined to say how the sale of BSI was progressing, citing non-disclosure agreements. Earlier this month, Reuters reported that Spain's Bankinter  had teamed up with U.S. investment fund Apollo Global Management for a bid worth up to 2 billion euros ($2.6 billion), according to three people with knowledge of the matter. The bank is also said to have drawn interest from potential bidders in Brazil and China. Generali, Europe's third-biggest insurer, said in January it planned to raise 4 billion euros by 2015 by selling assets including its life reinsurance arm in the United States and BSI as new boss Mario Greco looks to pay down debt.

The power outage, which was triggered by a fire in a PG&E; Corp. utility substation, disrupted San Francisco's normally bustling financial district, home to banks and technology companies.  The blackout started just after 9 a.m. (noon ET/1600 GMT) and at one point affected nearly 90,000 customers, according to PG&E.; The cause of the fire was a circuit breaker failure at the substation, PG&E; spokesman Paul Doherty said. Office workers unable to access elevators or use their keycards spilled out onto the sidewalks, some wandering the streets in search of an open cafe or sunny spot to enjoy a rare warm San Francisco day.  Others simply went home, with long lines forming for ferries. For many, there was little to do but wait. When I got here we had to shut down all the servers, all the work stations were off-line, said Bard Wood, an information technology worker in the financial district. I'm sure we've lost millions of dollars already. There's no business down here right now. Some cable car operators snoozed after their cars stalled on the street rails. Traffic was snarled and emergency workers responded to 20 elevator rescues, according to the city's fire department, but there were no reported deaths or major injuries. But many businesses, from coffee shops to major banks, took a hit. Wells Fargo & Co closed 13 bank branches and four office buildings, while the New York Stock Exchange said its ARCA options trading floor in San Francisco was briefly unavailable. Employees in Goldman Sachs' financial district office were sent home. King Lip, chief investment officer at Baker Avenue Asset Management, said his firm was in the middle of a trade when all our systems went down. He said employees in another state had to complete the transaction. Two office buildings and a local branch of First Republic Bank were shut down, a sign on the branch's doorway apologizing for the unexpected closure.  Fourteen neighborhoods were affected, including the main shopping district near Union Square, where stores turned signs to closed and major retailers such as Macy's and Louis Vuitton shut their doors. In a city proud of its technological prowess, the outage forced residents back to the dark ages. At the salad bar MIXT, cashiers took credit card payments using old-fashioned paper imprints.

I haven't seen that in forever.  Darkened by One Substation For more than two hours, trains barreled through the Montgomery Street station - one of the busiest stops that services the downtown and financial district - as the outage prevented them from stopping until backup generators came on line, Bay Area Rapid Transit spokesman Jim Allison said.  Power was finally restored to all customers by 6 pm local time, PG&E; said. Slideshow (21 Images)Workers have entered the substation. They're assessing the damage and starting to make repairs,” Doherty said.  San Francisco International Airport remained operational, and a U.S. Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said there was no evidence of terrorism. The spokesperson requested anonymity, citing department policy.  This had nothing to do with cyber, said Joe Weiss, an expert on control system cyber security who has testified to Congress about structural weaknesses in grid components.  The real question is how could one substation take out, effectively, San Francisco? An FBI spokesman said the agency monitored the incident but is not investigating. Twenty-one San Francisco schools lost power, but remained open nonetheless, according to a Department of Emergency spokesman. At least three hospitals had to rely on backup generators, canceling elective surgeries and redirecting emergency patients to other facilities.     Joanna Gadd, 55, was in the admitting room of the city’s Saint Francis Memorial Hospital waiting for her daughter to undergo surgery when the lights went out. The diagnostic surgery was canceled. She had forfeited a trip to the United Kingdom, including airfare, to accommodate the operation. It is frustrating,” Gadd said. It's quite nerve-racking going into surgery. She had been fasting, and fasting for someone with diabetes is definitely no picnic.

Speaking at a news conference, President Alan Thomson said Robinson, majority-owned by Thailand's largest retail conglomerate Central Group, planned to boost the number of stores to 56 by 2020 from 42 now, pinning its hopes on government economic stimulus measures stoking a pickup in the country's now-depressed consumer spending. Growth at that pace would be equivalent to an average of 2.8 new stores a year. But Robinson's rate of expansion has slowed recently, dropping to two new stores this year, versus four in 2015 and five two years earlier, a deceleration that reflects Thailand's current economic weakness, Thomson said. This year, the company will spend 1.6 billion baht on opening two branches. It's aiming for sales growth of 7 percent from 2015's 25 billion baht, and expects sales to reach 35 billion baht by 2020, Thomson said. He also said Robinson planned to spend 2.5 billion baht to renovate 20 existing stores in an effort to respond to changing retail patterns and attract more customers despite the spread of online shopping. Robinson also operates two stores in Vietnam, and aims to double that by 2020, Thomson said. We are trying to identify challenges before we expand in Vietnam, he said, adding the company would likely invest more in Vietnam next year after a pause in 2016. After being hit in recent years by weak spending in the slowing economy, like other Thai retailers, Robinson has seen signs of improvement in demand, thanks to the government's stimulus measures, Thomson said. The company's same-store sales rose 3.1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2015, versus a drop of 2.1 percent for the full year, according to company data. $1 = 35.0800 baht

His $11 billion family office, Point72 Asset Management, is opening a new branch less than two weeks after Cohen struck a deal with U.S. regulators that could once again see him take in outside capital.  Point72 President Douglas Haynes told journalists that the firm was back in hiring mode. We are reopening the office, we are gaining more exposure and, given that what we're good at is individual stocks, we're voting with our feet that that will pay off, he told Reuters on the sidelines of the LSE SU Alternative Investments Conference. The firm's UK office was launching with seven analysts and portfolio managers, Haynes told journalists, but could end up hosting 70-80 people, 80 percent of whom would likely be investment staff. As a sign of his intent, Haynes told Reuters he was interviewing three potential hires later on Tuesday. The team, based in Point72's office in the affluent Mayfair district, would likely be 15 strong by the end of the year. Underpinning the firm's decision to move back into Europe is a belief that investment returns would improve and benefit the equity-focused firm's 12 global equities trading books, each of which may decide to relocate some headcount to London. Globally, the firm has about 100 trading teams across a number of equity and global macro strategies. The firm as a whole returned 15.5 percent in 2015, Haynes said. Our belief, going forward, is that macro factors [in Europe] will settle down and the market will be more driven by individual equities, individual stock fundamentals.    While Europe looked increasing attractive, the Stamford, Connecticut-headquartered firm had temporarily scaled back its investment in mainland China from a high of around $500 million 9-12 months ago to around $100 million currently, Haynes said, although this would likely bounce back at some point. We do want to continue to get more exposure to both the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges but we don't want to go rushing in because we think the markets are still young, said Haynes.  Point72 currently has 15-20 investment professionals in Hong Kong, and this month hired Marc Desmidt from BlackRock as its Asia-Pacific chief executive.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-trump-immigration-legal-idUSL1N1FY0HY","Courts likely to probe Trump's intent in issuing travel ban","","February 13, 2017 /  11:04 AM / 5 months ago","","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Washington state’s attorney general has promised to uncover what truly motivated President Donald Trump's executive order on immigration, an approach that could prompt a rare public examination of how a U.S. president makes national security decisions.  The presidential order imposed a temporary ban on travelers from seven predominantly Muslim countries, but a federal judge has barred enforcement of the order while the court considers a challenge brought by Washington state.  On Thursday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit left the judge’s ruling in place without deciding the ultimate merits of either side’s arguments. In its decision, the 9th Circuit cited a previous case establishing that “circumstantial evidence of intent, including … statements by decisionmakers, may be considered in evaluating whether a governmental action was motivated by a discriminatory purpose.”  The Trump administration has argued that the ban is necessary to prevent potential terrorists from entering the country and is not discriminatory because the text of the order does not mention any particular religion.  Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson signaled on Sunday that he will move aggressively to obtain written documents and emails authored by administration officials that might contain evidence the order was unconstitutionally biased against Muslims or Islam. He also said he would also move to depose administration officials. Legal scholars say this could move the court into uncharted waters.  The idea of looking at motive has never really been applied to the president, said John Yoo, a former Justice Department lawyer in the George W. Bush administration.      It would represent a serious expansion of judicial oversight of what the president and the entire executive branch does, said Yoo, now a professor at the University of California at Berkeley School of Law.       Related CoverageSeattle judge says Trump travel ban case should continue during appealsThe Trump presidency on Feb. 13 at 8:05 P.M. EST    Scrutinizing Campaign Statements  Trump has harshly criticized the federal judge in Washington for his decision and a top White House aide on Sunday accused the 9th Circuit of a judicial usurpation of power.  The president's powers here are beyond question, senior policy adviser Stephen Miller told Fox News Sunday. U.S. courts have historically been careful about probing the motives behind laws, in part out of respect for the separation of powers between branches of government. But on questions of racial or religious discrimination, they have sometimes allowed intent to be examined.  In 1993, for instance, the Supreme Court found that an ordinance banning animal sacrifice in Hialeah, Florida, though neutral on its face, was actually intended to discriminate against a Santeria church, which holds sacrifice as a sacred rite. People participate in a protest against U.S. President Donald Trump's immigration policy at the Jewish Rally for Refugees in New York City, U.S. February 12, 2017.Stephanie KeithStephen Griffin, a professor of constitutional law at Tulane University, said cases like this make it clear that the court can look beyond the words of Trump's executive order. Motive is relevant, he said.  One question in the current case is likely to be which, if any, of Trump’s statements should be admissible in examining the administration’s motives in issuing the order.  If you're allowed to use evidence from the campaign, the state's case is very strong, said  Griffin. In December, 2015, days after a mass attack by an Islamic State sympathizers in San Bernardino, California, Trump called for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our representatives can figure out what is going on. He later said he supported only suspending immigration from areas with a history of terrorism. Stanford University Law School professor Michael McConnell, a former federal appeals judge, said the court should not consider campaign statements, because Trump only swore an oath to uphold the Constitution after he became president.  In its complaint, Washington cited an interview the president did on the day the order was signed with the Christian Broadcasting Network, saying he would prioritize Christians in the Middle East for admission as refugees.     Who Can Be Questioned? Legal experts are divided on whether the state's lawyers should be allowed to question the president's advisers – and possibly even the president – in depositions. The White House could potentially claim executive privilege, which protects the president and other officials from subpoena, said Thomas Lee, an expert in constitutional law at Fordham University.  Anna-Rose Mathieson a partner with the California Appellate Law Group said that one person who might be more easily deposed would be presidential adviser and former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who told Fox News the president had asked him to put a commission together to figure out how to make a Muslim ban legal. David Pressman, a partner at Boies Schiller Flexner and former assistant secretary of Homeland Security in the Obama administration, said there are important protections in place so that the executive branch can receive national security advice. You don't want a situation in which courts are adjudicating intelligence that is coming to the executive when trying to formulate policy, said Pressman. Though in this case, Pressman said he did not believe the national security argument for the order was clear, opening the door to further questioning. The next steps in the case are not certain.  The Trump administration has said it is considering appealing the 9th Circuit ruling to the Supreme Court, and the 9th Circuit itself might decide to rehear the case with a larger panel of judges. The president has also said he might replace the order with “a brand new” one, which could end the current legal action. Additional reporting by Dan Levine in San Francisco"

The third-largest U.S. bank by assets said net income applicable to common shareholders fell to $5.06 billion, or $1.00 per share, in the first quarter ended March 31, from $5.09 billion, or 99 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average had estimated earnings of 96 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. It was not immediately clear if the reported figures were comparable. Wells Fargo has been dealing with multiple lawsuits and regulatory inquiries since government investigations found in September that some of its employees had opened as many as two million accounts without customers' knowledge. The scandal damaged the bank's folksy image and also led to the ouster of Chief Executive John Stumpf, but growing deposit balances and a stable level of account closings show that profitability in the long run should not be hampered.

The power outage, which was triggered by a fire in a PG&E; Corp. utility substation, disrupted San Francisco's normally bustling financial district, home to banks and technology companies.  The blackout started just after 9 a.m. (noon ET/1600 GMT) and at one point affected nearly 90,000 customers, according to PG&E.; The cause of the fire was a circuit breaker failure at the substation, PG&E; spokesman Paul Doherty said. Office workers unable to access elevators or use their keycards spilled out onto the sidewalks, some wandering the streets in search of an open cafe or sunny spot to enjoy a rare warm San Francisco day.  Others simply went home, with long lines forming for ferries. For many, there was little to do but wait. When I got here we had to shut down all the servers, all the work stations were off-line, said Bard Wood, an information technology worker in the financial district. I'm sure we've lost millions of dollars already. There's no business down here right now. Some cable car operators snoozed after their cars stalled on the street rails. Traffic was snarled and emergency workers responded to 20 elevator rescues, according to the city's fire department, but there were no reported deaths or major injuries. But many businesses, from coffee shops to major banks, took a hit. Wells Fargo & Co closed 13 bank branches and four office buildings, while the New York Stock Exchange said its ARCA options trading floor in San Francisco was briefly unavailable. Employees in Goldman Sachs' financial district office were sent home. King Lip, chief investment officer at Baker Avenue Asset Management, said his firm was in the middle of a trade when all our systems went down. He said employees in another state had to complete the transaction. Two office buildings and a local branch of First Republic Bank were shut down, a sign on the branch's doorway apologizing for the unexpected closure.  Fourteen neighborhoods were affected, including the main shopping district near Union Square, where stores turned signs to closed and major retailers such as Macy's and Louis Vuitton shut their doors. In a city proud of its technological prowess, the outage forced residents back to the dark ages. At the salad bar MIXT, cashiers took credit card payments using old-fashioned paper imprints.

Power was finally restored to all customers by 6 pm local time, PG&E; said. Slideshow (21 Images)Workers have entered the substation. They're assessing the damage and starting to make repairs,” Doherty said.  San Francisco International Airport remained operational, and a U.S. Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said there was no evidence of terrorism. The spokesperson requested anonymity, citing department policy.  This had nothing to do with cyber, said Joe Weiss, an expert on control system cyber security who has testified to Congress about structural weaknesses in grid components.  The real question is how could one substation take out, effectively, San Francisco? An FBI spokesman said the agency monitored the incident but is not investigating. Twenty-one San Francisco schools lost power, but remained open nonetheless, according to a Department of Emergency spokesman. At least three hospitals had to rely on backup generators, canceling elective surgeries and redirecting emergency patients to other facilities.     Joanna Gadd, 55, was in the admitting room of the city’s Saint Francis Memorial Hospital waiting for her daughter to undergo surgery when the lights went out. The diagnostic surgery was canceled. She had forfeited a trip to the United Kingdom, including airfare, to accommodate the operation. It is frustrating,” Gadd said. It's quite nerve-racking going into surgery.

The company has provided notice to Wells Fargo that it may seek indemnification under the MyTerm distribution agreement, Prudential said in a Feb. 17 regulatory filing. It was unclear how much in costs Prudential may seek. A push by the Newark, New Jersey-based insurer for Wells to cover its costs could become another headache for the San Francisco-based bank, whose sales practices have been under a spotlight.  Last year, federal regulators ordered Wells Fargo to pay $190 million in fines and restitution because they said its high pressure sales environment pushed employees to open as many as 2 million deposit and credit card accounts without customers' permission. A Wells spokesman declined to comment on the filing. In December, Prudential suspended the distribution of MyTerm, a low-cost life insurance policy it sold through Wells, pending a review of how the product was sold by the bank.  Prudential's move followed a wrongful termination lawsuit filed in New Jersey by three former managers in its corporate investigation division who said Wells employees signed up bank customers for the Prudential policies without the customers' knowledge or permission. Since bankers are not licensed to sell insurance, Wells Fargo employees were meant to direct customers to either self-service kiosks in branches or online to buy the insurance, without getting into specifics about the products. In some cases, policies were opened and closed after a month or two and then reopened, and sometimes monthly fees were withdrawn from the accounts, according to evidence in the lawsuit. Insurance regulators in California and New Jersey are investigating the allegations.  Prudential was also hit with a class action lawsuit on behalf of Wells Fargo customers who said they were unknowingly signed up for Prudential policies. The lead plaintiff withdrew the lawsuit on February 17. Prudential has received inquiries, requests for information a subpoena and a civil investigative demand related to this matter from state and federal regulators, the insurer said in the Feb 21 filing. Prudential also received a demand from shareholders to inspect its books and records, it said. Reporting by Suzanne Barlyn; Editing by David Gregorio"

The inspections are viewed by many businessmen as retaliation for Western sanctions against Russia because of its support for separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine, and they fear the retribution could spread to other symbols of Western capitalism.  A spokeswoman for the country's food safety agency, Rospotrebnadzor, said the inspections were not related to the standoff. The checks are not politically motivated, she said. The agency also said it had no plans to close down the company's business in the Republic of Tatarstan, two days after the agency shut three McDonald's branches in Moscow. Checks in Tatarstan were announced on Thursday. An agency spokeswoman in Tatarstan's largest city, Kazan, said checks were under way at McDonald's, which has 17 restaurants in the region - one of the highest concentrations in Russia outside Moscow and St Petersburg. We are making checks there. There are some irregularities and we are likely to punish them, but we will not close down their restaurants, she said. The regulators had earlier extended the checks outside of Moscow, including in Central Russia and the Urals. The agency's branch in the Penza region said on Friday that its unscheduled checks at two McDonald's restaurants in August showed that nine products out of the 31 inspected did not meet regulatory requirements, without specifying what they were. After laboratory studies, three batches of products weighing a total of 38 kilograms were deemed unfit for consumption, the agency said in a statement on its website. It drew up 10 statements of administrative violations, the statement said. McDonald's declined an immediate comment. Local press also reported that it plans to begin inspections in the North-West Leningrad region on Aug. 25. A regional official declined to comment. McDonald's operates 440 restaurants in Russia and considers the country one of its top seven markets outside the United States and Canada, according to its 2013 annual report. Almost 1 million people a day use its restaurants in Russia. In Tatarstan, some 1,500 people work for the fast-food chain.

The seven-decade-old alliance between Washington and Riyadh, one of the most enduring pillars of the Middle East's strategic architecture, has been strained in recent years by disagreements over the aftermath of the Arab Spring uprisings.  However, the United States remains an irreplaceable partner for Saudi Arabia as its main security guarantor and defense supplier. Washington in turn, despite its own low imports of Saudi oil, sees stability in the world's top crude exporter as essential for the world economy. Although Prince Abdullah is from a side branch of the Al Saud ruling family, rather than being descended from a son of the kingdom's founder King Abdulaziz, he is a nephew of King Salman through his mother, Louloua bint Abdulaziz.  It is definitely a sign of how seriously King Salman takes the American relationship, said Robert Lacey, author of Inside the Kingdom, a book about modern Saudi Arabia.   Born in 1951, Prince Abdullah, known by his initials AFT during his stint as governor of the Saudi Arabian General Investment Authority (SAGIA) from 2000-2004, was a familiar figure among Western businessmen and diplomats.  His tenure at SAGIA coincided with the kingdom's most ambitious period of economic reforms, during which it negotiated accession to the World Trade Organisation and opened swathes of its closeted economy to foreign and private investors.  Previously, he had overseen the development of Saudi Arabia's two main industrial cities as Secretary General of the Royal Commission for Jubail and Yanbu from 1985.

Speaking as the host of an agribusiness conference in Mato Grosso, Rial said he expected changes in the agricultural financing environment, long dominated by state-run Banco do Brasil SA. Brazil's government, pressured by a fiscal crisis, is cutting the share of subsidized loans in the annual farm financing plan, increasing room for private banks to fund farmers at market rates. Declining interest rates, as Brazil's central bank reacts to plunging inflation, make private bank lines more affordable. Santander has hired several agronomists and streamlined credit analysis processes to expand its agricultural loan portfolio, the bank said in a statement distributed ahead of Rial's speech. The bank has 17 branches in the state of Mato Grosso and will open at least another three in Brazil's largest grain-producing state, Rial said. With one-digit interest rates, private banks have an important role to play in agribusiness financing, he said. His remarks underscore a push under Rial, a former executive of Cargill Inc and Marfrig Global Foods SA, to reposition Santander as a competitive agribusiness lender in Latin America's largest economy. The agribusiness sector, which accounts for more than 20 percent of Brazil's $1.9 trillion economy, has been traditionally dominated by Banco do Brasil and large private bank Banco Bradesco SA. Santander's agribusiness loan portfolio stands at 40.5 billion reais ($12.31 billion), the bank said. At the event, Brazil's Agriculture Minister Blairo Maggi said the new farm financing plan should be announced next week. He estimated interest rates could fall on average 1 percentage point from last year's plan but does not expect the total size of the package to rise. $1 = 3.2887 reais

Paytm Payments Bank will help the firm reach tens of millions of Indians who use mobile phones and cheap data services in the world's fastest-growing internet services market but do not have access to the formal banking sector. The payments bank will open 31 branches and 3,000 customer points in its first year, the company said in a statement. A payments bank is an institution that can take deposits and remittances but cannot lend. Paytm became a household name across India after New Delhi's shock move to ban high-value currency notes late last year resulted in a cash crunch and boosted the use of its electronic wallet. Paytm says more than 220 million clients use its e-wallet. Its success has attracted deep-pocketed investors such as Japan's SoftBank, which last week invested $1.4 billion in  Paytm parent One97 Communications. The firm's digital wallets will fold into its payment bank. The bank will offer an interest of 4 percent a year on savings accounts and also provide current account facility to merchants. It will have no minimum balance requirements and all online transactions will be free, the company said. The bank accounts will initially be available only through an invite.

The ABA has run a formal bidding process to secure a marketplace lending partner, spokesman John Hall confirmed on Friday. He could not say which companies were under consideration because the information was confidential. Marketplace lenders like LendingClub Corp (LC.N), Prosper Funding and Funding Circle connect borrowers and lenders through their platform and charge an origination fee. They are part of a broader trend of financial-technology companies upending traditional methods of banking, where customers visit brick-and-mortar branches to apply for mortgages, open investment accounts or get small business loans. To stay competitive, big banks have launched their own digital offerings or sealed individual partnerships with startups. For instance, JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) partnered with marketplace lender On Deck Capital Inc (ONDK.N) in 2015, while Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) launched its own online consumer lending service this year. But smaller banks have instead relied on ABA to source vendors for technology and other services. The association mostly represents banks with less than $250 million in assets. Such partnerships give startups access to a large network of customers, while allowing banks to improve digital offerings overnight without having to bear the development costs.

The killings follow an announcement by the military last month that it had stemmed Islamic State's attempts to expand in Pakistan, after arresting more than 300 people suspected of plotting attacks on government, diplomatic and civilian targets. Akbar Ali, a member of the Special Branch, or police intelligence wing in Charsadda, about 20 km (12 miles) from the provincial capital of Peshawar, was shot and killed at a bus stop, said the district police chief, Sohail Khalid. Two unknown motorcycle riders opened fire on police sub inspector Akbar Ali, and he died on the spot, Khalid added. Islamic State claimed the attack in an online post by its Middle East-based news agency, Amaq. Assassination of a member in Pakistani intelligence in Sardaryab in Peshawar, northern Pakistan, by fighters from Islamic State, it said. The Pakistani Taliban also claimed responsibility for the killing, said its spokesman Muhammad Khurasani. We accept responsibility for killing the Special Branch sub inspector in Charsadda, he said in a statement. A similar attack on Sept. 18 saw three Pakistani military employees killed in an ambush in Peshawar for which both Islamic State and a Pakistani Taliban faction claimed responsibility. Authorities last week arrested two men accused of spreading Islamic State propaganda in Peshawar, with police officials saying its members were still active in some parts of the provincial capital. There are fears that some Pakistani Sunni militants - whether members of the Pakistani Taliban, al-Qaeda, or homegrown sectarian outfits - could be drawn to Islamic State, as has happened in neighboring Afghanistan.

Stylish clothes being unveiled for spring 2014 are highlighting the pronounced simplicity of black and white. The colors are either elegant monochromes or mixed up in playful zebra prints, classic checks and mod color blocking. Victoria Beckham's show on Sunday was the latest in a string of collections at New York Fashion Week adhering almost entirely to a black and white palette. Her looks were sporty, with short pleated skirts, the season's omnipresent cropped tops and flouncy hemlines over knee-length shorts. Describing her collection, the celebrity designer said she set boyish elements against a sense of femininity. Some of Beckham's pieces were all-black or all-white, and she would use unusual structure or overlaid textures to bring them to life. Mixing the two colors, a short black dress revealed a pleated white skirt, peeking out from under an angled hemline, and a spaghetti-strapped black top was trimmed with white pleats at the midriff. All the black and white was accented with just a brief splash of hot pink and a subdued rust. At Yigal Azrouel, the collection was entirely black, white, cream and gray. Some were solids, some mixed. Among the stand-out looks was a set of dresses, jumpsuit, jacket and culottes in white silk with a black tree-branch pattern. Opening with all-cream looks, the show closed with a series of gray suits and dresses conservatively cut, but in an unlined, and revealing, open-weave fabric. Minimalism reigns in a decisive pattern of black, white, and shades of grey, the New York-based designer said in a statement accompanying the show. Androgynous tailoring and architectural lines are juxtaposed with arched necklines and seductive cut-outs. Spain's Delpozo, one of the more highly anticipated shows of the week-long extravaganza, used black and white in a striped, boxy top over a full-bodied black skirt, in a casual checkered top and in florals. Delpozo also mixed black with sand and with ecru, similar pairings of colorless hues. Accents were a delicate lavender, angelic florals and a bold black-and-yellow sunflower print. The black and white trend was bolder at Alexandre Herchcovitch, whose use ranged from polite pinstripes to brazen zebra prints. The Brazilian designer, popular with Lady Gaga, punched up his black and white with purple. Additional reporting by Eileen Houlihan, Erin Geiger Smith and

Nomura Securities Co, which is handling the sale of the shares, has received 10 times more applications to buy shares than the automaker plans to sell in the retail-only issue, said two sources at Japan's biggest brokerage who were briefed on the customer orders. They declined to be named as they are not authorised to speak to the public. There are customers who closed their bank time deposits and applied for Toyota shares, said a salesman at a Nomura branch in Tokyo. In another sign of strong interest in the new issue, Nomura has seen new accounts opened with it jump by 80 percent from normal levels since Toyota announced the sale, according to another Nomura official. Investors are attracted to the unlisted Toyota Model AA issue because the shares will pay an annual dividend starting at 0.5 percent and gradually rising to 2.5 percent in the fifth year. That compares with returns of about 0.05 percent or lower for five-year retail Japanese government bonds and time deposits at major banks. Investors must hold the stock for five years, after which they can convert them to common shares or have Toyota buy them back at the issue price. The sale could have consequences for other companies seeking stable long-term investors. Finance company Orix Corp  has said it is considering a similar issue and will be watching Toyota's market experiment. Nomura is limiting the sale to 50,000 shares per investor, but the strong interest could mean that not everyone who wants to buy will be able to do so. Toyota plans to sell up to 500 billion yen ($4 billion) of Model AA shares. It will price the issue as early as Thursday, and by next Tuesday at the latest, at 26-30 percent above the closing price of the common stock on that day. The world's biggest carmaker by sales aims eventually to sell 150 million shares, just under 5 percent of its outstanding shares. The new stock has faced opposition from foreign funds as the shares are only readily available in Japan. Toyota argues the shares would give investors more options in a country where most of the $14 trillion in financial assets held by individuals are in cash deposits. $1 = 122.0600 yen

The world's oldest bank was brought close to financial collapse by the euro zone debt crisis and is engulfed in a judicial probe over its costly purchase of a rival in 2007 and loss-making derivative trades it made in the deal's aftermath. Under pressure from Brussels, the bank must embark on a toughened-up turnaround plan that includes a 2.5 billion euro capital increase in 2014 - more than twice the amount originally penciled by its managers. EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said this month that should Monte Paschi fail to raise the funds on the market, the government would have to convert into equity the state loans it gave to the bank in February, effectively taking it over. The possibility that the Italian treasury could take a stake in the bank was already contemplated under the terms of the government's bailout scheme. This states that if Monte dei Paschi cannot pay its annual nine percent coupon on the state loans, it will issue shares to the treasury. However the sheer size of the capital increase demanded by the EU, the third cash call for the bank since 2008 excluding the bailout, makes the prospect of Monte dei Paschi falling under direct government control a lot more likely. The EU has also requested that the Siena-based lender, founded in 1472, shed more jobs and branches, cut the salaries of its top managers and gradually wind down its 29 billion euros Italian government bond portfolio. Monte dei Paschi is already cutting 4,600 jobs and shutting 400 branches under a previous turnaround plan which the EU thought was too soft. The new plan, to be approved by the bank's board on Tuesday, will be presented to investors before the market opens the following day. In another sign that the lender is bowing to pressure from Brussels, it cancelled coupon payments on three hybrid loans coming due at the end of the month. Almunia had told the Italian government in July that bond holders should share some of the pain of the bank's rescue. Monte dei Paschi has posted total net losses of nearly 8 billion euros in the past two years, and most analysts do not expect it to return to profit before 2015. Without the bailout, its core Tier 1 ratio - a measure of a bank's financial strength - would fall to just 6.5 percent, well below a minimum of nine percent required by the European Banking Authority, analysts estimate. The bank's judicial woes are also coming to a head. On Monday, the lender asked a London court to stay or dismiss legal action by Japan's Nomura (8604.T) over a risky 2009 derivative trade.

Putin, who has dominated Russian politics for 17 years, has not said whether he will run in presidential elections in March 2018. But the 64-year-old politician, who enjoys high popularity ratings, is widely expected to do so. Saturday's protest in the capital -- called We're sick of him -- was organized by the Open Russia movement founded by Kremlin critic Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Once Russia's richest man, he was freed by Putin in 2013 after spending a decade in jail for fraud, a charge Khodorkovsky said was politically-motivated. One of hundreds shepherded into a queue behind metal barriers by police before handing over their petitions one-by- one, Anna, a 16-year-old Moscow schoolgirl, said she hoped Putin would get the message and not run again. Nothing positive has happened in our country on his watch and I have the sense that things are getting worse, and that the main problem is the fact that those in power are the same, she  told Reuters. Her preference for president was opposition politician Alexei Navalny, who spent 15 days in jail last month after helping organize the biggest anti-government protests since 2012, which ended with over 1,000 arrests. Saturday's event, held in bright sunshine, was more modest, though authorities were taking no chances. A Reuters reporter counted at least 30 police buses and coaches in the area, packed with hundreds of riot police. Videos posted by Russian media showed police in riot gear detaining protesters in St Petersburg, where activists reported over 100 arrests. There was no official confirmation of the arrests. Interior Ministry officers detain a participant of an opposition protest, calling for Russian President Vladimir Putin not to run for another presidential term next year, in St. Petersburg, Russia, April 29, 2017.Anton VaganovStepping Up Pressure Police said 250 people had showed up in Moscow, the Interfax news agency reported, while Maria Baronova, an Open Russia activist, said at least 500 people had handed over a petition. Slideshow (4 Images)Irina Glushkova, 64, standing in the same line as the schoolgirl, said she and many others simply didn't agree with how Putin governed. I'm sick of the situation, she said. I'm the same age as Putin and I don't think I'm less intelligent than him, but my opinion is not taken into account at all. Authorities have stepped up pressure on Open Russia in recent days. The General Prosecutor's Office ruled on Wednesday that the activity of Open Russia's British arm was undesirable and accused it and other organizations of trying to discredit the election. On Thursday, police searched the Moscow offices of Open Russia's Russian branch. Activists said they confiscated 100,000 blank appeal forms which the foundation had hoped to hand out to people encouraging them to call for Putin to quit.  On Friday, REN TV, a Russian TV channel, broadcast a documentary about Open Russia activists, some of whom it accused of having criminal records, of being drug addicts, and of cultivating close links with the U.S. government. Activists dismissed the program as a cheap stunt designed to discredit them, with at least one noting that REN TV had somehow obtained video footage stored in his mobile phone.

Among the new partners are Addepar, which offers investment-tracking software, and Zelle, a digital payments network that aims to compete against the popular mobile application Venmo. Although the tools will not necessarily generate fees, they will help financial advisers do their jobs better, Morgan Stanley Chief Executive James Gorman said. They may also attract and retain customers who prefer digital options, he added. We've got to be careful that we are not penny wise and pound foolish, he said.  Big banks, investment firms and brokerages have been investing heavily in financial technology lately to avoid losing customers to Silicon Valley. In the wealth-management business, the most common threat has been so-called roboadvisors, like Wealthfront and Betterment, which manage clients' money using algorithms. They tend to charge less than human advisers and cater to customers with relatively little money to invest. Morgan Stanley's wealth business is sticking to a model that favors wealthier customers, Gorman said. However, he left the door open to serving those who want purely digital advice, and said he expects all customers to want cutting-edge digital options going forward. We will be building a lot of digital technology to support the financial advisors and the branch operations, he said. In December, Morgan Stanley said 20 of its top adviser teams would use Addepar's software to track wealthy clients' assets across all of their accounts - even those outside Morgan Stanley - to manage their assets better. Zelle, the peer-to-peer payments app, was developed by a group of big banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co and Bank of America Corp. It plans to launch later this year. In an earnings-related document, Morgan Stanley listed several other technology firms including cloud-based messaging service Twilio, data-analytics provider Cloudera and tax-software maker LifeYield, as partners it is using to modernize branches, communicate with customers and target clients who prefer digital options. Morgan Stanley has also made a number of key hires to build out its digital department, including Naureen Hassan, who joined as chief digital officer for the wealth business from Charles Schwab & Co Inc last year. The focus on technology is part of a broader strategy to increase profit margins in Morgan Stanley's wealth business to a range of 23-to-25 percent by next year, from a current 22 percent. As Gorman tells it, the technology can encourage customers to do more business with Morgan Stanley and allow advisers to use their time in more productive ways. Gorman feels strongly that Morgan Stanley will hit the 2017 target, he said. Morgan Stanley has also been trying to increase lending to wealth customers to bolster its bottom line. Since taking full control of the Smith Barney brokerage from Citigroup Inc in 2012, Morgan Stanley acquired a lush amount of deposits. It is working to put them to use through mortgages, lending against customers' investment portfolios and tailored loans that use fine art and other luxury items as collateral. Over the course of 2016, Morgan Stanley grew loans to wealth customers by 24 percent, to $55.3 billion.

They may also attract and retain customers who prefer digital options, he added. We've got to be careful that we are not penny wise and pound foolish, he said.  Big banks, investment firms and brokerages have been investing heavily in financial technology lately to avoid losing customers to Silicon Valley. In the wealth-management business, the most common threat has been so-called roboadvisors, like Wealthfront and Betterment, which manage clients' money using algorithms. They tend to charge less than human advisers and cater to customers with relatively little money to invest. Morgan Stanley's wealth business is sticking to a model that favors wealthier customers, Gorman said. However, he left the door open to serving those who want purely digital advice, and said he expects all customers to want cutting-edge digital options going forward. We will be building a lot of digital technology to support the financial advisors and the branch operations, he said. In December, Morgan Stanley said 20 of its top adviser teams would use Addepar's software to track wealthy clients' assets across all of their accounts - even those outside Morgan Stanley - to manage their assets better. Zelle, the peer-to-peer payments app, was developed by a group of big banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co and Bank of America Corp. It plans to launch later this year. In an earnings-related document, Morgan Stanley listed several other technology firms including cloud-based messaging service Twilio, data-analytics provider Cloudera and tax-software maker LifeYield, as partners it is using to modernize branches, communicate with customers and target clients who prefer digital options. Morgan Stanley has also made a number of key hires to build out its digital department, including Naureen Hassan, who joined as chief digital officer for the wealth business from Charles Schwab & Co Inc last year. The focus on technology is part of a broader strategy to increase profit margins in Morgan Stanley's wealth business to a range of 23-to-25 percent by next year, from a current 22 percent. As Gorman tells it, the technology can encourage customers to do more business with Morgan Stanley and allow advisers to use their time in more productive ways. Gorman feels strongly that Morgan Stanley will hit the 2017 target, he said. Morgan Stanley has also been trying to increase lending to wealth customers to bolster its bottom line. Since taking full control of the Smith Barney brokerage from Citigroup Inc in 2012, Morgan Stanley acquired a lush amount of deposits. It is working to put them to use through mortgages, lending against customers' investment portfolios and tailored loans that use fine art and other luxury items as collateral. Over the course of 2016, Morgan Stanley grew loans to wealth customers by 24 percent, to $55.3 billion.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-banks-future-idUSBRE9A203720131103","Banks hope futuristic flagships can tempt new customers","","November 3, 2013 /  8:10 AM / 4 years ago","","VELIZY, France (Reuters) - Installation art, interactive walls and a robot doorman; the flagship branches of the world's top banks have come a long way from the iron grilles and potted plants of old. To compete against online-only rivals and to attract a new generation of customers to branches, banks are installing sleek interiors and hi-tech gadgetry. ATMs that read fingerprints, touch-screen desks to flick through your finances and videoconference units for expert advice are all on display at payments-technology firm Wincor Nixdorf's (WING.DE) showroom in the Paris suburb of Velizy. Banks are investing a lot in their retail branches, said Steve Bousabata, head of Wincor's French banking services arm. They want customers to come back. The reason is clear: after years of relying on branches to drive retail revenue, European banks expect such networks to supply only 62 percent of sales by 2020 from today's average of 81 percent, according to Equinox Consulting. Banks, especially those still nursing losses from the financial crisis, are under pressure to cut costs and are balancing the need to pare back branch networks by sprucing up select outlets. But branches are still the first point of contact for many customers and are still the primary location for product sales like mortgages, new accounts and insurance, underlining the importance of upgrading them for a more tech-savvy generation. The difficulty is knowing exactly what belongs in the branch of the future and what is better left behind. Are all the things we see in branches today going to be seen in branches tomorrow? I very much doubt that, said Mike Baxter, head of management consultancy Bain's Americas Financial Services practice. There's an awful lot of experimentation of stuff that turns out to be unsuccessful and uneconomic. Flashy bank of the future branches mixing gadgetry with design similar to Apple's (AAPL.O) minimalist stores have been opened by BNP Paribas (BNPP.PA) in Paris, Barclays (BARC.L) in London and Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) in Berlin - at an estimated cost of 5 million euros ($7 million) each. They include lounge areas, giant interactive screens and other trimmings such as handbags for sale and pieces of art. Gauging their success is tricky. BNP was willing to give data on its refurbished flagship branch near the Paris Opera - which three years ago was fitted with a wall covered in plants, iPads for customer use and a touch-screen desk - saying that footfall was up 40 percent and new clients up 25 percent. Italy's Unicredit (CRDI.MI) also said that footfall and new business were up at its newly revamped flagship branch in the Bulgarian capital of Sofia, which offers welcoming scents and a touch-screen wall. Visits are up by an average of 60 percent while loans and deposits have doubled, a spokeswoman said. On the other hand, BNP has done away with some ideas that failed to click with consumers: it has scrapped the iPads and touch-screen desk in favor of an interactive wall. Deutsche Bank and Barclays declined to give data on single branches. More broadly, some 88 percent of bank executives view their flagship branches in main street areas as being successful in promoting brand awareness, according to a survey by Equinox. Robot Bankers Beyond Europe, the experiments are even bolder. In South Korea, where mobile banking has flourished faster than in the West, Hana Bank (086790.KS) allows mobile users to transfer money to one another by physically bumping smartphones. Shinhan Bank (055550.KS) has also introduced unmanned smart branch kiosks that communicate with handsets. Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA.AX) is using a mobile app to drive mortgage sales by offering clients data on houses for sale, while BBVA's (BBVA.MC) U.S. unit Compass is testing drive-through ATMs with videoconferencing. Customers of the Washington D.C. branch of Carolina Premier Bank (PARA.PK) will soon find themselves face-to-face with a robot, which will greet visitors from November 15. Although some of these advances may prove too gimmicky or not functional enough to catch on, long-distance banking via videoconference is seen as a way to reduce branch staffing without hurting service, though customers still prefer a physical point of contact somewhere along the line. Mortgage specialists sitting at headquarters, connecting via videoconference to the relationship manager; that works, said Bain's head of global retail banking, Dirk Vater. But bank-to-consumer, with people sitting on the sofa using Skype and Facetime, has not been adopted yet. It will eventually ... But not yet. Increased ATM functionality as used by Citibank (C.N) Asia and more secure biometric readers are also promising, he added. The ultimate question of whether to scrap the branch entirely is one that is not being considered, consultants said. The preference is for a hub-and-spoke model that pools resources in urban areas and reduces smaller, rural branches. While this may lead to more ambitious flagship outlets, it can create gaps for new competitors to fill: France's Nickel, which offers a low-cost current account, is creating a branch network with the country's 27,000 tobacconists. IDLnL6N0I62C3 Even in developed markets, the death of branches is somewhat exaggerated, Ernst & Young wrote in a 2012 report. We will see further evolution of the branch experience from something that looks like a local government office ...(to) a hybrid between coffee shop and technology store.

The plan is to build an all-new sports utility vehicle (SUV) to suit Chinese tastes, Lincoln China said in a statement. Ford plans to use an existing assembly plant it jointly operates with Chongqing Changan Automobile Co Ltd (000625.SZ) to produce the  Lincoln vehicles, a Ford spokesman in Shanghai said. Lincoln vehicles are currently imported into China, and their sales have jumped nearly 180 percent in 2016, the statement said.  The move to local production is a key next step in Lincoln’s evolution in China and will complement continued imports from North America, it said. The statement gave no other details about the plans. The Ford spokesman declined to give the model's anticipated production volume or describe the model other than to say it is an SUV. The Changan-Ford joint venture is in the process of getting approval for this move to produce Lincoln vehicles locally in China, said the spokesman. Lincoln China President Amy Marentic told Reuters in October that the brand was studying whether to produce cars locally in China. Lincoln was accelerating its entry into China with plans to have 65 Lincoln stores by the end of 2016, instead of previous plans of 60, with 80 planned for year-end 2017, she said. Marentic said the company would also open five to 10 smaller sales branches to tap into fast-growing auto sales in lower-tier Chinese cities.

Knopf.  The book, as yet untitled, is about the search for justice, not just in criminal cases but in life and society in general, Knopf said in a statement on Thursday. Publication is expected in January 2019. Bharara said his book would be about the law, integrity, leadership, decision making, and moral reasoning. It addresses what it means to do the right thing, how to avoid doing the wrong thing, and the role of thoughtfulness in making the best choice, Bharara said in a statement. In 2009, President Barack Obama appointed Bharara to serve as U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, which includes Manhattan.  During seven and a half years as the chief federal prosecutor in that region, Bharara oversaw several notable corruption and white-collar criminal cases, as well as prosecutions of terrorism suspects. Preet Bharara's life experience, coupled with his standing as a U.S. Attorney and the cases he tried as prosecutor, makes him uniquely qualified to write this book, said Sonny Mehta, editor-in-chief for Knopf, which is a division of Penguin Random House. Bharara, now a distinguished scholar in residence at New York University's law school, was unexpectedly fired by Trump on March 11 after refusing to step down. He had been among 46 U.S. attorneys who were told a day earlier to submit their resignations. In November, Bharara met with Trump at Trump Tower in New York City, three weeks after the presidential election, and said at the time that they had a good meeting and he agreed to remain in his post as a federal prosecutor. He was fired a few months later. This month, Bharara told ABC News in an interview that he received unusual phone calls from Trump after the election that made him uncomfortable. He said he was fired after declining to take the third call.  Bharara said he believed Trump's calls to him violated the usual boundaries between the executive branch and independent criminal investigators. Knopf spokesman Paul Bogaards said on Thursday that Bharara addresses the circumstances of his firing in the book proposal. Whether the book itself goes into the details of Bharara's firing remains an open question, Bogaards said.

Chief Executive John Chen said in an interview that the company's engineers have designed at least three different next-generation handsets that are being kicked around right now. The focus is going to be very keyboard centric, said Chen, the former Sybase CEO who took the reins of the Canadian company just over four months ago. Chen, viewed by tech industry insiders as a turnaround artist, wants BlackBerry to zero in on its core base of corporate and government clients, and on its services arm, which secures mobile devices on the internal networks of big clients. He sees that strategy as the best way to reverse market share losses to Apple Inc, Samsung Electronics and other companies that make smartphones powered by Google Inc's Android operating system. BlackBerry reported a fiscal fourth-quarter loss on Friday. Last month, at the annual Mobile World Congress trade fair in Barcelona, BlackBerry unveiled a new classic model with a keyboard that boasts a return of the command keys that include 'Menu,' 'Back,' 'Send' and 'End' buttons, along with a trackpad. The device, dubbed the Q20, will hit store shelves before the end of 2014. Last year, BlackBerry's product launches emphasized full touch screens. And even the keyboard-equipped devices that it did introduce came without the command keys, alienating some of their die-hard fans. Bbm for Desktops Chen, who has been meeting with BlackBerry clients, said another item that may be on the agenda is bringing the company's popular BlackBerry Messenger service, known as BBM, from mobile devices onto desktop computers. Such a move, Chen said, would allow employees of big companies and government agencies to go mobile on group chats started on their PCs, without skipping a beat. We are certainly going to take a very serious look at putting BBM on the desktop, he said. Last month, BlackBerry said that it would make BBM available on Microsoft Corp's Windows Phone and the upcoming Nokia X platforms in the coming months. The messaging tool was last year opened up to users of iPhones and Android devices. BBM, with over 80 million users, was a pioneering mobile-messaging service, but user growth has failed to keep pace with that of WhatsApp and other competitors, in part because BlackBerry had long refused to open the program other platforms. The potential value of a messaging platform was highlighted by Facebook Inc's acquisition of WhatsApp for $19 billion in stock and cash. The news had helped boost BlackBerry's stock. In February, BlackBerry outlined its plans to launch BBM Protected for enterprise clients in regulated industries, such as the financial sector. Chen said BlackBerry is now back on solid financial footing after it sold the vast majority of its real estate portfolio and arranged a convertible debt financing in 2013. The CEO said he was very comfortable with the balance sheet and plans to be cash flow positive or neutral by the end of this fiscal year. Still, any hope of turning a profit is quite a few quarters away. It is our plan to return to profitability at some point in fiscal 2016, said Chen. We need to generate cash and make money on a consistent basis, and it's got to come from our big installed base of enterprise and if we can do that, then we can branch out to do a lot of other stuff.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-immigration-legal-idUSKBN15S14H","Courts likely to probe Trump's intent in issuing travel ban","","February 13, 2017 /  11:04 AM / 5 months ago","","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Washington state’s attorney general has promised to uncover what truly motivated President Donald Trump's executive order on immigration, an approach that could prompt a rare public examination of how a U.S. president makes national security decisions.  The presidential order imposed a temporary ban on travelers from seven predominantly Muslim countries, but a federal judge has barred enforcement of the order while the court considers a challenge brought by Washington state.  On Thursday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit left the judge’s ruling in place without deciding the ultimate merits of either side’s arguments. In its decision, the 9th Circuit cited a previous case establishing that “circumstantial evidence of intent, including … statements by decisionmakers, may be considered in evaluating whether a governmental action was motivated by a discriminatory purpose.”  The Trump administration has argued that the ban is necessary to prevent potential terrorists from entering the country and is not discriminatory because the text of the order does not mention any particular religion.  Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson signaled on Sunday that he will move aggressively to obtain written documents and emails authored by administration officials that might contain evidence the order was unconstitutionally biased against Muslims or Islam. He also said he would also move to depose administration officials. Legal scholars say this could move the court into uncharted waters.  The idea of looking at motive has never really been applied to the president, said John Yoo, a former Justice Department lawyer in the George W. Bush administration.      It would represent a serious expansion of judicial oversight of what the president and the entire executive branch does, said Yoo, now a professor at the University of California at Berkeley School of Law.       Related CoverageSeattle judge says Trump travel ban case should continue during appealsThe Trump presidency on Feb. 13 at 8:05 P.M. EST    Scrutinizing Campaign Statements  Trump has harshly criticized the federal judge in Washington for his decision and a top White House aide on Sunday accused the 9th Circuit of a judicial usurpation of power.  The president's powers here are beyond question, senior policy adviser Stephen Miller told Fox News Sunday. U.S. courts have historically been careful about probing the motives behind laws, in part out of respect for the separation of powers between branches of government. But on questions of racial or religious discrimination, they have sometimes allowed intent to be examined.  In 1993, for instance, the Supreme Court found that an ordinance banning animal sacrifice in Hialeah, Florida, though neutral on its face, was actually intended to discriminate against a Santeria church, which holds sacrifice as a sacred rite. People participate in a protest against U.S. President Donald Trump's immigration policy at the Jewish Rally for Refugees in New York City, U.S. February 12, 2017.Stephanie KeithStephen Griffin, a professor of constitutional law at Tulane University, said cases like this make it clear that the court can look beyond the words of Trump's executive order. Motive is relevant, he said.  One question in the current case is likely to be which, if any, of Trump’s statements should be admissible in examining the administration’s motives in issuing the order.  If you're allowed to use evidence from the campaign, the state's case is very strong, said  Griffin. In December, 2015, days after a mass attack by an Islamic State sympathizers in San Bernardino, California, Trump called for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our representatives can figure out what is going on. He later said he supported only suspending immigration from areas with a history of terrorism. Stanford University Law School professor Michael McConnell, a former federal appeals judge, said the court should not consider campaign statements, because Trump only swore an oath to uphold the Constitution after he became president.  In its complaint, Washington cited an interview the president did on the day the order was signed with the Christian Broadcasting Network, saying he would prioritize Christians in the Middle East for admission as refugees.     Who Can Be Questioned? Legal experts are divided on whether the state's lawyers should be allowed to question the president's advisers – and possibly even the president – in depositions. The White House could potentially claim executive privilege, which protects the president and other officials from subpoena, said Thomas Lee, an expert in constitutional law at Fordham University.  Anna-Rose Mathieson a partner with the California Appellate Law Group said that one person who might be more easily deposed would be presidential adviser and former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who told Fox News the president had asked him to put a commission together to figure out how to make a Muslim ban legal. David Pressman, a partner at Boies Schiller Flexner and former assistant secretary of Homeland Security in the Obama administration, said there are important protections in place so that the executive branch can receive national security advice. You don't want a situation in which courts are adjudicating intelligence that is coming to the executive when trying to formulate policy, said Pressman. Though in this case, Pressman said he did not believe the national security argument for the order was clear, opening the door to further questioning. The next steps in the case are not certain.

Myanmar's banking system is among the world's most antiquated, crippled by years of sanctions and disastrous socialist policies. Moving funds abroad often requires help from ancient hawala underground money-transfer agents. Over the past two months, however, private banks have introduced basic electronic banking - with limits.

The plan is to build an all-new sports utility vehicle (SUV) to suit Chinese tastes, Lincoln China said in a statement. Ford plans to use an existing assembly plant it jointly operates with Chongqing Changan Automobile Co Ltd (000625.SZ) to produce the  Lincoln vehicles, a Ford spokesman in Shanghai said. Lincoln vehicles are currently imported into China, and their sales have jumped nearly 180 percent in 2016, the statement said.  The move to local production is a key next step in Lincoln’s evolution in China and will complement continued imports from North America, it said. The statement gave no other details about the plans. The Ford spokesman declined to give the model's anticipated production volume or describe the model other than to say it is an SUV. The Changan-Ford joint venture is in the process of getting approval for this move to produce Lincoln vehicles locally in China, said the spokesman. Lincoln China President Amy Marentic told Reuters in October that the brand was studying whether to produce cars locally in China. Lincoln was accelerating its entry into China with plans to have 65 Lincoln stores by the end of 2016, instead of previous plans of 60, with 80 planned for year-end 2017, she said. Marentic said the company would also open five to 10 smaller sales branches to tap into fast-growing auto sales in lower-tier Chinese cities.

The ABA has run a formal bidding process to secure a marketplace lending partner, spokesman John Hall confirmed on Friday. He could not say which companies were under consideration because the information was confidential. Marketplace lenders like LendingClub Corp (LC.N), Prosper Funding and Funding Circle connect borrowers and lenders through their platform and charge an origination fee. They are part of a broader trend of financial-technology companies upending traditional methods of banking, where customers visit brick-and-mortar branches to apply for mortgages, open investment accounts or get small business loans. To stay competitive, big banks have launched their own digital offerings or sealed individual partnerships with startups. For instance, JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) partnered with marketplace lender On Deck Capital Inc (ONDK.N) in 2015, while Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) launched its own online consumer lending service this year. But smaller banks have instead relied on ABA to source vendors for technology and other services. The association mostly represents banks with less than $250 million in assets. Such partnerships give startups access to a large network of customers, while allowing banks to improve digital offerings overnight without having to bear the development costs.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-education-yale-singapore-idUSLNE8BU00D20121231","Yale under fire for new campus in restrictive Singapore","","December 31, 2012 /  10:11 AM / 5 years ago","","NEW HAVEN (Reuters) - For more than 300 years, Yale University has prided itself on training top students to question and analyze, to challenge and critique. Now, Yale is seeking to export those values by establishing the first foreign campus to bear its name, a liberal arts college in Singapore that is set to open this summer. The ambitious, multimillion-dollar project thrills many in the Yale community who say it will help the university maintain its prestige and build global influence. But it has also stirred sharp criticism from faculty and human-rights advocates who say it is impossible to build an elite college dedicated to free inquiry in an authoritarian nation with heavy restrictions on public speech and assembly. Yale's motto is 'Lux et veritas,' or 'Light and truth,' said Michael Fischer, a Yale professor of computer science. We're going into a place with severe curbs on light and truth ... We're redefining the brand in a way that's contrary to Yale's values. Yale President Richard Levin describes the new venture as a chance to extend Yale's tradition of nurturing independent thinkers to a dynamic young nation at the crossroads of Asia. In the 19th century, Yale scholars fanned out to launch dozens of American colleges, Levin noted in a 2010 memo presenting the concept to faculty. Yale could influence the course of 21st century education as profoundly, he wrote. Levin, who spent years expanding Yale's campus in New Haven before initiating the Singapore project in 2010, has announced plans to retire at the end of the academic year. His successor, Yale Provost Peter Salovey, also supports the Singapore venture. Working with the National University of Singapore, or NUS, Yale is building a comprehensive liberal arts college from scratch. The school will offer majors from anthropology to urban studies, electives from fractal geometry to moral reasoning, and a rich menu of extracurricular activities -- sports, drama, debate, even a juggling club. Scheduled to open this summer with 150 students, it is slated to grow to about 1,000 undergraduates living in a high-rise campus now under construction. While American universities have been venturing overseas for decades, they have mostly offered tightly focused degree programs, often for graduate students. The closest analogy to the Yale project may be New York University's branch campuses now under construction in Abu Dhabi and Shanghai. But the new NYU campuses are extensions of the university. The Yale venture, which targets top students from around the globe, is an unusual hybrid. It will be called Yale-NUS College. It will draw some faculty -- and its inaugural president, Pericles Lewis -- straight from New Haven. Students will spend the summer before freshman year in New Haven, attending seminars with Yale faculty. When they graduate, they will be welcomed into the Association of Yale Alumni. Yet Yale officials are emphatic that the new school is not a branch campus. The degrees it issues will not be Yale degrees. It is not Yale, said Charles Bailyn, an astronomy professor on leave from Yale to serve as the founding dean of Yale-NUS. Opportunity Or Frankenyale? The new college will be funded entirely by the Singapore government, which will also subsidize tuition. Singapore citizens will pay about $18,000 a year, including room and board. International students will pay about $43,000 unless they secure a discount by committing to work for a Singapore company for three years after graduation. Yale and Singapore will get an equal number of seats on the new college's governing board -- but Singapore's education minister must approve all the Yale nominees. The arrangement exposes Yale to risk because its name is on the college, yet the university does not have control over the end product, said Richard Edelstein, who studies trends in higher education at the University of California at Berkeley. One angry member of Yale's faculty, Christopher Miller, a professor of French and African American studies, has dubbed the venture Frankenyale. Those involved in the project say the novel structure is a boon that will enable educational experimentation, with an emphasis on interdisciplinary seminars and student research. It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to build a new college program from the ground up, said Yale anthropologist Bernard Bate, who has signed on to teach in Singapore. He and others say they will bring the best of their new approach back to New Haven. And they contend that fears about censorship in Singapore are wildly overblown. That issue came to the fore last spring, when Yale faculty voted 100 to 69 for a resolution raising concern about the venture in light of the history of lack of respect for civil and political rights in Singapore. Human Rights Watch, the international advocacy group, subsequently accused Yale of betraying the spirit of the university. This month the American Association of University Professors weighed in, expressing concern about the project's implications for academic freedom. Singapore, an island nation in southeast Asia, is a democracy but has been dominated by one political party since securing independence from Britain half a century ago. In the name of stability and security, the government restricts public demonstrations to a corner of one park and heavily regulates news and entertainment, according to the U.S. State Department. Last year a British author was jailed for writing a book critical of Singapore's judiciary. This spring the government prevented an opposition politician from leaving the country to speak at the Oslo Freedom Forum. Still, Yale faculty working on the new college said they had spoken with foreign professors teaching on other campuses in Singapore and came away convinced that academic freedom would be respected. George Bishop, a Yale PhD who been teaching psychology at the National University of Singapore since 1991, says he has never felt restricted. In a class on the AIDS epidemic, he and his students freely discuss how Singapore's anti-sodomy laws hinder the nation's public-health response. We criticize the government all the time in class, said Bishop, who has joined the faculty of the new college. Plenty of Applicants Yet Yale-NUS will not be free and open in the way American students may expect. Singapore bans speech deemed to promote racial or religious strife. As long as they toe that line, students will be free to hear speakers and express views inside campus buildings. But many outdoor assemblies will require a government permit, Yale-NUS President Lewis said. Singapore law defines assembly quite broadly, to include a single protester holding a sign or an open-air debate. Can you march on City Hall? asked Bailyn, the Yale-NUS dean. No, he answered -- but said that didn't trouble him, as that's not really an educational matter. Bailyn said he had been promised complete freedom with the core mission of the college -- researching, teaching, unfettered discussion. Indeed, Yale-NUS faculty say they expect Singapore to be cautious about interfering with the new college for fear of provoking an incident and prompting Yale to withdraw its name. We know what a liberal arts education is, what intellectual freedom is, said Keith Darden, a professor of social sciences at Yale-NUS, and we'll accept nothing less than that for ourselves and our students. Under the philosophical questions lies a pragmatic one: Will the new college succeed? For all its wealth, Singapore has not always proved an ideal marketplace for higher education. Australia's University of New South Wales opened a campus in Singapore in 2007 -- only to shut it after one semester because of low enrolment. This fall, NYU announced it would close its graduate film school in Singapore because of financial trouble. Other American ventures in Singapore have done better, including a music conservatory developed by Johns Hopkins University. Interest in Yale-NUS is running high. Almost 2,600 students from around the globe have applied for the initial 150 spots. Several dozen have already been accepted -- among them, Singaporean students who suggest Yale's faculty might do well to back off the criticism and trust in the value of the liberal arts education they hold so dear. Ideological purity and moral righteousness from these critics will not make Singapore a free society, but education and the spread of ideas will, Jared Yeo, a Singapore native accepted to Yale-NUS, wrote on the college's blog. Perhaps the most pointed critique of the New Haven protests came from E-Ching Ng, a Singaporean who earned an undergraduate degree at Yale and remained on campus to study linguistics. In a column in the Yale Daily News last spring, she urged faculty to respect the rules Singapore has developed to maintain public order. Qur'an burning is illegal in Singapore, and we like it that way, she wrote. We prioritize our values differently, and different doesn't mean wrong. At least, that's what I learned from a Yale liberal arts education. (Reporting By Stephanie Simon in New Haven. Additional reporting by Kevin Lim in Singapore.

It would be good to see more of these, he added, pointing to a two-month-old blue-and-yellow ATM run by Co-Operative Bank, one of Myanmar's 13 private banks. That's about to happen: the central bank is preparing to launch a new nationwide ATM network within two months and is in talks with Visa International's Plus and MasterCard International's Cirrus to introduce international banking within six months to a year, part of sweeping reforms in the former British colony, also known as Burma. Myanmar's banking system is among the world's most antiquated, crippled by years of sanctions and disastrous socialist policies. Moving funds abroad often requires help from ancient hawala underground money-transfer agents. Over the past two months, however, private banks have introduced basic electronic banking - with limits. ATM machines, for instance, cannot be shared between rival banks, and many are offline. Although U.S. and European sanctions have been suspended, local banks still cannot connect internationally. Our payment system is still quite simple. It's mostly based on cash, Maung Maung Win, one of two Central Bank of Myanmar deputy governors, said in an interview in the commercial capital Yangon. Even some of the big companies or our government departments like to use cash. Within two months, he said, a new department within the central bank, the Myanmar Payment Union, will introduce a new debit-card network allowing banks to share ATM machines and offer a wider array of services, among the biggest changes in the financial sector since the managed float of the kyat on April 2. That will be followed by a second phase of international services by the middle of next year, or possibly as soon as six months, he added. The timing depends on the execution of Washington's decision this month to suspend sanctions. We're Waiting Since 1988, when the former military junta violently cracked down on student protesters, the United States has imposed what it calls a web of overlapping sanctions. This was done through five laws and four presidential documents. On May 17, the Obama administration announced it would ease those restrictions, allowing U.S. investments and financial services in Myanmar for the first time in decades. This was in recognition of dramatic political changes. But Washington only suspended sanctions, instead of lifting them, to ensure no backtracking on human rights. The laws remain on the books. U.S. businesses wanting to do business in Myanmar, including banks, must apply to Washington for a general license, a step that Myanmar's central bank expects could take weeks or even months. We're waiting, said Maung Maung Win. As a result, Western financial services are still non-existent in Myanmar and international credit and debit cards remain off limits - a frequent source of irritation for tourists and business executives now descending on the country. The restrictions also prohibit local banks from moving money to U.S. and European bank networks - effectively freezing Myanmar out of global banking. Anticipating changes, Myanmar's central bank has opened discussions with MasterCard and Visa, said Maung Maung Win. From our side we are willing to start as soon as possible, he said, adding the central bank wanted to connect to the international network ahead of the 2013 Southeast Asian Games, due to open late next year in Myanmar's capital, Naypyitaw. MasterCard is looking at opportunities in Myanmar, said Matthew Driver, division president for Southeast Asia at MasterCard Worldwide. Electronic payments will be crucial in helping Myanmar connect to the global economy, facilitating business activity, and creating a better life for its citizens through financial inclusion, he said in a statement e-mailed to Reuters. Local banking was not always so fraught. Dozens of local and foreign banks thrived in the 1950s, but the industry withered after a 1962 military coup introduced a disastrous Burmese Way to Socialism and sweeping nationalistion. In 1988, the country's former military rulers re-introduced a market economy. Soon after, in 1992, private banks were allowed. Foreign banks began opening representative offices, poised for a day when they could do business in the resource-rich country of about 60 million people. In 2003, shady money-lending practices caught up with the banking sector, sparking a crisis exacerbated by inept decision-making. Three banks collapsed. Accusations of money laundering have since begun to fade but other problems are entrenched, including restrictions that prevent foreign banks from doing little more than research at representative offices. Currently, 17 foreign banks maintain such offices, said the central bank. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, that number peaked at around 40. In recent weeks, it has started to rise again. Asked which banks were most keen to enter Myanmar, Maung Maung Win said Japanese banks led the pack, including Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd and Sumitomo Corp, followed by Singapore's United Overseas Bank Ltd, DBS Group Holdings Ltd and Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp Ltd , and then Malaysia's CIMB Group Holdings Bhd . Banks from Vietnam, China and the United States also expressed strong interest, he added. He said foreign banks might be allowed to open joint ventures or subsidiaries as early as next year and no later than 2015, pending new foreign direct investment laws and the outcome of deliberations at Myanmar's Finance Ministry, which oversees the central bank. In the meantime, domestic banks are rushing to roll out services ahead of foreign competition. Irrawaddy Bank, owned by local tycoon Zaw Zaw's Max Myanmar conglomerate, is less than two years old but aims to double in size to 45 branches and 1,500 staff next year from about 20 branches and 970 staff now, Zaw Zaw said in an interview. Some have started online bill payments and domestic remittances, adding to the thrill for card-holders such as Naing Lin Oo, who uses ATMs about twice a month. It is far easier than using cash, he said outside Yangon's second-largest shopping plaza, itself a new phenomenon, open for just two months. But we really need to see more of these, he said."
"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-blackberry-results-chen-idUSBREA2R0Q420140328","New BlackBerry phones to cater to keyboard aficionados: CEO","","March 28, 2014 /  11:50 AM / 3 years ago","","TORONTO (Reuters) - BlackBerry Ltd plans to introduce high-end smartphones that cater to keyboard aficionados in the coming 18 months, in an effort to win back core corporate and government clients who have shunned the company's touch-screen devices. Chief Executive John Chen said in an interview that the company's engineers have designed at least three different next-generation handsets that are being kicked around right now. The focus is going to be very keyboard centric, said Chen, the former Sybase CEO who took the reins of the Canadian company just over four months ago. Chen, viewed by tech industry insiders as a turnaround artist, wants BlackBerry to zero in on its core base of corporate and government clients, and on its services arm, which secures mobile devices on the internal networks of big clients. He sees that strategy as the best way to reverse market share losses to Apple Inc, Samsung Electronics and other companies that make smartphones powered by Google Inc's Android operating system. BlackBerry reported a fiscal fourth-quarter loss on Friday. Last month, at the annual Mobile World Congress trade fair in Barcelona, BlackBerry unveiled a new classic model with a keyboard that boasts a return of the command keys that include 'Menu,' 'Back,' 'Send' and 'End' buttons, along with a trackpad. The device, dubbed the Q20, will hit store shelves before the end of 2014. Last year, BlackBerry's product launches emphasized full touch screens. And even the keyboard-equipped devices that it did introduce came without the command keys, alienating some of their die-hard fans. Bbm for Desktops Chen, who has been meeting with BlackBerry clients, said another item that may be on the agenda is bringing the company's popular BlackBerry Messenger service, known as BBM, from mobile devices onto desktop computers. Such a move, Chen said, would allow employees of big companies and government agencies to go mobile on group chats started on their PCs, without skipping a beat. We are certainly going to take a very serious look at putting BBM on the desktop, he said. Last month, BlackBerry said that it would make BBM available on Microsoft Corp's Windows Phone and the upcoming Nokia X platforms in the coming months. The messaging tool was last year opened up to users of iPhones and Android devices. BBM, with over 80 million users, was a pioneering mobile-messaging service, but user growth has failed to keep pace with that of WhatsApp and other competitors, in part because BlackBerry had long refused to open the program other platforms. The potential value of a messaging platform was highlighted by Facebook Inc's acquisition of WhatsApp for $19 billion in stock and cash. The news had helped boost BlackBerry's stock. In February, BlackBerry outlined its plans to launch BBM Protected for enterprise clients in regulated industries, such as the financial sector. Chen said BlackBerry is now back on solid financial footing after it sold the vast majority of its real estate portfolio and arranged a convertible debt financing in 2013. The CEO said he was very comfortable with the balance sheet and plans to be cash flow positive or neutral by the end of this fiscal year. Still, any hope of turning a profit is quite a few quarters away. It is our plan to return to profitability at some point in fiscal 2016, said Chen. We need to generate cash and make money on a consistent basis, and it's got to come from our big installed base of enterprise and if we can do that, then we can branch out to do a lot of other stuff.

Now, Yale is seeking to export those values by establishing the first foreign campus to bear its name, a liberal arts college in Singapore that is set to open this summer. The ambitious, multimillion-dollar project thrills many in the Yale community who say it will help the university maintain its prestige and build global influence. But it has also stirred sharp criticism from faculty and human-rights advocates who say it is impossible to build an elite college dedicated to free inquiry in an authoritarian nation with heavy restrictions on public speech and assembly. Yale's motto is 'Lux et veritas,' or 'Light and truth,' said Michael Fischer, a Yale professor of computer science. We're going into a place with severe curbs on light and truth ... We're redefining the brand in a way that's contrary to Yale's values. Yale President Richard Levin describes the new venture as a chance to extend Yale's tradition of nurturing independent thinkers to a dynamic young nation at the crossroads of Asia. In the 19th century, Yale scholars fanned out to launch dozens of American colleges, Levin noted in a 2010 memo presenting the concept to faculty. Yale could influence the course of 21st century education as profoundly, he wrote. Levin, who spent years expanding Yale's campus in New Haven before initiating the Singapore project in 2010, has announced plans to retire at the end of the academic year. His successor, Yale Provost Peter Salovey, also supports the Singapore venture. Working with the National University of Singapore, or NUS, Yale is building a comprehensive liberal arts college from scratch. The school will offer majors from anthropology to urban studies, electives from fractal geometry to moral reasoning, and a rich menu of extracurricular activities -- sports, drama, debate, even a juggling club. Scheduled to open this summer with 150 students, it is slated to grow to about 1,000 undergraduates living in a high-rise campus now under construction. While American universities have been venturing overseas for decades, they have mostly offered tightly focused degree programs, often for graduate students. The closest analogy to the Yale project may be New York University's branch campuses now under construction in Abu Dhabi and Shanghai. But the new NYU campuses are extensions of the university. The Yale venture, which targets top students from around the globe, is an unusual hybrid. It will be called Yale-NUS College. It will draw some faculty -- and its inaugural president, Pericles Lewis -- straight from New Haven. Students will spend the summer before freshman year in New Haven, attending seminars with Yale faculty. When they graduate, they will be welcomed into the Association of Yale Alumni. Yet Yale officials are emphatic that the new school is not a branch campus. The degrees it issues will not be Yale degrees. It is not Yale, said Charles Bailyn, an astronomy professor on leave from Yale to serve as the founding dean of Yale-NUS. Opportunity Or Frankenyale? The new college will be funded entirely by the Singapore government, which will also subsidize tuition. Singapore citizens will pay about $18,000 a year, including room and board. International students will pay about $43,000 unless they secure a discount by committing to work for a Singapore company for three years after graduation. Yale and Singapore will get an equal number of seats on the new college's governing board -- but Singapore's education minister must approve all the Yale nominees. The arrangement exposes Yale to risk because its name is on the college, yet the university does not have control over the end product, said Richard Edelstein, who studies trends in higher education at the University of California at Berkeley. One angry member of Yale's faculty, Christopher Miller, a professor of French and African American studies, has dubbed the venture Frankenyale. Those involved in the project say the novel structure is a boon that will enable educational experimentation, with an emphasis on interdisciplinary seminars and student research. It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to build a new college program from the ground up, said Yale anthropologist Bernard Bate, who has signed on to teach in Singapore. He and others say they will bring the best of their new approach back to New Haven. And they contend that fears about censorship in Singapore are wildly overblown. That issue came to the fore last spring, when Yale faculty voted 100 to 69 for a resolution raising concern about the venture in light of the history of lack of respect for civil and political rights in Singapore. Handout image shows an artist's rendition of the Yale NUS College in Singapore.Yale NUS College/HandoutHuman Rights Watch, the international advocacy group, subsequently accused Yale of betraying the spirit of the university. This month the American Association of University Professors weighed in, expressing concern about the project's implications for academic freedom. Singapore, an island nation in southeast Asia, is a democracy but has been dominated by one political party since securing independence from Britain half a century ago. In the name of stability and security, the government restricts public demonstrations to a corner of one park and heavily regulates news and entertainment, according to the U.S. State Department. Last year a British author was jailed for writing a book critical of Singapore's judiciary. This spring the government prevented an opposition politician from leaving the country to speak at the Oslo Freedom Forum. Still, Yale faculty working on the new college said they had spoken with foreign professors teaching on other campuses in Singapore and came away convinced that academic freedom would be respected. George Bishop, a Yale PhD who been teaching psychology at the National University of Singapore since 1991, says he has never felt restricted. In a class on the AIDS epidemic, he and his students freely discuss how Singapore's anti-sodomy laws hinder the nation's public-health response. We criticize the government all the time in class, said Bishop, who has joined the faculty of the new college. Slideshow (2 Images)Plenty of Applicants Yet Yale-NUS will not be free and open in the way American students may expect. Singapore bans speech deemed to promote racial or religious strife. As long as they toe that line, students will be free to hear speakers and express views inside campus buildings. But many outdoor assemblies will require a government permit, Yale-NUS President Lewis said. Singapore law defines assembly quite broadly, to include a single protester holding a sign or an open-air debate. Can you march on City Hall? asked Bailyn, the Yale-NUS dean. No, he answered -- but said that didn't trouble him, as that's not really an educational matter. Bailyn said he had been promised complete freedom with the core mission of the college -- researching, teaching, unfettered discussion. Indeed, Yale-NUS faculty say they expect Singapore to be cautious about interfering with the new college for fear of provoking an incident and prompting Yale to withdraw its name. We know what a liberal arts education is, what intellectual freedom is, said Keith Darden, a professor of social sciences at Yale-NUS, and we'll accept nothing less than that for ourselves and our students. Under the philosophical questions lies a pragmatic one: Will the new college succeed? For all its wealth, Singapore has not always proved an ideal marketplace for higher education. Australia's University of New South Wales opened a campus in Singapore in 2007 -- only to shut it after one semester because of low enrollment. This fall, NYU announced it would close its graduate film school in Singapore because of financial trouble. Other American ventures in Singapore have done better, including a music conservatory developed by Johns Hopkins University. Interest in Yale-NUS is running high. Almost 2,600 students from around the globe have applied for the initial 150 spots. Several dozen have already been accepted -- among them, Singaporean students who suggest Yale's faculty might do well to back off the criticism and trust in the value of the liberal arts education they hold so dear. Ideological purity and moral righteousness from these critics will not make Singapore a free society, but education and the spread of ideas will, Jared Yeo, a Singapore native accepted to Yale-NUS, wrote on the college's blog. Perhaps the most pointed critique of the New Haven protests came from E-Ching Ng, a Singaporean who earned an undergraduate degree at Yale and remained on campus to study linguistics. In a column in the Yale Daily News last spring, she urged faculty to respect the rules Singapore has developed to maintain public order. Qur'an burning is illegal in Singapore, and we like it that way, she wrote. We prioritize our values differently, and different doesn't mean wrong. At least, that's what I learned from a Yale liberal arts education.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/popular-ma-santander-idUSL8N1J523T","How Popular was caught off guard by Europe's abrupt takeover","","June 8, 2017 /  3:15 PM / 2 months ago","","MADRID (Reuters) - When the 1,644 Spanish branches of Banco Popular POP.MC opened their doors on Monday morning, the bank's chairman Emilio Saracho still hoped the 91-year-old lender, once the most efficient in Europe, could be saved. The previous Friday, shortly after Popular suffered another selloff on the stock market, he had sent an email to the bank's staff to tell them it was solvent and they should keep working hard to overcome the current situation. We need to work together and believe in what we do, Saracho wrote. JP Morgan and Lazard, which had been advising Popular since early May on finding a merger partner or raising new capital, had spent the weekend working the phones with other Spanish lenders in a bid to find a last minute solution. And the bank had requested emergency central bank liquidity that it believed meant it had a whole week to review its options and try to draw a line under a deposit flight that had wiped a quarter of its deposits. What Saracho didn't appear to measure was that the fate of Spain's sixth-biggest bank would be sealed in hours, not days or months as in previous European banking meltdowns. The swift maneuvering by Europe's bank regulators marks a sharp and brutal change in the way they deal with struggling banks, which could become a blueprint for handling other cases, especially in Italy where the rescue of troubled lenders has been under discussion for months. Previous bank rescues in the euro zone have involved protracted negotiations and government bailouts, even after new rules came in following the financial crisis, aimed at preventing taxpayer money being used in bank bailouts.  However, the abruptness of the action by the authorities could raise questions about whether regulators and the Spanish government spent enough time exploring other options potentially less painful for shareholders or bondholders. That, in turn, could now pave the way for legal claims to be filed. The ECB, the Spanish government and Popular all declined to comment. Trigger On Saturday, the Single Resolution Board (SRB), a regulatory body responsible for dealing with the euro zone's banking crises, met in Brussels to discuss the risks posed by Popular for Spain's and Europe's financial stability. Based on an independent valuation by Spanish boutique investment firm Arcano which showed Popular had a capital shortfall of up to 8 billion euros, the SRB concluded the bank would likely fail to meet its financial obligations. It ordered an immediate fire sale, setting in motion the mechanism to take over the lender. Saracho was left by the side of the road by the European resolution body, said one source, adding that JP Morgan's last-ditch attempt at the weekend to find a buyer was predicated on an understanding that the SRB would soon move on Popular. The SRB declined to comment. Sources familiar with SRB strategy say the initial objective was to intervene in Popular on Friday, June 9, ahead of the weekend, to give enough time for negotiations. But both the volume of deposit withdrawals on Monday and the determination of European authorities to use their new banking resolution powers would speed things up dramatically. In the early afternoon of Tuesday, Saracho picked up the phone to call Spain's Economy Minister Luis de Guindos and let him know Popular had run out of collateral to obtain new ECB liquidity. Branches might not open on Wednesday morning. There was a bank run, the ECB's deputy governor Vitor Constancio said on Thursday in response to questions about why the authorities had not spent more time analyzing other options to salvage the bank. It was no longer a question of making sure the bank had enough capital to meet its long term obligations, so much as ensuring it had cash on hand to stay open. It was not a matter of assessing the developments of solvency as such, but the liquidity issue. Within six hours, the SRB had swooped, cancelling the investments of Popular's shareholders and junior bondholders with the stroke of a pen and selling the lender for a solitary euro to Spanish banking goliath Santander (SAN.MC).

She declined to comment on whether the bank has buyers lined up. BofA Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan last fall said the second-largest U.S. bank would look to streamline the space it has assembled through years of acquisitions as part of its New BAC cost-cutting program. The Charlotte-based bank is also looking to build capital to absorb mortgage-related losses and meet new international standards. The sale of the buildings will not affect employees or third-party tenants, Raulerson said. The Hearst Tower houses a three-story trading floor, which sources say has lost traders over the years as the bank shifts more investment banking operations to New York. Real estate ownership is not a core business for Bank of America, Raulerson said. Therefore, we are currently reviewing our portfolio and making the decision to sell our ownership interest in certain properties. The bank has a long history in Charlotte and New York and expects to maintain a significant presence in those cities for years to come, she said. Among other properties, the bank still owns its headquarters building in Charlotte and has a 49 percent ownership stake in the Bank of America Tower at One Bryant Park, its base in Midtown Manhattan. Those properties are not part of the review, Raulerson said. Selling properties allows BofA to get out of the landlord business and focus on banking, said Andrew Jenkins, managing partner at Karnes Research, a real estate research firm. It still makes sense, though, for the bank to own properties where it occupies most of the space, he said. It may not be the best time for the bank to be selling property in Charlotte, where the city center office building vacancy rate is above 13 percent, Jenkins said. The vacancy rate was as low as 2.8 percent in 2008, before the financial crisis spurred a retrenchment by the city's banks. BofA also faces an unusual situation with the Fifth Third Center, where it has leased space to Cincinnati, Ohio-based regional bank Fifth Third Bancorp since 2010. Fifth Third is opening a bank branch in the 30-story tower, which is across the street from Bank of America headquarters. Bank of America said last month that corporate workplace executive Gene Godbold, who is in charge of the bank's properties, will retire on February 15. His duties will be assumed by global corporate services executive Patty Clement, who reports to Chief Financial Officer Bruce Thompson. Reporting By Rick Rothacker; editing by John Wallace"

Saudi Arabia's push to diversify its economy under its National Transformation Plan provides a big opportunity for international banks, as well as the privatization of state-controlled enterprises such as Saudi Aramco's [IPO-ARMO.SE]planned initial public offering. MUFG, which is ranked as one of the leading project finance lenders globally and in the region, is working with clients in the Middle East including Saudi Aramco, Acwa Power IPO-ACWA.SE and Mubadala Development [MUDEV.UL], Algaseer said. MUFG was expecting around $350 billion in project finance opportunities in Saudi Arabia by 2022 and more across the region in areas such as power, alternative energy, health and education, Algaseer said. In this part of the world, they do have good liquidity reserves and good underground energy reserves and a good need to shift from relying on oil, so if these come through we should be on a lot of these deals because of our credentials and because of our know how, he said in an interview. Algaseer said there were also a lot more openings from privatizations in the country, estimating that there would be $300 billion in such opportunities by 2022. Saudi Arabia already has plans to list up to 5 percent of oil company Saudi Aramco that could raise as much as $100 billion via a listing in Riyadh and one or more international markets. Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe this month asked Saudi Arabia's King Salman to support a listing of Aramco's shares in Tokyo. Other markets, including New York, London, Hong Kong, Singapore and Toronto, are also vying for a role. I won't say it's [a Tokyo listing] a high possibility but it's not impossible, Algaseer said. He also said that the large size of the sale meant it would be hard for only two centers to manage it. If they do go to Japan they will definitely consider to have MUFG to launch it and if they go somewhere else there's a good possibility to let MUFG and its partner Morgan Stanley (MS.N) to launch it. Morgan Stanley and MUFG have several partnerships, stemming from a $9 billion investment MUFG provided the Wall Street bank at the height of the financial crisis. MUFG now owns 23.2 percent of Morgan Stanley, making it the bank's largest shareholder, according to Thomson Reuters data. MUFG's banking subsidiary, The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, expects to open its first branch in Saudi Arabia in 2018 after becoming the first Japanese bank to receive a license in the kingdom late last year, he said.

While the men's washroom just outside the debating chamber is clearly marked with the silhouette of a man, there are so far no signs for the women's. On the opening session of the new parliament on May 26, two of the newly elected female members had to ask for directions to the rest-room. Wherever I go I see a woman in front of me. Things have changed. We're used to only seeing men, said one local journalist as he watched the opening session of parliament. The 146 women elected to parliament last month is up from just 31 before. Women now make up 31.6 percent of the chamber, the highest share of any Arab legislature and higher than many in the West. The sudden leap is the result of a quota mandated by President Abdelaziz Bouteflika that many skeptics - including foreign election monitors - thought would not be enforced. Now Algeria, a Muslim energy exporter of 37 million people, is basking in its new status as a trailblazer for woman's rights. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton have both praised the large female contingent. But campaigners for equality say the big question remains unanswered: how will the new women lawmakers - most of them political novices - put their positions to good use? Under Algeria's constitution, the president has the most power, leaving only limited prerogatives to parliament. Lawmakers' functions usually extend little beyond rubber-stamping initiatives handed down from the executive branch. Women's groups said the result was a positive, if limited, development, however. This is a victory, said Nadia Ait Zai, head of CIDDEF, a non-governmental organization that campaigns for women's and children's rights. But, she asked, What can these 140 women do? Prominent Women Algeria's nearest Arab rival for the number of women MPs is now Tunisia, where women account for 26.7 percent of the seats in parliament, according to figures compiled by the Inter-Parliamentary Union. Algeria comes out ahead of several Western states, including Switzerland, Canada, France, Britain and the United States. As women, we will play a role, Samira Kerkouche, a new member of parliament from Algiers told Reuters in the national assembly building, across the road from the capital's Mediterranean port. We seek change. Bouteflika may have been thinking about his legacy when he created the quota. He is 75 and frail, and few people expect him to run for a fourth time when his term runs out in 2014. Increasing the number of women in parliament suits the secularist ruling establishment of which Bouteflika is a part. In the 1990s they fought and defeated Islamist hardliners who, among other things, wanted to confine women to the home. Women in Algeria have traditionally played a more active role in public life than in most other Arab states. Women feature among the heroes of Algeria's war of independence from France in the 1960s. Female underground fighters would change into western-style dress, slip unnoticed into bars and restaurants frequented by the French, and leave behind bombs timed to explode minutes later. Today, the police force prides itself on its female officers. At their graduation ceremony, women cadets show off their skills in hand-to-hand combat and dismantling automatic weapons. Algeria's National Assembly delegates listen to the national anthem during the opening session of the new National Assembly in Algiers May 26, 2012. Algeria has the largest proportion of women lawmakers in the Arab world. The 146 women elected to parliament last month is up from just 31 before. Women now make up 31.6 percent of the chamber, the highest share of any Arab legislature and higher than many in the West.Louafi LarbiThe government has one female minister and two women deputy ministers. Algeria is one of only two Arab members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to include women in their delegations. Nevertheless, the large number of women in parliament came as a surprise. Most people had assumed that the male-dominated parties would find ways to get around Bouteflika's quota. Almost unnoticed a few days before the vote, however, the interior ministry came up with a mathematical formula for allocating seats that guaranteed women would make up about a third of the new legislature. Discrimination In many ways, the parliament that Algeria now has is way ahead of the society it is supposed to represent, however. Away from the reaches of the secularist state, Algeria is a deeply conservative society. Delegates talk during the opening session of the new National Assembly in Algiers May 26, 2012.

Women now make up 31.6 percent of the chamber, the highest share of any Arab legislature and higher than many in the West. Picture taken May 26, 2012.Louafi LarbiViolence against women is widespread and laws guaranteeing equality are often flouted. One piece of legislation, the 1984 Family Code, gives women fewer rights than men in questions of divorce, inheritance and custody over children. The Islamist hardliners who challenged the authorities in the 1990s took up arms after the military annulled an election they were poised to win. In the fighting which followed, 200,000 people were killed, according to some estimates. They have now been largely defeated, but their sentiments about the role of women are still widespread. Islam is positive about not allowing women to practice politics, said Sheikh Abdelfateh Zeraoui, a prominent cleric and proponent of Salafism, an ultra-purist branch of Islam which is widely followed in Algeria. We have a hadith (saying of the Prophet) which says 'Allah will be angry when a group of men accepts being led by women'. Campaigners for women's equality hope the new female members of parliament will take up the fight against this kind of discrimination. Djaouida Safarbati, a lawyer from Medea in the mountains south-west of the capital, was elected as a member of parliament with the National Liberation Front, traditionally Algeria's ruling party. Our top priority is to take back our rights. Women's concerns are countless, she told Reuters. However, other new female members of parliament face a steep learning curve. In many cases thrust into the election by parties trying to meet the quota, not all have a background in politics or even in public life. One new MP is well-known as a television announcer and sister of Rabah Madjer, one of Algeria's most celebrated soccer players, but displayed no apparent political ambitions before the election. Another new lawmaker is the former wife of Sheikh Yousef al-Qaradawi, an Egyptian preacher who has become a celebrity for his appearances on Al Jazeera, the pan-Arabic television station. His ex-wife had not been involved in politics before. Ait Zai, the women's rights activist, was confident that with the right support, these new members of parliament could bring about a change. Many of them are in politics for the first time ... so we as women, if we want something from them, we have to go towards them, she said in her office, decorated with posters condemning domestic violence. We cannot expect them to come to us so we will have programmes to train these members of parliament and educate them about the rights of women.

The rules, launched last month, make Pakistan the second country after Indonesia to officially allow takaful windows, which enable firms to offer sharia-compliant and conventional products side by side, provided client money is segregated. Takaful has operated without conventional competitors in Pakistan since the first rules were introduced in 2005, but those rules said windows could be allowed after a five-year period. Conventional insurance firms could serve a broader share of the takaful market with their larger sales force and vast branch network, the securities commission said in a statement last month. Takaful is seen as a bellwether of consumer appetite for Islamic finance products. It is based on the concept of mutuality; the takaful company oversees a pool of funds contributed by all policy holders, but does not necessarily bear risk itself. In their investments, takaful firms must follow religious guidelines, including bans on interest and pure monetary speculation. Global takaful contributions are forecast to reach $12 billion this year, according to consultants Ernst & Young. Although Pakistan is the world's second most populous Muslim nation, takaful's share of the total insurance market there is only 2 to 3 percent, said Omar Mustafa Ansari, Karachi-based partner at Ernst & Young Ford Rhodes Sidat Hyder. In contrast, the average takaful share in Muslim countries stood at 5 percent in 2010 and is expected to reach 7 percent by 2015, according to a report last September by Swiss Re. The overall share of takaful in Pakistan could reach 25 to 30 percent for general coverage and 15 to 20 percent in family/life coverage within five to seven years, Ansari said, with much of that growth being captured by windows. Takaful companies did not have the capacity to serve the Islamic banks, let alone the overall corporate and personal needs for insurance, Ansari said, noting that no new takaful firms had entered the market in the last four years. While I am considered to be a purist (or at times critic of the weaknesses in the present system), I feel that for the purpose of growth of the industry, it is necessary to allow windows. Ansari added that his comments were his personal views and not made on behalf of any company or institution. Volumes Conventional players appear keen to enter the market to increase their business volumes. At least four to five companies have prepared working papers, Ansari said. Incumbents face fierce competition on pricing and service quality. They will have to increase their capital bases and might need to look for mergers and acquisitions, he added. New entrants into the takaful market could also increase  overall insurance coverage in the country by reaching out to untapped market segments. Pakistan's insurance penetration, measured as total premiums to gross domestic product, was the third-lowest in Asia last year at 0.7 percent, against 4.1 percent for India, another report by Swiss Re showed. Opportunity lies in Pakistan's rural belts where there are high growth prospects, said Muhammad Ashfaq Ur Rehman, a Dubai-based management consultant. It depends how conventional insurers having windows devise their marketing strategy. But Pakistan's five takaful operators last week filed a petition in a court in Sindh province, the country's second-largest Islamic banking market, to challenge the new rules. Criticism is against the window concept (seen as diluting the sharia), wrote Tarik Rashid, Karachi-based insurance consultant and associate fellow of the Institute of Islamic Banking & Insurance, a British-based body which offers education in Islamic finance. However, the new rules include requirements for external auditors and internal compliance officers, and the regulator said further requirements might be included. If authorities decide to introduce a minimum capital requirement for takaful windows, that could create a level playing field for pure takaful and conventional insurance companies, Ansari said. The takaful industry's lobby may not be powerful enough to persuade the authorities to cancel the reforms entirely. I do not think there is a real forceful takaful representation that could make the regulator reverse its decision, Rehman said. Any reversal might be hard to justify because Pakistan's conventional banks operate Islamic windows under the same methodology, a source at one of the takaful firms said. The petition may delay the opening of takaful windows or prompt the regulator to make some amendments to the rules, but the decision to open windows is guaranteed to go ahead, the source acknowledged.

Knopf.  The book, as yet untitled, is about the search for justice, not just in criminal cases but in life and society in general, Knopf said in a statement on Thursday. Publication is expected in January 2019. Bharara said his book would be about the law, integrity, leadership, decision making, and moral reasoning. It addresses what it means to do the right thing, how to avoid doing the wrong thing, and the role of thoughtfulness in making the best choice, Bharara said in a statement. In 2009, President Barack Obama appointed Bharara to serve as U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, which includes Manhattan.  During seven and a half years as the chief federal prosecutor in that region, Bharara oversaw several notable corruption and white-collar criminal cases, as well as prosecutions of terrorism suspects. Preet Bharara's life experience, coupled with his standing as a U.S. Attorney and the cases he tried as prosecutor, makes him uniquely qualified to write this book, said Sonny Mehta, editor-in-chief for Knopf, which is a division of Penguin Random House. Bharara, now a distinguished scholar in residence at New York University's law school, was unexpectedly fired by Trump on March 11 after refusing to step down. He had been among 46 U.S. attorneys who were told a day earlier to submit their resignations. In November, Bharara met with Trump at Trump Tower in New York City, three weeks after the presidential election, and said at the time that they had a good meeting and he agreed to remain in his post as a federal prosecutor. He was fired a few months later. This month, Bharara told ABC News in an interview that he received unusual phone calls from Trump after the election that made him uncomfortable. He said he was fired after declining to take the third call.  Bharara said he believed Trump's calls to him violated the usual boundaries between the executive branch and independent criminal investigators. Knopf spokesman Paul Bogaards said on Thursday that Bharara addresses the circumstances of his firing in the book proposal. Whether the book itself goes into the details of Bharara's firing remains an open question, Bogaards said.

Five states received a B grade for accountability and transparency and eight got an F in the investigation by the nonprofit groups Center for Public Integrity, Global Integrity and Public Radio International. No state got an A. The 18-month project is the most comprehensive study of state laws and practices that bolster openness and deter corruption, the investigators said. The five states receiving B grades were New Jersey, Connecticut, Washington, California and Nebraska. The eight failing states were North Dakota, Michigan, South Carolina, Maine, Virginia, Wyoming, South Dakota and Georgia at the bottom. Nineteen states got a C and 18 received a D. For New Jersey, whose popular image is fused with TV's mob drama The Sopranos, being among the leaders is counter-intuitive but a tribute to its corruption-fighting reforms, said Nathaniel Heller, managing director of Global Integrity. But, he added, To be at the top of this list is sort of to win a beauty contest where not anybody is particularly pretty to start with. The study comes as struggling newspapers have slashed statehouse coverage or folded, weakening its traditional watchdog role of government, said Caitlin Ginley of the Center for Public Integrity, the project manager. Almost every state had large gaps between laws on the books and their enforcement, she said. The index grade measured the risk of corruption based on 330 indicators across 14 categories of government. States with well-known scandals paradoxically often have tough laws and enforcement that then bring them to light, a statement accompanying the study said. 'Quiet' states may be at higher risk, with few means to (bring to the) surface corrupt practices, it said. New Jersey Tops List As a prime example of how scandals can lead to reform, New Jersey got a B+ despite a reputation for corruption that saw Governor Chris Christie bust more than 100 public officials while a U.S. attorney, earning him a reputation as a tough-talking conservative. Reforms by lawmakers and good-government groups mean New Jersey now has some of the toughest ethics and anti-corruption laws in the nation, investigators said. New Jersey ranks first in the integrity investigation for ethics enforcement, first for executive branch accountability and fourth for procurement practices. New York finished 36th with a D grade despite Governor Andrew Cuomo's steering ethics reform through the legislature. When the capital (Albany) is mentioned anywhere in New York state, there's usually a guffawing rejoinder followed by 'rats,' 'bums' or 'thieves,' the report said. Illinois, where former Governor Rod Blagojevich started a 14-year prison term for corruption on Thursday, got a C in a four-way tie for 10th with Rhode Island, Massachusetts and Hawaii. Georgia: Sports Tickets, No Fines In Georgia, at the bottom of the list, there is a gaping divide between legal standards for accountability and normal practice, the report said. Some 658 state workers accepted sports tickets, expensive meals and other gifts over a two-year period. It has been 12 years since the state last fined a vendor for failing to disclose such gifts, it said. As a group, executives of Georgia insurance companies, public utilities and other regulated sectors have become the biggest single source of campaign money for regulators. Methodology for the study was designed by Global Integrity, a Washington group that examines corruption worldwide. The Center for Public Integrity oversaw the reporting and editing.

Stylish clothes being unveiled for spring 2014 are highlighting the pronounced simplicity of black and white. The colors are either elegant monochromes or mixed up in playful zebra prints, classic checks and mod color blocking. Victoria Beckham's show on Sunday was the latest in a string of collections at New York Fashion Week adhering almost entirely to a black and white palette. Her looks were sporty, with short pleated skirts, the season's omnipresent cropped tops and flouncy hemlines over knee-length shorts. Describing her collection, the celebrity designer said she set boyish elements against a sense of femininity. Some of Beckham's pieces were all-black or all-white, and she would use unusual structure or overlaid textures to bring them to life. Mixing the two colors, a short black dress revealed a pleated white skirt, peeking out from under an angled hemline, and a spaghetti-strapped black top was trimmed with white pleats at the midriff. All the black and white was accented with just a brief splash of hot pink and a subdued rust. At Yigal Azrouel, the collection was entirely black, white, cream and gray. Some were solids, some mixed. Among the stand-out looks was a set of dresses, jumpsuit, jacket and culottes in white silk with a black tree-branch pattern. Opening with all-cream looks, the show closed with a series of gray suits and dresses conservatively cut, but in an unlined, and revealing, open-weave fabric. Minimalism reigns in a decisive pattern of black, white, and shades of gray, the New York-based designer said in a statement accompanying the show. Androgynous tailoring and architectural lines are juxtaposed with arched necklines and seductive cut-outs. Another showcase for sporty minimalism, the Y-3 Adidas collection by Yohji Yamamoto featured a stream of black and white, from t-shirts and dresses to kneesocks, shoes and backpacks. Various Y-3 hoodies, sweats and trench coats were accented with dabs of rainbow, electric blue and canary yellow. Porsche Design, too, barely strayed from blacks and whites in its show of sophisticated sportswear. Only a touch of gray and a rich blue briefly altered the Porsche color landscape. Spain's Delpozo, one of the more highly anticipated shows of the week-long extravaganza, used black and white in a striped, boxy top over a full-bodied black skirt, in a casual checkered top and in florals. Delpozo also mixed black with sand and with ecru, similar pairings of colorless hues. Accents were a delicate lavender, angelic florals and a bold black-and-yellow sunflower print. Designer Sofia Sizzi drew from her native Florence, Italy for her Giulietta collection - also heavy on black and white. Ahead of the show, she said she was influenced by the stark blacks and whites of the city's churches and piazzas. It's the idea of a walk through a city, she said. You have all these elements from the buildings and the shadows of the buildings. Sizzi accented her classic black and white with blue florals and spiced up the collection with a pair of bright red dresses. The black and white trend was bolder at Alexandre Herchcovitch, whose use ranged from polite pinstripes to brazen zebra prints. The Brazilian designer, popular with Lady Gaga, punched up his black and white with purple. Even designers who use vibrant color as their trademarks trotted out black and white. Tracy Reese, one of first lady Michelle Obama's favorite designers, cited Afro-Cuban influences in her colorful geometric prints, raffia embroidery and flared dresses in her show on Sunday. But she accented her collection with a black-and-white zigzag lace maxi slip, an embellished trapeze dress and a laser-cut neoprene jacket over a black gingham shell. New York Fashion Week ends on Thursday, followed by fashion weeks in London, Paris and Milan.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/wells-fargo-accounts-prudential-idUSL5N1E50I6","Prudential investigating Wells Fargo partnership after scandal","","December 10, 2016 /  3:44 PM / in 8 months","","NEW YORK, Dec 10 (Reuters) - U.S. insurer Prudential Financial is investigating whether Wells Fargo  employees signed up customers for its life insurance policies without their knowledge, a spokesman said on Saturday. Sales practices at Wells Fargo have been under a spotlight since September when federal regulators ordered the San Francisco-based bank to pay $190 million in fines and restitution because they said its high pressure sales environment pushed employees to open as many as 2 million deposit and credit card accounts without customers' permission. Prudential has a partnership with Wells Fargo to sell a low-cost life insurance policy, known as MyTerm, to the bank's retail customers. Since bankers are not licensed to sell insurance, Wells Fargo employees were meant to direct customers to either self-service kiosks in branches or online to buy the insurance, without getting into specifics about the products. According to a wrongful termination suit filed in New Jersey state court this week by three former managers in Prudential's corporate investigation division, Wells Fargo employees appear to have signed up bank customers for the Prudential policies without the customers' knowledge or permission. In some cases, policies were opened and closed after a month or two and then reopened, and sometimes monthly fees were withdrawn from the accounts, according to evidence in the lawsuit. Scot Hoffman, a spokesman for Prudential Financial, said the insurer had been monitoring its business with Wells Fargo since last year. A customer survey had shown high lapse rates. The insurer expanded the review of how the product was sold after Wells Fargo was fined in September. We anticipate reviewing this matter with our regulators in due course, Hoffman said in a statement. The three managers say they were fired in November for trying to escalate their discoveries internally within Prudential. Hoffman said they were fired for, appropriate and legitimate reasons that were entirely unrelated to Prudential's business with Wells Fargo and Prudential's decision to examine sales of the MyTerm product. No one from Wells Fargo was immediately available to comment. The lawsuit and the Prudential investigation were first reported by The New York Times.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/russia-mariinsky-idUSL6N0DH25I20130501","Russia's new Mariinsky theatre divides St Petersburg","","May 1, 2013 /  6:01 AM / 4 years ago","","* Putin to attend opening of $700-million theatre * Mariinsky is headed by leading world conductor * Russia aims to make it a major cultural landmark By Liza Dobkina ST PETERSBURG, Russia, May 1 (Reuters) - It has been variously described as a sleek piece of modernism or an ugly shopping centre, but whatever Russians think of the exterior of St Petersburg's new Mariinsky Theatre, they will finally get to see inside the much-debated building at its grand opening on Thursday. President Vladimir Putin will lead a select crowd of guests to the first performance at Mariinsky II, a 2,000-seat theatre, which, at a cost of $700 million, ranks among the most expensive cultural projects ever built. The new building stands near the 19th century Mariinsky Theatre, one of the great showcases of Russian culture and which became home to the opera and ballet companies renowned around the world under their Soviet-era name of Kirov. But the new theatre has divided opinion in Putin's home town, where critics have dubbed the glass-and-limestone building the Mariinsky mall, incongruous among the other elegant 19th-century buildings in the Imperial capital and the ugly sister of its ornately gilded predecessor. Valery Gergiev, head of the project and regarded by many as the greatest living orchestral conductor, has promoted the plan to build a new Mariinsky for 10 years, capitalising on Putin's desire to show that Russia no longer lags behind the West. He has promised that doubters will eat their words when they see the interior of the 80,000-square-feet (7,400-square-metre) structure. The inauguration of Mariinsky II will reaffirm and strengthen the great tradition of the theatre, opening the way for the future when it will be possible to create cutting-edge works of art and innovative performances, which previously we could not even dream of, said Gergiev. I feel certain that 25 years from now, Mariinsky II will be seen as a St Petersburg landmark in its own right, recognised for its superb acoustics, dazzling production facilities and unsurpassed level of audience comfort. Gergiev will conduct at the opening, which will be broadcast live on television. Spanish tenor Placido Domingo, Russian opera singer Olga Borodina, and violinist and viola player Yuri Bashmet are among the performers at the lavish gala performance. Cultural Heart The new theatre is one of several grand projects intended to show what Russia can achieve, most notably the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics, Putin's pet idea. With the latest technology -- although it has a chandelier in the VIP box to make prominent guests feel at home -- the Mariinsky II is a world away from the original Mariinsky Theatre, which was sumptuously decorated in gold and red. Built in 1860, the pastel green Mariinsky was the focus of cultural life in St Petersburg for decades. Tchaikovsky's Nutcracker was premiered there in 1892. Eighteen years earlier, Mussorgsky first showed his opera Boris Godunov to a packed house. But Gergiev, who turns 60 on the day of the concert, decided  the old Mariinsky theatre was no longer adequate for his plans. As the head of the ballet and opera companies that were called the Kirov Opera and Kirov Ballet in Soviet times before reverting to the Mariinsky name in 1992, Gergiev runs a huge cultural empire which needed a modern home. The project has not been without difficulties. Costs soared when one design was killed after work had already started, and at least three firms have been involved in the construction. Gergiev denied last year there was serious discontent in the ballet troupe over pay and conditions after dancers wrote a letter of complaint. But the Mariinsky has largely avoided the scandals that Moscow's Bolshoi Theatre has suffered in recent years. Not only was Sergei Filin, the artistic director of the Bolshoi Ballet, almost blinded in an acid attack in January but the Bolshoi's programme has at times faced criticism since the theatre reopened in 2011 after a six-year renovation. Ballerina Viktoria Krasnokutskaya was one of several  performers who said the new technical equipment at the Mariinsky made a huge difference, allowing scenes to be changed easily and quickly. Inside the theatre, the seating area is very beautiful ... It is very light and spacious, she said. Designed by Toronto-based Diamond Schmitt Architects, the interior of the building glows in light reflected from wall panels made of Italian onyx that stretch several storeys high. Glass and metal walkways slice through the building, which looks over a canal at the old Mariinsky through large windows. The two theatres are connected by a bridge and performances will be staged at both venues. Disgusting The two buildings could hardly be more different. The new one stands out against the late 19th-century edifices that surround it in a city landscape immortalised in the works of   Gogol and Dostoyevsky. (Before it was built) there were fears that this would look like an apartment block or a shopping mall. People do not understand what this building is, said city resident Irene Vargo. Builders demolished an entire block for the new theatre, razing the constructivist building of the Palace of Culture of the First Five Year Plan and the remnants of a Lithuanian market and school, built in 1930. Alexander Margolis, head of the St Petersburg branch of the Russian Society for the Protection of Monuments of History and Culture, said they had destroyed the World Heritage Site that lies at the heart of the city. I think it's not just an urban planning mistake, in my opinion this is an urban crime because there was an intrusion into one of the most unique corners of St Petersburg's historical centre, he said. Alexei Kovalev, a deputy in St Petersburg's legislative assembly, said the building was disgusting. My opinion is that it should be torn down, he said. I don't care what is inside it. Gergiev should be fired.       (Reporting by Liza Dobkina; Writing by Elizabeth Piper; Editing by Timothy Heritage and Giles Elgood)"
"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-corruption-petrobras-idUSKBN1801IB","More work needed to free Petrobras of corruption: Brazil prosecutor","","May 4, 2017 /  12:34 PM / 3 months ago","","RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - A top Brazilian prosecutor said Thursday there was still much work to be done to rid state-run oil company Petrobras of corruption, despite more than three years of investigations into a political kickback scheme involving contractors.  Prosecutor Carlos Lima made the statement at a news conference detailing the arrests of three former Petrobras executives who allegedly took 100 million reais ($32 million) in bribes. Some of the money held offshore was then brought into Brazil through a government amnesty program for foreign assets.   Nothing guarantees that today we have a company that is truly cleaned of the corruption of its past, Lima said in reference to Petrobras, also known as Petroleo Brasileiro SA. Petrobras Chief Executive Pedro Parente, who took over a year ago, has said the firm is working hard to shake out corruption and that it must quickly remove any doubts in order to help the revival of the company, the most indebted in the industry.    Lima and other investigators also sharply criticized the amnesty program as an easy way for those involved in the Petrobras scheme to launder bribes held in overseas bank accounts.  Their comments ratcheted up tension between anti-corruption crusaders in Brazil's judiciary and the executive and legislative branches, who have held the program up as a success. Investigators alleged that of the executives arrested, none of whom were named, one had brought some 48 million reais of bribe money that had been in offshore accounts back into Brazil under false pretenses, taking advantage of the amnesty program last year. This is a very serious fact, as it shows that the law ... institutionalized the money laundering of assets held abroad, said prosecutor Diogo Castor in a statement. The criticism of a law passed last year with the support of President Michel Temer underscored how prosecutors have increasingly come into open confrontation with the political establishment. Temer hailed the amnesty program for raising around 50 billion reais in taxes and fines to help the government meet its budget target and called on Congress to start another program swiftly. In March, the Senate sent a bill to his desk opening the repatriation window for another 120 days. Last month, the Petrobras probe sent shockwaves through the capital when the Supreme Court authorized investigations into eight cabinet ministers and dozens of senior lawmakers. Prosecutors reiterated on Thursday that they had presented Congress with 10 measures that should be passed into law to battle corruption.

We have oil, we have money, Libya can easily be just like Dubai, the 47 year old, who works in manufacturing, said. We just need foreign investors and hopefully they will now start coming and business will boom. Nine months after the end of Libya's uprising, Mohammed hopes Saturday's election of a national assembly will mark a new start for an economy that stagnated under Muammar Gaddafi's 42-year autocratic rule. Investors will be closely watching the outcome of the vote - with no indication of a leading contender - to see what it will mean for projects that were frozen during the fighting and for the vast opportunities likely to emerge in an oil-producing nation with the wealth to pay for construction and healthcare. Libya's new rulers have said no major new concessions would be awarded until after the polls and are reviewing past deals. Once elected, the new 200-member assembly will appoint a government to replace an interim administration that lacked the mandate to make major decisions, and expectations are for old projects to restart and for new contracts to be signed. There are a lot of projects (on standby), everyone wants to settle their projects from before, said Klaus Fodinger, head of the cement division at Austria's Asamer Holding, which resumed operations in Libya in October. If there are no institutions, no one to talk to, how do you settle deals from the past? The elections are a crucial event. Many international businesses came to Libya in recent years, attracted by its huge energy reserves and a population, which although numbering just 6 million, has median incomes much higher than elsewhere in the region. But the eight-month NATO-backed uprising sent foreigners fleeing. While oil companies were the first to return and have helped Libya climb back close to pre-war output levels of 1.6 million barrels per day, others have not been as fast. Government trade delegations from around the world have visited, vying for future contracts. As commercial flights have resumed, businessmen have also jetted in for short stretches. Most companies which had a foot in Libya before have mainly wanted to get their ventures back up and running as they await a clearer political and legal landscape. Tarek Alwan, managing director of London-based consulting firm SOC Libya, said he had been approached by numerous companies seeking guidance on how to enter the Libyan market. Major ones are seriously interested but they have not committed yet because the situation is not fully stable, economically and politically, he said. They have been waiting for the elections so this will give them some sort of assurances that there will be proper elected (authority) to represent the country. Waiting for the Green Light Major construction, such as residential property and hotels, as well as transport projects are untouched since last year, awaiting the green light from the authorities to restart. Despite the fact that most major public-sector projects are on hold, there is nonetheless a great deal of planning going on across many ministries and government agencies, and this is a positive sign, said Alex Warren, of research and advisory firm Frontier, which runs The Libya Report business site. It suggests that once an elected government is in place, then many projects look set to start or be resumed. The question is how quickly they will resume. The fasting month of Ramadan, when daily life usually slows, begins shortly after the elections. A man walks past a shopping centre under construction in Tripoli July 2, 2012.

Picture taken July 2.Ismail ZitounyThe assembly is expected to be named at least two weeks from July 7 after ballot counting is finalised and an appeals process. Within 30 days of its first meeting, it will appoint a new prime minister who will form a government. For major projects and contracts, I don't see it really picking up, in terms of new tenders or companies returning, until the last quarter at the earliest, Warren said. The election is expected to lead to reforms and investors want to know what those policies will be. In May, the economy ministry issued a decree enabling foreign companies to set up joint ventures, branches and representative offices in most sectors, more easily. Businesses are looking with great hopes towards the elections, David Bachmann, head of the commercial section at the Austrian embassy in Tripoli, said. However, they are aware that probabilities are high that even after the elections it might take some months - hopefully not years - before decisions are taken. While public sector entities await, the private sector is flourishing, especially trade. Tripoli's port is heaving with activity and foreign produce is stocked on supermarket shelves. A cash crisis has eased and shops and cafes have re-opened. Monoprix Tunisia, an affiliate of the French supermarket chain, wants to start opening 10 stores in Libya from late 2012, after uprisings in both countries delayed earlier plans.

We see a huge potential - there are the needs of young population and a lot of infrastructure to be reconstructed. We expect a boom in construction activity, Fodinger said. Gaddafi isolated Libya's economy from much foreign competition, reserving licences and contracts for his own circle, so the prospect of a more open market is attractive to new entrants. Dependent on oil, Libya needs basic infrastructure development as well as investment in property, consumer industries and telecoms after a fifth of transmitter stations were destroyed in the war. It will also need foreign investment and expertise to increase oil and gas production. Its tourism industry is largely unexplored, despite stretches of beaches and well-preserved Roman ruins. Various fairs drawing international businesses have allowed companies to cultivate relations. Industry Minister Mahmoud Al-Ftise said there were plans to increase privatizations, and Libya was interested in more foreign investment. We would like to have a participation from foreign and local private business so we can see results because we would like to have competition among the business, he told Reuters. However security remains a concern. Bouts of violence are deterring foreign firms from bringing back all their expatriates on the ground for now. For those who were once used to living in villas or flats in Tripoli, they now find themselves confined in secure compounds without their families. Many businessmen travel with security advisers. Libya's interim government has struggled to impose its authority on a country awash with weapons. Attacks on diplomatic and aid missions in the east have highlighted the ongoing volatility. Last month, Tripoli's international airport was seized by an armed group for several hours.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/food-chefs-blumenthal-idUSL4N0MS0YG20140408","World Chefs: Blumenthal shuns New York for Melbourne","","April 8, 2014 /  7:56 PM / in 3 years","","MELBOURNE, April 8 (Reuters) - British chef Heston Blumenthal, famed for his bacon and egg ice cream, credits fans, friends and the food explosion in Australia for his decision to move The Fat Duck to Melbourne for six months while the Michelin-starred restaurant is being renovated. From February 2015, the Fat Duck menu, staff and high-tech equipment will be all set to recreate Blumenthal's 3-1/2-hour dining experience in Australia, featuring the likes of grain mustard ice cream, snail porridge and his Alice in Wonderland-inspired mock turtle soup. The entertainment goes beyond smell, taste, touch and sight, as his Sound of the Sea dish transports diners to the beach with an iPod Shuffle tucked in a conch shell playing the sounds of splashing waves and seagulls. The Fat Duck's move is Blumenthal's first opening outside Britain, where the 47-year-old has Dinner by Heston at the Mandarin Oriental in London and two pubs in the village of Bray. The restaurant at Melbourne's Crown casino will turn into Dinner by Heston Blumenthal when The Fat Duck returns home after renovations to the 375-year-old building near Windsor, England are done. Blumenthal spoke to Reuters about Australia's appeal, the disincentives to running a restaurant in New York and toying with the senses of his diners. Q: Why have you chosen Australia to open your first restaurant outside the UK? A: I've actually got some really good friends over here. The TV shows (Heston's Feasts and How to Cook Like Heston) have done really well over here from the UK. I've signed up for this relationship with Brevilles (appliances). I've just started a relationship with Coles (supermarkets). For me, it was looking at the location and the market. If I was coming over just to do a restaurant, it would be one thing. But I'm over here anyway for the other things as well. We have massive Australian interest in the Duck. So many Australians come to the Duck in the UK. What I love about the approach is Australia is much more open-minded through the food explosion that's happened over here. I'd put Melbourne and Sydney in the top half dozen cities in the world to eat in, in terms of that kind of diversity of cuisine, quality, just the general food culture. Melbourne is incredibly multicultural and there's just an excitement and interest to try new things. Q: Do you feel like you're being a traitor to the Mandarin? A: No, because The Mandarin (hotels) aren't in Australia and I know for the moment they have absolutely no plans to be in Australia. We had a really serious look at New York. They (The Mandarin) wanted to do it. We wanted to do it. But the biggest problem there is the unions. I've got really good friends at top restaurants in New York who said to me, If you get under the control of the unions, it's just never going to work. Don't touch it with a barge pole. (Alain) Ducasse and (Joel) Robuchon both left New York because of that. The costs are completely prohibitive. You can go into the kitchen and the kitchen porter who's washing dishes has pots and pans stacked up to here and says the person whose job spec is to put the pots and pans away doesn't arrive for another 10 minutes. Literally, if someone drops something on the floor and you say Can you pick that up?, they say That's not my job. Q: Are you going to be looking at Australian ingredients for The Fat Duck menu in Melbourne? A: We'll be using all Australian ingredients. Instead of using langoustines, we might use yabbies (crayfish). We actually bought more Australian truffles this year than we did from France. They're really good. Q: Are there any unusual Australian ingredients you'll be looking at? A: I've never eaten witchety grubs (larvae of moths) and I really want to. Some of the stuff like lemon myrtle (a native plant) that we don't really see. Saltbush, like a spruce rosemary branch. But this is to bring most of the Fat Duck classics over here and to make sure that they're exactly the same quality that we serve in Bray. That's why we're picking up everything. We're picking the whole team up, all of the kit, the centrifuges, the rocket machine and the rotary evaporator. Q: What does the rotary evaporator do? A: It's a flavour enhancer. The rotary evaporator can extract flavour from things at low temperature. For example, if you put chocolate in it, the chocolate and the water boils at 25 degrees (Celsius) (77 degrees Fahrenheit) and then you collect the vapor, so you end up with chocolate water. Q: Where do you get the inspiration for a creation like Sound of the Sea and what's the process you follow from idea to table? A: The process can take a long time. In 1997, I put a dish on the menu which was crab ice cream with crab risotto. I just found it fascinating that if you said Taste this, it's crab ice cream, some people would go 'Wow, love it!' and some would go 'Yuck, how can you have crab ice cream? It's an oxymoron.' I started to realize that even the name of a dish can change your perception of that dish. From there I started to realize how complex flavor sensation is. It's the most complicated thing the human body does. There are more chromosomes involved in that than anything else, including reproduction. I then found myself at this amazing junction between the senses, being a chef, because eating is the only thing we do on a regular basis that involves all the senses. The effect of sight, sound, touch, taste and smell on flavor perception is quite incredible. That's when I started experimenting with psychologists, parfumiers, magicians, musicians, that sort of thing. When you start asking questions, a door opens, like falling down a rabbit hole into a wonderland, which is amazing.

But the new theater has divided opinion in Putin's home town, where critics have dubbed the glass-and-limestone building the Mariinsky mall, incongruous among the other elegant 19th-century buildings in the Imperial capital and the ugly sister of its ornately gilded predecessor. Valery Gergiev, head of the project and regarded by many as the greatest living orchestral conductor, has promoted the plan to build a new Mariinsky for 10 years, capitalizing on Putin's desire to show that Russia no longer lags behind the West. He has promised that doubters will eat their words when they see the interior of the 80,000-square-feet (7,400-square-meter) structure. The inauguration of Mariinsky II will reaffirm and strengthen the great tradition of the theatre, opening the way for the future when it will be possible to create cutting-edge works of art and innovative performances, which previously we could not even dream of, said Gergiev. I feel certain that 25 years from now, Mariinsky II will be seen as a St Petersburg landmark in its own right, recognized for its superb acoustics, dazzling production facilities and unsurpassed level of audience comfort. Gergiev will conduct at the opening, which will be broadcast live on television. Spanish tenor Placido Domingo, Russian opera singer Olga Borodina, and violinist and viola player Yuri Bashmet are among the performers at the lavish gala performance. Cultural Heart The new theater is one of several grand projects intended to show what Russia can achieve, most notably the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics, Putin's pet idea. With the latest technology -- although it has a chandelier in the VIP box to make prominent guests feel at home -- the Mariinsky II is a world away from the original Mariinsky Theatre, which was sumptuously decorated in gold and red. Built in 1860, the pastel green Mariinsky was the focus of cultural life in St Petersburg for decades. Tchaikovsky's Nutcracker was premiered there in 1892. Eighteen years earlier, Mussorgsky first showed his opera Boris Godunov to a packed house. But Gergiev, who turns 60 on the day of the concert, decided the old Mariinsky theater was no longer adequate for his plans. As the head of the ballet and opera companies that were called the Kirov Opera and Kirov Ballet in Soviet times before reverting to the Mariinsky name in 1992, Gergiev runs a huge cultural empire which needed a modern home. The project has not been without difficulties. Costs soared when one design was killed after work had already started, and at least three firms have been involved in the construction. Gergiev denied last year there was serious discontent in the ballet troupe over pay and conditions after dancers wrote a letter of complaint. But the Mariinsky has largely avoided the scandals that Moscow's Bolshoi Theatre has suffered in recent years. Not only was Sergei Filin, the artistic director of the Bolshoi Ballet, almost blinded in an acid attack in January but the Bolshoi's program has at times faced criticism since the theatre reopened in 2011 after a six-year renovation. Ballerina Viktoria Krasnokutskaya was one of several performers who said the new technical equipment at the Mariinsky made a huge difference, allowing scenes to be changed easily and quickly. Inside the theatre, the seating area is very beautiful ... It is very light and spacious, she said. Designed by Toronto-based Diamond Schmitt Architects, the interior of the building glows in light reflected from wall panels made of Italian onyx that stretch several floors high. Glass and metal walkways slice through the building, which looks over a canal at the old Mariinsky through large windows. The two theatres are connected by a bridge and performances will be staged at both venues. Disgusting The two buildings could hardly be more different. The new one stands out against the late 19th-century edifices that surround it in a city landscape immortalized in the works of Gogol and Dostoyevsky. (Before it was built) there were fears that this would look like an apartment block or a shopping mall. People do not understand what this building is, said city resident Irene Vargo. Builders demolished an entire block for the new theatre, razing the constructivist building of the Palace of Culture of the First Five Year Plan and the remnants of a Lithuanian market and school, built in 1930. Alexander Margolis, head of the St Petersburg branch of the Russian Society for the Protection of Monuments of History and Culture, said they had destroyed the World Heritage Site that lies at the heart of the city. I think it's not just an urban planning mistake, in my opinion this is an urban crime because there was an intrusion into one of the most unique corners of St Petersburg's historical center, he said. Alexei Kovalev, a deputy in St Petersburg's legislative assembly, said the building was disgusting. My opinion is that it should be torn down, he said. I don't care what is inside it. Gergiev should be fired. Reporting by Liza Dobkina; Writing by Elizabeth Piper; Editing by Timothy Heritage and Giles Elgood"

A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the new National Intelligence Estimate on Afghanistan concluded that a stepped-up Western military campaign had done real damage to the Taliban's military prowess but not enough so to change their strategic calculus. The classified document takes a dim view of possible futures in Afghanistan, especially with respect to the motivations of the Taliban, the official said. A gloomy outlook for Afghanistan would raise questions about the Obama administration's stepped-up efforts to broker a peace deal between the weak government of Afghan President Hamid Karzai and the Taliban, based in part on the assumption that weakened militants will be more likely to want an agreement. The Office of Director of National Intelligence and the Pentagon declined comment on the existence or content of any new estimate, which brings together viewpoints from 16 different U.S. agencies about the trajectory of the Afghanistan conflict more than 10 years after the Taliban government was toppled. Yet one source familiar with the document's contents and the debate within the U.S. government said the assessment documented disagreement among various intelligences agencies about the prognosis for Afghanistan, including alternative views from those who believe its conclusions were overly pessimistic. Another source said the document was heavily caveated. The U.S. official said certain military leaders had objected to the findings of the assessment, whose contents were first reported in detail on Wednesday by McClatchy Newspapers. The disagreement echoes the past disconnect between the depiction of the conflict offered by the U.S. military and that of the intelligence community, which has tended to take a more pessimistic view. Over 1,800 U.S. troops have been killed in Afghanistan since 2001. The U.S. official said the analysis put forward in the evaluation, shared only with senior officials in Congress and the executive branch, was sometimes dated by the time it was released and might not reflect current security conditions. It can also be time-late, he said. The findings of the estimate are unlikely to alter the overall U.S. course in Afghanistan at this late date, as President Barack Obama withdraws a force that now stands at around 90,000 soldiers and Western nations look past a 2015 deadline for putting Afghan forces in charge of security. The United States is expected to keep some troops in Afghanistan after the end of 2014 to focus on counter-terrorism and watch out for U.S. interests in a volatile region. Conflicting Interpretations The assessment, according to sources familiar with its contents, also raised concerns about the sustainability of the progress that U.S. troops have made against the Taliban. Whether commanders can hold on to security gains with a shrinking force is an open question as militants remain able to resupply and recover across the border in tribal areas of western Pakistan. Along with allies in the Haqqani network, active in eastern Afghanistan, Taliban militants appear to now be focused on high-profile attacks that undermine Afghans' sense of security and undermine efforts to bolster governance and investment. On Thursday, a suicide car bomber killed a district governor, his two young sons and his bodyguards in Afghanistan's southern Kandahar province, one of the areas where commanders believe a 2009-2010 troop surge has borne fruit. We remain committed to the strategy we have been implementing, and we believe we have achieved success based on that strategy, said Captain John Kirby, a Pentagon spokesman. In the hoped-for Afghan peace talks, the administration is launching a fresh round of shuttle diplomacy this weekend as it seeks to push ahead with a set of confidence-building measures.

The peace initiative has taken on increasing importance over the last year as more and more U.S. officials conclude that ongoing bloodshed in Afghanistan cannot be halted through military action alone. The judgment that the Quetta Shura and Mullah Omar remain committed to a military victory and not political reconciliation is probably right, said Bruce Riedel, a former high-ranking official at the CIA and White House.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-food-chefs-blumenthal-idUSBREA371X020140408","World Chefs: Blumenthal shuns New York for Melbourne","","April 8, 2014 /  8:10 PM / 3 years ago","","MELBOURNE (Reuters) - British chef Heston Blumenthal, famed for his bacon and egg ice cream, credits fans, friends and the food explosion in Australia for his decision to move The Fat Duck to Melbourne for six months while the Michelin-starred restaurant is being renovated. From February 2015, the Fat Duck menu, staff and high-tech equipment will be all set to recreate Blumenthal's 3-1/2-hour dining experience in Australia, featuring the likes of grain mustard ice cream, snail porridge and his Alice in Wonderland-inspired mock turtle soup. The entertainment goes beyond smell, taste, touch and sight, as his Sound of the Sea dish transports diners to the beach with an iPod Shuffle tucked in a conch shell playing the sounds of splashing waves and seagulls. The Fat Duck's move is Blumenthal's first opening outside Britain, where the 47-year-old has Dinner by Heston at the Mandarin Oriental in London and two pubs in the village of Bray. The restaurant at Melbourne's Crown casino will turn into Dinner by Heston Blumenthal when The Fat Duck returns home after renovations to the 375-year-old building near Windsor, England are done. Blumenthal spoke to Reuters about Australia's appeal, the disincentives to running a restaurant in New York and toying with the senses of his diners. Q: Why have you chosen Australia to open your first restaurant outside the UK? A: I've actually got some really good friends over here. The TV shows (Heston's Feasts and How to Cook Like Heston) have done really well over here from the UK. I've signed up for this relationship with Brevilles (appliances). I've just started a relationship with Coles (supermarkets). For me, it was looking at the location and the market. If I was coming over just to do a restaurant, it would be one thing. But I'm over here anyway for the other things as well. We have massive Australian interest in the Duck. So many Australians come to the Duck in the UK. What I love about the approach is Australia is much more open-minded through the food explosion that's happened over here. I'd put Melbourne and Sydney in the top half dozen cities in the world to eat in, in terms of that kind of diversity of cuisine, quality, just the general food culture. Melbourne is incredibly multicultural and there's just an excitement and interest to try new things. Q: Do you feel like you're being a traitor to the Mandarin? A: No, because The Mandarin (hotels) aren't in Australia and I know for the moment they have absolutely no plans to be in Australia. We had a really serious look at New York. They (The Mandarin) wanted to do it. We wanted to do it. But the biggest problem there is the unions. I've got really good friends at top restaurants in New York who said to me, If you get under the control of the unions, it's just never going to work. Don't touch it with a barge pole. (Alain) Ducasse and (Joel) Robuchon both left New York because of that. The costs are completely prohibitive. You can go into the kitchen and the kitchen porter who's washing dishes has pots and pans stacked up to here and says the person whose job spec is to put the pots and pans away doesn't arrive for another 10 minutes. Literally, if someone drops something on the floor and you say Can you pick that up?, they say That's not my job. Q: Are you going to be looking at Australian ingredients for The Fat Duck menu in Melbourne? A: We'll be using all Australian ingredients. Instead of using langoustines, we might use yabbies (crayfish). We actually bought more Australian truffles this year than we did from France. They're really good. Q: Are there any unusual Australian ingredients you'll be looking at? A: I've never eaten witchety grubs (larvae of moths) and I really want to. Some of the stuff like lemon myrtle (a native plant) that we don't really see. Saltbush, like a spruce rosemary branch. But this is to bring most of the Fat Duck classics over here and to make sure that they're exactly the same quality that we serve in Bray. That's why we're picking up everything. We're picking the whole team up, all of the kit, the centrifuges, the rocket machine and the rotary evaporator. Q: What does the rotary evaporator do? A: It's a flavor enhancer. The rotary evaporator can extract flavor from things at low temperature. For example, if you put chocolate in it, the chocolate and the water boils at 25 degrees (Celsius) (77 degrees Fahrenheit) and then you collect the vapor, so you end up with chocolate water. Q: Where do you get the inspiration for a creation like Sound of the Sea and what's the process you follow from idea to table? A: The process can take a long time. In 1997, I put a dish on the menu which was crab ice cream with crab risotto. I just found it fascinating that if you said Taste this, it's crab ice cream, some people would go 'Wow, love it!' and some would go 'Yuck, how can you have crab ice cream? It's an oxymoron.' I started to realize that even the name of a dish can change your perception of that dish. From there I started to realize how complex flavor sensation is. It's the most complicated thing the human body does. There are more chromosomes involved in that than anything else, including reproduction. I then found myself at this amazing junction between the senses, being a chef, because eating is the only thing we do on a regular basis that involves all the senses. The effect of sight, sound, touch, taste and smell on flavor perception is quite incredible. That's when I started experimenting with psychologists, parfumiers, magicians, musicians, that sort of thing. When you start asking questions, a door opens, like falling down a rabbit hole into a wonderland, which is amazing.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-wholefoods-m-a-breakingviews-idUSKBN19Z22Q","Amazon monopoly game will take forever to play out","","July 14, 2017 /  6:02 PM / 14 days ago","","NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Amazon.com's real-life game of monopoly will come to feel just as endless as the board-game version. The e-commerce titan's plan to buy upscale grocery chain Whole Foods triggered fresh fears of its dominance. For the time being, consumers and investors probably keep winning.  The plan to push aggressively into food last month rattled more than just supermarket investors. It stirred competition critics, too. Open Markets, a branch of Washington think tank New America, called for the government to block the Whole Foods deal and launch an investigation into how it impedes rivals. One hedge-fund boss said this week he was betting against the stock because of a possible congressional review.  Amazon's growing power is obvious. Various estimates reckon the firm founded by Jeff Bezos already controls at least a third of U.S. online retail purchases. After generating $136 billion in revenue last year, it also grabbed 5.1 percent of total retail sales in the categories it serves, excluding food, in the first quarter, according to MKM analysts, who used Census Bureau data to conclude it is eating the retail world. Less obvious is how Amazon's foregoing of profit over two decades to achieve its rarefied position might be illegal. In particular, current law underappreciates the risk of predatory pricing and how integration across distinct business lines may prove anticompetitive, as one Yale Law Journal assessment surmised in January. Other scholars also suggest a new approach may be needed for the modern marketplace. In addition, while the likes of Wal-Mart Stores may have been too slow to react to Amazon's threat, they also haven't given up fighting with gusto.  An antitrust case may be more plausible from the European Commission, which has led in challenging technology goliaths. The EU focuses on how monopolies harm other business not just consumers, who have yet to feel any pain from Amazon. The company, however, currently wields far more influence at home than abroad. Even an eventual government effort to restrain or break up $475 billion Amazon might not necessarily be value-destructive. For example, its cloud-computing operation, AWS, could be spun out fairly easily. The same probably goes for the gadget-making business behind Kindle and Echo. Either way, Bezos built Amazon for the long game, and is readying to play against trustbusters, too.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/wells-fargo-accounts-prudential-idUSL1N1E50FE","Prudential investigating Wells Fargo partnership after scandal","","December 10, 2016 /  3:57 PM / in 8 months","","NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. insurer Prudential Financial (PRU.N) is investigating whether Wells Fargo (WFC.N) employees signed up customers for its life insurance policies without their knowledge, a spokesman said on Saturday. Sales practices at Wells Fargo have been under a spotlight since September when federal regulators ordered the San Francisco-based bank to pay $190 million in fines and restitution because they said its high pressure sales environment pushed employees to open as many as 2 million deposit and credit card accounts without customers' permission. Prudential has a partnership with Wells Fargo to sell a low-cost life insurance policy, known as MyTerm, to the bank's retail customers. Since bankers are not licensed to sell insurance, Wells Fargo employees were meant to direct customers to either self-service kiosks in branches or online to buy the insurance, without getting into specifics about the products.  According to a wrongful termination suit filed in New Jersey state court this week by three former managers in Prudential's corporate investigation division, Wells Fargo employees appear to have signed up bank customers for the Prudential policies without the customers' knowledge or permission. In some cases, policies were opened and closed after a month or two and then reopened, and sometimes monthly fees were withdrawn from the accounts, according to evidence in the lawsuit. Scot Hoffman, a spokesman for Prudential Financial, said the insurer had been monitoring its business with Wells Fargo since last year. A customer survey had shown high lapse rates. The insurer expanded the review of how the product was sold after Wells Fargo was fined in September. We anticipate reviewing this matter with our regulators in due course,” Hoffman said in a statement. The three managers say they were fired in November for trying to escalate their discoveries internally within Prudential. Hoffman said they were fired for, appropriate and legitimate reasons that were entirely unrelated to Prudential’s business with Wells Fargo and Prudential’s decision to examine sales of the MyTerm product. A spokeswoman for Wells said the bank was investigating any alleged misconduct.  As we have consistently reinforced, if we identify any instances where a customer received a product they didn’t ask for, we will make it right, Mary Eshet, a spokeswoman for the bank said in a statement. The lawsuit and the Prudential investigation were first reported by The New York Times. Reporting by Carmel Crimmins, Editing by Franklin Paul"
"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-popular-m-a-santander-idUSKBN18Z24B","How Popular was caught off guard by Europe's abrupt takeover","","June 8, 2017 /  3:15 PM / 2 months ago","","MADRID (Reuters) - When the 1,644 Spanish branches of Banco Popular POP.MC opened their doors on Monday morning, the bank's chairman Emilio Saracho still hoped the 91-year-old lender, once the most efficient in Europe, could be saved. The previous Friday, shortly after Popular suffered another selloff on the stock market, he had sent an email to the bank's staff to tell them it was solvent and they should keep working hard to overcome the current situation. We need to work together and believe in what we do, Saracho wrote. JP Morgan and Lazard, which had been advising Popular since early May on finding a merger partner or raising new capital, had spent the weekend working the phones with other Spanish lenders in a bid to find a last minute solution. And the bank had requested emergency central bank liquidity that it believed meant it had a whole week to review its options and try to draw a line under a deposit flight that had wiped a quarter of its deposits. What Saracho didn't appear to measure was that the fate of Spain's sixth-biggest bank would be sealed in hours, not days or months as in previous European banking meltdowns. The swift maneuvering by Europe's bank regulators marks a sharp and brutal change in the way they deal with struggling banks, which could become a blueprint for handling other cases, especially in Italy where the rescue of troubled lenders has been under discussion for months. Previous bank rescues in the euro zone have involved protracted negotiations and government bailouts, even after new rules came in following the financial crisis, aimed at preventing taxpayer money being used in bank bailouts.  However, the abruptness of the action by the authorities could raise questions about whether regulators and the Spanish government spent enough time exploring other options potentially less painful for shareholders or bondholders. That, in turn, could now pave the way for legal claims to be filed. The ECB, the Spanish government and Popular all declined to comment. Trigger On Saturday, the Single Resolution Board (SRB), a regulatory body responsible for dealing with the euro zone's banking crises, met in Brussels to discuss the risks posed by Popular for Spain's and Europe's financial stability. Based on an independent valuation by Spanish boutique investment firm Arcano which showed Popular had a capital shortfall of up to 8 billion euros, the SRB concluded the bank would likely fail to meet its financial obligations. It ordered an immediate fire sale, setting in motion the mechanism to take over the lender. Saracho was left by the side of the road by the European resolution body, said one source, adding that JP Morgan's last-ditch attempt at the weekend to find a buyer was predicated on an understanding that the SRB would soon move on Popular. The SRB declined to comment. Sources familiar with SRB strategy say the initial objective was to intervene in Popular on Friday, June 9, ahead of the weekend, to give enough time for negotiations. But both the volume of deposit withdrawals on Monday and the determination of European authorities to use their new banking resolution powers would speed things up dramatically. In the early afternoon of Tuesday, Saracho picked up the phone to call Spain's Economy Minister Luis de Guindos and let him know Popular had run out of collateral to obtain new ECB liquidity. Branches might not open on Wednesday morning. There was a bank run, the ECB's deputy governor Vitor Constancio said on Thursday in response to questions about why the authorities had not spent more time analyzing other options to salvage the bank. It was no longer a question of making sure the bank had enough capital to meet its long term obligations, so much as ensuring it had cash on hand to stay open. It was not a matter of assessing the developments of solvency as such, but the liquidity issue. Within six hours, the SRB had swooped, cancelling the investments of Popular's shareholders and junior bondholders with the stroke of a pen and selling the lender for a solitary euro to Spanish banking goliath Santander (SAN.MC).

N26, previously known as Number26, has expanded rapidly since it launched in early 2015 as a smartphone-only bank with no local branches, with the backing of major global investors including Silicon Valley's Peter Thiel.  Vincent Haupert, a research fellow and PhD student in the computer science department of the University of Erlangen-Nuernberg, told the Chaos Communications Congress in Hamburg how he and two colleagues found N26 security defenses riddled with holes that could have been used to defraud thousands of users.  They say you can open a bank account in just eight minutes, Haupert said. As it turns out, you can lose it even faster. In a statement, N26 thanked Haupert for alerting the company to a theoretical security vulnerability and advising it on fixes, which N26 said it completed this month. N26 offers a range of online banking and other financial services to 200,000 customers in 17 European countries through a banking license granted earlier this year by German financial regulator Bafin. N26 executives have been the most outspoken among new fintech players in arguing traditional banks are failing to serve customers more directly by relying on antiquated local branch relationships instead of modern, phone-based services. I don't see banks at all as my competitors. They just can't move fast enough, N26 Chief Executive Valentin Stalf told Reuters last year. Haupert told the Chaos conference, Europe's biggest annual gathering of hackers, how his team had found numerous ways to attack N26 banking apps to hijack individual customer accounts. With such a strategy, fintechs squander the trust that banks established over years, he said. For example, Haupert said he compared data from a leak of 68 million account credentials from online file sharing company Dropbox with information on N26 users he was able to request from the company's own software feed to identify 33,000 N26 user credentials - without being thwarted by N26 anti-fraud systems.  From there, he said it would have been simple to send a phishing email to these N26 customers that could potentially have allowed him to break into their accounts.  Don't worry, we didn't do this, Haupert said. My professor had legal concerns. Instead, Haupert disclosed his research findings to N26 on Sept. 25. In response, N26 said in a statement it had made customer accounts more secure by reducing and encrypting data transfers, by blocking brute-force attacks in which hackers can quickly guess user credentials, and fixing voice-recognition security weaknesses in its app for the newest Apple mobile devices.  At no time during these scenarios was personal data of our customers available to third parties, the statement said. No N26 customer was impacted by the demonstrated vulnerabilities. It added: We have fully addressed and closed all vulnerabilities promptly and completely and quoted Haupert as saying earlier this month that all vulnerabilities he had uncovered appeared to have been fixed.   Still, Haupert said regulators needed to take a closer look at the security of banks. It was Bafin that granted a banking license to N26 only six months ago, he said, adding that security weaknesses at that time were rampant.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hungary-soros-university-idUSKBN17E0QC","Hungarian students march to parliament in protest at university law","","April 12, 2017 /  7:42 AM / 4 months ago","","BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Thousands of Hungarian students marched on parliament late on Wednesday despite the government suggesting a compromise to keep open a university founded by U.S. financier George Soros. Central European University (CEU) found itself in the eye of a political storm after Hungary's parliament passed the new law last week setting tougher conditions for the awarding of licenses to foreign-based universities. Critics said the new terms would hurt academic freedoms and were especially aimed at CEU, founded by the Hungarian-born Soros after the collapse of Communism and considered a bastion of independent scholarship in the region. In an apparent change of tack, Education Secretary Laszlo Palkovics said CEU, which specializes in social sciences, could continue to operate if it delivered its teaching and issued its degrees through its existing Hungarian sister school. We never wanted to close down CEU, Palkovics told news website HVG.hu. The question is whether CEU insists on having a license in Hungary or having courses in Hungary honored with a CEU degree ... (CEU's own) license has little significance. Despite this, thousands of Hungarians protested in central Budapest against what they said was a crackdown on free thought. Thousands of students broke off from an earlier protest in Heroes' Square and marched some 3.5 km to the parliament, chanting Europe! Europe! and Free country! Free university!  Related CoverageHungarians protest against crackdown on education, NGOsBrussels wants dialogue with Hungary on concerns over rights, democracyEU threatens Hungary over rights, Soros collegeThey threw paper planes - alluding to allegations in Orban-friendly media that Soros had flown in foreign protesters. One protester told Reuters he did not believe what the government said. Look at the law: they are still out to get CEU, they are still out to get Soros, they don't care if they destroy the country in the process, said Geza Lukacs, 22, an engineering student from the northern town of Vac. Calls for Talks People sit during a protest against a new law that would undermine Central European University, a liberal graduate school of social sciences founded by U.S. financier George Soros in Budapest, Hungary, April 12, 2016.Bernadett SzaboWednesday's protests were the fourth major demonstration in the past two weeks as the government faces growing resistance a year before elections are due.  They have pressed ahead since 2010 with new moves every day that hurt democracy in some way, Robert Ferenczi, a 55-year-old protester from Budapest, told Reuters in Heroes' Square. The dispute over the university has come to symbolize rival visions of Hungary's future. Soros, whose ideal of an open society is squarely at odds with Orban's self-styled illiberal democracy, has often been vilified by the prime minister. Slideshow (11 Images)CEU itself was taken by surprise at Palkovics' comments. The solution evoked by State Secretary Palkovics in the press does not appear to be legally and operationally coherent and certain, it said by email. CEU has not been approached directly by Secretary Palkovics with this information. Exchanges in the press are no substitute for sustained direct contact on a confidential basis. We look to the Hungarian government to initiate negotiations with CEU so that we can resolve this. Government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs said the government would not suspend the law but added: We are going to have talks with everyone; if the Soros university is driven by good intentions, it will be able to solve the problem. The law said the CEU must open a branch in its home state of New York alongside its campus in Budapest and secure a bilateral agreement of support from the U.S. government. Both of those conditions would have been prohibitive by a deadline of January 2018, and CEU rejected them from the start. The United States asked Hungary to suspend the implementation of the law, and the European Union on Wednesday threatened Orban with legal action for moves that it saw as undemocratic. The European Union was adamant Hungary must show its actions would not harm democratic safeguards. Taken cumulatively, the overall situation in Hungary is a cause of concern, European Commission First Vice President Frans Timmermans said.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/brazil-corruption-petrobras-idUSL1N1I60D5","More work needed to free Petrobras of corruption: Brazil prosecutor","","May 4, 2017 /  12:34 PM / 3 months ago","","RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - A top Brazilian prosecutor said Thursday there was still much work to be done to rid state-run oil company Petrobras of corruption, despite more than three years of investigations into a political kickback scheme involving contractors.  Prosecutor Carlos Lima made the statement at a news conference detailing the arrests of three former Petrobras executives who allegedly took 100 million reais ($32 million) in bribes. Some of the money held offshore was then brought into Brazil through a government amnesty program for foreign assets.   Nothing guarantees that today we have a company that is truly cleaned of the corruption of its past, Lima said in reference to Petrobras, also known as Petroleo Brasileiro SA. Petrobras Chief Executive Pedro Parente, who took over a year ago, has said the firm is working hard to shake out corruption and that it must quickly remove any doubts in order to help the revival of the company, the most indebted in the industry.    Lima and other investigators also sharply criticized the amnesty program as an easy way for those involved in the Petrobras scheme to launder bribes held in overseas bank accounts.  Their comments ratcheted up tension between anti-corruption crusaders in Brazil's judiciary and the executive and legislative branches, who have held the program up as a success. Investigators alleged that of the executives arrested, none of whom were named, one had brought some 48 million reais of bribe money that had been in offshore accounts back into Brazil under false pretenses, taking advantage of the amnesty program last year. This is a very serious fact, as it shows that the law ... institutionalized the money laundering of assets held abroad, said prosecutor Diogo Castor in a statement. The criticism of a law passed last year with the support of President Michel Temer underscored how prosecutors have increasingly come into open confrontation with the political establishment. Temer hailed the amnesty program for raising around 50 billion reais in taxes and fines to help the government meet its budget target and called on Congress to start another program swiftly. In March, the Senate sent a bill to his desk opening the repatriation window for another 120 days. Last month, the Petrobras probe sent shockwaves through the capital when the Supreme Court authorized investigations into eight cabinet ministers and dozens of senior lawmakers. Prosecutors reiterated on Thursday that they had presented Congress with 10 measures that should be passed into law to battle corruption.

U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein in Manhattan said the release was proper because departing Defense Secretary Ash Carter failed to show why publishing the photos would endanger Americans deployed outside the United States. Hellerstein's decision is a victory for the American Civil Liberties Union and other civil and veterans rights groups whose lawsuit seeking the photos under the federal Freedom of Information Act began in 2004. Photos depicting abuse at Abu Ghraib began to emerge in 2004, with some detainees claiming to have endured physical and sexual abuse, electric shocks and mock executions. The number of photos sought in the lawsuit has not been disclosed but has been estimated at roughly 2,000, according to the Congressional Record and court papers. Those photos, representing a sad episode in our history, are a matter of great public interest and historical importance, which should not, in a democracy like ours, be shielded from public view, said Lawrence Lustberg, a lawyer for the plaintiffs. The court has wisely reaffirmed our nation's commitment to open government. A spokesman for U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in Manhattan, whose office defended Carter's decision, declined to comment. After Hellerstein in March 2015 ordered the release of additional photos, Carter allowed the release of 198 but kept the remainder under wraps, citing a review of a representative sample by four high-ranking generals. In Wednesday's decision, Hellerstein said the U.S. troop presence in Iraq had fallen to about 5,000 from more than 100,000 at the start of the Obama administration, and that those remaining now serve as advisers rather than in combat. The judge said that while risks remained, including that portions of Iraq had been overrun by the Islamic State, he could not blindly accept withholding the remaining photos. I take seriously the level of deference owed to the executive branch in the realm of national security decision making, he wrote. My complaint is that the executive has failed to articulate the reasons supporting its conclusion that release of the photos would endanger Americans deployed abroad. Hellerstein first ordered the release of photos in 2005, but Congress later authorized withholding photos whose release could endanger Americans. The case is American Civil Liberties Union et al v.

Just 22 bumpy miles from the capital of India's restive Manipur state, he and his colleagues are outnumbered by gunmen from a faction of the National Socialist Council of Nagaland, one of half a dozen insurgent groups operating near India's border with Myanmar. Last year, six policemen were killed a few miles away in an ambush authorities blamed on them. Small groups of men with machetes on their belts can be seen in the winter twilight, openly climbing steep paths through the poppy fields, where valuable seed heads will later be harvested and taken to Myanmar for processing into heroin. There are many poppy fields in the hills here, the policeman said in a hushed voice, refusing to give his name to Reuters for fear of reprisals from the men he said were armed rebels patrolling the fields above his office. Growers will either sell the seed heads to agents or openly in the local market , he said. Opium and insurgency can make for a profitable if exotic  business model, but it is not what India had in mind when it launched its Look East policy 20 years ago to link its markets to those of booming Southeast Asia. Now as resource-rich Myanmar emerges from decades of isolation under military rule, India should be a natural partner, with ties stretching back to 3rd Century BC Buddhist emperor Ashoka and, more recently, a shared experience of British colonialism and World War Two. Bridge to Southeast Asia Myanmar is India's only bridge to Southeast Asia, Myo Myint, Myanmar's deputy foreign minister, told Reuters last week at a meeting of Southeast Asian diplomats in New Delhi to look at ways to speed up road, rail and telecoms connections with India. India needs to come forward with assistance. Myanmar sits at Asia's crossroads, sharing a western border with India, and a northern one with China. Thailand is its neighbour to the east and the Malacca Strait is on its southern flank. The country of nearly 60 million people has emerged from a half-century of military rule and is courting the West while trying to wean itself from dependency on China for trade and investment. But despite a recent flurry of high-level visits between the two countries, India appears ill-placed on the ground to exploit Myanmar's opening. Reuters journalists on a recent trip to the Myanmar-India border in Manipur found a region where rebel groups deeply influence politics and business. Opium poppies are grown openly. Cross-border gun-running remains big business. Manipur and the three other Indian states sharing the 1,640- km (1,020-mile) border with Myanmar were supposed to be India's Gateway to the East. Instead, the area has become India's Wild East. Legal trade on the border has dwindled in the last five years to just 0.15 percent of total commerce between Myanmar and India. Checkpoints by security forces and rebel group supporters make the 120 km (75 mile) journey along rutted Highway 102 through the hills from Manipur's capital Imphal to Moreh on the border a painstakingly slow -- and expensive, too, from the taxes they impose on traffic. No Crime Here The sleepy border town of Moreh had dreams of being a major international trading centre, a key station on the ambitious Trans-Asia Railway that will enable containers from East and Southeast Asia to travel overland across India to Europe. But work on the $900 million, 125 km (77 mile) stretch of the railway is already two years behind schedule and has only progressed a short distance. Costs are soaring. At first glance, Moreh seems to be a quiet bazaar of traditional wooden stilt houses, frontier hotels and stores where Myanmarese Buddhist monks and tribespeople in traditional dress and sandal-paste painted faces mingle with traders from across India. The town of 15,000 people has one bank. There is no crime here, acting police chief Akbar Hussein said, chewing on a lump of betel nut at his outdoor desk. There was only one case registered this month, and that was a road accident. Opened in 1995 to great fanfare, the Moreh crossing was supposed to be a major trading post by now. Only some small-scale merchants conduct legal trade. Much of that is on a barter system, exchanging flour and soy products for betel, a mild stimulant popular in India. Despite the police chief's boast, Moreh is a major smuggling centre where outlaws move around freely. Heroin from the Golden Triangle, guns and gem stones go westward; raw opium, tiger bones and rhino horn move east. Since 1995, nothing substantial has taken place. The border area is like a 17th-century tribal village, said N. Mohindro, an expert on trade in the state. It's all about drugs and guns. People can make money so easily. Some of this business is in the hands of Indian insurgents who run their operations from the Myanmar side of the border. Several of Myanmar's own rebel groups are also based in the area. A U.S. diplomatic cable from 2006 released by Wikileaks described local politicians either in league with the rebels or supporting them for financial reasons. Local residents say security forces are also deeply involved in trafficking but a senior officer of the police intelligence branch in Imphal denies that. The dense forest cover in this open border region is a nightmare for us, the officer said, the officer said of an unfenced 63 mile stretch running from Moreh, adding that the easy availability of weapons inside Myanmar has worsened the situation. Imaginary Road It wasn't always this way. Until the early 1990s, Myanmarese flocked across the border to buy Indian-made consumer goods. But as China's workshops cranked up and offered cheaper, more durable products, the market shifted to the other side of the fence. Now, traders from Manipur's capital Imphal endure the serpentine journey along bumpy Highway 102 and its checkpoint shakedowns to visit the Namphalong bazaar on the Myanmar side of the Moreh border gate. Their pick-up trucks are piled high with Chinese mattresses, refrigerators and TVs to sell back in India, returning along the same road that brought Japanese troops in World War Two through then Burma in an attempt to invade India. The trip from the border to Imphal carrying such contraband can involve payoffs along the way amounting to several hundred dollars. Highway 102 was supposed to be part of a road network linking up with Mandalay, Myanmar's main city in the North, and on into Thailand. But the only notable improvement on the Indian side is a short patch running through the Manipur chief minister's home town. People had plans to open eateries, motels and shops along the Asian highway. Now, the trans-national road is imaginary. It does not exist here, said Lunminthang Haokip, a senior state government official for Moreh's Chandel district. The Look East policy is no more than power-point presentations in Delhi. The complaint is voiced often here by residents in Manipur who have suffered decades of rights abuses under draconian emergency powers including shoot-to-kill orders aimed at curtailing the insurgencies. Residents say New Delhi acts like a colonial power, with much of its mistrust of the region stemming from its relative proximity to China. The overwhelming presence of military, paramilitary and police officers contributed to the impression that Imphal was under military occupation, the U.S. embassy cable said. The Indian civil servants were also clearly frustrated with their inability to stem the growing violence and anarchy in the state, feeling their efforts to effectively control the insurgencies was hamstrung by local politicians either in league with or at least through corruption, helping to finance the insurgents. India, which fought a border war in 1962 with China, has watched with mounting concern as Beijing steadily increases its influence around the rim of the Indian Ocean. You can't leave the whole region under an iron curtain just because they look Chinese, said rights activist Babloo Loitongbam, in a restaurant left dark by one of the chronic power cuts in Imphal. You have to constantly prove you are not anti-national. Ten years ago India's foreign minister proposed reopening a World War Two highway to the north of Manipur called the Stilwell Road, which connects India's far eastern region, known as the Northeast, with Myanmar and China. Worried that the road risked strengthening China's influence and the flow of militants and arms to the region, India dragged its feet and Myanmar turned to China's Yunnan Construction Engineering Group instead. India also missed out on the natural gas from two fields in Myanmar it has a stake in, when the government chose to pipe it to China. During long years of self-imposed isolation, Myanmar's only major economic partner was China. India realised in the 1990s that Chinese investment in Myanmar's military and infrastructure was giving Beijing a strategic advantage in a nation that     borders five countries, straddles busy Bay of Bengal shipping lanes and has large oil and gas reserves. New Delhi quietly dropped its backing for the opposition party of Nobel peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, who went to school and university in India. Ties have strengthened since then, with President Thein Sein just the latest of Myanmar's leaders to call on New Delhi on a visit to India last year. Rajiv Bhatia, who was India's ambassador to Myanmar until 2005. says India is still more concerned with its South Asian neighbours, including Bangladesh and Pakistan, and could miss the moment. In pure geopolitical terms, Myanmar is hugely important to India. We are now getting a historic opportunity to recover our relationship, he said.  But it is still not a priority for our politicians.

Strategic partners only, hedge funds, private equity and institutions need not apply. American marketing expert Travis Ledwith and German banker Thomas Buemsen have been quietly making that unlikely-sounding pitch to telecoms and technology firms and other hand-picked investors for the last few months. Now the duo are kicking off formal fundraising that they hope will allow them to cash in on Ireland's newly-concentrated banking market, the turnaround from economic crisis and the Dublin technology hub that will help them break new ground. Public perception of the country's current lenders, including the surviving domestic banks who were among those bailed out to the tune of close to 70 billion euros ($96.26 billion), doesn't hurt either. Most of the clients had a negative experience with their existing bank, said Buemsen, 46, who met 33-year-old Ledwith on an international MBA course in 2012. Danske Bank is leaving, ACC is leaving, they have huge losses. All the other banks that were state owned are still state owned...It (personal banking) is an area of banking which was neglected in the last couple of years. If their plans for Flip succeed they'll become the first new retail player in Ireland since Postbank's shortlived venture in 2007 and the first to offer cutting edge technology like an app that allows customers to scan and upload cheques instead of physically depositing them. They want it to be a lifestyle bank, tailored to making your life easier, a concept similar to the one used by a Thai bank called K Bank. They hope the Irish operation will be open by 2015 and are already thinking further afield, with plans to replicate the model in Italy and Spain, where they see similar post-crisis opportunities, and in Germany, where they want to take advantage of a large banking market they say is lacking in innovation. Barriers Brand new banks have been few and far between across the developed world. Jason Quarry, head of Oliver Wyman UK, cites several barriers to entry - the lack of an existing brand, customer inertia over switching bank accounts, not having an existing balance sheet and cash flow, and the need to develop the complex operating platform needed to run a bank. However, you can turn each of those on their head and turn them into an advantage, he said. Historic brand dynamics are shifting given the challenges from the financial crisis; customers are gradually becoming more willing to consider alternative providers; the lack of a balance sheet means less exposure to credit losses from legacy lending; the lack of existing IT complexity offers the chance of developing a clean operating model. He said markets seeing light at the end of the tunnel after high defaults were particularly ripe for new entrants. Irish policymakers have publicly spoken about the need to tempt more lenders towards small- and medium-sized enterprises, after the crisis left Ireland with only three SME lenders of scale  - state-owned AIB, Royal Bank of Scotland's Ulster Bank and Bank of Ireland, which counts the Irish state as a 15 percent shareholder. But they have said less about the personal banking market, where state-owned Permanent TSB joins the big three as a competitor. It's all about the app, a bank that is low cost and has a world class mobile phone App will go viral, said Peter Bellew, a senior executive with an Irish airline. A new online brand could impute trust from customers from day one with understated design and simple interfaces. Financial experts say there could be space in the Irish market for another player. There is a role for new niche players in the Irish banking market, said Ciaran Callaghan, analyst at Merrion Stockbrokers. Innovation Ledwith and Buemsen hope to keep Flip's costs down by outsourcing most of its operations to providers like Capita, which is already signed up as a partner. The traditional branch network will be ditched in favour of an online only system, similar to the one offered by RaboDirect, a subsidiary of Dutch bank Rabobank which offers online personal and business savings. Soaring regulatory costs that constrain many banks should be avoided because Flip's model is simple - take in deposits from customers and offer current accounts, personal loans and overdrafts - so rules about derivatives and the hierarchy of bondholders are of little concern. What customers should see is deposit rates of about 1.5 percent, against current rates of almost nothing from the Irish banks now, along with a simple pricing structure for its current accounts, the duo said. The target market is defined not by the usual parameters of age and wealth, but by how people use their bank, Ledwith said. The service side is where they claim the biggest advantage. Their lifestyle bank will be fronted by an app that makes banking easy. Along with cheque-scanning, they plan a Skype-style live chat feature allowing customers to talk to a bank representative within their app. The app will also analyse a customer's spending so they can see where their money is going, and will warn them if they're over-spending and prompt them about a possible overdraft. Licensing Getting a licence may not be straightforward. Just ask Dave Fishwick, who's spent close to three years trying to convince UK regulators to license his 'Bank of Dave'. Fishwick has arranged loans of more than 2.5 million pounds by acting as a matchmaker between savers and borrowers, but is still has no licence. The process is huge, and you've got to bear in mind that there's one other banking licence issued in the last 100 years, to Metro Bank, he said, adding that his venture is now halfway through the process and hopes to have a licence this year. Flip hasn't even begun talking to the Central Bank of Ireland about a licence yet, and won't until it gets financial backers on board. It expects the process to take about a year. Vernon Hill, who founded Metro Bank in 2010, had already built Commerce Bank from start-up into one of the U.S.'s top twenty lenders before he tried his hand in the UK. Metro Bank was an unusual set of factors that came together, he said. I had a proven model, I had a management team to help me. I had done new banks and I had the ability to raise capital based on my prior performance. Buemsen spent 17 years working in financial services, rising to become deputy CEO of Hungary's Takarek Bank, but he has never set one up. Ledwith comes from the marketing world. We're looking for investors that are interested in retail financial services ... but that themselves do not want to be a bank, said Ledwith. Targeted investors included mobile phone handset makers who want to offer the banking platform on their devices, technology companies who want to help develop the interface or telecoms companies whose networks will be used by bank customers. Because they're such large companies, Buemsen and Ledwith believe that they'll be able to tap them for extra cash if the project takes off and needs more money to expand to new markets. The duo also stress that they don't have to make it big. The headcount could be as low as 20 direct employees when they start. Their business model pencils in about 10,000 customers at launch (wooed via online sign-up before launch), rising to 30,000 or 40,000 in the first year - less than one percent of the adult Irish population. And they don't even have to go against the famed Irish statistic that people are more likely to leave their spouse than their bank. It's increasingly common to have more than one bank account. You don't have to get a divorce, said Buemsen. You can have an affair with us as well."
"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed-repo-idUSBREA1C1N120140213","New York Fed threatens new rules to stop repo-market fire sales","","February 13, 2014 /  6:42 PM / 3 years ago","","NEW YORK (Reuters) - The banks and big funds in a key short-term funding market have not even begun to address the risk of destabilizing fire sales, and the lack of action may force regulators to step in with new rules, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York warned on Thursday. The market for so-called tri-party repurchases, or repos, is at particular risk of seizing up entirely, as it did in the 2008 financial crisis, if a big player defaults, the New York Fed said. It added investors are highly vulnerable to liquidity pressures and credit losses that could force them to dump collateral in a fire sale. The stern warning from the branch of the U.S. central bank suggested regulators are growing frustrated with the lack of industry action to fix a problem that was at the heart of the financial crisis more than five years ago. The New York Fed, which is tasked with overseeing the Fed's open market operations, said no mechanism currently exists or is being developed by the banks and funds in the tri-party market to ensure that investors will act collectively and in a measured way in liquidating their collateral. As noted by Federal Reserve Bank of New York President (William) Dudley in a recent speech, in the absence of a market-based solution to this risk issue, regulators may be forced to use the tools they have to take steps to reduce this risk, the bank said in a statement. Fire sale risk remains a critical policy concern of the Federal Reserve and other members of the U.S. regulatory community. In repurchase agreements lenders, such as money funds, make short-term loans to banks or other borrowers and receive collateral such as Treasuries or other bonds. Banks then often make similar loans to far more leveraged investors such as hedge funds. A fire sale can happen when a dealer comes under stress and dumps assets in a bid to shore up its liquidity, depressing asset values that hurt other firms then have to sell in an accelerating chain. Worries over a fire sale of collateral against repos at Long Term Capital Management (LTCM) when it almost defaulted in 1998 led to a group of banks having to purchase the fund and then slowly unwind the firm. Then in September 2008, the repo market rapidly dried up when investment bank Lehman Brothers failed. The two clearing banks for tri-party transactions, JP Morgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) and Bank of New York Mellon (BK.N), have adjusted systems in the last two years to reduce the use of intra-day credit, but the New York Fed said little has been done to better manage risk. The regulator made that recommendation two years ago; in October, Dudley said government agencies may need to intervene. While it is unclear what the Fed and other U.S. market regulators could do, the threat of new rules has alarmed members of a European capital markets association, which worries the Americans will adopt an ill-suited solution. Fed Governor Jeremy Stein said in October that regulators have tools they can employ to help shore up liquidity at individual companies such as banks, including risk-based capital, liquidity and leverage requirements. He noted, however, that none are a comprehensive solution to the problem of repo market fire sales. Reporting By Dan Burns; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama"
"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-syria-actress-idUSTRE8040WQ20120105","Syrian actress treads new stage in Syrian protests","","January 5, 2012 /  1:47 PM / 6 years ago","","AMMAN (Reuters) - Syrian actress Fadwa Suleiman says she was drawn to a life in drama because of its promise of freedom. Disillusioned at the level of state control even in theater and film, she joined protests last year against President Bashar al-Assad and now takes the stage at demonstrations in the city of Homs, center of resistance to his family's four-decade rule. Cutting her hair short like a boy and moving from house to house to evade capture, Suleiman has become one of the most recognized faces of the 10-month uprising against Assad. She played no part in the early demonstrations that broke out in March, but a deep-seated rebellious streak - which only increased when she joined the state-run High Conservatory for Theater Arts - drew her toward the protests. I chose to study theater because I thought theater means freedom to think and to express oneself, Suleiman told Reuters in a Skype interview from Homs. Describing her time at the conservatory, which like most culture in Syria is controlled by the state, she said she slowly discovered that my country wants to drain every culture and content from its citizens. I became opposed to the way we work, to the humiliation, the degradation in human interaction. Everywhere you go, even a theater or a film company, you feel you have entered a security branch, she said. Authors write the worst scripts but they are chosen because they have links to security. Before the uprising, Suleiman was known for her roles in television, radio, cinema and theater, playing an art teacher at an orphanage in Small Hearts, a television series that helped raise awareness about human organ trafficking and was broadcast by several Arab channels. She also acted in an Arabic adaptation of Henrik Ibsen's A Doll's House at the Qabbani theater in Damascus. When the uprising broke out Suleiman, who is in her 30s, became increasingly active as Syria's intelligentsia mobilized in support of the pro-democracy protesters. She has appeared at rallies demanding Assad's removal, sharing the podium with soccer star Abdelbasset Sarout, one of a number of Syrian celebrities who have backed the revolt. Veteran actresses Mona Wassef and May Skaf, singer Asala Masri, film director Nabil Maleh and composer Malek Jandali are among other Syrian figures who have supported the uprising. She has also delivered impassioned monologues to camera, calling for peaceful protests to continue across the country until Assad is overthrown. In one video message in November, she said security forces were searching Homs neighborhoods for her and beating people to force them to reveal her hiding place. Her life on the run resembles that of other activists wanted for their role in the uprising, except that Suleiman is a woman from Syria's Alawite minority - the same sect as Assad - taking part in a mainly male and Sunni Muslim rebellion. In the conservative bastion of Homs where Suleiman has made her stand, most women wear the headscarf and tensions between Sunnis and Alawites have exploded into sectarian violence. Fearing a Sunni backlash, the Alawite community, a secretive and tightly knit sect which controls the army and makes up most of the security apparatus, has mostly sided with Assad, or remained silent as troops cracked down on protesters. Many Alawites have disavowed Suleiman, including her brother Mahmoud, who appeared on a state-controlled satellite channel saying Syria's unity was more important than his sister. The actress insists Sunnis and Alawites can still live together despite the spiral of sectarian violence in Homs, pointing to conservative Sunni families who have opened their homes to shelter her from security forces. The regime portrays Homs as a hub for extreme Islam, but I walk in Sunni neighborhoods distributing flyers, and go like this, without a veil, into the homes of religious families and discuss politics and organizing the next protest, she said. A YouTube video showed Suleiman standing on a podium last month in the Sunni neighborhood of Khalidiya in Homs, chanting One, one, one. Syrian people are one. The crowd, waving Syrian green and white flags from the era before Assad's Baath Party took power in a 1963 military coup, thunders after her Khalidiya: free and proud. Opposite Khalidiya is the Alawite neighborhood of Nozha, where the bodies of 30 Sunni Muslims were dumped by army trucks in December, provoking an attack by armed Sunnis, according to an Alawite resident of the district. At the rally, Suleiman appealed to the people of Nozha to come and see reality, to see your brothers in blood peacefully demanding freedom. Freedom cannot be against your beliefs, even if you're pro-regime, she said. In the interview, Suleiman said that stopping the sectarian bloodshed in Homs had become the main priority, but that Assad must also be removed. We're a civilized and peaceful nation. We cannot let the regime with a simple ploy make us slaughter each other to justify its existence, she said. At a rally earlier in the uprising, the actress sang a popular tune by Lebanese singer Marcel Khalifah, surrounded by youths from her home region in the Alawite mountains overlooking the Mediterranean. I chose you, my homeland. Lovingly, voluntarily, she sang, in apparently wistful reference to her now estranged Alawite community. Let the times disavow me, as long as you will remember me, my wonderful homeland. Editing by Dominic Evans"

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-michaelmoore-oscars-idUSTRE80A1EC20120111","Michael Moore: new Oscar docs process is more transparent","","January 11, 2012 /  4:35 PM / 6 years ago","","LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - New rules in the Oscar documentary process are not going to make things harder for documentary filmmakers, director and AMPAS governor Michael Moore told TheWrap. Instead, he said, the rules that go into effect this year are going to make what Moore called a crazy, Byzantine process more open, more democratic and more transparent -- and they're going to fix a process that has led to decades of snubs, surprises and inexplicable decisions. I saw a headline that said documentary filmmakers were fearing the changes, Moore said in a lengthy interview. We've feared the process for the last 20 years -- this is the elimination of that fear. And if anybody should be worried about the new rules, it's not the makers of small docs, it's a giant in the doc field, HBO (which he did not single out by name, but which is one clear target of the new rules). The changes led to some controversy when the New York Times revealed a new requirement that films need to be reviewed in the New York Times or the Los Angeles Times in order to qualify for Oscar consideration. But Moore, the architect of and prime lobbyist for the new system, described the review rule as a small part of a major overhaul. The main change is the elimination of the committees that have been responsible for nominations for decades. In its place, the documentary branch will do what most Academy branches do: All members of the branch will vote for the nominations, and all members of the Academy will vote for the final awards. Why is it that year after year, so many great documentaries don't even make the shortlist? Moore asked. The main problem is committees, and I made it my mission to eliminate those committees. Others, including TheWrap, have been lobbying for a change to the committee system for years. In fact, Moore said that a 2010 story in TheWrap was a particularly accurate summation of the problems with a process in which volunteers from the branch were assembled into small committees and given a number of films to score on a scale of six to 10. It was not a democratic process, and not a transparent process, Moore said. With some branches, you'd see the nominations and be surprised that this actor got in or that film didn't make it. With our branch, every year it was five or six or seven surprises. It's so jarring to think that the Maysles never got an Oscar, D.A. Pennebaker never got one, Michael Apted never got one for the '7 Up' series. And it happened again this year, when Werner Herzog couldn't even make the shortlist. The changes will also do away with a rule that said members who had a film in the running were not eligible to participate, a regulation that had the potential to knock out a hefty chunk of the electorate when you have a 166-member branch and more than 100 eligible films. If 50 people volunteer and you have 100 films to watch, you form 10 committees of five people each, said Moore, who in the past has served on those committees. And if I saw 'Inside Job' in a theater and loved it but 'Inside Job' is not in the box of 10 movies that I get, there's nothing I can do to help that movie get nominated. Even worse, he said, the small size of each committee meant that each member's vote is of inordinate importance. If there's only a five-person committee deciding the fate of those 10 films, one or two low votes can kill the movie. In fact, former Academy executive director Bruce Davis all but admitted to me that low scores from a small group of members prevented Hoop Dreams from receiving a nomination in 1994, even though that film had more scores of 10 than any other documentary in the competition. In the fall, Moore said he took his concerns before the executive committee of the doc branch. I made an impassioned plea that we're at a defining moment for our branch, he said. Let's do it like everybody else does, and let everybody in the branch vote. Let's not allow one or two people to kill the chances for a film. The new rules, Moore added, will call for filmmakers to submit screeners to all branch members at the end of the quarter during which the film is released. I'm guessing it will be about 15 films every three months, he said, and I think most people will watch most of those films. Once the entire branch has voted to create a 15-film shortlist and select the five nominees, the final vote will be open to all Academy members, without the current requirement that members must prove they've seen all five nominees in a theater. (The Foreign-Language category retains that rule.) The rule restricting voting to those who'd seen all five films, he said, reduced the total number of voters in the category to between 200 and 400 out of the 6,000-member Academy. When I presented this to the Board of Governors in December, I said that we stand up on the Kodak stage every year and say, 'The Academy has selected this film as the best documentary of the year.' But that isn't the truth, is it? It isn't the Academy, it's less than 5 percent of the Academy. And I don't think we want to have somebody stand on that stage and say, 'Less than 5 percent of the academy has chosen this film.' The executive committee, said Moore, voted unanimously to approve the new rules he'd drawn up. The Board of Governors then followed suit in December, approving rules that were not scheduled to have been publicly disclosed until after this year's Oscar show. That changed when the New York Times ran its story, which focused on an additional wrinkle that was added to the rules for qualifying: Not only will films need to run for a week in theaters in Manhattan and Los Angeles County, but they'll also need a review in the New York Times or the Los Angeles Times. The intent of that rule, he said, is simple: to prevent the common practice of television networks quietly playing their docs for a week in out-of-the-way theaters, qualifying them for Oscars before staging a splashy television premiere. Too often, we are having to vote for films that are essentially television documentaries trying to get an Oscar, he said. Television has its own award. It's called the Emmy. It's a good award. I like it. I have one. But you don't see movies like 'The King's Speech' win Oscars and then go to TV and qualify for Emmys. In documentaries, some networks have been able to game the system. Moore declined to single out any specific networks or films, but the culprits are fairly obvious. At the last Emmy Awards, nominees in the nonfiction categories included HBO's Gasland and PBS's The Most Dangerous Man in America: Daniel Ellsberg and the Pentagon Papers, both of which had previously received Oscar nominations. Three of the 15 films on this year's Documentary Feature shortlist, The Loving Story, Paradise Lost 3: Purgatory and Sing Your Song, are HBO films. All three received unpublicized one-week runs at Laemmle's Fallbrook 7 theater in West Hills prior to splashy debuts on the cable channel. Located on the outskirts of the San Fernando Valley, the Fallbrook 7 is one of the most distant Laemmle theaters that still satisfies the requirement of a run in Los Angeles County, and is popular with companies four-walling their films for Oscar consideration. Most of the non-HBO shortlisted docs had their qualifying runs at more visible theaters in Beverly Hills, Santa Monica or West Hollywood. I feel bad that theatrical documentary film directors -- Werner Herzog, Steve James, Errol Morris {Tabloid], the guys who made 'Senna' and 'Nostalgia for the Light' -- spend years making these films that are intended to be real theatrical experiences, Moore said. And their potential slots on the shortlist are taken by films that were not truly theatrically released. Moore is quick to add that he has no problem with documentaries funded by and intended for television if those docs receive true theatrical releases rather than out-of-the-way stealth bookings. Some networks, like the History Channel and A&E;, are now giving their movies real theatrical runs, he said. That's great. But don't try to sneak it into theaters when nobody's looking so you can have your big TV premiere. If you do that, it's a TV movie and you should be trying for the Emmys, not the Oscars. That type of run, he said, is what the New York Times/L.A. Times rule is designed to stop. Because TV networks want the reviews to run when their films are debuting on the air, they do not solicit reviews for the stealth bookings. The New York Times, he said, was chosen because it has a long-standing policy of reviewing every film that receives a one-week theatrical run in New York. The L.A. Times was added as a first-step fail-safe measure in case the New York Times missed a film. And the new rules also add an appeals process for filmmakers whose work somehow doesn't get reviewed. We will side with the filmmaker, Moore promised. Moore admitted that the new requirement will reduce the number of eligible films, perhaps from 100 down to about 60. (This year's field of 124 is artificially inflated because it covers a 16-month eligibility period.) And it could deal a severe blow to programs like the International Documentary Association's DocuWeeks, in which more than a dozen films are programmed in rotating one-week blocks specifically to meet Oscar qualifying rules. Typically, DocuWeeks films do not receive separate reviews in the L.A. or New York Times. Among the films that qualified that way in 2011 is the shortlisted feature Semper Fi: Always Faithful. Asked how he felt about potentially knocking that film out of contention, Moore hesitated. I showed 'Semper Fi' at my festival, he said. It's a great film. He paused. The thing with 'Semper Fi,' I think they're going to be distributed in another month or two. So under the new rules, they could be eligible for next year's Oscars. Moore said his next priority is to find ways to give small documentaries theatrical distribution, but that he doesn't want the Oscars to be bogged down with vanity projects that try to game the system by four-walling theaters. And he adamantly insisted that the new system will not harm smaller films to any significant degree. At the documentary branch meeting, we were talking about whether this was going to hurt the smaller film, the independent film, he said. And Dawn Hudson pointed out that if you look at Oscar stats over the last 20 years, since screeners have been available, that has allowed for the rise of indie films. When you open up the process and make it accessible, what happens? 'The Hurt Locker' and 'Slumdog Millionaire' win Best Picture. The smaller films have been helped by a more open, more egalitarian process. The decades of a few people deciding have come to a complete end, he said. I think we have a better chance of 'Hoop Dreams' not happening again."

Unknown criminals tried to steal nearly $1 billion from the Bangladesh central bank account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in February and succeeded in transferring $81 million to four accounts at Rizal Commercial Banking Corp (RCBC) in Manila. Maia Deguito, a former manager of an RCBC branch in Manila, helped arrange the deposit and withdrawal of the money but says she was only following orders from her superiors and denies wrongdoing. Deguito posted bail of a 6,000 pesos ($130) on Thursday, Makati police chief Rommel Mitra said. Deguito also faces money laundering and falsification of documents complaints at the Department of Justice for opening five bank accounts at the bank branch last year.  She said a Manila-based Chinese casino junket operator had asked to open the accounts. The stolen funds were deposited in four of the accounts and ended up in casinos which are not covered by the anti-money laundering law. Only about $18 million has been recovered. Deguito's lawyer, Ferdinand Topacio, said she had no idea who filed the perjury case. We have never heard about it until tonight, he told broadcaster ABS-CBN on Wednesday night after she was arrested. This is pure harassment. Her rights were violated. ABS-CBN said the perjury case was filed by former RCBC president Lorenzo Tan. In April, Tan filed a civil complaint against Deguito alleging abuse of rights and defamation after she told a congressional hearing that Tan was aware of the opening of the five questionable accounts at her branch.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-syria-actress-protests-idUSTRE8051SK20120106","Syrian actress treads new stage in Syrian protests","","January 6, 2012 /  8:30 PM / 6 years ago","","AMMAN (Reuters) - Syrian actress Fadwa Suleiman says she was drawn to a life in drama because of its promise of freedom. Disillusioned at the level of state control even in theatre and film, she joined protests last year against President Bashar al-Assad and now takes the stage at demonstrations in the city of Homs, center of resistance to his family's four-decade rule. Cutting her hair short like a boy and moving from house to house to evade capture, Suleiman has become one of the most recognized faces of the 10-month uprising against Assad. She played no part in the early demonstrations that broke out in March, but a deep-seated rebellious streak - which only increased when she joined the state-run High Conservatory for Theatre Arts -- drew her towards the protests. I chose to study theatre because I thought theatre means freedom to think and to express oneself, Suleiman told Reuters in a Skype interview from Homs. Describing her time at the conservatory, which like most culture in Syria is controlled by the state, she said she slowly discovered that my country wants to drain every culture and content from its citizens. I became opposed to the way we work, to the humiliation, the degradation in human interaction. Everywhere you go, even a theatre or a film company, you feel you have entered a security branch, she said. Authors write the worst scripts but they are chosen because they have links to security. Before the uprising, Suleiman was known for her roles in television, radio, cinema and theatre, playing an art teacher at an orphanage in Small Hearts, a television series that helped raise awareness about human organ trafficking and was broadcast by several Arab channels. She also acted in an Arabic adaptation of Henrik Ibsen's A Doll's House at the Qabbani theatre in Damascus. When the uprising broke out Suleiman, who is in her 30s, became increasingly active as Syria's intelligentsia mobilized in support of the pro-democracy protesters. She has appeared at rallies demanding Assad's removal, sharing the podium with soccer star Abdelbasset Sarout, one of a number of Syrian celebrities who have backed the revolt. Veteran actresses Mona Wassef and May Skaf, singer Asala Masri, film director Nabil Maleh and composer Malek Jandali are among other Syrian figures who have supported the uprising. She has also delivered impassioned monologues to camera, calling for peaceful protests to continue across the country until Assad is overthrown. In one video message in November, she said security forces were searching Homs neighborhoods for her and beating people to force them to reveal her hiding place. Her life on the run resembles that of other activists wanted for their role in the uprising, except that Suleiman is a woman from Syria's Alawite minority - the same sect as Assad - taking part in a mainly male and Sunni Muslim rebellion. In the conservative bastion of Homs where Suleiman has made her stand, most women wear the headscarf and tensions between Sunnis and Alawites have exploded into sectarian violence. Fearing a Sunni backlash, the Alawite community, a secretive and tightly knit sect which controls the army and makes up most of the security apparatus, has mostly sided with Assad, or remained silent as troops cracked down on protesters. Many Alawites have disavowed Suleiman, including her brother Mahmoud, who appeared on a state-controlled satellite channel saying Syria's unity was more important than his sister. The actress insists Sunnis and Alawites can still live together despite the spiral of sectarian violence in Homs, pointing to conservative Sunni families who have opened their homes to shelter her from security forces. The regime portrays Homs as a hub for extreme Islam, but I walk in Sunni neighborhoods distributing flyers, and go like this, without a veil, into the homes of religious families and discuss politics and organizing the next protest, she said. A YouTube video showed Suleiman standing on a podium last month in the Sunni neighborhood of Khalidiya in Homs, chanting One, one, one. Syrian people are one. The crowd, waving Syrian green and white flags from the era before Assad's Baath Party took power in a 1963 military coup, thunders after her Khalidiya: free and proud. Opposite Khalidiya is the Alawite neighborhood of Nozha, where the bodies of 30 Sunni Muslims were dumped by army trucks in December, provoking an attack by armed Sunnis, according to an Alawite resident of the district. At the rally, Suleiman appealed to the people of Nozha to come and see reality, to see your brothers in blood peacefully demanding freedom. Freedom cannot be against your beliefs, even if you're pro-regime, she said. In the interview, Suleiman said that stopping the sectarian bloodshed in Homs had become the main priority, but that Assad must also be removed. We're a civilized and peaceful nation. We cannot let the regime with a simple ploy make us slaughter each other to justify its existence, she said. At a rally earlier in the uprising, the actress sang a popular tune by Lebanese singer Marcel Khalifah, surrounded by youths from her home region in the Alawite mountains overlooking the Mediterranean. I chose you, my homeland. Lovingly, voluntarily, she sang, in apparently wistful reference to her now estranged Alawite community. Let the times disavow me, as long as you will remember me, my wonderful homeland. Editing by Dominic Evans"

"https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-china-regulator-banks-exclusive-idUSKBN14V0CP","Exclusive - Banks forced to cover tracks of China's forex regulator","","January 11, 2017 /  4:31 AM / 7 months ago","","SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's forex regulator is telling banks to keep its instructions about curbing capital outflows secret and to ensure that research analysts keep any negative views about the yuan's prospects to themselves, several bankers said. Both demands are seen as an attempt by the authorities to prevent alarm that could trigger further declines in the yuan, the bankers from local and foreign banks said. The yuan lost more than 6 percent against the dollar last year and is at eight-year lows, prompting a flurry of restrictive measures on capital outflows from the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE), including setting limits on banks' currency volumes in some cities or provinces and requiring approval for ever smaller transactions. SAFE, which is part of the People's Bank of China (PBOC), is insisting in oral instructions to dozens of banks that they don't reveal its role in such restrictions, six bankers said, which was damaging their relationships with clients since they were unable to explain why they were turning away business. In a statement late on Wednesday, SAFE's Shanghai branch said it had not adopted new measures to control forex conversions and cross-border payments, but had urged banks to strengthen checks on compliance and deal authenticity. SAFE also said a media report about it telling banks to keep its instructions secret was inaccurate, and is misleading public opinion and disturbing normal operations of the Forex market. SAFE did not identify the media outlet or detail what was inaccurate and misleading. There was no reply at its Beijing headquarters or Shanghai branch when Reuters called for comment outside normal office hours. SAFE's reticence began at least as far back as August, when its Shanghai branch called at least 20 of the major foreign and domestic banks operating in the city to a meeting with the regional heads of several SAFE departments. A representative from an international bank attending the meeting said there were no written instructions, but a high-ranking SAFE official told them explicitly what was expected of them. You must control your forex deficit, but you can't say that SAFE is controlling capital outflows, the official told the bankers. The banks were told to manage sentiment to prevent public panic, the banker said, and the banks' research analysts should not broadcast any negative views on the yuan. They told us not to publish bad house views - analyst house views - on the yuan, the person said. A second banker on the forex team of an international bank said his bank had received the same instructions. Where a bank has exceeded the SAFE-set limits for forex transactions in a month, they have to turn business away, but are unable to explain the real reason why, several bankers complained. We're not going to tell our customers that (our forex business) has stopped; we just have to find ways to turn down the business we're not allowed to do, said a banker at Chinese Commercial Bank Ping An who had received SAFE instructions from seniors. It's not good for client relationships, he added, explaining that he had told his clients to go to other banks. The building of State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) is pictured in Beijing, China, January 11, 2017.Jason LeePing An did not return requests for comment. Penalty Threat In a verbal order to at least two lenders, SAFE said it would vet all cross-border money transfers worth $5 million or more, down from $50 million, banking sources told Reuters in late November. They also told the banks to interview clients to make sure the forex deals were not for fake transactions, or else face punishment, according to two bankers at separate listed banks. In response to those orders, one of the banks sent an internal notice to employees, seen by Reuters, to alert them to SAFE's requirements, explaining that the regulator's penalties could include cancelling business qualifications needed for the lender to conduct forex business. Slideshow (5 Images)The notice passed on SAFE's instructions that staff should not mention the regulator. Please do not reply to clients using wording such as SAFE controls, or SAFE doesn’t allow or strictly controls FX purchases, it read. Instead, they should adhere to the line provided by SAFE, that the purpose of the changes was to promote healthy development of outbound direct investment and crack down on fake deals, the notice added. China's foreign exchange reserves fell to $3.05 trillion in November from $3.3 trillion in the first 11 months of 2016, and many traders are betting there will be further outflows as U.S. interest rates rises make dollar assets more attractive. But SAFE wants banks to advise clients to buy yuan and sell dollars, the international bank representative said, a play that is likely to lose clients money. If a person doesn't have this need, how am I supposed to encourage it? the banker said. At the same time, SAFE is quietly choking programmes designed to open overseas markets to Chinese investors. Even where institutional investors have been granted quotas to invest overseas, they are finding it increasingly difficult to exchange yuan into another currency. SAFE would tell you that you still need to stand in the queue, and the waiting period is 'uncertain', said an executive at Shanghai-based China equity fund house Greenwoods. An investment programme set up so global funds can raise Chinese cash to invest overseas has ground to a halt without explanation. The application process seems to be in a state of suspension, Michael Lu, managing director of Greater China Business Development of Dutch money manager Robeco told reporters in November.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-wells-fargo-accounts-prudential-idUSKBN13Z0KA","Prudential investigating Wells Fargo partnership after scandal","","December 10, 2016 /  3:57 PM / in 8 months","","NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. insurer Prudential Financial (PRU.N) is investigating whether Wells Fargo (WFC.N) employees signed up customers for its life insurance policies without their knowledge, a spokesman said on Saturday. Sales practices at Wells Fargo have been under a spotlight since September when federal regulators ordered the San Francisco-based bank to pay $190 million in fines and restitution because they said its high pressure sales environment pushed employees to open as many as 2 million deposit and credit card accounts without customers' permission. Prudential has a partnership with Wells Fargo to sell a low-cost life insurance policy, known as MyTerm, to the bank's retail customers. Since bankers are not licensed to sell insurance, Wells Fargo employees were meant to direct customers to either self-service kiosks in branches or online to buy the insurance, without getting into specifics about the products.  According to a wrongful termination suit filed in New Jersey state court this week by three former managers in Prudential's corporate investigation division, Wells Fargo employees appear to have signed up bank customers for the Prudential policies without the customers' knowledge or permission. In some cases, policies were opened and closed after a month or two and then reopened, and sometimes monthly fees were withdrawn from the accounts, according to evidence in the lawsuit. Scot Hoffman, a spokesman for Prudential Financial, said the insurer had been monitoring its business with Wells Fargo since last year. A customer survey had shown high lapse rates. The insurer expanded the review of how the product was sold after Wells Fargo was fined in September. We anticipate reviewing this matter with our regulators in due course,” Hoffman said in a statement. The three managers say they were fired in November for trying to escalate their discoveries internally within Prudential. Hoffman said they were fired for, appropriate and legitimate reasons that were entirely unrelated to Prudential’s business with Wells Fargo and Prudential’s decision to examine sales of the MyTerm product. A spokeswoman for Wells said the bank was investigating any alleged misconduct.  As we have consistently reinforced, if we identify any instances where a customer received a product they didn’t ask for, we will make it right, Mary Eshet, a spokeswoman for the bank said in a statement. The lawsuit and the Prudential investigation were first reported by The New York Times. Reporting by Carmel Crimmins, Editing by Franklin Paul"
"https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-fed-repo-idUSL2N0LI1KG20140213","UPDATE 1-New York Fed threatens new rules to stop repo-market fire sales","","February 13, 2014 /  7:55 PM / in 3 years","","By Jonathan Spicer and Dan Burns NEW YORK, Feb 13 (Reuters) - The banks and big funds in a key short-term funding market have not even begun to address the risk of destabilizing fire sales, and the lack of action may force regulators to step in with new rules, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York warned on Thursday. The market for so-called tri-party repurchases, or repos,  is at particular risk of seizing up entirely, as it did in the 2008 financial crisis, if a big player defaults, the New York Fed said. It added investors are highly vulnerable to liquidity pressures and credit losses that could force them to dump collateral in a fire sale. The stern warning from the branch of the U.S. central bank suggested regulators are growing frustrated with the lack of industry action to fix a problem that was at the heart of the financial crisis more than five years ago. The New York Fed, which is tasked with overseeing the Fed's open market operations, said no mechanism currently exists or is being developed by the banks and funds in the tri-party market to ensure that investors will act collectively and in a measured way in liquidating their collateral. As noted by Federal Reserve Bank of New York President (William) Dudley in a recent speech, in the absence of a market-based solution to this risk issue, regulators may be forced to use the tools they have to take steps to reduce this risk, the bank said in a statement. Fire sale risk remains a critical policy concern of the Federal Reserve and other members of the U.S. regulatory community. In repurchase agreements lenders, such as money funds, make short-term loans to banks or other borrowers and receive collateral such as Treasuries or other bonds. Banks then often make similar loans to far more leveraged investors such as hedge funds. A fire sale can happen when a dealer comes under stress and dumps assets in a bid to shore up its liquidity, depressing asset values that hurt other firms then have to sell in an accelerating chain. Worries over a fire sale of collateral against repos at Long Term Capital Management (LTCM) when it almost defaulted in 1998 led to a group of banks having to purchase the fund and then slowly unwind the firm. Then in September 2008, the repo market rapidly dried up when investment bank Lehman Brothers failed. The two clearing banks for tri-party transactions, JP Morgan Chase & Co and Bank of New York Mellon, have adjusted systems in the last two years to reduce the use of intra-day credit, but the New York Fed said little has been done to better manage risk. The regulator made that recommendation two years ago; in October, Dudley said government agencies may need to intervene. While it is unclear what the Fed and other U.S. market regulators could do, the threat of new rules has alarmed members of a European capital markets association, which worries the Americans will adopt an ill-suited solution. Fed Governor Jeremy Stein said in October that regulators have tools they can employ to help shore up liquidity at individual companies such as banks, including risk-based capital, liquidity and leverage requirements. He noted, however, that none are a comprehensive solution to the problem of repo market fire sales."
"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-myanmar-idUSTRE81L03T20120222","Insight: India's Wild East unprepared for new Myanmar","","February 22, 2012 /  1:22 AM / in 5 years","","MOREH, India (Reuters) - As dusk falls on a lonely police station in the eastern tip of India, a young policeman nervously keeps an eye on the Arakan hills above him, dotted with poppy fields. Just 22 bumpy miles from the capital of India's restive Manipur state, he and his colleagues are outnumbered by gunmen from a faction of the National Socialist Council of Nagaland, one of half a dozen insurgent groups operating near India's border with Myanmar. Last year, six policemen were killed a few miles away in an ambush authorities blamed on them. Small groups of men with machetes on their belts can be seen in the winter twilight, openly climbing steep paths through the poppy fields, where valuable seed heads will later be harvested and taken to Myanmar for processing into heroin. There are many poppy fields in the hills here, the policeman said in a hushed voice, refusing to give his name to Reuters for fear of reprisals from the men he said were armed rebels patrolling the fields above his office. Growers will either sell the seed heads to agents or openly in the local market, he said. Opium and insurgency can make for a profitable if exotic business model, but it is not what India had in mind when it launched its Look East policy 20 years ago to link its markets to those of booming Southeast Asia. Now as resource-rich Myanmar emerges from decades of isolation under military rule, India should be a natural partner, with ties stretching back to 3rd Century BC Buddhist emperor Ashoka and, more recently, a shared experience of British colonialism and World War Two. Bridge to Southeast Asia Myanmar is India's only bridge to Southeast Asia, Myo Myint, Myanmar's deputy foreign minister, told Reuters last week at a meeting of Southeast Asian diplomats in New Delhi to look at ways to speed up road, rail and telecoms connections with India. India needs to come forward with assistance. Myanmar sits at Asia's crossroads, sharing a western border with India, and a northern one with China. Thailand is its neighbor to the east and the Malacca Strait is on its southern flank. The country of nearly 60 million people has emerged from a half-century of military rule and is courting the West while trying to wean itself from dependency on China for trade and investment. But despite a recent flurry of high-level visits between the two countries, India appears ill-placed on the ground to exploit Myanmar's opening. Reuters journalists on a recent trip to the Myanmar-India border in Manipur found a region where rebel groups deeply influence politics and business. Opium poppies are grown openly. Cross-border gun-running remains big business. Manipur and the three other Indian states sharing the 1,640- km (1,020-mile) border with Myanmar were supposed to be India's Gateway to the East. Instead, the area has become India's Wild East. Legal trade on the border has dwindled in the last five years to just 0.15 percent of total commerce between Myanmar and India. Checkpoints by security forces and rebel group supporters make the 120 km (75 mile) journey along rutted Highway 102 through the hills from Manipur's capital Imphal to Moreh on the border a painstakingly slow -- and expensive, too, from the taxes they impose on traffic. No Crime Here The sleepy border town of Moreh had dreams of being a major international trading centre, a key station on the ambitious Trans-Asia Railway that will enable containers from East and Southeast Asia to travel overland across India to Europe. But work on the $900 million, 125 km (77 mile) stretch of the railway is already two years behind schedule and has only progressed a short distance. Costs are soaring. At first glance, Moreh seems to be a quiet bazaar of traditional wooden stilt houses, frontier hotels and stores where Myanmarese Buddhist monks and tribespeople in traditional dress and sandal-paste painted faces mingle with traders from across India. The town of 15,000 people has one bank. There is no crime here, acting police chief Akbar Hussein said, chewing on a lump of betel nut at his outdoor desk. There was only one case registered this month, and that was a road accident. Opened in 1995 to great fanfare, the Moreh crossing was supposed to be a major trading post by now. Only some small-scale merchants conduct legal trade. Much of that is on a barter system, exchanging flour and soy products for betel, a mild stimulant popular in India. Despite the police chief's boast, Moreh is a major smuggling centre where outlaws move around freely. Heroin from the Golden Triangle, guns and gem stones go westward; raw opium, tiger bones and rhino horn move east. A refugee from Myanmar surfs the Internet as his wife and their son look on, inside their house at Churachandpur village, south of the northeastern Indian city of Imphal, January 24, 2012. A flurry of high-level official visits shows both countries are keen to get the chemistry right, but at the border area, where smuggling dominates trade, India appears ill prepared for Myanmar's historic opening. Picture taken January 24, 2012. To match Insight MYANMAR-INDIA/Rupak De ChowdhuriSince 1995, nothing substantial has taken place. The border area is like a 17th-century tribal village, said N. Mohindro, an expert on trade in the state. It's all about drugs and guns. People can make money so easily. Some of this business is in the hands of Indian insurgents who run their operations from the Myanmar side of the border. Several of Myanmar's own rebel groups are also based in the area. A U.S. diplomatic cable from 2006 released by Wikileaks described local politicians either in league with the rebels or supporting them for financial reasons. Local residents say security forces are also deeply involved in trafficking but a senior officer of the police intelligence branch in Imphal denies that. The dense forest cover in this open border region is a nightmare for us, the officer said, the officer said of an unfenced 63 mile stretch running from Moreh, adding that the easy availability of weapons inside Myanmar has worsened the situation. Imaginary Road It wasn't always this way. Until the early 1990s, Myanmarese flocked across the border to buy Indian-made consumer goods. But as China's workshops cranked up and offered cheaper, more durable products, the market shifted to the other side of the fence. Slideshow (14 Images)Now, traders from Manipur's capital Imphal endure the serpentine journey along bumpy Highway 102 and its checkpoint shakedowns to visit the Namphalong bazaar on the Myanmar side of the Moreh border gate. Their pick-up trucks are piled high with Chinese mattresses, refrigerators and TVs to sell back in India, returning along the same road that brought Japanese troops in World War Two through then Burma in an attempt to invade India. The trip from the border to Imphal carrying such contraband can involve payoffs along the way amounting to several hundred dollars. Highway 102 was supposed to be part of a road network linking up with Mandalay, Myanmar's main city in the North, and on into Thailand. But the only notable improvement on the Indian side is a short patch running through the Manipur chief minister's home town. People had plans to open eateries, motels and shops along the Asian highway. Now, the trans-national road is imaginary. It does not exist here, said Lunminthang Haokip, a senior state government official for Moreh's Chandel district. The Look East policy is no more than power-point presentations in Delhi. The complaint is voiced often here by residents in Manipur who have suffered decades of rights abuses under draconian emergency powers including shoot-to-kill orders aimed at curtailing the insurgencies. Residents say New Delhi acts like a colonial power, with much of its mistrust of the region stemming from its relative proximity to China. The overwhelming presence of military, paramilitary and police officers contributed to the impression that Imphal was under military occupation, the U.S. embassy cable said. The Indian civil servants were also clearly frustrated with their inability to stem the growing violence and anarchy in the state, feeling their efforts to effectively control the insurgencies was hamstrung by local politicians either in league with or at least through corruption, helping to finance the insurgents. India, which fought a border war in 1962 with China, has watched with mounting concern as Beijing steadily increases its influence around the rim of the Indian Ocean. You can't leave the whole region under an iron curtain just because they look Chinese, said rights activist Babloo Loitongbam, in a restaurant left dark by one of the chronic power cuts in Imphal. You have to constantly prove you are not anti-national. Ten years ago India's foreign minister proposed reopening a World War Two highway to the north of Manipur called the Stilwell Road, which connects India's far eastern region, known as the Northeast, with Myanmar and China. Worried that the road risked strengthening China's influence and the flow of militants and arms to the region, India dragged its feet and Myanmar turned to China's Yunnan Construction Engineering Group instead. India also missed out on the natural gas from two fields in Myanmar it has a stake in, when the government chose to pipe it to China. During long years of self-imposed isolation, Myanmar's only major economic partner was China. India realised in the 1990s that Chinese investment in Myanmar's military and infrastructure was giving Beijing a strategic advantage in a nation that borders five countries, straddles busy Bay of Bengal shipping lanes and has large oil and gas reserves. New Delhi quietly dropped its backing for the opposition party of Nobel peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, who went to school and university in India. Ties have strengthened since then, with President Thein Sein just the latest of Myanmar's leaders to call on New Delhi on a visit to India last year. Rajiv Bhatia, who was India's ambassador to Myanmar until 2005. says India is still more concerned with its South Asian neighbours, including Bangladesh and Pakistan, and could miss the moment. In pure geopolitical terms, Myanmar is hugely important to India. We are now getting a historic opportunity to recover our relationship, he said. But it is still not a priority for our politicians.

Launched last year with one branch and funded by South Sudanese and Kenyan investors, Liberty is one of the latest entrants to one of the most under-banked markets in the world. Devastated by decades of civil war before it broke away from Sudan in 2011, South Sudan, with a population of nearly 12 million, has struggled to build up state institutions and laws since winning independence. The lack of an efficient legal system has not deterred foreign banks from arriving, including Kenya Commercial Bank , Qatar National Bank and a bank funded by Dubai Islamic Bank. South Sudan has a handful of local banks including Liberty, which were established in the run-up to or since independence. They have set up shop in the ramshackle capital Juba, urging people via billboards lining the dusty streets to deposit their money amid a sharp rise in crime in the city as the government struggles to assert control in a country awash with guns after the 1983-2005 civil war. Liberty says it has already attracted $15 million in funding from investors. This week it held meetings with unnamed potential investors from Uganda about broadening its shareholder base as it wants to open 10 branches by 2018, Emmanuel Batali, head of strategic planning told Reuters in a recent interview. There have also been some UK people, a Canadian group and there is also an expression of interest from India, said Batali, a South Sudanese who worked in Canada as a civil servant for many years. The bank plans to have four branches open by the end of this month to serve its 20,000 clients, Batali said. Now we are looking at mobile banking, phone banking, even potential for drive-in banking like in America, he said. Branches will have automatic teller machines. We have the software now. Batali said Liberty was also in talks with banks in Dubai to help channel money flows between the two countries. We are not going to open in Dubai but we are talking to banks in Dubai that can do your business transaction there, he said. Dubai is a main source of imports for South Sudan which has almost no industrial production. Anything from corn flakes, to wheat, juice or cement is shipped from the Gulf to the Kenyan port of Mombasa from where it is trucked for weeks to the landlocked nation. Business prospects have improved since the government agreed in March with Sudan to resume oil exports through the north, bringing in badly needed dollars. The biggest challenge is we are a country that depends on imports. We do not export anything except oil. If oil was not there we would be totally out of everything, Batali said. Banks have also had liquidity problems as a 16-month shutdown of oil production has diminished the supply of dollars available from the central bank, he said. The central bank has not said whether it has resumed pumping dollars to banks after booking oil revenues of around $730 million in September, the first since exports through Sudan resumed in April.

The Outlook is Stable. A full  list of rating actions can be found at the end of this commentary.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - IDRs AND VIABILITY RATING (VR) TSB's IDRs, VR and Stable Outlook reflect its conservative risk appetite which  has resulted in consistently sound asset quality above industry average for the  past decade. At the same time, TSB's simple business model has resulted in a  strong balance sheet structure and sustainable operating performance. TSB's  liquidity, funding and capital positions are good for an institution of its  size. However, the ratings also take into account TSB's small domestic  franchise, geographic concentration and lack of ability to raise capital. TSB's risk appetite has been conservative, reflected in cautious loan book  expansion outside its home region and into new customer segments such as  commercial property and rural lending. Underwriting standards appear tight  despite the bank's above-system growth, and non-household exposures have  remained small. There is some geographic concentration in the loan portfolio -  around one-third was exposed to Taranaki at financial year-end, 31 March 2014  (FYE14) - but it is well diversified by single name exposures. However, Taranaki  is a fairly wealthy region with a below-national unemployment rate, which should  continue to support asset quality. TSB's policy requires it to maintain a liquid balance sheet. TSB holds a  significantly larger liquidity portfolio relative to its domestic peers. Around  44% of total assets accounted for securities held until maturity in the bank's  liquidity portfolio. Credit risk is well managed as a result of strict  underwriting standards as most of these securities are repo-eligible with the  Reserve Bank of New Zealand. The recent debt restructure of Solid Energy - a  state-owned corporation which was unsupported - has resulted in an impairment  charge and a change in the bank's approach to its investments into state-owned  entities. However, single name and industry concentrations are likely to  continue - although these are mostly linked to the large New Zealand-based  banks.  Since early 2000, TSB has consistently achieved solid operating profitability,  considering the bank's community-trust ownership and strong capital ratios.  Healthy balance sheet growth and good margin management have supported revenue  generation. In addition, TSB has strong cost management relative to its peers.  It owns a smaller branch network but operates a centralised customer-service  centre which proportionally generates a large part of the new business.  TSB's capitalisation is adequate for its risks. In FY14, its capital ratios  reduced by 65 basis points, reflecting the purchase of a stake in FisherFunds.  Future revenue generation through this investment is expected to offset the  recent decline in TSB's regulatory capital ratios. However, TSB's ownership  status limits the bank's access to fresh capital if needed. TSB's funding and liquidity position is strong relative to its peers, and the  agency does not expect this to change in the medium-term. Its entire loan book  has always been funded by customer deposits. About 50% of these deposits have  been sourced in its home market. A modest increase in wholesale funding may be  viewed positively as it could contribute to diversification, especially if TSB  maintains a liquid balance sheet.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - IDRs AND VR TSB's IDRs and VR are sensitive to a change in the bank's risk appetite. An  increased risk profile, reflected in weaker underwriting standards and/ or risk  controls, or a substantial increase in asset growth could lead to deterioration  in asset quality, operating performance and capitalisation which could result in  negative rating actions. Positive rating momentum would require significant  improvements in the bank's franchise while maintaining its current business  model and risk appetite which is unlikely in the short- to medium-term. KEY RATING DRIVERS AND RATING SENSITVITIES - SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING  FLOOR TSB's Support Rating of '5' and Support Rating Floor of 'No Floor' reflect  Fitch's view that while support from the authorities is possible, it cannot be  relied upon. The Support Rating and Support Rating Floor also take into account  the existence of a legal framework, the Open Bank Resolution Scheme (OBR), which  reflects a reduced propensity of the New Zealand sovereign to support its banks.  The OBR allows for the imposition of losses on holders of senior debt to make up  capital shortfalls if a deposit-taking institution has failed. Support Ratings  are sensitive to any change in assumptions around the propensity or ability of  the New Zealand sovereign to provide timely support to the bank.

Under central bank rules announced late on Wednesday, foreign banks which convert their local operations from a branch structure to being subsidiaries will be treated on nearly equal terms with local lenders. This could open the way to them opening more outlets across India and could also allow them to buy local private sector banks - potentially a major lure as banks seek to tap into the fast-growing Indian economy. The rules are aimed at giving India greater regulatory power over foreign banks in the wake of the global financial crisis. Yet foreign banks would also face a bigger regulatory burden in the subsidiary setup, including having to earmark 40 percent of their lending to the priority sector, which includes underserved parts of the economy and agriculture. That's a requirement that domestic banks must already meet and is being phased in for foreign banks with 20 or more branches. As a subsidiary, a foreign bank would also need approval to tap its parent's balance sheet, something it doesn't need under existing rules. The new rules come as global financial firms have been paring back their investment in non-core markets. The environment has changed, both in India and overseas. Only a handful of banks who have retail banking ambitions will consider it, said a senior banker with a large U.S. bank,  declining to be named given the sensitivity of the matter. The 43 foreign banks in India account for less than half a percent of the country's 92,114 banking outlets. Under exiting rules, foreign banks can open up to just 12 branches between them per year in India. Citigroup, HSBC and Standard Chartered  are the biggest and operate as branches, not subsidiaries. They along with Singapore-based DBS Group Holdings Ltd, which has 12 branches, are widely seen as the likeliest to consider switching to subsidiaries. If you look at Citi, StanC or HSBC, they have an embedded India strategy, so it makes a lot of sense for them to convert because they are getting near-national treatment, said Abizer Diwaji, national leader for financial services at EY India. The flip side is that they will have to commit (more) capital in India. Achievable Target DBS India CEO Sanjiv Bhasin said the bank was evaluating the RBI guidelines. If you read it, it looks intimidating, but the fact is you have been given five years, Bhasin said, referring to the priority sector lending target. It's difficult but it's certainly achievable. Citigroup and HSBC declined comment. StanChart welcomed the guidelines but said it was too early to comment in detail. In recent years, Barclays has exited retail banking in India and Royal Bank of Scotland has sold its Indian credit cards, mortgage and commercial banking portfolios, part of a broader trend by global banks looking to shore up their capital base to meet regulatory requirements. Most of the foreign banks in India have moved away from retail banking and are now focusing on corporate banking, said the India operations head of a European bank who declined to be named. Under the new rules for wholly-owned subsidiaries, foreign banks can buy a local private-sector lender after a central bank review of overall foreign bank penetration. To prevent foreign domination of the banking sector, the central bank will restrict further entry of new wholly owned subsidiaries of foreign banks if the assets of institutions owned abroad exceed 20 percent of the country's total. Currently, foreign banks' capital, reserves and surplus account for 15 percent of the overall banking sector, even though foreign banks have less than 5 percent of industry deposits, leaving little room for big acquisitions. India's banking system is dominated by state banks, which accounted for more than two-thirds of industry assets at the end of March 2012, the latest RBI data showed. Foreign banks operating in India before August 2010 have the option of continuing as branches. However, they will be incentivised to convert into WOS (wholly owned subsidiaries) because of the attractiveness of the near-national treatment afforded to WOS, the central bank said."

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-uslabor-afscme-idUSBRE85H05E20120618","New union chief to face war over benefits","","June 18, 2012 /  4:11 AM / 5 years ago","","WASHINGTON/CHICAGO (Reuters) - When the largest national union for public-sector employees elects its first new president in a generation, it will be a watershed moment. The new chief will be running an organization whose members are fighting almost unprecedented cuts in jobs, benefits, bargaining rights - and increasingly angry taxpayers who question the size of their pension and healthcare benefits. With many states, cities and counties struggling to balance their budgets and facing big pension and health care funding deficits, employee costs are the obvious target. Underlining its problems, the labor movement was defeated in a recall election in the state of Wisconsin earlier this month when voters sided with Republican Governor Scott Walker, who had taken bold moves to limit union collective bargaining powers. The struggle is evident even a few blocks from the site where more than 3,500 delegates of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) delegates is due to meet in downtown Los Angeles this week. Last Friday, the Los Angeles Superior Court announced that it was laying off 157 workers and cutting the salaries of another 250. And earlier in June, voters in the second- and third-largest California cities after LA, San Diego and San Jose, supported imposing curbs on the pensions of city government workers. Delegates, who are gathering at the Los Angeles Convention Center, are due to vote on June 21 for a successor for outgoing President Gerald McEntee who is due to speak later Monday in opening remarks. The new president will not only have to help the union's 1.6 million members battle to protect their jobs and standards of living but also try to convince a skeptical public - many of whom have seen their own benefits under siege in the financial crisis and its aftermath -- that calls for reduced benefits for public sector workers are undeserved. The public perception is that public employees are overpaid, that the public sector itself is overstaffed and that the only victims here are the taxpayers, said Marick Masters, a labor historian at Wayne State University in Detroit. Labor experts say the contest between Lee Saunders, who is currently secretary-treasury, and Danny Donohue, who is head of the union's New York branch, could be critical as the union decides on how it is going to adapt to an increasingly hostile environment. The current president, McEntee who backs Saunders and with whom he co-authored a book on how the American dream of equal opportunities is fading away for a middle class hit by the financial crisis, is stepping down after 30 years - 30 years in which union membership has become less popular in the United States, especially in the private sector. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistic the percent of workers who were members of a union in 2011 was 11.8 percent, dramatically down from 20.1 percent in 1983, the first year for which comparable data are available. At the same time there are fewer public workers - down to a total of 20.4 million in 2011 from 21.3 million in 2008. I think (the election) is tremendously important, said Gary Chaison, professor of industrial relations at Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts. Chaison said the outcome would affect AFSCME, public sector unions and ultimately the entire labor movement. The contest could be close. Saunders beat Donohue only narrowly to get his current position in a 2010 election. Saunders, who was not immediately available to comment for this story, is stressing the need for the union to grow. He plans to work with both political parties, aims to make local chapters stronger, and leverage new technologies. We've got to continue to grow our union in order to build power within our union, he says in a campaign video. Saunders would be the union's first African-American president. Donohue is casting himself as the outsider and reformer who will take AFSCME out of the cocktail circuit in Washington, D.C., and back to its grass roots of organizing and mobilizing. He has also been more willing to work with Republican leaders in local authorities. We've become checkbook unionists. We can give checks to people, we can contribute to politicians, he said in an interview. We can win the White House and end up losing our members. Reports that the union will spend upward of $100 million to help President Barack Obama win re-election are not officially confirmed. AFSCME has pledged to significantly invest into the next election cycle spokesman Chris Fleming told Reuters, adding that two thirds of any spending will go to state and local campaigns. The right-wing National Institute for Labor Relations Research said that AFSCME spent $66.5 million on 2010 political campaigns. Donohue said that the union has been too focused on national politics to the detriment of local and state contests. He supports Obama, because the alternatives are nightmarish, but he believes in building relationships with state legislators, governors and city leaders of either party. Recently, Donohue suspended the local union's endorsement of Andrew Cuomo, when the Democratic New York governor made pensions less generous. On the national level, the Republican party is not friendly to labor. On the local level you have to look at everyone, he said. Not Mortally Wounded, but a Prime Scapegoat The Wisconsin defeat and the San Jose and San Diego voter outcome were seen as major setbacks to the labor movement, but in particular it was seen as a big blow to the public sector unions such as AFSCME. While private sector unions were bleeding members in their traditional base in the U.S. manufacturing sector over the past 40 years, the local government-focused unions were relatively unscathed. But the financial crisis, the housing downturn and the 2007-09 recession combined to create a revenue collapse for almost all U.S. states and local governments. States have saved money by cutting staff and providing less funding to cities and counties, which, in turn are laying off thousands of teachers and other workers. From May 2011 to May 2012, the private sector gained 1.9 million non-farm jobs, U.S. labor department data shows. Over that same year, state governments shed 14,000 jobs and other local governments 97,000 jobs. Also, after years of short-changing retirement systems, many states and cities are short billions of dollars to cover future benefits. Adding insult to injury, the stock market declines triggered by the financial crisis devastated the investments used to provide the bulk of the funds' revenues. Estimates put the national gap at anywhere between $660 billion and $3 trillion, depending on how investment targets and liabilities are measured. Taxpayers are worried that dwindling dollars will be pulled from vital state services to pay for pensions seen by some as too rich when compared to the private sector's retirement accounts. Both candidates pledge to protect pensions. AFSCME, whose origins date back to 1932 when a group of Wisconsin state professionals gathered together in defense of civil services, says that its average member earns less than $45,000 per year and receives a pension benefit of approximately $19,000 a year after retirement. In the election, McEntee has come under attack for using private jets, with Donohue saying he would end the practice as president, following the protocol of most other unions that require officers to fly commercial. He has also said he would cut the president's salary, which is near $400,000, by $100,000. Are they mortally wounded? I don't think so. Not yet. But there is a growing awareness across the country of this issue. Wisconsin was the first engagement in the war, said Mark Mix, president of the National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation and the National Right to Work Committee, which aim to eliminate coercive union power and compulsory unionism. Now, he said, political leaders, even Democrats who have traditionally enjoyed organized labor's support, will be able to say to the unions, 'Hey you guys have to cut me some slack on some things. If you don't give me some slack, I'm going to start to push. Where else are you going to go?' Masters, labor historian, said that to a large extent the unions are being blamed for doing a good job for their members. Public employee unions have worked very hard to make government a model employer, he said. They have pushed to make them professional, service oriented, well trained, well-educated and well-compensated for the jobs they do, he added. Today, public employees are a prime scapegoat for the ails affecting government. (Reporting by Lisa Lambert in Washington and James B. Kelleher in Chicago.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-prisoners-idUSBRE85J0I920120620","Special Report: In the new Myanmar, the gulag endures","","June 20, 2012 /  11:00 AM / in 5 years","","YANGON (Reuters) - When hundreds of political prisoners were released from Myanmar's jails in January, supporters greeted them in jubilant scenes. But for Myo Min, a 36-year-old electrical repairman and dissident, the reunion with his wife and children after three years in jail was muted. That's because in 2008, after five days of near-continuous torture - with police beating him so savagely their truncheons broke - Myo Min says he provided testimony that put an innocent man behind bars for life. That fellow dissident is still in prison. They gave me a document and I signed it, he told Reuters. I just couldn't stand the beatings anymore. The document doomed veteran democrat Myint Aye, 61. He is one of 471 political prisoners - including 16 women and 50 Buddhist monks - who remain in jail in appalling conditions, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners Burma, a monitoring group run by Burmese exiles in Thailand. Their plight, Myanmar's dissidents say, belies the progressive policies of the country's quasi-civilian government, which embarked on reforms after taking office in March 2011. Reformist President Thein Sein has relaxed media censorship, started peace talks with ethnic rebels, and held by-elections that put democracy champion Aung San Suu Kyi into Myanmar's parliament. Most dramatically, perhaps, more than 650 political prisoners were freed between May 2011 and January 2012, according to Amnesty International. Among those released were celebrated dissidents such as Min Ko Naing and U Gambira, jailed for their role in a 2007 democracy protest led by Buddhist monks. These reprieves, and the April by-elections that Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy won by a landslide, helped convince the United States and Europe to suspend economic sanctions against Myanmar earlier this year. But a Reuters examination shows that Myint Aye and other political prisoners continue to suffer incarceration and abuse in an era of uncertain reform. Their stories hold dangerous implications for Myanmar's future. The military junta that ruled the country for nearly 50 years is gone. But it is survived by a formidable apparatus of oppression: corrupt judges, horrific prison conditions, draconian laws still on the books, and police and soldiers who torture with impunity. Until it is dismantled, democracy activists here say, nobody is safe from arbitrary arrest, torture and wrongful imprisonment. As Myanmar's long moribund economy opens up, there are signs that repressive system once used to silence political opponents is being retooled for a new era - to sweep away opposition to breakneck economic development. The Thailand-based AAPPB prisoner-monitoring group reports an increase in people being interrogated and jailed for resisting land confiscations and forced evictions, often by the military or businesses with close government connections. Government officials in Myanmar declined to comment for this article. More Releases? A fresh round of releases could begin in late June, after Suu Kyi's landmark trip to Europe, predicts Zarganar, an actor and democracy activist who was once imprisoned himself. Any releases will happen slowly, he cautions, with government officials still reluctant to admit political prisoners even exist. They call them criminal cases, Zarganar says. I tell them, 'Water is still water, whatever you call it. Please release them. That's all.' Some were jailed after Myanmar's last spasm of repression in 2007, when police and soldiers crushed the monk-led Saffron Revolution. Others were arrested on what Amnesty International says were trumped-up charges of terrorism and convicted in secret courts on flimsy evidence or confessions extracted under torture. The exact number of political prisoners remaining today is unknown. A list Zarganar submitted to the president's office in May contains 345 names. AAPPB records 471, and says it is investigating another 466 cases. The confusion is a measure of the secrecy of Myanmar's gulag. One political prisoner is one too many, said U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton during her historic visit to Myanmar last year. Asked whether the continued jailing and abuse of dissidents suggests the U.S. eased sanctions too soon, Yangon embassy spokesman Michael Quinlan referred to remarks in April by a senior State Department official, who said Washington's policy is to blend both pressure and engagement. The U.S. continues to press for the release of at least several hundred prisoners of conscience, Quinlan added. In almost every meeting we have with the Burmese government, we engage on the issue of political prisoners. Suu Kyi, in accepting the Nobel Peace Prize she won in 1991, said last week the release of famed detainees runs the risk that unknown ones will be forgotten. Please remember them, she said, and do whatever is possible to effect their earliest, unconditional release. Life in the Gulag Abuses continue under the government that took office in March 2011. Even now, dissidents are deliberately kept in jails far from their homes, says Bo Kyi, the AAPPB's joint-secretary. The idea is to punish not just the prisoners but also their families, he says. It's a type of psychological torture. Distant prisons also hamper information-gathering by human-rights groups and make it harder for families to deliver potentially life-saving medicines and food. In October 2011, 15 dissidents were confined to cells normally used for prison dogs after staging a hunger strike in Yangon's colonial-era Insein Prison, Tomás Ojea Quintana, the United Nations special rapporteur on human rights in Myanmar, reported in March. The AAPPB has recorded the deaths of 152 detainees since 1998 due to torture and ill-treatment. Two have died during President Thein Sein's administration, said the Network for Human Rights Documentation Burma (ND-Burma), an advocacy group based in Chiang Mai, Thailand. The first, Zaw Lin Htun, got a 20-year sentence in 2003 for trying to re-establish a banned student union. He died within weeks of his release last October due to untreated diseases and being held in sub-human prison conditions that amount to torture, ND-Burma reported. He was 38. The second, Thet Nwe, a National League for Democracy member serving a 38-year sentence, had no teeth when he was freed from Insein Prison in January 2012. They had been knocked out during a decade of abuse that his family said had shattered him mentally and physically. He died nine days later, aged 54. Dozens of gravely ill prisoners remain in custody. Among them is a Yangon engineer named Phyo Wai Aung. He was arrested in 2010 for his alleged role in a series of deadly Yangon bombings, tortured into confessing, then tried in a closed court inside Insein Prison, Amnesty International says. The abuse persisted despite Myanmar's transition from military junta to fledgling democracy, his brother Htet says. In February 2011, Phyo Wai Aung was put in Insein's dog cells - kennels built during British colonial times to house guard dogs. The cells were covered in white lice and smelt like a sewer, a former detainee told Amnesty. Phyo Wai Aung was there for a month. His health deteriorating, he spent time in the prison medical ward before being moved recently to a local hospital, where he remains under guard. He was recently diagnosed with liver cancer, his brother says. Last month, he was sentenced to death in the bombings. The government hasn't responded to pleas for clemency. I have sent so many letters to the president's office. They have all been ignored, Htet says. Family members wave as political prisoners are released at Pa-an prison in Pa-an in this January 13, 2012 file photo. A mass amnesty in January saw the release of Myanmar's most famous political prisoners, but about 400 more remain in jails across the country.Soe Zeya Tun/FilesUseful Laws & Judges The task of dismantling the gulag would have to start with reforming draconian laws and the judges who administer them. Aung Thein, 66, was once a lawyer. In 2008, after representing more than 300 political prisoners, his license was revoked by a high court in Naypyitaw, the capital of Myanmar. Other lawyers who defended perceived enemies of the regime have suffered similar revocations, as well as police intimidation, monitoring and sometimes jail themselves, according to the UN. Aung Thein has had a client list that reads like a Who's Who of Myanmar's democrats, including Suu Kyi herself. The framed dissident Myint Aye, also a client, was the victim of a common tactic in Myanmar's courts, says Aung Thein. His life sentence was extended by eight years with help from British colonial-era laws such as the Unlawful Association Act, which dates back to 1908 and can add three to five years to a sentence. A more recent law was passed by the junta to check the influence of the Internet in long-isolated Myanmar. Under the 2004 Electronic Transactions Act, sending a single email deemed detrimental to state security can carry a 15-year jail sentence. Ko Ko Gyi, a famous political prisoner released in January, was sentenced to 65 years after the 2007 Saffron Revolution. Sixty of those years consisted of four 15-year sentences under the Electronic Transaction Act. Most senior judges are notorious fellows, because they only follow government orders, Aung Thein says. Waiting for Myint Aye The imprisonment of Myint Aye is particularly sensitive, human-rights groups say, because he was arrested on the orders of the man who at the time was Myanmar's police chief - and is now a member of President Thein Sein's reformist cabinet. Myint Aye's story begins at his home in northwest Yangon, a wooden bungalow with rusting tin walls which has long been watched by Special Branch police. They might be in the teashop at the end of the street, says his wife, Lae Lae Win. You can never tell. Slideshow (13 Images)Lae Lae Win, 52, has spent much of her married life waiting for her husband. As a physics student in the 1970s, Myint Aye spent four years in jail for his part in anti-government protests. Later, when he headed a local chapter of her National League for Democracy, Suu Kyi spoke from the steps of his home. Its interior walls are decorated with portraits of the Nobel Peace Prize laureate. Myint Aye was arrested so many times that Lae Lae Win kept a travel bag with his clothes by the door. Each arrest was followed by up to 18 months in custody. We never knew where he was taken, she says. Even in his absence, Special Branch agents monitored the house. I used to tease my husband, 'They look after me better than you do.' Myint Aye was arrested for the ninth time in August 2008 for his alleged role in the bombing of an office belonging to a junta-backed political organization the previous month. Repairman Myo Min, a father of four who helped out at NLD events, was arrested two days earlier with two others in connection with the same incident. The abuse began immediately, Myo Min says. Police handcuffed him behind his back, tied a rope around the cuffs and suspended him from the ceiling. This position can dislocate the shoulders of a heavier man, but Myo Min, a bookish-looking 34-year-old, has a slight build. The pain was excruciating nevertheless. Police beat the soles of his feet and burned his penis with a cigarette lighter, he says. I felt like I was going mad, he says. Such tortures are routinely heaped upon political prisoners, the AAPPB says. It has recorded a range of methods: beatings, stress positions, mock executions, sleep deprivation, solitary confinement, and the iron road - rolling a metal rod across the shins until the skin peels off. Myo Min says he was given no water or food for five days and survived by drinking from a filthy latrine. Battered and sleep-deprived, he signed a police-drafted confession that he had received bomb training from Myint Aye. Then it was Myint Aye's turn. He confessed to planning the 2008 bombing after enduring strenuous interrogation and was forced to watch his colleagues be tortured, the U.S. State Department said in a 2011 report. The idea of Myint Aye planting a bomb made no sense to those who knew him. He is a very simple and honest man, Zarganar says. But the government didn't like him because he promoted human rights. Myint Aye's predicament was made worse by the pressure put on his attorneys. One of his lawyers spent four months in prison for contempt of court. Another fled to Thailand to avoid a similar sentence. Charging dissidents such as Myint Aye with criminal offenses allows the Myanmar government to deny it holds any political prisoners, says the State Department. Despite government assertions, it noted in the report, a vast majority of these prisoners were not believed to have engaged in any violence. Student Warriors In Myint Aye's case, there was a more likely suspect. An anti-government group called the Vigorous Burmese Student Warriors claimed responsibility for the 2008 bombing in an email reported by Mizzima, a news agency run by Burmese exiles. While this claim was hard to confirm, the Student Warriors had a proven reputation for violence. In 1999 its members stormed the Myanmar Embassy in Bangkok and held 89 people at gunpoint for more than 24 hours. The hostages included Burmese diplomats and foreign tourists; they were released unharmed after the Thai authorities granted the gunmen safe passage to the Myanmar border. Less than four months later, the Student Warriors and another armed group called God's Army seized a hospital in the Thai city of Ratchaburi. This time, they were shot dead by Thai commandos. The Student Warriors' possible role in the 2008 bombing was apparently ignored. Brigadier General Khin Yi, Myanmar's police chief at the time, held a pre-trial press conference to announce that Myint Aye had confessed to offering cash awards for terrorist acts, reported the New Light of Myanmar, a state-run newspaper. Khin Yi is now the immigration minister in the reformist government. His office didn't respond to questions about the Myint Aye case. Myint Aye and Myo Min were tried in closed courts along with two other co-accused. I told the judge that I'd been tortured into signing a confession, but he didn't listen, says Myo Min. They didn't even do a medical. A doctor would have found the bruises left by his interrogators, he says. Myo Min was sentenced to eight years in prison. He served most of it in a jail in northwest Myanmar, a location so remote his wife and children couldn't visit him. Myint Aye got 28 years. He was transferred to Loikaw Prison, a 24-hour car journey from Yangon in eastern Myanmar. Lae Lae Win visits him once every three months. They are allowed only 20 minutes together. She is now preparing for her next trip. I always hope he'll be released tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow, Lae Lae Win says. Until then, she will speak to her husband through a metal grille about the life he is missing - their son, for instance, will soon graduate as a civil engineer. A prison officer always sits silently nearby, she says, recording their conversation in his notebook.

U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein in Manhattan said the release was proper because departing Defense Secretary Ash Carter failed to show why publishing the photos would endanger Americans deployed outside the United States. Hellerstein's decision is a victory for the American Civil Liberties Union and other civil and veterans rights groups whose lawsuit seeking the photos under the federal Freedom of Information Act began in 2004. Photos depicting abuse at Abu Ghraib began to emerge in 2004, with some detainees claiming to have endured physical and sexual abuse, electric shocks and mock executions. The number of photos sought in the lawsuit has not been disclosed but has been estimated at roughly 2,000, according to the Congressional Record and court papers. Those photos, representing a sad episode in our history, are a matter of great public interest and historical importance, which should not, in a democracy like ours, be shielded from public view, said Lawrence Lustberg, a lawyer for the plaintiffs. The court has wisely reaffirmed our nation's commitment to open government. A spokesman for U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in Manhattan, whose office defended Carter's decision, declined to comment. After Hellerstein in March 2015 ordered the release of additional photos, Carter allowed the release of 198 but kept the remainder under wraps, citing a review of a representative sample by four high-ranking generals. In Wednesday's decision, Hellerstein said the U.S. troop presence in Iraq had fallen to about 5,000 from more than 100,000 at the start of the Obama administration, and that those remaining now serve as advisers rather than in combat. The judge said that while risks remained, including that portions of Iraq had been overrun by the Islamic State, he could not blindly accept withholding the remaining photos. I take seriously the level of deference owed to the executive branch in the realm of national security decision making, he wrote. My complaint is that the executive has failed to articulate the reasons supporting its conclusion that release of the photos would endanger Americans deployed abroad. Hellerstein first ordered the release of photos in 2005, but Congress later authorized withholding photos whose release could endanger Americans. The case is American Civil Liberties Union et al v.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/bc-finreg-women-harsher-discipline-idUSKBN16S29W","Women in U.S. finance face harsher misconduct discipline than men, 'bad broker' research team finds","","March 21, 2017 /  6:00 PM / 4 months ago","","NEW YORK (Thomson Reuters Regulatory Intelligence) - Women involved in securities-industry disciplinary actions are significantly more likely to be fired than their male counterparts, according to a study released March 13 by the research team that last year drew wide attention to “bad brokers” who remain in the securities industry after being fired for misconduct. Women charged with misconduct face more dire consequences than men even though they are three times less likely to be cited for misbehavior on the job. One in 11 men in the finance industry have been cited, compared with one in 33 women.  The gender gap shows up even when brokers are shown the door by their employers. Severance packages are substantially higher of men than women. The study by researchers from Stanford, the University of Chicago and the University of Minnesota found that female advisers are 20 percent more likely to lose their jobs and 30 percent less likely to land new jobs than male advisers. The study was published by the Stigler Center for the Study of the Economy and the State at the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business When Harry Fired Sally The study, titled “When Harry Fired Sally: The Double Standard in Punishing Misconduct” comes just a year after the same team of researchers released a widely-cited study showing many brokers and some firms have a marked tendency to hire such advisers. The team’s prior study became an issue during Congressional hearings into finance industry practices that led to calls for enhanced regulatory oversight by securities agencies. The new study lends support to earlier research findings on the difficulties women face in the financial services industry, where they make up a relatively small percentage of wealth managers and even fewer positions in top management. The low representation of women in finance has persisted in the industry even as women have surpassed men as the largest owners of investment assets, owing to their increased presence in the workplace and longer average life spans. “Although both female and male advisers are disciplined for misconduct, female advisers are punished more severely,” the study concluded,. “Following an incidence of misconduct, female advisers are 20 percent more likely to lose their jobs and 30 percent less likely to find new jobs relative to male advisers.” Evidence Suggests Differences  The study adds that “evidence suggests that the observed behavior is not driven by productivity differences across advisers.” Women are punished more often and rehired less at firms regardless of financial performance, especially at firms or branches that have higher numbers of men as executives and owners.  The findings suggest that the favoritism, instead, is “taste-based discrimination.” Men appear to prefer hiring other men. They also are more likely to blame women for problems, since “disproportionate share of misconduct complaints is initiated by the firm, instead of customers or regulators. Wells Fargo Surfaces Again The study, which breaks down reports into individual firms, singled out Wells Fargo as one of the major firms that fires 25 percent more female employees than male ones with similar work profiles. For a firm still trying to recover from allegations of an incentive program that spawned bad behavior in the opening of millions of falsified account openings at branch banks, the study pointed to another area of concern. Reuters Regulatory Intelligence was unable to immediately reach the firm for contact. But Wells told Fortune (here), that “We will continue to focus on providing a diverse and inclusive work environment where all of our team members can thrive.” Discrimination With Little Attention The researchers said that while gender inequality is often studied in the context of hiring discrimination and salary, there has been little academic research on the topic of firing and discipline imbalances. It said the brokerage industry offered a “unique” chance to study the phenomenon because of the availability of public information on work force management. Gender differences in punishment speak to the broader idea that female employees have less leniency for missteps than their male counterparts, the researchers said. “This aspect of discrimination has received little attention in academia or in policy. One possible reason is that such discrimination is less likely to draw attention than the wage gap.”  The study was done by Mark Egan of University of Minnesota, Gregor Matvos of the University of Chicago and Amit Seru of Sanford. Their study drew upon similar data to the bad broker problem last year. The study covered reports from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority data on disciplinary actions, and used GenderChecker software to correlate the data with based on gender, which the FINRA data does not break out. The sampling includes the 1.2 million people registered through FINRA covering the 10-year period ended in 2015. The researchers cited data showing that three-quarters of brokers are male. - Study by researchers from Stanford, the University of Chicago and the University of Minnesota: www.chicagobooth.edu/~/media/B76C81EFE39B4EDB9A4B4D8B34D0B0F7.pdf (Richard Satran is a financial journalist covering daily and emerging issues for Thomson Reuters Regulatory Intelligence.)

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed-breakingviews-idUSKBN15P2JA","Daniel Tarullo gives banks generous parting gift","","February 10, 2017 /  7:56 PM / 6 months ago","","WASHINGTON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Daniel Tarullo is giving banks a generous parting gift. The tough Federal Reserve governor told President Donald Trump on Friday that he is resigning five years before his term expires in 2022. Tarullo was the most influential architect of post-crisis financial reform, including the stress tests. His exit may be one of the biggest determinants of how banks are overseen. Since his appointment by Barack Obama in 2009, Tarullo has been a regulatory force. Although he did not hold the title of vice chairman of bank supervision, it was a role he essentially served. Critical of what he saw as the central bank's lax approach to watching over financial institutions, Tarullo worked to centralize control in Washington, diminishing the role of the Fed's New York branch. He pushed for tougher capital rules than international Basel standards require, often describing the Fed's version as super-equivalent. In 2014, for example, the Fed approved a 6 percent supplementary leverage ratio, twice as stringent as the global criteria, for the insured deposit units of the largest banks. Wall Street chieftains routinely balked at the annual stress tests, complaining they are too opaque and arbitrary. Citigroup, Deutsche Bank and others were tripped up by the so-called qualitative part of the exams, which measure operational risk and other subjective factors. Failing means banks can't pay additional dividends or buy back more shares, putting extra pressure on management. Last year, Tarullo announced proposals that could make the tests even tougher, including adding what he called a stress capital buffer. Unlike a softening of the Dodd-Frank law, which Trump and many Republicans advocate, most changes to the stress tests don't need congressional approval. The central bank's staff, which has been led by Tarullo, devises the scenarios and assesses the results. The Fed also has leeway on how strongly to enforce other rules or guidance, such as restrictions on leveraged lending. In all probability, Tarullo's power would have been weakened by the addition of a new vice chair of supervision. By deciding not to stick around, though, he has left another big opening for Trump to fill. Whoever succeeds Tarullo will be in a better position to roll back regulation than any attempt to reform Dodd-Frank.BreakingviewsReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

Markit's final services index rose to a 15-month high of 55.6 from 54.4 in February, helped by new business in the post and telecommunication sector and the renting, business activities and financial intermediation branch. Markit's final composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), which tracks the activity in manufacturing and services that together account for more than two-thirds of the economy, rose to 57.1 from 56.1 in February to reach a 70-month high. Markit's final PMI for manufacturing on Monday showed growth had accelerated at the strongest rate in nearly six years in March. It suggested manufacturing would contribute to overall growth in the first quarter. Wednesday's results similarly suggest services, which are not historically a German strength, would also contribute to growth. Services providers recorded the strongest expansion in new work since February 2016. It was the second straight monthly acceleration after three months of slowing growth. The final services PMI data for March completed a picture of strengthening economic growth in Germany in the opening quarter of 2017, Markit economist Trevor Balchin said. He added that the data reinforced Markit's full-year growth forecast of 1.9 percent this year for Europe's largest economy. Services companies faced higher input costs linked to salaries and fuel prices. Input inflation rose for the sixth time in seven months, reaching a five-year high, which led to the biggest increases in the price of services since July 2008. Despite inflation pressures, service providers were most optimistic about their 12-month business outlook in six years. Their optimism was reflected in increased hiring.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/turkey-gold-banks-idUSL6E8HP9R220120704","Turkey's gold fever finds new focus in banks","","July 4, 2012 /  2:01 PM / 5 years ago","","* Central bank allows use of gold in reserves * Commercial banks develop deposits to obtain gold * Such deposits rocket fourfold in past year * Jewellers' traditional business model pressured * Helps authorities to mobilise domestic savings By Seda Sezer and Behiye Taner ISTANBUL, July 4 (Reuters) - For centuries, Turks have flocked to the jewellery shops of Istanbul's labyrinthine Grand Bazaar to trade their gold - ornaments handed down through their families over generations, or bars stashed under mattresses as savings. But in recent months the shops have a new and unexpected competitor: banks. The country's commercial banks are pouring their technical expertise and marketing resources into offering their customers gold deposit accounts. Customers hand their gold to a bank and can make withdrawals from their accounts in gold bars or the lira currency; the accounts offer interest rates that are substantially lower than those on normal time deposits. Gold deposit accounts have been growing around the world, but Turkey's boom has made it a leader in the trend. This appears to have cut the amount of gold flowing to jewellers in the Grand Bazaar and elsewhere in the country, a trend which dismays the shop owners. In the long run, it could threaten their business model, which relies partly on turning scrap gold they buy into jewellery and selling it back to retail customers. Where is the emotion when you go to the bank?...This trade should not be seen only as gold or money, it is an emotion, a life, said 60-year old jeweller Turgay Ayardem, who has been working at the bazaar for 45 years. The head of the Istanbul Chamber of Jewellery, Alaattin Kameroglu, said: People will make losses because of the banks. They will become less interested in jewellery, and the sector will be hit. We as the jewellery sector are also banks' customers, we use their point-of-sale machines, credit cards and loans. We plan to take action against banks which have forgotten about doing banking and started collecting gold, he added without elaborating. Big Business Gold is big business in Turkey, for cultural reasons and also because of the country's experience with bouts of high inflation over the past century. The metal is traditionally given as a gift at weddings and circumcision ceremonies, and demand for imports tends to surge during the summer months. Turks are believed to have accumulated about 5,000 tonnes of gold in their homes, worth around $250 billion at current international prices, according to the World Gold Council, an industry lobby. It ranks Turkey's gold demand as fifth in the world for jewellery and eighth for retail investment, mostly behind countries with much bigger populations such as India, China and the United States. Turkey's economic boom has kept imports high despite the weakness of the lira over the past 18 months. Gold imports in the first five months of 2012 totalled 35.18 tonnes, compared with 79.70 in all of 2011 and 42.49 in 2010. Meanwhile, Turkey produced 25 tonnes of gold last year, up from 16.4 in 2010. With so much money at stake, it was perhaps inevitable that other institutions would muscle into Turkish jewellers' business. The catalyst was Turkey's central bank, which has been trying to cool breakneck growth in commercial bank lending without interest rate hikes that could hurt exports by appreciating the currency. It has pursued this goal by adjusting reserve requirements, the proportion of deposits that commercial banks must hold at the central bank instead of lending out. In September 2011 the central bank increased the ratio of lira reserves that could be held in the form of gold from zero to 10 percent, raising it further to 20 percent in March 2012 and 25 percent last month. This had the effect of drastically increasing banks' appetite for gold. They responded by promoting gold deposit accounts. Early entrants into the business included Denizbank and Islamic lenders Kuveyt Turk and Bank Asya ; others are preparing to step in. We collected 650 kilograms of gold in the last month and attracted 3,200 new customers with DenizGold Days, said Cem Turgut Gelgor, Denizbank's executive responsible for gold banking. One of Turkey's largest banks, Isbank, plans to collect $1 billion of gold or around 18-20 tonnes in its deposit accounts by the end of this year, deputy chief executive officer Erdal Aral told Reuters. Bensu Ozgan, a 43-year-old retired textile sector worker who was visiting a Denizbank branch, said she previously stored her gold holdings in a safe at a bank, but would now keep them in a Denizbank gold account. After watching a Denizbank advertisement on television and my friends' recommendation, I came here to open an account. Now I will save 150-200 lira every month and buy gold in grams and add it to this account, Ozgan said. Outlook There are no reliable statistics for how much the flow of gold to jewellers has declined because of the banks' marketing push. But an indication can be seen in data from the banking watchdog which shows total gold deposits at Turkish banks soared to 15.6 billion lira ($8.6 billion) in April from 3.73 billion lira a year earlier. The central bank predicted its latest 5 percentage point hike in the portion of lira reserves that can be held in the form of gold would be worth about $2.2 billion. Some jewellers insist the boom in gold deposit accounts will prove transitory. They argue many Turks will stay loyal to their traditional links with jewellery shops; any future reduction in reserve requirements, when economic conditions change, could reduce banks' appetite for gold. It's impossible to break a habit of centuries with advertising. Gold keeps Turks warm, said Mehmet Ali Yildirimturk, a 63-year-old trader at the Grand Bazaar, as he displayed old gold coins from the reigns of Ottoman Sultans. But the rise of gold deposit accounts in some ways suits the purposes of Turkey's monetary authorities; by prompting people to take gold holdings out from under their mattresses and put them back in circulation, it may help to reduce the growth of the country's gold imports, cutting its current account deficit. It also ties in with the government's desire to mobilise idle savings. After insisting that he was confident of keeping his customers' loyalty, Yildirimturk then conceded that his business might face major change. You cannot stand against this wind. The jewellery sector will be transformed, and one day in the future only jewels will be bought from jewellery shops, not gold coins for investment, he said."

France's 27,000 tobacconists, or tabacs, whose distinctive red, diamond-shaped signs dot the nation's streets, will be out to win business from the likes of BNP Paribas and Societe Generale as established banks cut back their retail networks in a stagnating economy. The Nickel bank account, which after initial tests is due to be expanded nationwide next year, will offer customers a debit card and a current account for 20 euros ($27.17). That compares with about 28 to 30 euros for the cheapest payment cards at BNP, SocGen and Credit Agricole. Though Nickel clients will be charged fees for depositing and withdrawing money, the tabac association CBF still estimates the cost of having an account at less than 50 euros a year. The association says this is a third less than the cost of an account with Bank of France. Nickel, co-founded by former SocGen communications chief Hugues Le Bret, wants to lure people on the fringes of the system who may be unable to open a traditional bank account. It also says it want to help to fight debt problems by not offering loans and is using the slogan 100 percent useful, zero percent toxic. The product is being launched at a time when French retail banking, traditionally a cash cow thanks to lucrative fees and widespread appetite for conservative savings products such as life insurance, is taking a hit from the stagnant economy and competition from cheaper online competitors. Lenders themselves are trying to come up with alternatives even as they close branches. BNP this year launched the online-only Hello Bank in Germany, Belgium, France and Italy to bring in customer deposits without a bricks-and-mortar branch network. Consumer association UFC-Que Choisir, which has railed against the rising cost of bank charges, said that Nickel might help hard-pressed consumers to save money on bank fees. BNP declined to comment. SocGen and the French Banking Federation did not respond immediately to requests for comment."

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-regulator-banks-exclusive-idUSKBN14V0CK","Exclusive - Banks forced to cover tracks of China's forex regulator","","January 11, 2017 /  4:31 AM / 7 months ago","","SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's forex regulator is telling banks to keep its instructions about curbing capital outflows secret and to ensure that research analysts keep any negative views about the yuan's prospects to themselves, several bankers said. Both demands are seen as an attempt by the authorities to prevent alarm that could trigger further declines in the yuan, the bankers from local and foreign banks said. The yuan lost more than 6 percent against the dollar last year and is at eight-year lows, prompting a flurry of restrictive measures on capital outflows from the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE), including setting limits on banks' currency volumes in some cities or provinces and requiring approval for ever smaller transactions. SAFE, which is part of the People's Bank of China (PBOC), is insisting in oral instructions to dozens of banks that they don't reveal its role in such restrictions, six bankers said, which was damaging their relationships with clients since they were unable to explain why they were turning away business. In a statement late on Wednesday, SAFE's Shanghai branch said it had not adopted new measures to control forex conversions and cross-border payments, but had urged banks to strengthen checks on compliance and deal authenticity. SAFE also said a media report about it telling banks to keep its instructions secret was inaccurate, and is misleading public opinion and disturbing normal operations of the Forex market. SAFE did not identify the media outlet or detail what was inaccurate and misleading. There was no reply at its Beijing headquarters or Shanghai branch when Reuters called for comment outside normal office hours. SAFE's reticence began at least as far back as August, when its Shanghai branch called at least 20 of the major foreign and domestic banks operating in the city to a meeting with the regional heads of several SAFE departments. A representative from an international bank attending the meeting said there were no written instructions, but a high-ranking SAFE official told them explicitly what was expected of them. You must control your forex deficit, but you can't say that SAFE is controlling capital outflows, the official told the bankers. The banks were told to manage sentiment to prevent public panic, the banker said, and the banks' research analysts should not broadcast any negative views on the yuan. They told us not to publish bad house views - analyst house views - on the yuan, the person said. A second banker on the forex team of an international bank said his bank had received the same instructions. Where a bank has exceeded the SAFE-set limits for forex transactions in a month, they have to turn business away, but are unable to explain the real reason why, several bankers complained. We're not going to tell our customers that (our forex business) has stopped; we just have to find ways to turn down the business we're not allowed to do, said a banker at Chinese Commercial Bank Ping An who had received SAFE instructions from seniors. It's not good for client relationships, he added, explaining that he had told his clients to go to other banks. The building of State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) is pictured in Beijing, China, January 11, 2017.Jason LeePing An did not return requests for comment. Penalty Threat In a verbal order to at least two lenders, SAFE said it would vet all cross-border money transfers worth $5 million or more, down from $50 million, banking sources told Reuters in late November. They also told the banks to interview clients to make sure the forex deals were not for fake transactions, or else face punishment, according to two bankers at separate listed banks. In response to those orders, one of the banks sent an internal notice to employees, seen by Reuters, to alert them to SAFE's requirements, explaining that the regulator's penalties could include cancelling business qualifications needed for the lender to conduct forex business. Slideshow (5 Images)The notice passed on SAFE's instructions that staff should not mention the regulator. Please do not reply to clients using wording such as SAFE controls, or SAFE doesn’t allow or strictly controls FX purchases, it read. Instead, they should adhere to the line provided by SAFE, that the purpose of the changes was to promote healthy development of outbound direct investment and crack down on fake deals, the notice added. China's foreign exchange reserves fell to $3.05 trillion in November from $3.3 trillion in the first 11 months of 2016, and many traders are betting there will be further outflows as U.S. interest rates rises make dollar assets more attractive. But SAFE wants banks to advise clients to buy yuan and sell dollars, the international bank representative said, a play that is likely to lose clients money. If a person doesn't have this need, how am I supposed to encourage it? the banker said. At the same time, SAFE is quietly choking programmes designed to open overseas markets to Chinese investors. Even where institutional investors have been granted quotas to invest overseas, they are finding it increasingly difficult to exchange yuan into another currency. SAFE would tell you that you still need to stand in the queue, and the waiting period is 'uncertain', said an executive at Shanghai-based China equity fund house Greenwoods. An investment programme set up so global funds can raise Chinese cash to invest overseas has ground to a halt without explanation. The application process seems to be in a state of suspension, Michael Lu, managing director of Greater China Business Development of Dutch money manager Robeco told reporters in November.

Unknown criminals tried to steal nearly $1 billion from the Bangladesh central bank account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in February and succeeded in transferring $81 million to four accounts at Rizal Commercial Banking Corp (RCBC) in Manila. Maia Deguito, a former manager of an RCBC branch in Manila, helped arrange the deposit and withdrawal of the money but says she was only following orders from her superiors and denies wrongdoing. Deguito posted bail of a 6,000 pesos ($130) on Thursday, Makati police chief Rommel Mitra said. Deguito also faces money laundering and falsification of documents complaints at the Department of Justice for opening five bank accounts at the bank branch last year.  She said a Manila-based Chinese casino junket operator had asked to open the accounts. The stolen funds were deposited in four of the accounts and ended up in casinos which are not covered by the anti-money laundering law. Only about $18 million has been recovered. Deguito's lawyer, Ferdinand Topacio, said she had no idea who filed the perjury case. We have never heard about it until tonight, he told broadcaster ABS-CBN on Wednesday night after she was arrested. This is pure harassment. Her rights were violated. ABS-CBN said the perjury case was filed by former RCBC president Lorenzo Tan. In April, Tan filed a civil complaint against Deguito alleging abuse of rights and defamation after she told a congressional hearing that Tan was aware of the opening of the five questionable accounts at her branch.

Engineers were working to fix the problem as quickly as possible, he said, but there was no time estimate on when service would be restored. Amtrak service is operating between Philadelphia, New York and Boston, although passengers may see some delays, Schulz said.

France's 27,000 tabacs, whose distinctive red, diamond-shaped signs dot the nation's streets, will be out to win business from the likes of BNP Paribas and Societe Generale as established banks cut back their retail networks in a stagnating economy. The Nickel bank account, which after initial tests is due to be expanded nationwide next year, will offer customers a debit card and a current account for 20 euros ($27.17). That compares with about 28 to 30 euros for the cheapest payment cards at BNP, SocGen and Credit Agricole. Though Nickel clients will be charged fees for depositing and withdrawing money, the tabac association CBF still estimates the cost of having an account at less than 50 euros a year. The association says this is a third less than the cost of an account with Bank of France. Nickel, co-founded by ex-SocGen communications chief Hugues Le Bret, also wants to lure people on the fringes of the system who may be unable to open a traditional bank account. With this account, we are bringing banking access to those who feel they've been forgotten, notably in rural areas, or simply shut out because of a mistake along the way, Pascal Montredon, head of the CFB network, told a press conference. Nickel estimates that 1 percent of the French population does not have a bank account, while there are 2.5 million people who are classified as overindebted and 6 million who are unhappy with their current bank. It also said that it wants to help to fight debt problems by not offering loans and is using the slogan 100 percent useful, zero percent toxic. Nickel is being launched at a time when French retail banking, traditionally a cash cow thanks to lucrative fees and widespread appetite for conservative savings products such as life insurance, is taking a hit from the stagnant economy and competition from cheaper online competitors. Lenders themselves are trying to come up with alternatives even as they close branches. BNP this year launched the online-only Hello Bank in Germany, Belgium, France and Italy to bring in customer deposits without a bricks-and-mortar branch network. Consumer association UFC-Que Choisir, which has railed against the rising cost of bank charges, said that Nickel might help hard-pressed consumers to save money on bank fees. BNP declined to comment. SocGen and the French Banking Federation did not respond to requests for comment."

(See pictures here) Midtown Manhattan sprang back to life on a bright and sunny Sunday as residents and tourists rejoiced in the warming sunlight, digging out buried cars, heading to reopened Broadway shows and cavorting in massive drifts left by New York City's second-biggest snowstorm on record. In Washington, where a traffic ban remained in effect, the recovery got off to a slower start, with the entire metropolitan transit system closed through Sunday. The U.S. Office of Personnel Management said federal government offices in the Washington area would be shut down on Monday, along with local government offices and public schools in the District of Columbia and its Maryland and Virginia suburbs. Virginia and Maryland state offices also were ordered closed. Even so, many people were out in the street. Some skied and snowboarded down the steps of the Lincoln Memorial until security officials moved them on.  The monster weather system unofficially dubbed Winter Storm Jonas left at least 20 dead in several states, with most of the fatalities the result of traffic accidents. The entire region seemed to breathe a sigh of relief that the worst was over. For us, snow is like a normal winter, said Viola Rogacka, 21, a fashion model from Poland, walking with a friend through New York's Times Square. It's how it should look like. Theaters reopened on Broadway after the blizzard forced them to go dark on Saturday on the recommendation of New York Mayor Bill de Blasio. We still have some areas that we have to do a lot more work on. But we've come through it pretty well, de Blasio said on ABC's Sunday program This Week. We think we'll be broadly up and running again at the city tomorrow.    Historic Storm  The blizzard was the second-biggest snowstorm in New York City history, with 26.8 inches (68 cm) measured in Central Park by midnight on Saturday, just shy of the record 26.9 inches (68.3 cm) set in 2006, the National Weather Service said. At least 13 people were killed in weather-related car crashes in Arkansas, North Carolina, Kentucky, Ohio, Tennessee and Virginia on Saturday. One person died in Maryland and three in New York while shoveling snow. Two died of hypothermia in Virginia, and one from carbon monoxide poisoning in Pennsylvania, officials said.

New York state Governor Andrew Cuomo lifted a travel ban on New York City-area roads and on Long Island at 7 a.m. (1200 GMT) on Sunday. A state of emergency declared by Cuomo was still in place. Most bus and subway services operated by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority were up and running again by 9 a.m. (1400 GMT), officials said. The agency was working on restoring full service on Sunday. The MTA said Sunday night that seven of the Long Island Rail Road's 12 branches would be fully operational by 5 a.m. on Monday, with partial service restored to an eighth branch. Those branches serve nearly 80 percent of the LIRR's near 300,000 passengers. The Metro-North rail line, which serves suburbs north and east of New York City, was restored on Sunday afternoon. A spokeswoman for the New York Stock Exchange said the market planned to open as usual on Monday. City schools also were set to open on Monday. Snow covers a wall near the U.S. Capitol in Washington January 24, 2016.Jonathan ErnstOn the Upper West Side of Manhattan, grocery store shoppers picked their way through brown slush and over compressed snow and ice as they balanced their bags in their hands.  Drivers tried their best to free cars that were encased in snow, but often found themselves spinning their wheels.  Outside the city, suburban New Jersey resembled Vermont. I'm not sure where I am right now because of all the snow, said Patty Orsini, 56, a marketing analyst from Maplewood, New Jersey, at the nearby South Mountain Reservation. It's nice to be out today in the sun. Yesterday it was scary to be outside, she said as she clipped on her cross-country skis.  Snowbound Schools and Government The National Weather Service said 22.4 inches (57 cm) fell in Washington at the National Zoo, and Baltimore-Washington International Airport notched a record 29.2 inches (74.2 cm). The deepest regional total was 42 inches (106.7 cm) at Glengarry, West Virginia.  Washington, which has a poor track record in dealing with snow, seemed unready for a return to its Monday routine after its largest snowstorm in decades, with major airports, public buses and subways completely shut down all Sunday. Metro trains were to begin limited service starting at 7 a.m. on Monday. Slideshow (9 Images)Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser earlier issued a public apology for commuting headaches caused by the blizzard, which locals dubbed Snowzilla. She said crews had worked all night and Sunday, plowing main roads and were just getting to secondary roadways and neighborhoods.  Public schools were slated to be closed on Monday across much of the Washington and Baltimore region, with some shuttered through Tuesday. All federal offices were to be closed on Monday and the U.S. House of Representatives canceled its voting until Feb. 1. The Pentagon canceled all its events. Nevertheless, walkers, sledders, some cars and the occasional cross-country skier ventured into the dazzling white Washington landscape under a bright sun. Paul Schaaf, a 49-year-old helicopter pilot for Children's Hospital in Washington, was biking 7-1/2 miles (12 km) to work for his overnight shift and planned to bike back to Arlington, Virginia, on Monday morning. I have to get into work no matter what. And the best way to do it is on my bicycle with steel-studded snow tires, he said. Snowballs and Runways At Dupont Circle, hundreds gathered to pelt each other with snowballs. Jomel Nichols, a tourist from Kansas City, Missouri, accompanying three exchange students and her daughter, was plastered with snow. They all turned on me, as teenagers will do, she told Reuters Television. More than 3,900 airline flights were canceled on Sunday, and some 900 were called off for Monday, according to aviation website FlightAware.com. Among New York-area airports, John F. Kennedy International, Newark Liberty and LaGuardia were open, with limited flight activity expected on Sunday, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey said. About 150,000 customers in North Carolina and 90,000 in New Jersey lost electricity during the storm, but most service had been restored by Sunday afternoon. On Sunday, moderate coastal flooding was still a concern in the Jersey Shore's Atlantic County, said Linda Gilmore, a county public information officer.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/abughraib-photos-idUSL1N1F82JM","U.S. must release Abu Ghraib photos, judge says","","January 18, 2017 /  10:04 PM / 6 months ago","","NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Defense must release a cache of photos showing how Army personnel treated detainees at the Abu Ghraib prison and other sites in Iraq and Afghanistan, a federal judge ruled on Wednesday. U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein in Manhattan said the release was proper because departing Defense Secretary Ash Carter failed to show why publishing the photos would endanger Americans deployed outside the United States. Hellerstein's decision is a victory for the American Civil Liberties Union and other civil and veterans rights groups whose lawsuit seeking the photos under the federal Freedom of Information Act began in 2004. Photos depicting abuse at Abu Ghraib began to emerge in 2004, with some detainees claiming to have endured physical and sexual abuse, electric shocks and mock executions. The number of photos sought in the lawsuit has not been disclosed but has been estimated at roughly 2,000, according to the Congressional Record and court papers. Those photos, representing a sad episode in our history, are a matter of great public interest and historical importance, which should not, in a democracy like ours, be shielded from public view, said Lawrence Lustberg, a lawyer for the plaintiffs. The court has wisely reaffirmed our nation's commitment to open government. A spokesman for U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in Manhattan, whose office defended Carter's decision, declined to comment. After Hellerstein in March 2015 ordered the release of additional photos, Carter allowed the release of 198 but kept the remainder under wraps, citing a review of a representative sample by four high-ranking generals. In Wednesday's decision, Hellerstein said the U.S. troop presence in Iraq had fallen to about 5,000 from more than 100,000 at the start of the Obama administration, and that those remaining now serve as advisers rather than in combat. The judge said that while risks remained, including that portions of Iraq had been overrun by the Islamic State, he could not blindly accept withholding the remaining photos. I take seriously the level of deference owed to the executive branch in the realm of national security decision making, he wrote. My complaint is that the executive has failed to articulate the reasons supporting its conclusion that release of the photos would endanger Americans deployed abroad.

California Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones told Reuters on Monday he has ordered an investigation into allegations retail bankers at Wells Fargo signed up customers for life insurance policies from Prudential without their permission. The New Jersey Division of Insurance is also investigating, according to a news release from Jones's office. Spokesmen for the New Jersey office had no immediate comment. The allegations are part of a wrongful termination lawsuit filed by three former managers in Prudential's corporate investigation division. The lawsuit was filed in New Jersey state court last week. A class action suit against Prudential was also filed Monday in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey on behalf of Wells Fargo customers who say they were unknowingly signed up for Prudential policies. Wells Fargo's sales practices have been under a spotlight since September when regulators ordered the bank to pay $190 million in fines and restitution to settle charges that its employees opened as many as 2 million deposit and credit card accounts without customers' permission. Prudential has worked with Wells Fargo since 2014 to sell the term insurance policy, known as MyTerm, to the bank's retail customers. Wells Fargo employees were meant to direct customers to either self-service kiosks in branches or online to buy the insurance, without getting into specifics about the products because bankers are not licensed to sell insurance. Customer responses in a survey conducted last year did not indicate potential fraudulent activity, Prudential said. Prudential also said it had asked for Wells Fargo's assistance in gathering all the necessary facts. Former Wells Fargo employees have blamed the San Francisco-based bank's high-pressure sales environment for its role in creating the unauthorized accounts. Some state and local governments have also suspended business with Wells Fargo, including the Pennsylvania Treasury Department.   (Reporting by Richa Naidu, Suzanne Barlyn and Dan Freed)"

Security Council vote on a resolution to dramatically expand sanctions on North Korea after its recent nuclear test and satellite launch has been delayed to Wednesday after Russia negotiated changes in the U.S.-Chinese drafted text. Last week the United States presented the 15-nation council with the draft resolution that would significantly tighten restrictions after the Jan. 6 nuclear test and Feb. 7 rocket launch, to create what it described as the toughest U.N. sanctions regime in two decades. The vote, first scheduled for Tuesday afternoon, is now planned for 10 a.m. (1500 GMT) on Wednesday, the council said. The U.S. mission to the United Nations said in a statement the vote was rescheduled after Russia invoked a procedural 24-hour review of the resolution. Russian U.N. Ambassador Vitaly Churkin told reporters it's a resolution which is necessary, which the Security Council needs to adopt because of the certain challenges coming from DPRK (North Korea). We did have a few issues to take care of and we discussed them with the U.S. delegation and I think they accommodated some of our concerns, he said. Have they accommodated all of our concerns? Not entirely. After nearly two months of bilateral negotiations that at one point involved U.S. President Barack Obama and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, China agreed to support the unusually tough measures intended to persuade its close ally North Korea to abandon its atomic weapons program. North Korea has been under U.N. sanctions since 2006 because of its four nuclear tests and multiple rocket launches. Related CoverageFactbox: Highlights of draft U.N. North Korea sanctions resolutionNorth Korea vows to shun U.N. rights forum over political attacksThe expanded sanctions, if adopted, would require inspections of all cargo going to and from North Korea and blacklisting North Koreans active in Syria, Iran and Vietnam. Washington had wanted the council to adopt the resolution last weekend but Russia demanded more time to study it. The draft, seen by Reuters, would require U.N. member states to conduct mandatory inspections of all cargo passing through their territory to or from North Korea to look for illicit goods. Previously states only had to do this if they had reasonable grounds to believe there was illicit cargo. The list of explicitly banned luxury goods will be expanded to include luxury watches, aquatic recreational vehicles, snowmobiles worth more than $2,000, lead crystal items and recreational sports equipment. Pyongyang denied the Feb. 7 launch involved banned ballistic missile technology, saying it was a peaceful satellite launch. The official North Korean news agency KCNA said in a commentary on Monday its position as a satellite manufacturer and launcher will never change (and) ... space development is not something to be given up because of someone's 'sanctions'. It called the proposed sanctions a wanton infringement on (North Korea's) sovereignty and grave challenge to it. The proposal would also close a gap in the U.N. arms embargo on Pyongyang by banning all weapons imports and exports.  There would also be an unprecedented ban on the transfer to North Korea of any item that could directly contribute to the operational capabilities of its armed forces, such as trucks that could be modified for military purposes. Other proposed measures include a ban on all supplies of aviation and rocket fuel to North Korea, a requirement for states to expel North Korean diplomats engaging in illicit activities, and blacklisting 16 North Korean individuals and 12 entities, including the National Aerospace Development Agency, or NADA, the body responsible for February's rocket launch. Candidates for the blacklist include a senior official in North Korea's long-range missile program, senior officials at NADA, officials for Tanchon Commercial Bank in Syria and Vietnam, and Korea Mining Development Trading Corporation (KOMID) representatives in Iran and Syria. The previous draft would have blacklisted 17 individuals but the proposed designation of a KOMID representative in Russia was dropped from the latest version. He's not even in Russia, that's the problem, Churkin said. That's why we were surprised he appeared in the first place. There is also an exception for transshipments of Russian coal via the North Korean port of Rajin. In 2013 Russia reopened a railway link with North Korea, from the Russian eastern border town of Khasan to Rajin, to export coal and import goods from South Korea and other Asian countries. There is also an exemption on the ban on aviation fuel to allow foreign civilian passenger airlines to travel to and from North Korea. In addition to NADA, North Korean entities to be blacklisted include the Academy of National Defense Sciences, Chongchongang Shipping Co and the Ministry of Atomic Energy Industry. Also new, countries will be required, not just encouraged, to freeze the assets of North Korean entities linked to Pyongyang's nuclear or missile programs and to prohibit the opening of new branches or offices of North Korean banks or to engage in banking correspondence with them.

For decades a fast-growing success story, H&M; repeatedly missed sales forecasts last year and saw profits fall amid stiff competition from budget rivals such as Britain's Primark and new players online. The world's second-biggest fashion retailer after Zara owner Inditex said local currency sales in March - the first month of its fiscal second quarter - rose 6 percent, one percentage point below a reading for the first 28 days of the month. It's not a sensation but yet another confirmation it is a tough market, said Carnegie analyst Niklas Ekman. Societe Generale analyst Anne Critchlow said the final reading was a fresh blow after disappointing preliminary data. In February, H&M; saw local currency sales shrink for the first time in four years. Chief Executive Karl-Johan Persson said in March weaker than expected sales in the first quarter made it harder to meet a full-year growth target of 10-15 percent. Carnegie's Ekman, who has a sell recommendation on H&M;'s shares, was surprised the company continued to open so many stores in a weak clothing market. The first thing they should do is slow down expansion, he said. Things are looking pretty tough for H&M.; H&M; replaced its old growth target which focused on store openings to reflect the shift towards growing e-commerce, but is still opening many shops. At the end of March, it had 4,426 stores, up 11 percent from a year earlier. In April, the timing of Easter should support sales, though chilly weather across key northern and western European markets such as Germany may limit demand for spring wear. In our view the greatest challenge facing the group is that the main H&M; concept operates in the 'value fashion' arena, which is the most price competitive and crowded part of the clothing market, said Societe Generale's Critchlow, who also has a sell recommendation on H&M;'s shares. H&M; is branching out into brands with higher prices than its core H&M; chain, but these still account for a small share of turnover. Sourcing the bulk of clothes in Asia with long lead times, it is also investing to make its supply chain more flexible and responsive to swings in demand. A more nimble supply chain has long helped Inditex outperform H&M.; H&M; shares were down 0.3 percent at 0815 GMT, and have fallen around 26 percent over the past year.

Banks from countries that have already been granted licenses - Australia, Japan, Malaysia, China, Singapore, and Thailand - will not be eligible for the new licenses. New licenses will instead be given to additional neighbouring and important trading-partner economies, the central bank said. The move to raise the number of foreign players in Myanmar's nascent banking sector follows the successful granting of nine licenses last year, although restrictions remain on what services foreign banks can offer to the nation of 51 million. Banking services are still limited, and the domestic industry is dominated by financial institutions with ties to the former military regime. Foreign direct investment in Myanmar reached $3.58 billion in the first seven months of the fiscal year, according to data from the Directorate of Investment and Company Administration. There are hopes a government led by Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy, which won a landslide in the country's Nov. 8 election and will take power next year, will attract more investment to the country. Encouraged by this success, the Central Bank of Myanmar will initiate a second round of foreign bank licensing early 2016 aiming at welcoming new foreign banks from additional neighbouring and important trading partner economies, the central bank said in a statement on its website on Monday. The central bank did not specify how many licenses would be granted. It did say banks would be able to provide wholesale onshore banking through a branch office. Among the winners of licenses last year were ANZ Banking Group, Australia's fourth-largest lender by assets, Thailand's Bangkok Bank and the banking units of Japan's Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group and Mizuho Financial Group. Banks looking to obtain licenses next year will need to have a representative office in Myanmar or be in the process of establishing one.   (Editing by Ryan Woo)"

Li Fenghua, general manager of the strategic development department, said the firm would consider opening more overseas branches, such as in New York, Paris, Singapore, Japan and South Korea, and hiring experienced professionals and teams abroad. Our aim is to use our Hong Kong subsidiary as a platform to strengthen international business and significantly increase its share in our total revenue to make domestic and international business under a more balanced structure, Li said in a reply to questions received by email late Tuesday. Global asset allocation demand from Chinese residents and demand from Chinese companies to go abroad is very strong, which will bring huge opportunities to brokerages' wealth management, corporate financing and M&A; business. Launched in 1991, GF Securities is one of the first full service investment banks and integrated securities firm in China. By the end of 2015, it had total assets worth of 419 billion yuan  ($61.95 billion). It has already established offices in Hong Kong, London and Vancouver. Li said he is cautiously optimistic for Chinese brokerages next year due to strong growth momentum in the direct financing market, mergers and acquisitions, asset securitisation and investment banking business. So long as the economy stabilises and the government acts to curb risks, Li believed the secondary stock market could avoid major volatility. He said the decline of commission rates for the industry had slowed down and would maintain at the current level next year. China's weak stock market in the first half of this year hit domestic securities firms, as they suffered big declines in equity fund trading volumes, margin business and investment returns. Their total profits for the first half were down 59 percent at 62.5 billion yuan ($9.24 billion) compared with a year previously, according to the Securities Association of China. The drop looks worse than it was as brokerages' profits were very strong in the first half of 2015. And despite the weaker first half this year,  117 of the 126 firms included in the data were profitable, and most of them still recorded their second best performance ever. Citi analysts said in a report that they expect brokerages' ROE (return on equity) to bottom in 2016 as the impact from the stock market crash gradually gets digested. $1 = 6.7637 Chinese yuan renminbi

Mariano Rajoy is not accused of any wrongdoing, but the investigation is an embarrassment for the Spanish Prime Minister who has sought to distance himself from a series of political scandals involving kickbacks. Dozens of politicians and executives have taken the stand as a result and Rajoy, who holds the narrowest parliamentary majority in the history of Spanish democracy, has been called as a witness in a trial of members of his party suspected of operating a slush fund, a court spokeswoman said on Tuesday.  OHL and Indra confirmed the searches and an OHL spokesman said the company had not made any payments to politicians and was fully cooperating with police, while an Indra spokesman declined any further comment. El Pais newspaper reported that the searches were linked to the financing of the PP's Madrid branch during regional election campaigns in 2011. A PP spokeswoman declined to comment. News of the searches hit shares in both companies, with OHL falling as much as 14 percent, before recovering to trade around 8 percent lower. Indra's shares lost more than 4 percent.

Moritomo Gakuen, an educational institution in the western  city of Osaka that also operates a kindergarten promoting patriotism based on Japanese traditions and culture, will open an elementary school in April that had been set to have Akie Abe as honorary principal. Yasunori Kagoike, who is president of Moritomo Gakuen, heads the Osaka branch of Nippon Kaigi, or Japan Conference, a nationalist lobby group with close ties to the prime minister and his cabinet. Abe, grilled about the issue in a parliamentary committee on Friday, said his wife had tried to refuse the position of honorary principal but accepted after it was announced in front of parents. Despite this, she decided that it would be detrimental for both the students and the parents if she continued and so she told them she would resign, he said. On the web site of the elementary school, Akie had said: I was impressed by Mr. Kagoike's passion for education and have assumed the post of honorary principal. But the comments were removed from the website on Thursday. It is true that she was on the web site as honorary principal but at her request, this was removed, Abe said. Abe reiterated that he had declined to allow his name to be used when Moritomo Gakuen solicited donations for what it called the Abe Shinzo Memorial Elementary School. He has also denied that either he or his wife had been involved in the school's getting approval or in its acquisition of the state-owned land for school grounds. Moritomo Gakuen last year bought an 8,770-square-metre plot of government-owned land for 134 million yen ($1.2 million), or 14 percent of its appraisal price, to build a new elementary school, according to official data. Officials have said the difference reflected the cost for cleanup of waste at the site. Finance Minister Taro Aso said in parliament earlier this week that there were no problems with the purchase.

Travel retail has long been a fixture for brands like Estée Lauder Cos Inc and LVMH's Louis Vuitton. But sales at airports and other travel venues have risen far more quickly in recent years than at regular stores for many chains, putting this area of retailing front and center in many companies' expansion plans. Chains with few such stores are adding new ones: Tiffany & Co is set to open a second store in Singapore's Changi this year and one at Berlin's new airport next year, bringing the jeweler's total to eight, while Swiss luxury watchmaker Hublot, which is also part of LVMH, is eyeing Frankfurt's airport. Meanwhile, Estée Lauder Cos, with nearly 1,000 airport stores across its myriad brands of beauty products, is branching out to domestic airports in smaller cities in China and Brazil to find new growth in the travel business and scouting places that could one day be China's top vacation spots. It is the moment to ask ourselves, what is the St-Tropez of China? Chief Executive Officer Fabrizio Freda said in a recent interview. Travel retail sales growth at the company has outpaced its overall growth. Worldwide, duty-free and travel retail sales of perfumes, cosmetics and luxury goods jumped 28.3 percent between 2008 and 2011, according Generation Research. The Swedish data firm expects them to jump 25 percent to $44.5 billion by 2014 from its projection for 2012. For perspective, Boston Consulting Group expects overall sales of luxury goods to rise 14.5 percent by 2014. China's emerging middle class has been the single largest motor of luxury's growth in the last few years. According to the Global Business Travel Association, there are plans in place for 100 new airports in China in the next decade. So called second-tier cities like Chongqing and Wuhan are emerging as major centers and attracting retailers' notice. Spending thousands at an airport on a designer handbag is much more of a habit for shoppers from China and other emerging markets than for Westerners. The Chinese love buying when they travel-- it's a culture, said Hublot Chairman Jean-Claude Biver, noting how much those shoppers boost sales at its airport stores in Switzerland. Even in the United States, where airports are generally seen as shabby compared with Europe and Asia's sleek venues, there is interest in opening stores when facilities are up to standard. Estée Lauder Co's M.A.C. and Brookstone Inc were among the brands to open stores at the splashy $1.4 billion international terminal in Atlanta that opened in May. Chris Anderson, Brookstone's director and general manager of airport retail, said he would gladly open many more under the right conditions, given how they serve as a billboard for the chain. But for many, U.S. airports are generally not up to snuff, hampering the potential there. When I look at American airports, there is just no sense of trying to create in many of them a nice store, Samsonite International S.A. CEO Tim Parker said. Olivier Bottrie, president of travel retail worldwide for Estée Lauder Cos, and other industry executives recognized the threat of a global economic crisis, but pointed to travel's quick recovery after shocks like 9/11 and the 2003 SARS epidemic. It is an area that is growing in terms of traffic and therefore in terms of sales potential, Bottrie said."

(Reuters) - United Launch Alliance, a partnership of Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing Co , for the first time beat Elon Musk's SpaceX in competition for an Air Force satellite launch, both launch companies said on Friday. The contact covers launch services for multiple satellites aboard an Atlas 5 rocket in June 2019. The contract value is just over $191 million, the Air Force said.  The award is the first for United Launch Alliance since the Air Force certified rival SpaceX's Falcon 9 rockets for flight and opened bidding for launch contracts in 2015. ULA, which previously had a monopoly on the military’s launch business, sat out the Air Force’s first solicitation and lost the second. Both were awarded to SpaceX. A SpaceX official told Reuters it did not expect to win this bidding competition because the mission required a heavy-lift launcher and its Falcon Heavy booster has not yet flown. “The mission performance required that we bid Falcon Heavy,” SpaceX spokesman John Taylor wrote in a email. “We did submit a bid, but with the knowledge that our first Falcon Heavy flight might occur after the time of the award.  Given we have not flown Falcon Heavy, we did not anticipate winning this mission,” he said. SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy is expected to debut this year. The new booster would need to fly successfully at least once before the Air Force would award SpaceX a Falcon Heavy launch contract, three times before any high-priority military satellites would fly on it, Claire Leon, the launch enterprise director for the Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center, told reporters during a conference call. Typically, the Air Force awards contracts two years ahead of a launch. Another branch of the Air Force that handles experimental programs bought a Falcon Heavy rocket ride in 2012. That mission is currently targeted to fly early next year, Leon said. SpaceX also won Falcon 9 contracts to fly a U.S. National Reconnaissance Office spy satellite, which launched in April, and is scheduled to launch the X-37B robotic space plane for the Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office later this year. SpaceX is preparing for its 39th launch -- and third in nine days -- on Sunday. Reporting By Irene Klotz. Editing by Joseph White and David Gregorio"
"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-turkey-sniper-idUSKBN16T0VB","Turkey says fires into Kurdish-held Syria after soldier killed by sniper","","March 22, 2017 /  8:55 AM / 4 months ago","","ANKARA/BEIRUT (Reuters) - Turkey fired into Kurdish-controlled Syria on Wednesday after saying one of its soldiers was killed by a sniper from across the border, risking deeper conflict with a Kurdish militia backed by the United States and building ties to Russia. The Turkish military said the soldier was killed in the Turkish province of Hatay, across the border from Syria's Afrin, which is controlled by the Kurdish YPG militia. It said it returned fire in retaliation. YPG spokesman Redur Xelil told Reuters that Russian forces which deployed to Afrin earlier this week had headed to the area shelled by Turkey. Russia's Defence Ministry was not available for immediate comment. We will certainly not stand with our hands tied in the face of any aggression and we will use the right to respond in the framework of legitimate self defense, Xelil told Reuters in a written message. The incident highlights the volatile nature of one of the most complicated theaters in the multi-sided Syrian conflict, where the United States, Turkey, Russia, Iran and Arab states have all backed local forces.  The YPG is a military ally of the United States and is playing a major part in U.S.-backed operations against Islamic State in areas of Syria further to the east. It has also built ties to Russia, and said this week that Moscow was setting up a military base in Afrin and would help train its fighters. Turkey, which is a NATO member and part of the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State, views the YPG as a terrorist organization, an arm of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) militant group fighting an insurrection in Turkey. Ankara has been incensed by U.S. support for the YPG and has warned it will not tolerate a terror state being established in northern Syria. It accuses the YPG of rights abuses and of trying to displace Syrian Arab and Turkmen civilians. Xelil said the Turkish army was the aggressor in Wednesday's incident and that Turkish shelling of border villages around Afrin had wounded 10 civilians. To Turkey's dismay, Syrian Kurds have managed to bring both Washington and Moscow onto their side after showing themselves as an organized force able to confront jihadist groups and take back territory from Islamic State. The Russian defense ministry said on Monday it had no plans to open new military bases in Syria but that a branch of its reconciliation center, which negotiates local truces in Syria, had been located in Aleppo province near Afrin.

The CSI300 index fell 0.4 percent, to 3,414.39, while the Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.3 percent, to 3,133.40 points. Zhang Qi, an analyst with Haitong Securities said that tight liquidity could curb demand for equities, although he said the risks of a sharp downturn in the benchmark Shanghai Composite are small. The SSEC is up 1.0 percent year-to-date, but has lost 4.7 percent from its 15-month high hit in mid-April, when concerns about tighter policy and the broader economic outlook triggered a selloff. China's central bank injected 506.39 billion yuan ($73.48 billion) into the financial system via short- and medium-term liquidity tools in April, down 18 percent from the previous month, signalling a bid to rein in rapid credit growth. On Wednesday, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) said it had injected 200 billion yuan into money markets through open market operations, but it made no mention of maturing medium-term lending facility (MLF) loans. After years of super-loose policy, the PBOC has cautiously shifted to a modest tightening bias in recent months and regulators have stepped up a crackdown on riskier forms of financing as authorities try to contain financial risks from years of debt-fuelled stimulus. On the day, most sectors lost ground, led by real estate stocks, not helped by news that the Beijing branches of some major Chinese banks have raised interest rates on housing loans for first- and second-home buyers -  the latest of several steps by authorities to check the heated property investment. China's Pangda Automobile Trade tumbled as much as 10 percent for suspected violations of securities laws and regulations. Last month, China's insurance regulator warned it will ramp up its supervision of insurance companies and threatened to investigate executives who flout rules in an effort to root out risk-taking. Analysts expect the broad regulatory clampdown to continue, and the central bank to continue to further tighten policy, though most believe authorities will tread cautiously to avoid hitting economic growth.

The board of directors voted unanimously to fire them for cause as part of its investigation into employees opening as many as 2 million deposit and credit card accounts without customers' permission. Since the scandal and paying a $185 million fine to the U.S. government, the third-largest U.S. bank by deposits has been trying to show it is holding management accountable. The scandal led to the departure of former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John Stumpf last October, who along with another executive forfeited tens of millions of dollars in compensation. The most recent firings include Claudia Russ Anderson, former chief risk officer for the Wells Fargo branch banking unit where the sales problems occurred. She took a personal leave from the bank in September, bank spokeswoman Mary Eshet said. Anderson could not be reached for comment. The others fired by the bank were Pamela Conboy, Arizona lead regional president; Shelley Freeman, former Los Angeles regional president and now head of consumer credit solutions; and Matthew Raphaelson, head of community bank strategy and initiatives. None of them could be reached for comment. The four executives will not get bonuses for 2016 and will forfeit unvested equity awards and vested outstanding options. The scandal also led to the firing of thousands of low-level executives. A spokesman for the Wells Fargo board of directors, Paul Scarpetta at Sard Verbinnen & Co, declined to comment further. Wells Fargo said on Tuesday the board's investigation was ongoing and was expected to be completed before the company's annual shareholder meeting in April. Wells Fargo shares had little reaction to the news and were up 0.14 percent at $58.19. Wells Fargo shares, along with those of most other banks, have posted strong gains in the months following the U.S. presidential election as investors react to higher interest rates and what they expect to be a more permissive regulatory environment. In January, the bank reported its fifth straight decline in quarterly earnings as other large banks, including JPMorgan Chase & Co and Bank of America Corp posted gains.

Travel retail has long been a fixture for brands like Estée Lauder Cos Inc and LVMH's Louis Vuitton. But sales at airports and other travel venues have risen far more quickly in recent years than at regular stores for many chains, putting this area of retailing front and center in many companies' expansion plans. Chains with few such stores are adding new ones: Tiffany & Co is set to open a second store in Singapore's Changi this year and one at Berlin's new airport next year, bringing the jeweler's total to eight, while Swiss luxury watchmaker Hublot, which is also part of LVMH, is eyeing Frankfurt's airport. Meanwhile, Estée Lauder Cos, with nearly 1,000 airport stores across its myriad brands of beauty products, is branching out to domestic airports in smaller cities in China and Brazil to find new growth in the travel business and scouting places that could one day be China's top vacation spots. It is the moment to ask ourselves, what is the St-Tropez of China? Chief Executive Officer Fabrizio Freda said in a recent interview. Travel retail sales growth at the company has outpaced its overall growth. Worldwide, duty-free and travel retail sales of perfumes, cosmetics and luxury goods jumped 28.3 percent between 2008 and 2011, according Generation Research. The Swedish data firm expects them to jump 25 percent to $44.5 billion by 2014 from its projection for 2012. For perspective, Boston Consulting Group expects overall sales of luxury goods to rise 14.5 percent by 2014. China's emerging middle class has been the single largest motor of luxury's growth in the last few years. According to the Global Business Travel Association, there are plans in place for 100 new airports in China in the next decade. So called second-tier cities like Chongqing and Wuhan are emerging as major centers and attracting retailers' notice. Spending thousands at an airport on a designer handbag is much more of a habit for shoppers from China and other emerging markets than for Westerners. The Chinese love buying when they travel-- it's a culture, said Hublot Chairman Jean-Claude Biver, noting how much those shoppers boost sales at its airport stores in Switzerland. Even in the United States, where airports are generally seen as shabby compared with Europe and Asia's sleek venues, there is interest in opening stores when facilities are up to standard. Estée Lauder Co's M.A.C. and Brookstone Inc were among the brands to open stores at the splashy $1.4 billion international terminal in Atlanta that opened in May. Chris Anderson, Brookstone's director and general manager of airport retail, said he would gladly open many more under the right conditions, given how they serve as a billboard for the chain. But for many, U.S. airports are generally not up to snuff, hampering the potential there. When I look at American airports, there is just no sense of trying to create in many of them a nice store, Samsonite International S.A. CEO Tim Parker said. Olivier Bottrie, president of travel retail worldwide for Estée Lauder Cos, and other industry executives recognized the threat of a global economic crisis, but pointed to travel's quick recovery after shocks like 9/11 and the 2003 SARS epidemic. It is an area that is growing in terms of traffic and therefore in terms of sales potential, Bottrie said."

From sunny California to wintry Quebec, 26 of the NHL's 30 teams were in action on Saturday. The Los Angeles Kings raised their massive black-and-white Stanley Cup banner before opening the defense of their crown against the Chicago Blackhawks, while in Montreal, two of the league's flagship franchises, the Canadiens and Toronto Maple Leafs, renewed their storied rivalry. NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman and NHL Players Association chief Donald Fehr, who had held the ice hockey spotlight through nearly four months of negotiations, slipped into the shadows and left the stage to the players. Last week we announced that we reached an agreement on a new CBA (collective bargaining agreement) and tonight the Bruins are back on the ice, said Boston Bruins owner Jeremy Jacobs shortly before his team got a 3-1 win over the New York Rangers. When the puck drops, we put the last four months behind us and celebrate the return of hockey to Causeway Street. The fact that we were unable to reach an agreement until just recently is a disappointment. I want to personally apologize to our fans and others who depend on this team for their livelihood. But these are just words. The best way to make it up to you is to play hard and win. Olive Branch The season began the way the last one ended -- in Los Angeles, with the Kings doing one final victory lap around a jubilant Staples Center with the Stanley Cup before a poignant banner raising ceremony assisted by the family of Ana Marquez-Greene, a fan and victim of the Sandy Hook massacre. There was one big difference, however, as the Kings, who never gave up more than four goals in their championship run, surrendered that many in two periods as the Blackhawks spoiled the party with a 5-2 win. In some markets, bitterness from the 113-day lockout is sure to linger but not in Canada where an ice hockey buzz swept across the country like a massive winter storm and fans welcomed back teams with open arms. The return of the NHL also meant the return of hundreds of jobs as fans slipped into their favorite jerseys and packed bars and pubs providing a jolt to local economies. Winnipeg Jets fans Tyler MacFarland (L) and Norman Lavallee cheer as they arrive at the MTS Centre for the first game of the NHL hockey season against Ottawa Senators in Winnipeg January 19, 2013.Fred GreensladeThe league and teams have worked hard to win back disgruntled fans and their wallets, offering everything from free tickets and parking to discounts on beer, hotdogs and merchandise. Even the Maple Leafs, who last year were rated by Forbes as the first ice hockey team to be worth $1 billion, extended an olive branch by giving away 1,000 tickets to Monday's home opener against Buffalo and offering free skate rentals at the Toronto city hall outdoor rink that same day. For opening day the NHL took out full page newspaper ads in major cities across Canada and the United States, offering yet another apology for dragging fans through a fourth work stoppage in 20 years. Fans to the Fore Slideshow (2 Images)At nearly every arena, teams thanked fans for their patience and standing by the sport through trying times. Fans were also front-and-center at several openers. In Los Angeles, 10 fans were selected to escort the Stanley Cup in the Staples Center while two San Jose Sharks supporters were chosen to drop the ceremonial puck at their home opener. The league-wide charm offensive generated enough goodwill to make opening day a success but most of the initiatives do not go further, leaving it up to the product on the ice to keep the turnstiles twirling and television ratings climbing. With a shortened 48-game regular season there will be little margin for error, with even a minor slump or injury capable of tripping up a team up during a 99-day sprint for a playoff spot. With only a six-day training camp, there was plenty of rust on display on Saturday. The Pittsburgh Penguins, the odds makers favorites to replace the Kings as champions, got off to solid start beating their great rivals the Flyers 3-1 in front of a record Philadelphia crowd. The Maple Leafs, who have not hoisted the Stanley Cup since 1967 and failed to make the playoffs the last seven seasons, gave their fans hope the postseason drought might be coming to an end with a 2-1 victory over the Canadiens.

Revel was ultimately bought by Brookfield Management, which has experience in casino operations. Caesars CEO Gary Loveman said the deal could help the city's economy evolve beyond gaming. The transformation and revitalization of Atlantic City requires the addition of a diverse set of reasons for people to come visit, Loveman said in a statement. Atlantic City officials have struggled to turn around the seaside resort's fortunes and find uses for the shuttered buildings. Gaming companies, loath to open the door to new competition, have typically inserted deed restrictions ensuring that new owners did not re-open the properties as casinos. Stockton College purchased the Seaview Resort in Galloway Township, New Jersey, in 2010 for $20 million. It uses part of the property to train students in hospitality and generate revenue for the college, and to house students. News of the Showboat deal comes on the same day that New Jersey Governor Chris Christie convened a second closed-door summit of business, labor and government leaders focused on revitalizing the city. In remarks to reporters before the meeting, Christie said those involved need to accept realities and endure some pain without getting weak-kneed.   (Editing by Frank McGurty and Eric Walsh)"

Travel retail has long been a fixture for brands like Estée Lauder Cos Inc (EL.N) and LVMH's (LVMH.PA) Louis Vuitton. But sales at airports and other travel venues have risen far more quickly in recent years than at regular stores for many chains, putting this area of retailing front and centre in many companies' expansion plans. Chains with few such stores are adding new ones: Tiffany & Co (TIF.N) is set to open a second store in Singapore's Changi this year and one at Berlin's new airport next year, bringing the jeweller's total to eight, while Swiss luxury watchmaker Hublot, which is also part of LVMH, is eyeing Frankfurt's airport. Meanwhile, Estée Lauder Cos, with nearly 1,000 airport stores across its myriad brands of beauty products, is branching out to domestic airports in smaller cities in China and Brazil to find new growth in the travel business and scouting places that could one day be China's top vacation spots. It is the moment to ask ourselves, what is the St-Tropez of China? Chief Executive Officer Fabrizio Freda said in a recent interview. Travel retail sales growth at the company has outpaced its overall growth. Worldwide, duty-free and travel retail sales of perfumes, cosmetics and luxury goods jumped 28.3 percent between 2008 and 2011, according Generation Research. The Swedish data firm expects them to jump 25 percent to $44.5 billion by 2014 from its projection for 2012. For perspective, Boston Consulting Group expects overall sales of luxury goods to rise 14.5 percent by 2014. China's emerging middle class has been the single largest motor of luxury's growth in the last few years. According to the Global Business Travel Association, there are plans in place for 100 new airports in China in the next decade. So called second-tier cities like Chongqing and Wuhan are emerging as major centres and attracting retailers' notice. Spending thousands at an airport on a designer handbag is much more of a habit for shoppers from China and other emerging markets than for Westerners. The Chinese love buying when they travel-- it's a culture, said Hublot Chairman Jean-Claude Biver, noting how much those shoppers boost sales at its airport stores in Switzerland. Even in the United States, where airports are generally seen as shabby compared with Europe and Asia's sleek venues, there is interest in opening stores when facilities are up to standard. Estée Lauder Co's M.A.C. and Brookstone Inc TEMSHB.UL were among the brands to open stores at the splashy $1.4 billion international terminal in Atlanta that opened in May. Chris Anderson, Brookstone's director and general manager of airport retail, said he would gladly open many more under the right conditions, given how they serve as a billboard for the chain. But for many, U.S. airports are generally not up to snuff, hampering the potential there. When I look at American airports, there is just no sense of trying to create in many of them a nice store, Samsonite International S.A. (1910.HK) CEO Tim Parker said. Olivier Bottrie, president of travel retail worldwide for Estée Lauder Cos, and other industry executives recognized the threat of a global economic crisis, but pointed to travel's quick recovery after shocks like 9/11 and the 2003 SARS epidemic. It is an area that is growing in terms of traffic and therefore in terms of sales potential, Bottrie said. (Reporting by Phil Wahba in New York; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)"
"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-target-jpmorgan-idUSBRE9BK0D020131222","Millions of Target shoppers face new debit card limits","","December 22, 2013 /  12:35 AM / 4 years ago","","NEW YORK (Reuters) - At least 2 million shoppers who used bank debit cards at Target Corp (TGT.N) stores during its recent data breach are facing lower limits on how much cash they can take out of teller machines and spend at stores. JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) said on Saturday it is notifying customers who used Chase brand debit cards at Target from November 27 through December 15 that they are now limited to $100 a day of cash withdrawals and $300 a day of purchases with their cards. The new limit effects roughly 2 million accounts, or 10 percent of Chase debit cards, according to a spokeswoman for Chase, the consumer banking business of JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets. Chase said it acted as a precaution to prevent criminals from taking money from customer accounts. Chase and other banks say they will cover unauthorized transactions that customers report. Banks are putting various precautions in place, Target spokeswoman Molly Snyder said by email, declining to be specific about what the banks are doing. Representatives for other major banks, including Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) and Citigroup Inc (C.N), told Reuters on Saturday that their institutions take steps to protect accounts, but none described specific actions so broadly limiting to cardholders as those of Chase. Target's Snyder said that for the debit card it issues and calls Redcard, the company has activated a deeper fraud monitoring protocol. She did not describe the new steps. People shop at a Target store during Black Friday sales in the Brooklyn borough of New York, in this November 29, 2013, file photo.Eric Thayer/FileChase said in its notice to customers that it realized its move could not have happened at a more inconvenient time with the holiday season upon us. At Chase, the usual debit card daily limits are $200 to $500 for cash withdrawals and $500 for purchases, according to a bank spokeswoman. It seems like the banks are the 'Grinch who stole Christmas,' said Jamie Court, president of Consumer Watchdog, a consumer advocacy group based in Los Angeles. It is Target's fault, but children across America are going to bear the price ... The banks are protecting themselves. Chase spelled out the new limits in an email to customers with the subject line: Unfortunately, your debit card is at risk by the breach at Target stores. Target said on Thursday that computer hackers had stolen data from as many as 40 million credit and debit cards of shoppers who visited its stores during the first three weeks of the holiday season. Chase said in the letter that it plans to reissue affected debit cards over the coming weeks and in the meantime said employees at its 5,600 branches would help those who need more cash. Many branches will stay open late if needed, the letter said. Debit cards, unlike credit cards, typically require customers to enter personal identification numbers when they make purchases at store check-out counters. Initial reports of Target's security breach said data may have been taken through devices at its counters. Debit cards are used to spend money that has been deposited in checking and other demand accounts at banks.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/china-banks-foreign-idUSL3E8LU3GA20121104","Foreign banks hope China's new leaders will loosen up regulators","","November 4, 2012 /  9:00 PM / in 5 years","","SHANGHAI, Nov 5 (Reuters) - For all the hopes that China's forthcoming leadership change will herald a new wave of market reforms, foreign bankers don't expect to get the level playing field they crave any time soon. Trends are positive, but progress can be frustratingly slow. My outlook is basically optimistic, particularly in the medium term. The near term is always always uncertain, Christian Murck, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in China and independent director of J.P. Morgan Chase (China) Ltd, told Reuters. A lighter regulatory touch on bond writing, derivatives and funding channels are seen as crucial to foreign banks' growth in China. But the best they can hope for in the short term is that the new faces in the Communist Party's standing committee adopt a broadly pro-reform stance that gradually works through to front-line regulators, whose discretion on licensing and product approval can mean the difference between feast and famine. The attitudes that they take towards whether market reform needs to be accelerated again is absolutely crucial, Murck said. Foreign banks in China had their best year ever in 2011. After-tax profits grew 115 percent to 16.7 billion yuan ($2.68 billion) in 2011, according to a survey of 41 banks by accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC). Onerous regulation and unequal treatment compared to domestic rivals still restrain their growth. Foreign banks' assets rose by 24 percent last year, but their share of China's total banking assets remained under 2 percent. Officials would like to say it's a level playing field for the foreign banks, but in fact that's still not exactly the case, said a senior financial services professional with experience working with foreign banks in China, who requested anonymity for fear of offending the Chinese authorities. Every year they do relax things a bit more. They give you one or two more products every year, but not all in one go, he added. Funding Shortage Foreign banks consistently struggle to fund their lending in China. They are subject to the same 75 percent loan-to-deposit ratio that governs their local counterparts. But attracting deposits is a much greater challenge due to the slow and difficult process of receiving approvals to open new branches. Our branch network is nowhere near complete. We need to expand further to meet the demands of our clients, said an Asian banker, who declined to be identified because he is not authorised to speak to media. It's like, how many years do we need to wait to open a branch here? Consequently, most foreign banks rely on their offshore head offices for a large portion of their funding. But China's tight capital controls mean that increases in capital, via debt or equity, require regulatory approval. China expanded the aggregate long-term debt quota for foreign banks earlier this year, but banks still want more. The State Administration of Foreign Exchange has cut short-term debt quotas in recent years, according to the European Chamber of Commerce's 2012 position paper on financial services. Chinese authorities want foreign banks to rely on local sources of funding. But the chamber noted that China's onshore forex funding markets are still immature. A foreign bank whose offshore parent could borrow dollars at the Libor rate may pay 30-40 basis points more to borrow dollars onshore. Waiting for Green Lights Gaining access to the lucrative bond underwriting business ranks at the top of foreign banks' wish list, according to PWC's survey. China's bond market has nearly doubled in size since the end of 2009, with total bonds outstanding reaching 24.1 trillion yuan at the end of September. But as of mid-2011, only three foreign banks - HSBC, Standard Chartered, and JP Morgan - were approved to underwrite Chinese government bonds, which make up the largest share of the market. That compares to 57 domestic banks. New rules brought in last year established a process to allow foreign firms to underwrite commercial paper and medium-term notes in the corporate bond market - the fastest growing segment of China's bond market. But so far only HSBC has been approved, though it is not permitted to serve as lead underwriter. Foreign banks would also like to leverage their expertise in derivatives, a strictly regulated area, to sell structured products in China aimed at corporate treasurers or wealthy individuals. These investment products use derivatives like options or swaps to connect the value of the product to movements in interest rates, currencies, commodities, or equities. But approvals to roll out such products can often take months or years."

Attorney General Kamala Harris authorized a seizure warrant against the bank that seeks customer records and other documents, saying there is probable cause to believe the bank committed felonies. The probe marks the latest setback for the bank in a growing scandal that led to the abrupt retirement of its chief executive officer, monetary penalties, compensation clawbacks, lost business and damage to its reputation. Wells Fargo spokesman Mark Folk did not immediately provide a comment in response to requests from Reuters, but was quoted in the Los Angeles Times as saying the bank is cooperating in providing the requested information. A spokeswoman for the California Department of Justice said she could not comment on the probe. The bank's downward spiral kicked into high gear last month. The U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and other regulators ordered the United States' third-largest bank by assets to pay $190 million in fines and restitution to settle civil charges that its branch staff created as many as 2 million accounts without customers' knowledge in order to meet internal sales targets. The CFPB said that high pressure sales tactics and financial incentives fueled the fraud, which was largely carried out by low-level branch employees. About 5,300 of those employees were fired. Shortly after the civil settlement was made public, CEO John Stumpf was called to testify before Congress. Observers have widely criticized his performance, with many saying he appeared ill-prepared to deal with tough questioning by lawmakers including Massachusetts Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren, who called for his resignation and accused him of him gutless leadership. Last week, Stumpf resigned and was replaced by Chief Operating Officer Tim Sloan. This is at least the second criminal probe to be opened into Wells Fargo since last month. In September a source told Reuters that federal prosecutors are also looking into the matter. An affidavit filed by Special Agent Supervisor James Hirt with the California Department of Justice reveals that interviews with possible victims of the fraud have already started. One victim, identified only as Ms. B, told the investigator that she had declined a request by a Wells Fargo teller in late 2011 or 2012 to open new accounts. But sometime in late 2013 or early 2014, she started to receive notices that she and her husband allegedly owned on three life insurance policies held by the bank, the affidavit says. She also told the investigator that Wells Fargo often claimed that her accounts had to be closed and reopened because of problems that it could never fully explain. The constant changes, she added, sometimes caused her to incur fees because her checks would bounce. Another alleged victim, identified as Ms. C, told the investigator she noticed the bank was transferring money from her checking account to her savings account in amounts that grew over time, from $50 to $150. The bank claimed the transfers were done as overdraft protection, but it refused to provide her bank statements when she asked to see them. The seizure warrants by the state are seeking a variety of documents from Wells Fargo, including a list of all unauthorized California customer accounts created between May 2011 and July 2015. It also seeks information about fees, charges and other costs that were incurred and the identity of all Wells Fargo employees that may have opened the accounts."

The private Tsukamoto kindergarten in Osaka, western Japan, has been visited by Akie Abe and is operated by Moritomo Gakuen, an educational institution that plans to open an elementary school in April with the prime minister's wife as honorary principal. Kyodo news agency reported on Friday that the kindergarten had apologized after referring to irresponsible South Korean and Chinese parents on its home page. We apologize for expressions about foreigners that caused misunderstanding, the kindergarten said on its web site. The school, however, denounced unjust, slanderous and defamatory Internet-based articles about this kindergarten and it said it would keep fighting against malicious criticism. Criticism of Korean residents and Chinese people is a common feature of right-wing rhetoric in Japan, where ethnic homogeneity has been a source of pride for many conservatives. Separately, the Osaka prefectural government is considering whether to take action over derogatory expressions about Koreans living in Japan and Chinese used by the kindergarten in a document sent to students' parents last year, an Osaka official said. FILE PHOTO -  A student stops to bow to a portrait of Japanese former Emperor Hirohito and Empress Kojun at Tsukamoto kindergarten in Osaka, Japan, November 30, 2016.Ha Kwiyeon/File PhotoThe Tsukamoto kindergarten aims to instill in its 3- to 5-year-old students a sense of patriotism with a curriculum focused on Japanese traditions and culture.  Abe was grilled in parliament last week about possible ties to Moritomo Gakuen, including whether he knew his name had been used to solicit donations for the elementary school.  Abe said then he had rejected a request to have the school bear his name because it was not appropriate for an incumbent lawmaker and was unaware his name had been used in seeking donations. An official at the prime minister's office declined comment on any specific remarks by the school because they had not seen them.  But the official, who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the subject, added: When it comes to the issue of discrimination based on nationality, ethnicity or race, it cannot be tolerated and it is extremely important to have consideration for others and to have mutual understanding. Yasunori Kagoike, the principal of the kindergarten and president of Moritomo Gakuen, heads the Osaka branch of Nippon Kaigi, or Japan Conference, a nationalist lobby group with close ties to the prime minister and his cabinet.
