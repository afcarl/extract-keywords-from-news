/article/296425,3 Touch Points to Better Engage a Multigenerational Workforce,"Smart HCM technology can help organizations create compelling work environments that make employees feel valued and treated fairly - regardless of their generation, employment status, or position.","Free Webinar | August 16thFind out how to optimize your website to give your customers experiences that will have the biggest ROI for your business.							Register Now  Many workplaces today are in the unprecedented position of having five generations working together, side-by-side. While the exact definition of each generation may vary slightly, any office or workplace today could include members from the traditionalists (born 1927-1945), baby boomers (1946-1964), Generation X (1965-1980), millennials/Generation Y (1981-1996) and Generation Z (those born in 1997 or later).While most would agree that generalizations like generational buckets are helpful only to a point, multigenerational workforces challenge employers to meet a broad range of needs and expectations. Making the matter more complicated: Typical full-time and part-time positions are now being augmented with gig economy roles such as freelance, contract and temporary employment options.Related: 10 New HR Software Solutions for 2017When you pair this complex and diverse workforce with the growing competition to attract and retain top talent, it s easy to see why culture and work environment have become a key focus for employers looking to gain a strategic advantage.The price of a disengaged workforceAccording to Deloitte University Press s Global Human Capital Trends 2016 report,  employee engagement is a headline issue throughout business and HR.  Fully 85 percent of survey respondents ranked engagement as a top priority, yet only 46 percent reported that they were prepared to address engagement challenges.For all the attention being paid to the topic, employee engagement has remained fairly static, at around 30 percent since 2014, and has not experienced large year-over-year improvements in Gallup s 15-year history of measuring and tracking the metric.In fact, according to Gallup, almost 20 percent of U.S. workers are  actively disengaged  employees, those likely to undermine coworkers and sabotage projects. Perhaps worse, most U.S. workers -- 51 percent -- continue to fall into the  not engaged  category. While these employees do not typically negatively affect business performance, they tend to do the minimum asked of them and are not likely to go the extra mile for clients or customers.Overall, Gallup reports that disengagement costs the U.S. around $500 billion annually.Related: Staff Turnover Is Draining Your CompanyHow technology can helpClearly, disengagement is too big and costly a problem to ignore. Smart human capital management technology can help organizations create compelling work environments that make employees feel valued and treated fairly so they will give that extra discretionary effort to the organization -- regardless of their generation, employment status or position.Here are three areas where good HCM technology strategy and implementation can make a real difference:1. Recruiting: Recruiting is an area where technology and user experience play a critical role in getting your engagement efforts off on the right foot. A recent survey found that 20 percent of job seekers would give up on an online application if they couldn t complete it on a mobile device. And although 70 percent of job seekers are interested in applying for a job via smartphone, only about a quarter of large companies surveyed have optimized their hiring process for mobile devices -- a significant gap that all employers should look to close.Improving the user experience and efficiency of your hiring process eases the demand on managers and ensures that good candidates don t get lost in the process. In addition, the use of prescreening tools can help get to the short list of best-fit candidates so that hiring managers and recruiters spend their time efficiently. Alerts, notifications and automated workflows can also make the process easier and more efficient while keeping everyone involved on-task.Related: 6 Steps Your HR Team Can Take to Leave the Dark Ages2. Performance management: Performance management drives engagement for the entire workforce. Managers need to provide employees with continuous feedback instead of the traditional approach of annual reviews or when discipline is necessary. When employees know how they re doing -- and how their ongoing activities align with corporate goals -- they perform at a higher level and stay with an organization longer. HCM technology provides managers with the tools to provide ongoing feedback on employee activities connected to goals and key performance indicators, and to promote ongoing performance development, manage compensation and stay on top of learning and development to advance skills. Providing all of this with an easy-to-use, mobile interface helps create a more engaged, motivated and productive workforce.3. Scheduling: When employees have access to flexible scheduling tools to manage their working hours, companies see a significant impact on performance, engagement and retention. Today s HCM solutions can help organizations involve employees in the decisions around when they work, through tools like shift swapping. These and other self-service tools increase flexibility for employees and relieve managers from the burden of frantically filling open shifts at the last minute. Findings from a recent Aptitude Research Partners study showed that organizations that offer shift-swapping capabilities, no matter what the industry, were 55 percent more likely to indicate they had higher than industry average levels of engagement and 53 percent more likely to indicate they had below average turnover for their industry.Related: The 'Whys' of Why You Should Consider HR Software for Your Small BusinessWhy tech requires new processesWhen thinking about each of these areas where HCM technology can help improve the user experience and increase employee engagement, it s critical to remember that even the best technology may fail to yield results if the processes behind it have been ignored. Process improvements go hand-in-hand with technology investments.Organizations looking to implement new HCM systems should always consider why the current workflows are in place and how, if at all, they can be improved upon. They must also decide whether to leverage a unified platform inclusive of HR, workforce management and payroll or seek out best-of-breed solutions for each functional area. The former will provide a single source of truth that provides a well-rounded picture of people trends based on workforce data, while the latter may require deep specializations to maximize the value of any investment.Leading companies work hard to deliver a superior customer experience to attract, engage, retain and cultivate customers and clients. Organizations must apply a similar lens to their workforces, looking for ways to make the employee experience easier, rewarding, more transparent and professionally fulfilling, regardless of their generation.Robert DelPonteRobert DelPonte is the vice president and general manager of the human capital management (HCM) practice group at Kronos Incorporated.

/article/297614,"The 'Al Capone Theory' Shows How Sexual Harassment Hurts Your Bottom Line, Too","When you hire and partner, look for people whose values you can trust in all things.","Recode reported yesterday that Vinod Khosla, the billionaire founder of Khosla Ventures, had this to say during a speaking engagement about sexual harassment in the world of venture capital:  I did not know that there was any discrimination. Khosla went on to say that he thought it was  rarer than in most other businesses,  and that  it s a reality because it s perceived as a reality."" His comments came after a several week stretch that has shown just how real this discrimination is.Related: Uber Fires More Than 20 Employees for HarassmentIn June, following six allegations of sexual harassment against VC Justin Caldbeck, he released a statement and resigned from the fund he co-founded, Binary Capital. It shut down completely shortly thereafter.On June 30, The New York Times published an article titled  Women in Tech Speak Frankly on Culture of Harassment.  In it, writer Katie Brenner spoke with female founders about being subjected to unwanted advances. They named a number of high profile VCs, including Chris Sacca and 500 Startups co-founder Dave McClure.McClure resigned from his role at 500 Startups and his female co-founder Christine Tsai took over. Both McClure and Sacca took to Medium in an attempt to own up to their behavior, though not before being contacted by and named in a paper of record.Related: Don't Be Blind to Workplace Harassment: 5 Tough Questions to AskIn his post,  I m a Creep. I m Sorry,  McClure wrote,  When confronted about what happened, I was at first defensive. What did I do wrong? We were just hanging out! Why are people so upset? I tried to present my crappy behavior in the best possible light. I didn t have much empathy for the people I hurt and offended, and rather than face up to my own shallow motivations, I rationalized my actions and came up with reasons to find blame in others, rather than solely with me. In Sacca s post, titled  I Have More Work to Do,  he wrote,  particularly when reflecting upon my early years in Silicon Valley, there is no doubt I said and did things that made some women feel awkward, unwelcome, insecure, and/or discouraged. In social settings, under the guise of joking, being collegial, flirting, or having a good time, I undoubtedly caused some women to question themselves, retreat, feel alone, and worry they can t be their authentic selves. By stupidly perpetuating a culture rife with busting chops, teasing, and peer pressure to go out drinking, I made some women feel self-conscious, anxious, and fear they might not be taken seriously.""In response to this series of high profile incidents, Valerie Aurora, principal consultant at Frame Shift Consulting, a firm that helps companies promote diversity and inclusion, and Leigh Honeywell, the co-founder of female-driven makerspaces HackLabTO and the Seattle Attic Community Workshop, shared what they call  The Al Capone theory of sexual harassment. Related: 5 Ways to Create a Healthy, Thriving Tech Company CultureThe pair explained what the infamous crime boss -- who was caught for the relatively prosaic felony of not paying taxes rather than the more garish ones he committed -- has to do with Silicon Valley s culture of harassment. The U.S. government recognized a pattern in the Al Capone case: smuggling goods was a crime often paired with failing to pay taxes on the proceeds of the smuggling. We noticed a similar pattern in reports of sexual harassment and assault: often people who engage in sexually predatory behavior also faked expense reports, plagiarized writing, or stole credit for other people s work.   All of these behaviors are the actions of someone who feels entitled to other people s property -- regardless of whether it s someone else s ideas, work, money, or body. Which is to say, as founders, you have a responsibility to your employees to build organizations where people feel that they are safe and can do their best work. Once you are in a position to hire or partner, as you do your due diligence about the backgrounds of the people you bring into your orbit, you cannot ignore or brush aside this kind of behavior as one-off incidents or just the way things are. To do so is to allow harmful actors to thrive while the environment around them suffers.

/article/296710,This Question Reveals the Truth About Workplace Diversity,How is your business handling workplace diversity? This scenario will show you the truth.,"Imagine your organization is expanding into Texas, where your goods or services are needed but you have no footprint or name recognition.The population of the region is very diverse but largely Hispanic, specifically Mexican American. You are responsible for hiring the person to lead the expansion -- to brand the organization, hire direct reports, find ways to connect with customers, and work with local leaders in the communities and government.There is no internal candidate for the position and the search has been narrowed down to two equally qualified and likeable candidates: a Mexican American woman who has never lived or worked anywhere but Minnesota her whole life and has no knowledge of the target market and a non-diverse woman who has lived and worked with the target market all her life and is well-established in the business community.Who would you hire?Did you say the Mexican American? So did more than 80% of the senior leaders -- both in HR and in other departments -- I presented this scenario to. The percentage was over 95% among non-diverse leaders, and after they answer, they all look at my face and say,  Uh-oh, I m wrong, aren't I? Related: Why the Accenture Gender-Parity Target Is Insane -- and Bad for WomenYes, they are, and so are you if you chose the Mexican American. Here s why: you were thinking about optics and workforce representation -- not increasing influence. You were thinking about diversity -- not inclusion -- which is why workforce representation, as it is usually defined, solves for quotas and not growth. It solves for diversity but rarely solves for inclusion.Of course we need more diverse leaders in positions of influence to serve diverse marketplaces. But you think that influence is achieved by hiring a single Mexican American who looks like the market but has no idea how the people in that market live? She s from Minnesota -- a state that looks and acts nothing like Texas -- but company leaders want to hire her simply because she is Mexican American. The result is that a company hires for representation rather than the best talent for what it is solving for. Representation is about quotas -- not moving all people to the center of our growth strategies. It s about compliance -- not influence.I get that organizations across industries from education to healthcare to engineering to retail are facing demands to increase the workforce representation of diverse populations. But those organizations also know the talent pipeline of qualified diverse workers available to fill roles of influence is limited. Those that are available need to be placed on high potential tracks that allow them to earn influence in the organization based on performance capabilities. In other words, organizations need to understand and celebrate how their backgrounds introduce new ways of thinking that promote diversity of thought throughout the organization.Related: 22 Qualities That Make a Great LeaderTo do that, we need inclusive leadership that prepares diverse populations to be successful by embracing authenticity rather than forcing assimilation. Only then can they challenge the status quo and create inclusive foundations for identifying and hiring the most qualified diverse and non-diverse leaders long term. Otherwise, we get diversity without inclusion, and all that solves for is quotas rather than growth.Simply put, a leader does not have to be a diverse candidate to best serve diverse populations or their communities. In this particular example, the non-diverse candidate was this organization s path to long-term growth and sustainable inclusive leadership. The usual mindset of quota and workforce representation made this hire a short-term compliance play.This is why human resources (HR) should not and cannot be responsible for managing all of these change management requirements. Ask yourself how many decisions you have made through the HR, I-have-to-choose-the-diverse-candidate lens? How much has that cost you in engagement and retention, workplace culture, and close-minded decisions, along with all the money associated with those things? Probably a lot.Related:  5 Ways to Recruit Rock-Star Employees on a BudgetBoth candidates may know they need talent to help sell and sustain the company in that market and need to hire talent that understands that market to solve for the opportunity gaps that lead to a long-term growth strategy. But only one candidate has the relationships and understanding in the market and the wisdom to best serve the unique needs of the community to do this, and what she lacks in diversity, she makes up for in diversity of thought.It is time to disrupt the status quo and reinvent the ways we work and lead. The marketplace has changed, yet our thinking has not evolved. It s time to embrace a new mindset that moves diversity and inclusion to the center of an organization s growth strategy and gives diverse talent influence to start growing from the center out, so everyone has the opportunity to be inclusive and influence the future.Glenn LlopisGlenn Llopis is the Chairman of the Glenn Llopis Group   a nationally recognized thought-leadership, human capital, and business strategy consulting firm.

/article/296696,How to Know It's Time to Add an HR Department,HR activities at startups are often reactive in nature instead of proactive. That leaves gaps in the system.,"When starting their businesses, most entrepreneurs tend to wear many hats. However, there are times when they need to step back and look at how they may be unintentionally hurting their business and employees.Related: The Hidden Costs of Undervaluing Human ResourcesConsider the experience of Mollie Delp, the designated HR specialist at Workshop Digital, in Richmond, Va. At the digital marketing company, Delp juggled multiple duties while also helping co-workers manage human resource tasks. While growing and developing our operational service teams, we also took care of developing HR processes, like hiring, recordkeeping and benefits administration,  Delp told me via email.  We only had slightly over 20 employees, but things already felt messy and inefficient. Important things were bound to slip through the cracks. If Delp hadn t taken charge of HR tasks, the company's leaders would have suffered from the lack of time and attention they weren t able to give other important projects. That s why it s crucial for entrepreneurs to take an unbiased look at their own processes. At what point do you need help?Here are four indications that it s time fto add a designated human resources department:1. Apps can do only so much.The number of HR tech tools on the market is growing every day. While these tools are helpful in running a business, even their founders admit they don t replace people, if you go by the words of Steffen Maier, co-founder of Impraise.Impraise is a New York-based performance-management and coaching platform, whose co-founder, Maier, says he recognizes human resources (staffed with people, not just tools) as a necessity, rather than a simply nice-to-have department. With the rise of HR tech tools that can help with everything from recruitment to payroll, many have tried to simply replace the department altogether with apps. This is actually the wrong move,  Maier explained in an email.  Instead, these tools are facilitating the transition of HR from an admin role to a more strategic role within the organization. Hiring his own human resources team early, Maier continued, allowed him and other Impraise founders to focus on hiring the right people for their team, thus creating a better employee experience and maintaining a positive company culture.You might want the same for your own company: Take a look at the HR apps you're already using to assist the business. Gather feedback from employees or use analytics to determine what s still lacking in your employee experience and workplace culture.Related: 'Human Resources' Just Doesn't Tell You What HR Really DoesUse this information to decide what employee and company aspects might be improved with the addition of an HR department. As Maier said, some functions, such as hiring the right people and creating a positive employee experience and culture, can t be done with technology alone.2. Employees aren t proactive.In the beginning, startups typically don't have one employee covering human resource duties full-time. Instead, when a problem arises, people react by stepping into the role. Many times, however, this leaves holes in the system. The challenge with waiting until that point is, the HR activities that have been done up until then have been reactive in nature and not proactive,  Jana Tulloch said by email. She's a human resources professional at Develop Intelligence, a technical learning solutions company headquartered in Boulder, Colo.The problem with being reactive, Tulloch explained, is that,  This is where companies can get into trouble, when required policies, employee records or other compliance issues have gaps. While many company leaders view HR as only a transactional function, Tulloch said she believes it s a strategic one.  HR supports an organization s goals by ensuring the right policies and programs are in place to attract, retain, engage and motivate staff, creating a high-performing organization,  the HR professional said.The message, then, is that business leaders need to decide if current HR practices are reactive or proactive. Start by assessing the most recent HR incidents, transitions or policy changes: Were they built around compensation, benefits, performance management and employee relations? Or were they created in reaction to events that interrupted normal company procedures?If entrepreneurs continue waiting for HR issues to arise before addressing them, their current HR situations will not help ROI or assist in building a sustainable organization.3. Someone without HR experience shouldn't handle HR.Human resource professionals carry a lot of weight and skill. For that reason, having employees fill in when they can, with no knowledge of HR functions, can be detrimental.Lovely Kaur, founder and executive director of human resources and business operations at ShieldX, a cloud security vendor in San Jose, Calif., has witnessed this scenario many times. I helped a startup where the CEO was doing HR without having any HR experience. He was trying to keep the budget low, but overlooked the potential costs and legal ramifications of HR done bad,  Kaur told me.  Making a smooth runway before taking off is so important, and HR is a crucial component of that runway. So, whether a company has five or 500 employees, managing the compliance and legal aspects of the job cannot be overlooked. If the person running between multiple jobs has no history or knowledge of HR practices, it s time to end the balancing act.Hire someone with the ability to mitigate risks for employees and ensure the company doesn t run into any problems.4. The cost of having no one doing HR is expensive. When cutting HR-related costs, company leaders can face expensive legal risks. Hiring, firing, promoting, demoting and even paying employees can have significant consequences under the law. So, the more employees you have, the more decisions you have to make, and the greater the risk of a problem,  Jaime Lizotte, HR solutions manager at ComplyRight, a compliance resources and solutions company in Pompano, Fla., explained to me.Thankfully, there are outside contractors you can hire to customize your own organization's HR solutions. If you're going in this direction, look for an HR company that provides real people -- like Jumpstart HR (rather than an HR platform that's all tech bells and whistles). With this type of ""people"" service, your startup can customize its HR solutions to fit its needs and have HR professionals watching your back, offering creative problem-solving techniques.Of course, some entrepreneurs may feel more comfortable with an in-house team member. If that's the case for you, start by looking to mentors and other business leaders to discuss what qualities their HR pros possess that you need, as well.Related: 4 Ways Technology Improves the Human Resources (and Human) ExperienceThis will help you feel comfortable about what attributes you're looking for when you set out to form your first HR department.Heather R.

/article/294967,Why You Need This One Trait to Build a Successful Company Culture,Having this skill is like having a workplace superpower.,"How would you describe a superpower in the workplace? Words such as  inspirational,   influential  and  powerful  would come to mind, but you would rarely think of  empathetic. Empathy is a skill which is often overlooked in the workplace. Determined by Frans de Waal as the  social glue that holds human society together,  empathy refers to the awareness of one s own and other people s feelings, needs and concerns. Having the ability to be empathetic has been proven to prevent poor morale, misunderstandings and conflicts, consequently enabling a person to build significant and long-lasting relationships with others. Empathy therefore is the underrated key ingredient for both personal and professional success.Related: Uber's Woes Teach Us the Cost of a Company Culture Without EmpathyEmpathy vs. sympathy: What s the difference?Even though many people believe empathy and sympathy are similar, they are in fact completely different qualities. Empathy is the ability to understand the thoughts, emotions and experiences of another individual, whereas sympathy provokes feelings of pity and sorrow for someone else s misfortune. In other words, empathy is the ability to step into someone else s shoes, being aware of her feelings and considerate of her needs.How can you develop empathy in the workplace?Pay attention.Most of the time, we forget to take into consideration how other people are feeling because we are so preoccupied with our own thoughts. This mindset can cause misunderstandings and conflict among the team, consequently creating a toxic and pressured environment. It is for this reason that employees need to be self-aware and more aware of others, taking the time to understand the other person s feelings before passing judgment. For instance, when speaking to your colleagues, do not just take what they are saying at face value; think about what is being said and how they are saying it. Are there certain facial expressions, gestures or pace of speech that are contradicting what they are saying? Being aware of the non-verbal cues and reflecting on what has been said will allow your team to recognise and respond in a much more supportive way.Related: 7 Traits of Exceptional LeadersBe willing to listen.It takes more than being observant to be empathetic; you also need to be willing to listen.  A recent report from Oxford Open Learning Trust shows that the top three skills business leaders seek from their employees are people skills (71 percent), team-working skills (70 percent) and strong effective communication (68 percent). All of these skills require one important ability: listening. Whether your colleagues want to pitch an idea or they are seeking advice, being prepared to listen to these queries will increase team collaboration as well as create a more positive and supportive network. Particularly for aspiring leaders or managers, empathy enables you to switch the focus from your personal ambitions to those of the team, helping others with their career development and understanding what is best for the company s success.  Remember the company s vision.In a Development Dimensions International (DDI) study of over 15,000 leaders worldwide, empathy was determined as the number one most critical driver of employee performance. Why? Empathy transpires in how your company shares their vision with its employees. Allowing your employees to feel a part of a network that is working collaboratively towards the same goal can result in a more dynamic workforce. Create a monthly internal journal where your employees can celebrate company success, discuss current projects and even participate in competitions will enable your employees to see the bigger picture and support the company s values, generating an inclusive, positive and cooperative work culture. Related: Why Business Leaders Need to 'Tune in"" to Their PeopleWhy does empathy matter in the workplace?According to a study by Businessolver, 31 percent of employees believe profit is all that matters to their organization, and that their company does not care about its employees. This statistic demonstrates how a substantial amount of employees worldwide see their workplace as emotionless, demanding and high-pressured, believing that their organization s sole purpose is to drive financial success, even at the expense of its workforce. Having this perception spread through the business can be extremely harmful to the company s vision, diminish team productivity and reduce employee morale.People are the foundation of any successful company. It is for this reason that the kind of atmosphere that is promoted can either develop or hinder the future of the business. By enacting a more empathetic approach will generate a much more respectful, positive and productive work environment for the team, consequently transforming you into a superpower that stands the test of time.

/article/295844,Uber Needs to Recreate its Company Culture. Here's What You Can Learn From Its Mistakes.,Start by treating people with respect. It's as simple as that.,"During a Tuesday meeting to discuss an overhaul of Uber s company culture, former board member David Bonderman proved exactly why the conversations needed to happen in the first place.At the start of the all-hands meeting, Arianna Huffington, who was the first woman to join the company s board last year, announced the addition of Nestl  executive Wan Ling Martello to the board, increasing the representation of women on the board from 14 to 25 percent. There s a lot of data that shows when there s one woman on the board, it s much more likely that there will be a second woman on the board,  Huffington noted.That s when Bonderman interrupted. Actually what it shows is it s much likely to be more talking. In the recording obtained by Yahoo Finance, you can hear Huffington respond at first with awkward laughter. And then her reply:  Oh. Come on, David. Don t worry, David will have a lot more talking to do as well. That is not to be the case, as Bonderman resigned shortly after the meeting, which, it bears repeating, was convened to talk about recommendations to change Uber's culture after allegations of systemic discrimination and sexual harassment.Related: 3 Lessons Every CEO Can Learn From Travis Kalanick's Emotional Meeting With Uber's Female EngineersBonderman, the 74-year-old founding partner of investment firm TPG Capital, apologized for the  disrespectful  comment via an internal memo to Uber employees and issued this statement about his departure:""I do not want my comments to create distraction as Uber works to build a culture of which we can be proud. I need to hold myself to the same standards that we're asking Uber to adopt. Therefore, I have decided to resign from Uber's board of directors, effective tomorrow morning.""Earlier on Tuesday, CEO Travis Kalanick also announced that he would be taking a leave of absence in order to, as he shared in an email to the company,  take some time off of the day-to-day to grieve my mother, whom I buried on Friday, to reflect, to work on myself, and to focus on building out a world-class leadership team. The ultimate responsibility, for where we ve gotten and how we ve gotten here rests on my shoulders,  Kalanick wrote.  There is of course much to be proud of but there is much to improve. For Uber 2.0 to succeed there is nothing more important than dedicating my time to building out the leadership team. But if we are going to work on Uber 2.0, I also need to work on Travis 2.0 to become the leader that this company needs and that you deserve. Related: Travis Kalanick to Take a Leave of Absence. Here Are 9 CEOs Who Were Fired or Decided to Step Down.So what exactly is Uber 2.0 going to look like?Over the past few months, former attorney general Eric Holder and Tammy Albarr n, partners at law firm Covington & Burling, were tasked with investigating the allegations made by former engineer Susan Fowler and others.They interviewed more than 200 Uber employees and provided a set of recommendations pertaining to how the company should address discrimination, harassment and retaliation and how it could  ensure that its commitment to a diverse and inclusive workplace was reflected not only in the company s policies but made real in the experiences of each of Uber s employees. The recommendations include:Providing more support for the human resources department and establishing clear protocols to track complaints.Mandatory training for senior executives, HR staffers, managers and people in the position to interview prospective employees, particularly around the topics of promoting inclusion and combatting unconscious bias.In terms of recruiting and developing talent, implementing a blind resume review, and increased transparency when it comes to performance reviews and promotions.The prohibition of romantic or intimate relationships between supervisor/subordinates and the consumption of alcohol during work hours, at after work events and at company-sponsored events.An update of discrimination and harassment policies including instituting a zero-tolerance policy for violators of those rules -- no matter what position they hold in the company -- and explicit protection against harassment from not only other employees, but third-parties the company deals with such as clients to vendors.Related: A 2013 Letter From Uber's Travis Kalanick Lays Out Sex Rules for Employees at Company PartyA lot of these seem quite standard. But when you look at former engineer Susan Fowler s blog post and Kalanick s 2013 Miami letter side by side, the necessity for Holder and Albarr n to explicitly state things such as the importance of  de-emphasizing alcohol as a component of work events,  or that policies should be applied consistently across the company with no special treatment afforded to any one employee is pretty glaring.One passage in particular about Uber s 14 cultural values speaks volumes about where Uber ran aground. Holder and Albarr n recommended that the company communicate with its employees to reassess and develop a core list of values that are accessible and easy to understand.  Eliminate those values which have been identified as redundant or as having been used to justify poor behavior, including Let Builders Build, Always Be Hustlin , Meritocracy and Toe-Stepping, and Principled Confrontation; and encourage senior leaders to exhibit the values on a daily basis and to model a more collaborative and inclusive Uber culture,"" the recommendation reads. ""Leaders who embody these values should be part of the process of redefining Uber s values and should be role models for other leaders within the company. Related: Uber CEO Travis Kalanick Says He Needs to 'Grow Up' After Video of Argument With a Driver ReleasedUber has long had a reputation for aggressive tactics in its dealings with regulators and competitors. It was seen, for better or worse, as one of the key drivers of its rapid growth. But clearly, as Uber s experience shows us, growth and success are not one in the same.In an interview with Vanity Fair in 2014, Kara Swisher asked Kalanick about the nature of the interactions with the leaders of the cities (some of whom he described as  really awesome, but most are uninspired ) his business was disrupting. If you don t agree with the core principles, which are the premise of that compromise, then you have to have what I call principled confrontation. And so that is the thing that we do that I think can rub some people the wrong way. If you re beginning with the premise that compromise doesn t work for you, and every interaction is a war of attrition, you can let people build all they want, but what exactly are you working toward?If you re always hustlin  -- though if they do keep that one, I would urge them to restore the  g  to its rightful place -- you don t stop to think about where the pitfalls may be or whether you might be in the wrong. Uber s experience shows us that is kind of approach is a recipe for collapsing under the weight of your own hubris.Related: If Elon Musk Can Admit His Mistakes, Then So Can YouIn Uber s San Francisco headquarters, up until this week, the office s main conference room was called aptly, the War Room. Bloomberg reported that along with the multitude of changes recommended by Covington & Burling, the room is now going to be called the Peace Room. It s a bit on nose, but you can appreciate the thought, as long as it's not just lip service.Uber s culture is not going to change overnight, but now the company seems to have the self-awareness and tools in place to build an environment where values aren t used, as per Holder and Albarr n s description, to  justify poor behavior. So what can we learn from Uber s newfound emphasis on internal, rather than external growth? Company culture isn t about perks or empty aphorisms that look good on a T-shirt.

/article/295610,A 2013 Letter From Uber's Travis Kalanick Lays Out Sex Rules for Employees at Company Party,'You better read this or I'll kick your ass.',"Following an investigation by a former U.S. attorney general into accusations of rampant sexual harassment at the ride-hailing company, Uber fired 20 employees for inappropriate behavior earlier this week. Then, after Recode inquired about Eric Alexander, the company's former president of business in the Asia Pacific, obtaining the medical records of a woman who was raped by her driver in India, Uber fired him. Alexander reportedly also shared those records with Uber CEO Travis Kalanick and Senior Vice President Emil Michael.It's clear that there's something very wrong with the multi-billion-dollar company's culture.Related: Uber Fires More Than 20 Employees for HarassmentNow, possibly as a result of those firings, Uber is experiencing leaks. One document that is now seeing the light of day is a 2013 letter from Kalanick to employees, in which he discusses ""rules"" for a party the company held in Miami. The contents and language of the letter are what you'd expect from the president of a college frat -- not the leader of a global business. In it, Kalanick sets rules for puking, throwing kegs off of buildings, doing drugs and even having sex with co-workers.You have to wonder why it took until these recent firings for something like this to go public. It's also hard to believe that the company's investors weren't privy to this letter, or others like it, and if they were, that they still gave the company money.

/article/293273,4 Opportunities to Empower Employees on Payday,"According to a recent survey, many workers find their paystub confusing to read. However, a little help from their employer could yield huge dividends.","Ever look at your paycheck and wonder what certain acronyms and abbreviations mean? Or how specific taxes or deduction affect your overall earnings? What s the difference between filing zero or one anyway? Although a paystub is loaded with important information, it can also be frustrating for an employee who doesn t understand where his or her hard-earned money is going every payday.While many bosses may take for granted that their employees know how to read a paystub, the new  Engaging Employees through Payroll  survey of 1,013 American workers from The Workforce Institute at Kronos Incorporated has found that 42 percent of respondents find their paycheck confusing and difficult to read. There is a clear generational divide as well: While just 19 percent of survey respondents over the age of 55 find their paycheck confusing, that number jumps to almost half -- 45 percent! -- for millennials aged 18-29 years old.Related: It Turns Out, Millennials Are Happiest With Their Health BenefitsAs organizations seek out new avenues to support employee engagement, these findings present an opportunity for HR and payroll teams: 45 percent of American workers also reported they would feel more engaged in their jobs if their employer helped them better understand the impact of taxes, deductions and withholdings on their overall earnings.Here are four opportunities that organizations can quickly leverage to empower employees on payday:1. New hire onboardingBenefits enrollment is a cornerstone of new hire onboarding. While the entire new hire process can be overwhelming, it represents the first opportunity for new employees to see what their paycheck will look like and how their pre-tax and post-tax deduction decisions can impact their overall earnings.For example, many health and wellness benefits, along with 401(k) retirement investments, are pre-tax deductions. Fully taking advantage of these programs will reduce the employee s total taxable wages, reducing tax withholding liability, which many younger employees may not realize. Post-tax deductions, such as union dues, uniform fees, United Way deductions or court-ordered garnishments, will reduce net take home pay without reducing the employee s taxable wage base. Related: What Payroll Schedule Is Best for Your Business?Taking time during orientation, or offering informational worksheets that demonstrate various scenarios that an employee can review when selecting their benefits or completing their tax withholding forms, will help them better understand the advantages -- or consequences -- of their choices.2. Employee handbookNew hire onboarding can be a whirlwind, and once employees have settled into their new role, they may not remember the choices they made or the information that was shared with them that first week. For this reason, the employee handbook -- which most organizations issue to every employee in either a printed or digital format -- can serve as another great resource.Instead of focusing a handbook on policy do's and don ts, it can also include educational resources. A  know your paycheck  reference card can explain the difference between gross pay, net pay, taxes, deductions and all those different acronyms that an employee could face on payday. The inclusion of sample paychecks will also help new employees understand what the information in each section really means. Informational worksheets shared during onboarding can be included in the handbook, too.Related: Why Team Input Is the Key to Successful Benefits Planning3. Company intranetA company intranet site will provide even more flexibility than the handbook to empower employees to learn about their paycheck. On an intranet site, organizations can provide self-service tools such as online paycheck calculators that allow employees to input anticipated changes to tax status, 401(k) withholdings or benefits to see the anticipated impact on net pay. It can serve as a central hub for any and all payroll resources shared during new hire onboarding and the employee handbook to keep them easily accessible for employees.The intranet can also host a secure portal that allows employees to take self-service one step further by allowing them to update their own address, tax status and deduction changes within the HR and payroll system. In addition to empowering employees with transparency, trust and control over how this information is edited, it also eliminates the need for HR or payroll to make these changes manually, freeing them up to focus on larger, strategic initiatives.Related: Got a New Staffer? 10 Ways to Make Them Welcome and Productive.4. W-2 season Every year, organizations invest significant time and resources to distributing W-2 tax forms to all eligible employees. In fact, it may be one of the most anticipated employer communications of the year for those who wish to get their taxes filed early!Although more organizations are providing these forms digitally for employees to print, many are missing the opportunity to share valuable information at the same time. Taxes change each year, and understanding new social security limits or 401(k) thresholds could prompt employees to make additional changes to their withholdings. Updated benefits offerings for the new plan year can be shared at this time, or new earnings codes can be flagged.Solving the payroll puzzleThe  Engaging Employees Through Payroll  survey also found that 58 percent of respondents feel they live paycheck to paycheck. This telling statistic could explain why employees are so eager for employers to provide guidance on how to maximize their overall earnings in their paycheck.Organizations are making increasingly significant investments in new benefits, professional development opportunities, managerial training and other progressive programs to build the most engaged workforce possible. With a little bit of effort, organizations can eliminate paycheck confusion to reap huge dividends by making sure employees fully understand how all the pieces of their paycheck fit together to influence their take-home pay.

/article/293161,7 Things to Consider When Your Employee Asks to Move Teams,Employees rotating to a different team within the organization happens often. Here's how to determine if it's the right move.,"Internal transfers are not a new phenomenon. Employees rotating to a different team within the organization happens often; however, it s not always easy for managers to tell whether or not it s the right move.When approached by employees requesting to make an internal transfer consider the following:Consider their effort. Is this employee someone who grinds it out, has a positive attitude and gives it their all, but the role they re in just isn t clicking? If so, then it may make sense to consider the transfer. If the employee is coming to HR after just a few weeks with the company, he probably hasn t given it a chance and could just be complaining. Few people are good at something new after a few weeks. In this instance, talk to him about training resources that could help him learn more quickly. Related: 9 Things That Make Good People QuitDig in on why. Sometimes the reason employees want to transfer is an issue that can be resolved. When first approached by the employee, take time to understand the real reason she wants to move. Is it an issue with a manager? Has she communicated it to them? Make sure it s a legitimate reason and not because she thinks the other team has an easier workload. Oftentimes with fun company cultures, employees want to stay but don t want to work hard for the culture. Transfer for this reason and it will inevitably fail.Ask their peers.Ask teammates individually how they feel about the person. These conversations can shed light on the employee's personality and work ethic. Is he a complainer, or does he roll up his sleeves and grind it out with the team? Would she be a culture giver and bring the right energy and attitude to the new team, or would she be the opposite, a culture taker?If a transfer makes sense after considering the above, the employee should run through the same, or similar, interview process he went through when first hired. Related: Staff Turnover Is Draining Your CompanyEvaluate them. HR needs to also evaluate the employee's skills, strengths and weaknesses. The person may want to move from analytics to creative, but lack attention to detail, and a creative eye. The role the employee wants may not be right.Talk to the managers. While the current manager should be looped in, HR should also have a conversation with the manager the employee is interested in working for. There may not be a need or open spot on the team, or that manager may not think the employee would add value to the team, so it could be a moot point. Before moving forward with anything, HR should gauge where the manager stands and get his or her buy-in.Consider interview preparedness.Managers can determine a lot from how the employee prepares and presents himself during the interview. The most successful internal transfers don t take anything for granted. They come prepared with how they ve added value to the company so far, why they want the transfer, can explain why they are qualified and how they can add value to the team. They ask about how to prepare and what is expected of them for the interview. They ask if they should wear a suit, or if regular work attire is appropriate. They come with good questions and have done their research on the team and the manager they are interviewing with.If they don t treat this interview as if it it s their first, they re not taking it seriously, and it s a waste of everyone s time. They need to be just as competitive as the external candidates applying for the role. They should never act as if they have a leg up in the race.   Related: 5 Simple Ways to Manage Employee Morale During Company ChangeAsk the same questions as external candidates. Managers shouldn t play favorites. The employee will mimic the interviewer s style so treat it as if it was one with an external candidate. Ask questions like, why do you think you d be good at this role? Why do you want to work here? What differentiates you from everyone else applying? How will you add value to the team and the company? Given that the employees has had inside access with the company, it will be great to see how her answers stack up against external candidates. If the employee does have a great interview and seem like she would be a great fit, talk to the existing team and get their buy-in before announcing the move. If after interviewing the person you find that she may be better for a different group, suggest that instead and explain why and how it will benefit her career.

/article/289393,5 Smart Ways Entrepreneurs Can Spot Promising Potential Hires,Looking for your next great hire? Use these tips to find the right person.,"You'll often hear others complain about how much money they make -- how their income is not enough to pay for their expenses.Most of the time, they are not wrong. That is why many people work multiple jobs to try to make ends meet. Worse still, the number of people looking for jobs -- some of them with really good skill sets -- far outnumber the number of job positions available.However, this does not mean that anyone with a skill set is a good fit for your business. As a business owner, you want to hire the right people -- employees with industry-compatible skill sets who can help your team advance and adapt. The long-term success of your company will be decided by the potential of the people you hire.Getting the right people cannot always be solved by searching out people on job boards (not that this is bad) and offering them too much money to refuse. I have outlined a few unconventional ways of searching out the right talent for your business that go beyond posting an opening online and hoping for the best.Related:  22 Qualities That Make a Great Leader1. Realize that all your employees constitute a human resources (HR) teamYou should already have a dedicated HR team, but to increase the reach and effectiveness of your hiring project, you should consider incentivizing all your current employees to pitch in on the search for new hires. You could give them a bonus for recommending a good prospect who gets hired and lasts for a given amount of time -- say six months to a year.Make sure to let them have creative freedom over their hiring strategy: It doesn't matter whether your employees use word-of-mouth promotion or social media. The important thing is that you have an avalanche of people with a vested interest in bringing in some real, meaningful talent..If you are feeling adventurous and more creative than usual, you could also bring your customers in on the act and extend the same referral incentive to them. However, you should only trust your most loyal customers with this -- those who know how your business works and appreciates their alliance with your company. 2. Invest in a paid internship programThis is a powerful way to preview the best talent before they are even out of school. Create a paid internship program that focuses on some of the brightest and most intelligent seniors or grad students looking for jobs within your industry. To create the best paid internship program, you have to study why these people look for jobs while in school. Once you can understand what makes them tick, you can create something that fits their work persona. Then, when they graduate, you can pluck the most talented of those interns right off the stage, diploma still in hand.Related:  How to Start a Business With (Almost) No Money3. Increase hiring search specificity via relevant local chapters and associationsThe more industry-focused your search for talent is, the likelier you'll be to find just the right person. Almost every industry has its own unions, chapters and organizations. These bodies usually have a fixed annual meeting schedule that they keep to rather religiously.Sniff out the relevant ones that apply an accreditation or certification process. This tells you that they are a professional body and therefore a good hunting ground for potential employees who have the requisite skills for the job.4. Look within your companyI am sure that we have all heard, in some form or another, the mantra: ""Your answer lies within yourself."" Well, in a business context, the answer sometimes lies within your company. This is why it is necessary to be consistent in carrying out occasional employee performance appraisals.You will sometimes find that the talent you have been looking to hire has been in your company the whole time.Related:  11 Habits of Truly Happy People 5. Target your competitor s employeesYou already know that your competitors' best employees have the talent, industry knowledge and experience, work ethic and aptitude you need in an employee. That is what makes them such prime candidates to target.However, you have to be patient when going this route, since they are passive candidates. Seek them out on LinkedIn, via email or phone, but be polite and respectful. If they turn you down, do not force it.

/article/290886,Only You Can Overcome the Invisible Barrier Keeping You From the Best Available Talent,Unconscious bias is a learned mindset. Leaders who truly want the best teams will look beyond their own experiences to attract and retain a diverse workforce.,"Today s leaders are constantly thinking (and worrying) about talent. Because a workforce is every organization s most vital resource, business success truly depends on whom you attract, hire and retain.Businesses always perform better when they bring together unique and diverse employees -- people with different backgrounds, cultures, races, genders and perspectives -- and include them in the conversation. Studies have shown this type of cross-cultural collaboration leads to greater innovation.Leaders set the tone.As leaders, it's our responsibility to create environments where these experiences are the norm. To foster this brand of team identity, companies must attract and hire a diverse pool of talent, then ensure each individual feels included and supported.Ironically, the hiring process is where many business problems begin. Before we try to fix these issues, however, we first need to understand how the recruiting funnel fosters such problems in the first place. Even hiring managers at an open-minded organization can be influenced by unconscious bias. This perspective can have long-term and far-ranging impacts on business -- most them, negative.Related: How Amazon Aligns Employee Experience and Business ResultsUnconscious bias hurts business.Unconscious bias limits our businesses more than we realize. Though the global talent pool is broader and larger than ever before, we still can fall victim to unspoken assumptions and implicit biases. They lead us to view potential employees and job prospects narrowly, without seeing, developing and leveraging their full potential. We fail to recognize the inherent value that lies within these different people and their diverse backgrounds.As a result, enormous pools of talent remain untapped. In fact, the problem is so severe we mislabel it: We don t have a talent shortage; our problem is we re not looking in the right places.To overcome this mental obstacle, we must rethink how we attract and pursue talent. We need to eliminate bias from recruiting processes as well as internal decision-making procedures. Here's a three-step plan to make it happen.1. Stop bypassing the best candidates. When we start recruiting for an open position, we assume we're looking at the most qualified candidates. In reality, we often unconsciously narrow the talent pool to exclude some of the best prospects.For example, job descriptions for marketing professionals commonly use words and terms geared toward women, focusing on  adaptability,   flexibility,   self-awareness  and  creativity.""

It can lead us to turn down a talented 56-year-old simply because he may be close to retiring or ignore a hard-working 23-year-old because she's fresh from a college you're aren't familiar with. Refuse to self-perpetuate this assumption that we leaders helped create. 2. Embrace diversity and practice inclusion. Allowing hiring to be restricted to certain qualities results in a workforce that lacks diversity. Where we grew up, the people we interact with, the schools we attended -- all influence who we are and what we bring to the workplace. It's human nature to gravitate toward applicants whose backgrounds are similar to our own. Yet that's exactly the problem. It encourages us to overlook those whose specific demographics don't match our previous experience or preconceived ideas.Identifying this bias and eliminating it is only half the battle. As an organization, we must also ensure we re actually changing our culture to be more inclusive. If employees don t feel welcome, included and valued, they'll leave to find a more evolved workplace.Related: How to Stop Unconscious Bias Before It Starts Against the People You Hire3. Realize that groupthink is the enemy of innovation. Teams with too many similar mindsets choose conformity and harmony over creativity and uniqueness. It's an absolute danger for an organization. When employees resist anything that exists outside a singular philosophy, teams and leaders are reluctant to change. We should instead encourage our workers to explore new ways of thinking, tackle different approaches and be willing to fail and try again. That s how innovation happens. With unconscious bias continuously generating this dreaded groupthink, teams might never consider alternatives -- much less pursue them.Related: Your Brain Doesn't Want to Change: 5 Ways to Make It.We can solve this intrinsic issue.Unconscious bias clearly damages businesses. So why is it still happening so frequently? For many, the problem is not knowing where to start. As a good first step, we must work to help hiring managers face the hidden preferences they bring to decision-making. Tactfully help them understand how these biases can get in the way of finding and securing the best people for the jobs at hand.Blind interviews aren't the answer, either. We must remain conscious of our focus and concentrate on skills that define the candidate s merit. Before you survey the options, create clear criteria that describes what a ""qualified"" candidate means to your company. Later, as you're in the midst of decision-making, ask yourself which qualities or factors are convincing you that one candidate is better than others. Challenge yourself to be honest about your own motivations as an employer.Related: The Startups Trying to Fix the Bias Problem in HiringIf your company still finds it difficult to remain conscious of bias, there's good news mixed with the bad: Technology is impartial. Intelligent technologies now being integrated into hiring processes can provide checks and balances previously unavailable. Machine learning means these assessments only will get stronger, detecting and countering new biases as they surface. Technology brings us ever closer to choosing the most qualified candidate, based solely on his or her experience. It can be intimidating to admit to unconscious bias. No one wants to think she or he is guilty of succumbing to its influence. Yet it's far worse to be untruthful with yourself as an employer, leader or colleague. Being honest with yourself results in greater authenticity with your employees and your company. Ultimately, this transparency enables you to be a better leader -- one who takes the right steps to create a truly diverse and inclusive workforce culture.Mike EttlingMike Ettling is president of SAP SuccessFactors.

/article/290486,Staff Turnover Is Draining Your Company,Your employees are your customers and the lifeblood of your business. Invest in their development so they'll keep putting their talent and training to work for you.,"Reducing staff turnover keeps more money within your business and gives you fewer headaches. Running a company is easy when you have a full roster of excellent employees. Lose a few of your most experienced, rock-star workers, though, and you'll wonder why you ever wanted to own a business.In my early years of entrepreneurship, I owned one pizza restaurant. My staff turnover was roughly the industry average, and I was sick of the time, energy and money this cycle cost me. It wasn't just the bottom line that suffered. Even more unacceptable than the lower profit numbers were the canceled family vacations.Related: How to Survive When a Key Employee Leaves Your CompanyI started turning things around by implementing a few key guidelines. In the 10 years since, I can't recall having an employment crisis, and I'm proud to claim a nucleus of employees who continue to deliver at a high level.If you're struggling with turnover at your company, odds are you need to invest in one or more of these five areas.1. Create a positive culture.Culture self-audits. It weeds out those who don t fit the culture you've created and attracts those who do. Your culture is the baseline for your company because it cultivates an environment for success. Make sure you're actively working to create the environment you say you want to develop.Related: How These Entrepreneurs Managed Team Dynamics as Their Companies Grew2. Care for your team members.Your employees have hopes and dreams for their lives as well as day-to-day disappointments and struggles. It's easy to get so focused on your company that you forget about the people who really make your business happen. Not all employees will want you involved in every facet of their personal lives, but I guarantee they all want a caring boss. Find ways to care for your team members better than any boss has in the past, and they will care for you and your business.Related: How You Can Get to Know Millennial Employees, Build Relationships and Retain Talent3. Toe the line.As an entrepreneur, you have a vision for what you want to create and actively pursue what you see in your mind. Allowing actions that exist beyond this vision is every bit as deadly to your business as falling short in your active pursuits. Your company and the employees who help run it become a mix of what you create and what you allow -- and what you allow can be stronger than what you create. As your company grows and adds more employees, you will experience more conflicts with others' vision for your business. 4. Support your employees. Are you giving your employees what they need to succeed? Proper equipment, training and a detailed job description are the minimum. Provide your staff the tools and the target. After all, success breeds even greater success. You shouldn't be afraid to obsess over what your employees need from you. Meet those needs. If you can't, at least give them the courtesy of letting them know why those resources aren't available at this very moment. This takes the frustration and guesswork off your employees' minds. If you want your staff members to stay for years, serve and support them.Related: Why So Many Businesses Mess Up Employee Development5. Pay your workers.Money matters to your employees. They have responsibilities at home and their own aspirations and goals. When they perform, pay them well -- and increase their salaries as your business succeeds. You know you'll need to pay more than the industry standard to keep top talent. It's an investment in your company's most valuable asset, and it's still less expensive than the cost of turnover. You're better off paying higher wages than losing trained individuals who already understand your company.Related: How to Set SalariesDo these five things, and your staff will not only work hard for you, they'll fight for your company.

/article/292914,6 Steps Your HR Team Can Take to Leave the Dark Ages,Automating payroll and outsourcing benefits frees HR staff to focus on recruiting and retaining talented employees.,"The workplace continues to change as workers and clients use technology to communicate and manage operations. However, some HR departments still cling to outdated processes, arguing that it s the way they ve always done things. By resisting moving forward, these teams may hurt their chances of recruiting new employees or impressing clients. Customers may see a business s outdated processes as a sign they don t quite have their act together. Some businesses have outsourced apsects of their HR, especially fast-moving startups run by youger entrepreneurs who haven't been trained in this area.The good news is that businesses can easily make adjustments that will bring their HR teams further into the 21st century. Here are some those effective work practices and how you can implement them.Simplify PayrollOne of the first places to start is in the automation your team members use to make sure your employees get paid. If you re still cutting payroll checks and using manual timesheets, you re wasting valuable time each month. By moving your payroll checks to automatic deposit, you ll also provide a welcome convenience to your employees and contractors. Automation also reduces the risk that you ll make costly mistakes in your recordkeeping, which will help keep you out of trouble at tax time.Related: Payroll Made Easy: Automated Payroll Service Claims To Make the Process Quick and PainlessIncorporate FlexibilityToday s new generation of workers expect flexibility in their work environment, whether that means being allowed to work from home or keeping an hourly schedule that better meets their needs. One study found that 75 percent of employees listed work-life balance as a top priority in a job. You may not be able to offer the best salaries or the nicest office spaces, but you can win and retain employees with an HR team that is less focused on policies and more focused on employee happiness.Related: 5 Secrets to Achieving and Maintaining Work-Life BalanceInclude FreelancersThe freelance economy is growing, with many workers choosing the freedom of contract work over salaried positions. Your HR team may be firmly set on hiring salaried employees despite this, which means you miss out on opportunities to work with some of the best specialists in a given field, whether it s sales, design or engineering. As the freelancer economy continues to grow, your business will find it difficult to compete with the many other HR departments that have embraced the concept of contract work.Related: We're Turning Into a Freelance Nation. Here's What That Looks Like.Recruit ContinuouslyWhen the unemployment rate drops, HR professionals find they must shift from waiting for candidates to apply for openings to recruiting great workers. If you re always on the lookout for great team members, you ll likely find that when an opening does arise, you re fully prepared to fill it. When you do have a position available, your HR teams should shift their focus from placing ads and sorting through applications to attending networking functions and job fairs to find the perfect professionals.Related: 3 Ways to Be Constantly Recruiting Star Talent Through Social MediaHandle Employee IssuesEmployee disagreements are inevitable. If you have an HR team who can gracefully resolve them, you ll have a good shot at creating a positive work environment. Your HR team should be fully trained in conflict resolution, with the ability to work one-on-one with feuding employees to ensure everyone is satisfied. Your HR employees serve as consultants to the rest of your staff, so it s important to ensure they receive regular training in how to properly manage your company s most important asset: its workers.Related How Leaders Can Best Manage Conflict Within Their TeamsAutomateYour payroll is only one of many processes your HR team undertakes each day. A top-quality enterprise resource planning (ERP) system can help bring everything they do under one umbrella to avoid duplicate work. The reports you ll be able to extract will help you better manage the employees and contractors on your teams. You will be able to gain insight into which employees are most productive, employees who take the most vacation time, and similar information that can help in your labor planning.A human resources department serves an important role in an organization, helping bring workers together and supporting managers when they hire, fire, or take disciplinary action. With the right tools in place, HR teams can be far more productive in the work they do, but they ll also need to continually update the way they interact with people. Recognize that not all duties can be outsourced, and that choosing who to recruit or what to automate can be optimized as new technology and ideas come along.John BoitnottJohn Boitnott is a longtime digital media consultant and journalist living in San Francisco.

/article/292882,This Is the Best Way For Tech Startups to Solve Their Image Problem,The secret to customer success and a strong brand is your employees.,"It's no secret that the tech industry has a bit of an image problem. Whether it s the bootstrapping lifestyle or the party culture, tech startups are fighting an uphill battle to improve how they re seen in the public eye and, most importantly, by their customers.There s a crucial first step that many tech companies overlook when they re trying to build their brand and scale with their public image intact. They all have an immediate pool of individuals they should turn to first to foster brand advocacy and loyalty: their employees.It s not just a nice benefit to have your employees love your brand today; it s essential for your business  survival. We live in a world where a disgruntled employee, empowered by social media, can quickly turn hundreds of thousands of customers against a brand.Related: 4 Things You Didn't Think You Would Need When You Scaled Your BusinessToo many times I ve seen companies fail in part because their business priorities came before their employees and culture. Employee success is often placed on a backburner until the company gets larger and a more formal HR team can develop. At this point, the focus is usually on managing back-end HR processes and paperwork -- less so on motivating and cultivating the people themselves.While it s essential to have these processes in place for the organization to run smoothly, there comes a time when employees and company culture need to shift to the forefront. Businesses that deliver a great employee experience will in turn reap the benefits of a great customer experience. Tech companies need to understand that their employees are the gateway to their customers. Focusing on company culture first enlivens and nourishes customer service which, ultimately, strengthens the company brand.For example, at Justworks, we host a weekly All Hands meeting. This hour-long meeting brings together all employees, providing an open forum to discuss team updates, connect with management, brainstorm business approaches and celebrate the successes of our fellow teammates and our company. We ve also established partnerships with One Medical to give employees access to on-demand medical care and Exubrancy to bring yoga, meditation and massages inside the office, ensuring health is a high priority and easily accessible for everyone.Related: How a Stronger HR Function Could Have Helped Uber Avoid the Sexual Harassment ScandalREI and Basecamp are also great examples.Last year, REI made the employee-focused decision to not participate in the madness of day-after-Thanksgiving sales and instead closed all of its stores. This was a clear decision to put employees first and not have them participate in the typically long hours of Black Friday. While the decision itself may not have benefitted customers -- the stores were closed -- the long-term goal was happier employees, which translates directly to happier customers.In the technology space, Jason Fried at Basecamp continues to challenge workplace norms and make decisions that put employees first. At the software company, most employees are remote, profits are distributed to employees, and Fried preaches fewer meetings and a generally calmer workplace. This allows employees to focus, innovate and deliver better products for customers.Investing in activities that internally strengthen employees encourages them to personally invest in meeting the company s goals and, in turn, those of customers.Related: Is Your Employee Development Broken? Here's How to Fix It.At Justworks, we ve made our own employees integral to our mission of helping entrepreneurs better serve their teams. One of the ways we ve approached this is by rebranding our HR team as Employee Success.Many people think of the human resources department as the group responsible for hiring, firing and all the paperwork that comes in between. We decided that our HR team should mean more than that and transcend its traditional, back-office role to focus on the overall employee experience. As Employee Success, this team is building on our company culture and making Justworks the best place to work that it can be -- by launching new benefits, expanding our health and wellness program, and improving our new hire onboarding program.As a company that helps other businesses manage their HR processes, we ve committed ourselves to setting a standard that others can follow. We believe that making the employee experience a priority -- and formalizing that through the Employee Success team -- has given us a strong foundation to better serve our customers and other stakeholders. We ve seen the benefits first hand -- through employees willing to go the extra mile for customers, and business growth as that customer base expands -- and we re not alone.Related: 4 Ways to Personalize the Employee ExperienceFor tech startups and other growing businesses, the decision on whether to invest in employees first can ultimately make or break the company s image and reputation. I urge entrepreneurs to think about their business  mission and long-term plans from Day One as they choose where and how to focus priorities, and consider how internal investments can have an external impact. In the end, even a little bit of employee appreciation can go a long way.Isaac OatesIsaac Oates is the CEO and founder of Justworks, an automated HR and payments platform that helps entrepreneurs build their business and create great places to work.

/article/290458,Got a New Staffer? 10 Ways to Make Them Welcome and Productive.,Details always matter.,"						This story appears in the April 2017 issue of Entrepreneur. Subscribe  Adding to a team can be tricky. So we asked 10 entrepreneurs: How do you welcome new employees and make them part of your culture? 1. Sweat the small stuff.  When someone is new to a team, the little things can be the most frustrating. That s why we make a point to cover them -- what number to dial for an outside line, how to use the photocopier, the best locations for a quick lunch, where the restrooms are. We show them the coffeemaker   and how to refill it.  -- Morag Barrett, founder and CEO, SkyeTeam, Broomfield, Colo. Related: 6 Must-Do Steps to Ensure New Employees Start on the Right Foot2. Pair off. We help new hires identify team members with experience they need to learn. Mentoring can make for more competent employees. The most successful mentorships occur when both people have knowledge to share. We see  reversed mentoring,  where the less experienced employee mentors on a skill they possess that s beneficial to the business.  -- Avi Singer, founder, Showd.me, New York3. Include partners. Before the new hire arrives, send a note to their significant other. This builds emotional bonds and makes them feel connected and involved.  -- Dr. Linda Sharkey, co-author, The Future-Proof Workplace, Wilmington, N.C.4. Make lunch dates. That first day can be a doozy. Just like at summer camp, I like to implement the trusty buddy system. To empower new employees to succeed, I often request that they have a lunch partner on the first day -- someone they ll be working with, or even a few people from the team, who can show him or her around.  -- Helena Cawley, co-founder, Uplift Studios; and CEO/founder, SweatStyle, New YorkRelated: 7 Ways to Make the First Day Perfect for New Hires5. Get  em moving. We send everyone into the field for one day during their first week to see the business firsthand. No one is above getting their hands dirty, and if they come back unhappy, they might not be a good fit. Talking to real customers makes them truly understand the needs of that person on the other side of the phone.  -- Garrett O Shea, president and CMO, PockitShip, Falls Church, Va.6. Show, don t tell.  Because the nuances of business models and strategies can be tripping points, showing new employees a short video to give them  insider  knowledge helps them contribute more quickly. In less than 10 minutes, we cover market landscape, customer segments, positioning, value proposition -- and how they all reflect the company s values.  -- Ted Frank, story strategist, Backstories Studio, Burlingame, Calif.7. Get social. We make it a fun, warm experience -- from having lunch with a C-suite member the first week, to  Price is Right  group games to get to know the products, to team bonding over volleyball and SoulCycle. We welcome team members with open arms, which results in long-lasting employment.  -- Morris Panner, CEO, Ambra Health, New York8. Caffeinate them. When we hire someone new, they get a gift card to a local coffee shop that they re to use for taking each person on the team out to coffee. They can talk about work -- or not. That way everyone knows each other, which makes it a more collaborative, productive and fun work environment.  -- Kelsey Doorey, founder and CEO, Vow To Be Chic, Los AngelesRelated: 10 Tips for Successfully Onboarding Your New Hire9. Yield the floor. We have a meeting called the 404 every Thursday at 4:04 p.m. Each employee gets a chance to host; they supply snacks, drinks and an icebreaker game to connect the team. A new hire typically does a competitive analysis presentation at this meeting, allowing them to quickly understand the market. It also serves as a refresh to the rest of the team.  -- Lizzy Ellingson, co-founder, Blueprint Registry, Seattle10. Party remotely.  We like to have a virtual welcome ceremony in our Slack chat room.

/article/291943,4 Things You Didn't Think You Would Need When You Scaled Your Business,Business owners often believe that figuring out how to grow their business will be their biggest challenge. But that's just the start.,"In our experience, most small organizations want to grow. If you have a business model that is scalable, and you are successful, you are going to face challenges. Think about it. The needs of a business with $500,000 in revenue and four employees are very different from those of a business with $10 million or $100 million in revenue and hundreds of employees.Related: Reasons Your Company Needs to be Metrics-Driven 6 Tips From Tinder Execs on Finding Enough Success to Be AcquiredWe have helped dozens of businesses scale. What we find is that, regardless of the industry, all businesses will encounter many of the same needs as they transition from a micro business, to a small business, to one that is much larger. Here are four things you might not have thought about but that you will need as you grow.Different leadershipThe truth is that the employees who got you from micro to small may not have the horsepower to get you to the next level. We have witnessed it too often. Take a business we recently worked with: The business owner has a loyal employee who has been there from the start. As the business grew, the owner promoted this person several time, and raised his compensation.About a year ago, the owner realized that this long-term employee could not grow the division further. He was out of his depth. What the organization really needed was someone with a much broader skill set and experience.The dilemma -- How does the company afford the new employee it needs when it already supports a highly compensated employee in a senior role? Does the owner terminate the loyal, but less skilled employee? Does the owner cut the incumbent employee s compensation and layer him/her when it hires another, more highly skilled employee?If the owner chooses either option, what does this do to the great morale and culture of the organization? In the case of the company described, the owner has yet to make his decision.Our advice: The best course is not to put your organization in this difficult position in the first place. Don't raise employees  titles and compensation above what their skills, education and experience would fetch in the open market.In addition, have honest conversations with employees about the need to bring in additional talent as the business grows.  Human resourcesWith most businesses, scaling means adding employees. But having more people will bring new challenges to your organization. A firm we worked with that had scaled back during the recession was on the rebound. We worked with its leadership team to assess the issues the organization face.Related: The Hidden Costs of Undervaluing Human ResourcesThe list we put together was one that dealt almost exclusively with employee issues. Hiring, training, employee performance and accountability, discipline, culture, a DOL audit, and compensation issues were all on the list.Unfortunately, the company had cut its HR staff during the recession, as well. Without daily guidance from a knowledgeable expert, the managers were overwhelmed with employee-related issues. That's why we advised the owners to hire an HR manager to help tackle the long list of concerns.Today, the company focus is on growing sales, increasing efficiency and implementing a new software system. The company continues to grow and increase profits.Our advice: As you scale and increase your headcount, you will encounter new and challenging people issues. You can expect to need help with recruitment and training, adding benefits to attract and retain the talent, and the regulations that come with an increased headcount. Don t skimp on HR. You will need expert advice and council to help you through the transitions.Documented processesDocumenting what you do in your organization isn t sexy and no one will pay you a nickel more because you've written your processes down. However, scaling a business without such documentation will create more difficulties then the investment of time to create and write out those systems.We worked with a family-owned broker-dealer, a company that executes trades in the financial markets. The family had placed almost exclusive emphasis on sales and marketing. Because the owners had little interest in operations, they never invested the time to develop appropriate systems or establish documented processes.As they grew, however, their operations floundered. Most of the knowledge about how to do things resided in the heads of the experienced employees. Because processes hadn't been systematically written down, there was no basis for formal training; seasoned employees simply passed down their knowledge.Unfortunately, this method was not reliable. As with any oral tradition, over time, information is lost and inconsistency occurs.This was a problem for the back-office work of a broker/dealer, whose work is typically extremely nuanced. Precision is critical. But at the company we worked with, processors had no documentation to consult. They just did what they thought was best. But without consistent training or documentation, errors increased. Customers grew dissatisfied with the mistakes and inconsistencies.The situation was bad enough in normal times, but the economy's unprecedented market volatility in 2008/2009 resulted in a doubling of this broker-dealer's processing volume in a very short time. The result was near catastrophe.We jumped in to help the company determine what and how to document and met with the managers daily to identify errors, correct them and document the process. Improvements didn t happen overnight, but the company now has the documentation it needs and a training program for new employees. Our advice: When you start to grow, document what you do. Good process documentation has a number of benefits. It ensures that employees complete their work consistently across the organization and over time. It also lessens the impact of key employees leaving and makes training more efficient and effective. Finally, it provides a basis from which to make improvements. If you aren t sure how to do this,you might find it worth the investment to hire an expert.MetricsHow do you know if you are winning, if you don t know the score? When a business is small, the owner is typically involved in every aspect of the enterprise. Once it transitions from a small to a large company, the owner can no longer be involved in every detail. No one can. The business is too complicated.  The broker/dealer described above suffered from just such a lack of metrics. As we began to engage with the company, we asked the person responsible for running the back office to provide all of the metrics used to run the operation. When he responded that there weren t any, we thought that he was being intentionally difficult. Actually, he was telling the truth.The company knew it made too many errors, but it had no way to quantify the issue. Standards for service delivery were nonexistent; a mechanism for quantifying performance didn't exist.The managers  knew things weren t good, but they didn t know how bad they actually were. And attempting to make processes systematic without metrics to track results didn't work; it was never clear how much progress, if any, had been made. As we had done with the lack of processes, we worked with the management team to identify and develop metrics. This gave management the information it needed to make good decisions.Our advice: Metrics let an entrepreneur sleep at night. They tell you what is going on in your business -- both good and bad. Without them, you have no way to know what to fix, or to tell if your efforts are effective. Metrics also go well beyond your monthly financials.So, develop a robust set of daily, weekly and monthly metrics on key measures in your business. Again, if you need help with this, it is probably worth the investment to seek out expert advice.Related: 10 Ways to Grow Leaders in Your BusinessOften, business owners believe that figuring out how to grow their business will be their biggest challenge.

/article/285067,Who Do You Trust to Hire Your Next Top Employee?,Why you should add a recruiter to your talent-acquisition team.,"You run a fast-growing company. You have to hire talented people, and you have to hire them quickly. So, who do you trust to find the right people and get them into the fold?Your first impulse might be to put a human resources (HR) professional in charge of all of your recruiting and hiring, but think twice before you do. You need someone who can sell your business concept, ideas and vision to professionals who may already have a good job with a long-standing employer. If you ve started a new company, the skill of selling becomes even more important.Gone are the days when you placed an ad and then passively sat back and waited for applications to come in. Talent shortages are a top concern for CEOs worldwide. Businesses are fighting for the best, most talented workers. To compete in that arena, you need a salesperson. You need a professional recruiter to help you build your team, and it has to be one you can trust.  I am the CEO and founder of a relatively young company. We re growing quickly, but we have to hire the right people. We work too closely together to accept anything less than total professionalism and teamwork. (And our clients demand it.)I ve found success in going after people I want, rather than waiting for them to come to me. We post open positions, but I also keep an eye on social media sites. Most of the time, the people we want aren t actively looking for employment, but they aren t happy with their jobs and are open if you contact them and are able to sell them on your vision.That s how I ve found some of our best team members. It hasn t been easy to assemble a top-notch team, and we are never done. Also, whether we re currently hiring or not, we keep some positions posted on our website -- just in case. You never know when your next top employee will find you and submit an application.Here are some lessons I ve learned about building and maintaining a good team:If you want good employees, be good to your employees. Never refer to them as  my staff  or  my employee.  I try to refer to them as  my colleagues.  It s just two words, but it means a lot.Create win-win situations for the people you want. Know what they want out of their next job and be willing to give a little to make it happen for them.Rub elbows at trade shows or professional development events. The best people will be there, so it s a perfect time to strike up a conversation and get to know possible future employees.Stay in touch on LinkedIn and other social media sites. Even if you re not hiring at the moment, it s good to know who s out there.Let me be clear: HR is essential for any company, but it takes a different personality to do HR processes than proactive recruiting. While it's possible to perform the functions of both, most people are better at one than the other.Recruiting is no longer just an HR function. Recruiters are becoming more appropriately known as talent acquisition specialists, and they re excellent at knowing how to market a company.

/article/285866,3 Onboarding Tips That Close the Gap for Remote Employees,Consider these strategies to foster engagement and peak performance.,"What does the first day at a new job look like for a remote employee? Work attire: likely comfy clothes. Start time: flexible, perhaps with a  welcome to the team  conference call at 9 a.m. First assignment: Start getting familiar with new-hire training tools. There s not a lot of oversight for a new remote employee, meaning the first-day jitters are probably less of an issue.Studies show that home-based employees are more productive. Besides the benefit this brings to employers, remote work comes with dreamy perks for employees: work-life balance, flexible hours and unlimited workspace options.However, there are some hidden disadvantages to working remotely. Spontaneous brainstorms, team-building and personal connections with coworkers -- all key factors in employee engagement -- are missing from the home office atmosphere.These challenges are especially important for leadership and human resources teams to consider when bringing new remote employees up to speed. Here are three onboarding strategies to keep your remote employees happy and performing at their best.1. Set up regular check-ins.A natural first step in the onboarding process is job training. While there are many digital tools available for onboarding remote employees, it s even more important to anticipate the need for open and frequent communication. Whether training takes place in-office or online, make sure key onboarding staff anticipate questions that a remote employee might have as he or she settles into a new role. Team members working remotely won t have the opportunity to wander around the office and brainstorm potential solutions when uncertainties arise, so having regular check-in meetings is essential.Dedicated onboarding specialists are a tremendous asset when it comes to welcoming new employees. A  buddy system  can also be helpful -- pairing seasoned employees with new hires can provide extra guidance, institutional knowledge and a personal connection.2. Create opportunities for team-building.For remote staff, casual chatter around the water cooler is not an option for getting to know the rest of the team. If weekly meetings are a time for the whole staff to get together, eliminate any confusion by introducing remote employees to the team from the get-go. Create an inclusive atmosphere from day one by setting up a meet-and-greet so in-office staff and remote employees can get to know each other. Make sure remote workers are looped in on staff gatherings outside the office, if the distance is appropriate. Creating opportunities for togetherness will help close the gap in the long-distance relationship between remote employees and in-office staff.Annual in-person team meetings are a great way to connect employees and build a sense of community within an organization. Formstack, a company with a largely remote workforce, has begun hosting annual  all hands  weeks to gather employees scattered across the globe. Such events help to create a culture of transparency, communication and fun -- all essential ingredients to maintaining a healthy relationship with remote employees.3. Invest in continuing education.Continuing education programs are investments in your employees s futures. These programs are especially important when it comes to remote employees, as they demonstrate that you value their continued success within the company and beyond. Your company can provide opportunities for employees to attend conferences or complete professional development courses and certifications. Likewise, you can encourage growth by implementing programs for tuition reimbursement or training as well as creating leadership roles for existing employees to fill.Whether it s a small-scale option, such as weekly webinars, or a bigger gesture, such as sending employees to annual conferences, building development opportunities into the onboarding process for remote employees will go a long way toward making them feel like an important part of the team.Chris ByersChris Byers is the CEO of Formstack, an Indianapolis-based company offering an online form and data-collection platform.

/article/290874,Want to Make More Money? Get Comfortable Asking This One Hard Question.,You can't negotiate salary without this crucial knowledge.,"I recently spoke to a friend who was interviewing for a new job and she said,  You would be so proud of me. I asked for a ten percent raise!  And I said,  Ten percent of what?   Ten percent of what I was making at my old job,  she said with a smile.I was not smiling, though. Yes, I m happy that my girlfriend is in the mind-set of asking for more, but I was not pleased that she asked for 10 percent more than her old job. Why? The first problem with that is that she offered up the exact amount of her old salary to her new employer; that is a no-no. The second problem is that she asked for the 10 percent before knowing what that position at the new company paid. My friend had made $80,000 at her old job and asked for $88,000. Sounds like a nice bump until you learn that the person who held her new position before her was making $110,000. What she should have done is, first, get that piece of information. Then get the offer, and then ask for 10 percent more of that, which is $121,000. By not having that very important benchmark of what that position typically paid, she negotiated against herself and cost herself $23,000 extra. Ouch.Related: 8 Ways to Negotiate Your Way to a Higher SalaryNow, my sweet, wicked-smart friend knows a lot about a lot of things, but she didn t know the ins and outs of negotiating your salary. I mean, we don t learn this stuff in school. We learn about the bullshit Pythagorean theorem, but we don t learn basic business skills, which, of course, boggles my Boss Bitch mind. All she knew was that she needed to  negotiate,  but she didn t know where to start. I don t blame her, and she shouldn t blame herself. After all, it s important to forgive yourself for not knowing what you haven t learned. And then learn it, grow, repeat. Hating on your former self for not previously knowing what you know now is a waste of time time that should be spent putting that lesson into action.Back to my friend. When I broke it to her that not finding out the going rate for her new job had cost her $23,000, she responded,  Honestly, how could I ask someone what they make? It s so taboo and so awkward; who would tell me that?!  She s right. People are so weird about talking about their salary. In fact, I did a study with Nielsen that shows that women would rather admit their weight than their salary. Yes, neither subject is super fun to talk about. But it begs the question: What are we so guarded about?When people ask me for advice about negotiating their salary, the first question I ask is:  What do you make?  Because how the hell am I supposed to help you if I don t know what I m working with? The second question is  What do other people in your position make?  Because how can you know how you re stacking up if you don t know what your colleagues and peers are pulling in?Related: The Highest Paying Jobs in America, According to GlassdoorUnless you re position is CEO of a publicly traded company, this information is probably hard to get. Why? Dirty little secret: The bosses don t want employees to share this information with one another because they know it could be used as leverage in negotiations.Enter: moi. Yup, I m the girl who is in a room with a bunch of women who work together and has no shame throwing down the question of how much you make. And when I do? Crickets. Fucking crickets. Sometimes they hem and haw. And I don t let them get away with it. I ask them again and don t let up until I get an answer. They will happily talk to me about sex positions and bikini waxes, no problem, but salary?! Well, that s too taboo. Are you kidding me?We all want to make more. We say we all want to help each other make more, but if that s really the case, then why the secrecy with the very thing that will help us do that? I m not asking my friends to tell me their salary because I want to make them feel anything but empowered to rise up.Related: 6 Calculators That Can Help You Determine Your SalarySo here are some answers to the questions about my salary you might be wondering about. I m not too chickenshit to put my money where my mouth is, and I encourage you to follow my lead.

/article/290771,The 'Whys' of Why You Should Consider HR Software for Your Small Business,Be wary of going with a desktop software in a business world that's being shaped around the cloud.,"Free Webinar | August 16thFind out how to optimize your website to give your customers experiences that will have the biggest ROI for your business.							Register Now  Everywhere you turn, software seems to be the answer. You re probably already using software for your marketing, accounting and management. But have you yet considered the need for human resources software in your small business? In fact, it s much more than a luxury. Businesses that use HR software would likely call it a necessity.Related: 5 Ways HR Technology Can Improve Performance ReviewsWhat is HR software?In its simplest form, HR software means specific platforms that combine different systems and processes to ensure a business  employees are readily accessible when needed and data is properly stored.All HR software, of course, is different, and each business has unique needs and applications. But systems typically include payroll management, benefits administration, attendance recordkeeping and time stamps, or some combination of those functions.HR automation isn t new, but we are finally at a point where it s cost effective and feasible for small businesses to utilize. You can trace automation all the way back to the late 1970s when big corporations started using ERP systems to overcome the manual limitations they faced with the use of mainframe computers.In 1987, the first totally HR-centered platform was released by Oracle (which still offers premium HR tools today). Since then, dozens of systems have been launched and improved upon. There was a lot of innovation in this space in particular in the late 1990s and early 2000s, but it was only recently that HR software finally became cost effective (thanks to the cloud infrastructure).The benefits of HR SoftwareIf you ve been manually handling HR operations in the past, you may wonder about the benefits of paying for a software system. But take a closer look:1. Cost savingsAre you familiar with the cost of employee turnover? Chances are, you ve drastically underestimated what it really costs your company to replace an employee. According to research from different studies, a company will spend anywhere from 16 percent to 213 percent of its average employee s annual salaries to hire someone new.Replacing even someone in a low-paying job is likely to amount to 16 percent of his or her salary. So, for an hourly employee making $10 an hour, you re talking about roughly $3,328 when all is said and done. That number scales to 20 percent for a mid-range position ($30,000 to $50,000) and then balloons to a whopping 213 percent for executive positions. (Need to replace a CEO earning $100,000? That will cost you roughly $213,000.)Related: A New Wave of HR Technology Is Disrupting the MarketWhat does all of this have to do with HR software? Well, a good HR platform helps reduce turnover by ensuring employees  needs are taken care of. Furthermore, it makes the process of finding the right candidates simpler. As a result, there s less likelihood of hiring someone who s wrong for the position -- which further drives up costs.2. Better use of timeTime is the one thing your HR staff can t get more of. Thus, it s imperative that you help them create systems that maximize time. If your HR team is constantly inputting data by hand, making phone calls and manually vetting candidates for openings, they won t have time for things that matter more -- like handling legal issues and enforcing company policies.An HR software platform isn t a perfect solution, but it certainly helps businesses save time and better allocate manual resources to areas that really matter to a company s health.3. More accurate insightsWith the amount of data that comes through an HR department these days, it s virtually impossible for any person -- or group of people -- to process everything. This means valuable information is constantly being overlooked or misplaced.The beauty of working with HR software is that you don t have to rely on your own human limitations. Data is synthesized and analyzed in powerful ways that allow you to obtain more accurate insights and make strategic decisions.4. Surprisingly cost effective Many business people believe that purchasing a top-quality HR software package will bankrupt their entire marketing budget. This is simply not true,  business consultant Malcolm Rowlings said.  Some of the best HR packages have financing programs and monthly memberships that can work with even the smallest startup budget. Some would even argue that you can t afford not to use HR software. The amount of money you re losing in terms of lost man-hours and mistakes doesn t even begin to compare to the up-front cost of HR software. It s an easy call to make.The features to look forIf you re in the market for HR software, you have plenty of choices. In order to narrow down your options, you need to know what you re looking for:1. Cloud platform. There are plenty of desktop and on-premises HR software applications available today. Many of them are useful and, surprisingly, pack a pretty powerful punch. However, be wary of going with a desktop software in a business world that s being shaped around the cloud.Cloud software platforms are so much more valuable these days. Take People HR software, one of the leaders in this niche, as an example. Whereas a desktop solution requires the user to actually be in the office and log on to a particular computer in order to access the platform, a tool like People lets employees access information regardless of whether they re in the office or using their smartphone in an airport.That s the power of the cloud.2. Self-Service Features. The more you re able to offload responsibilities from your HR team, the more useful they can be. In other words, if your HR team doesn t have to worry about constantly emailing the same answers to employees who repeatedly ask about sick days and pay stubs, they can focus on big-picture tasks that really matter. This is where self-service features come into play.A self-service HR software platform   such as the one Paylocity offers   puts the power in the hands of employees by developing a centralized portal that employees, managers and HR can all access. It lets employees request days off or review payroll details, while HR can monitor what s happening and get notifications when approval is required.3. Scalability. The third thing you need to be cognizant of is scalability. If you re like most companies, you re anything but stagnant. You re most likely growing, and the last thing you want is to invest in an HR system, learn how to use it and then have to replace it because your team outgrew it.Good HR software is scalable in the sense that you only pay for what you need. And when you need more access, you simply upgrade without interruption. Most of today s leading cloud systems -- such as People -- are scalable, but make sure you evaluate this in the vetting process.Make the right choice.HR software finally makes sense for small businesses. It s equal parts functional and cost-effective, which means there are very few negatives to investing in this technology.Related: How This Startup Is Aiming to Make HR EasierHowever, you do need to do your research and know what you re looking for. Every platform is different, and you ll want to be sure that you re getting access to the features you need.

/article/290779,5 Signs Your Boss Might be a Psychopath (Your Emails Might Hold the Biggest Clues),How do you know if you work with a psychopath? Asking for a friend.,"They re charismatic, unpredictable and make you do things you never imagined.These traits could describe the most inspirational bosses you ever had. But as we learned at a SXSW panel this week, they could also describe psychopaths when combined with other key traits such as ego, self-deception and callousness.In fact, the panel s experts say there s almost one psychopath for every 100 people, with rates shooting up in the workplace, especially in leadership, thanks to psychopaths  ease with manipulation. Research finds that nearly 4 percent of corporate CEOs are psychopaths, and this rate is nearly doubled among middle managers. (Shockingly, the share of psychopaths among middle managers is nearly as high as the share of psychopaths in medium security prisons.)Related: SXSW: Billionaire Chris Sacca on Tech's New Business BlindspotIn the world of startups, psychopaths could be particularly hard to spot. Psychopaths might be irrational and driven by ego, but so are successful entrepreneurs, points out Brian Stolle, a venture capitalist who says he s worked with founders who fit a psychopathic profile.Entrepreneurship, by nature, forces you to do unnatural things such as putting aside friends and family for the good of a company. And since no startup is successful without a team, Stolle says, charismatic startup founders must convince others to commit the same seemingly unnatural acts, making it all the more difficult to separate old fashioned hustle from a psychopath s expert manipulation. They convince you that something can be done that no one else thinks can be done,  Stolle says.They can be hurtful and cold, with bullying driving costly turnover and destroying a staff s quality of life. Thankfully, true psychopaths do share certain traits -- ones you might recognize from chats, texts and emails. These distinct language and behavior patterns can help anyone cope and possibly even make the most of a psychopath s contributions to a team.Related: SXSW 2017: There's a Scary Reason You'll Start Taking Digital Privacy SeriouslyWhat s psychopathic and what s notThere s a difference between psychopaths and just people we d consider difficult or even erratic or violent, says Michael Woodward, a registered psychologist who has studied psychopathic murderers. A psychopath stands out, Woodward says, thanks to a  blend of interpersonal, lifestyle and behavioral deficits  that they can mask, at least for a period of time. Woodward explains,  They come across as very charming and very gregarious. But beneath that veneer lies a lack of remorse, an amorality and a real callousness. Related: SXSW 2017: The CEO of this Futuristic Automaker Makes Time for Art -- and Maybe You Should, TooWhat to look for: In language1. Hostility: Psychopaths have an emotional deficit and don t discuss others much or express anxiety. However, psychopaths do use a a lot of negative, hostile language, regardless of who they re talking to, since they aren t able to modulate their speech for different audiences. They ll talk the same way to a friend, to a work colleague or on a post on on social media. This behavior can be jarring -- shocking even.2. Profanity: Psychopaths also like to swear. So much so, that Stolle uses profanity as a test when evaluating which startups to work with. He asks founders to drop the F-bomb in conversation to see how they ll react.3. Complex language: An emotional deficit can also make psychopaths hard to understand. There s a connection between emotional understanding and its impact on reading and writing, says Jeff Hancock, a professor at Stanford University known for his research on how people use technology to deceive. This disconnect means a psychopath uses more complicated language and odd phrasing especially in written communication.Tenses psychopaths use can be another important tell. Though they usually talk in first person, when describing a negative event, they'll switch to third person. They'll also couch that event further in the past then it might have occurred. Both of these strategies help them distance themselves from a problem to which they might have contributed. What to look for: Actions4. Lies: All of us lie -- often a few times a day -- but psychopaths don t lie for a specific purpose, Hancock says. While most members of the general population might fib to save someone s feelings or hide a mistake, psychopaths lie sheerly to manipulate. They receive pleasure from the mere act of deceiving people -- something he calls a  duping delight. What to look for: Motivation5. Selfishness: Psychopaths are driven by their own needs, and talk of sex, food and money will consume their conversations. In describing this phenomenon, Woodward described something he calls ""the chicken wing effect,"" a term sparked by his own research with convicted murderers.When discussing a killing, Woodward was shocked at how little one prisoner talked about his actual crime and how much detail he d used to describe the 15-cent chicken wing deal he d snagged at a strip club the day of the murder. Non-psychopaths would never think to bring up these details and would, in fact, discuss a crime in moral terms. Psychopaths, on the other hand, are stuck in survival mode, Hancock adds, and can t move up from the lowest rungs of Maslow s hierarchy of needs.Related: SXSW 2017: The Simple Lessons Reshaping the Cities and Cars of the FutureWhat to do:Tread carefully. Psychopaths can be erratic bullies, but they recruit protectors. These might be appointed lackeys who act as close confidents or even investors that they know will wait out a dicey situation for a strong exit. Unfortunately, members of human resources are often among their protectors, since psychopaths are often in leadership positions. As a result, the people in the best position to stop a situation from worsening choose not to, reinforcing bad behaviors over time.These protectors aren t even truly safe from a psychopath s erratic behavior. Psychopaths care about people who serve a need for them. Once someone stops serving that need, they re discarded. Psychopaths can turn on these allies on a dime and even push them out of an organization, Woodward says.Help them succeed. Because psychopaths are bold thinkers, Woodward says, they can do great things for organizations initially. Feeding their hero mentality can fuel good constructive acts for a company -- at least in the short term.Show your interest. Psychopaths are interested in themselves, but also interested in you being interested in them.  They genuinely believe in their expertise and their abilities,  Woodward says. Keeping this in mind can likely make your interactions with a psychopath more successful.Negotiate through writing. Psychopaths are most successful face to face, Hancock says. They play off non-verbal reactions using mimicry and by simulating others  emotions. They re engaged, seeing the effect of their manipulations first-hand and in real time. Written communication, on the other hand, removes people from their charms. And as chats, emails and texts become less interesting to psychopaths, they can become more practical, effective and powerful overall.  Text-based communication is a shield,  Hancock says.Set ground rules. When working with a psychopath, a few simple guidelines can be essential, Stolle advises. If you choose to do something, ask if it s something you want to do and aligns with your values, he suggests. Checking against these principles can keep you focused on the task s needs, not the psychopath s needs, and protect your own peace of mind.Linda LacinaLinda Lacina is the managing editor at Entrepreneur.com.

/article/283843,4 Ways to Personalize the Employee Experience,Personalization goes beyond just wellness programs and coffee perks -- it needs to be applied to the entire employee experience.,"The employee experience is what makes or breaks retention. Simply put, if employees enjoy their work, they will stay.However, this is no easy feat. The best way to improve the employee experience is by giving them a personalized experience. Employees don t want to feel like just a number in the books. They want to feel special and have an employer who knows how they prefer to be treated.Take a look at how wellness programs are used. The Whispers From the Water Cooler survey by Welltok and National Business Group on Health found that 37 percent of the 1,000 employees surveyed did not find health programs personally relevant and 20 percent didn't know they were available, a strong indication that greater personalization and awareness is needed to drive employee engagement.Personalization goes beyond just wellness programs and coffee perks -- it needs to be applied to the entire employee experience. Here s how employers should make the change:1. Create a talent mobility program.Motivate the staff by investing in their professional growth. The 2014 Global Workforce Study by Towers Watson found that career advancement opportunities are among the top driving forces for employees, according to more than 32,000 respondents.A talent mobility program empowers employees with clear, documented processes that will guide them to advance within the company. When employees are given a chance to learn and grow, they are motivated to stay.Promote the talent mobility program to boost interest and encourage enrollment. Then start catering training and development to each person s unique interests, talents and personal goals.Customized action plans are impactful and far more efficient that one-size-fits-all training. A one-size program may bore employees who want to learn a different skill, or the teaching style might leave some behind. It s best to identify each person s style of learning so they can be taught in the most effective method. Try to connect each employee to the path they want and invest in educating them to expand their skill sets in a way that works toward not only personal goals, but also a stronger organization, collectively.2. Start recognizing employees.People want to know how they are doing in their work. A recognition process helps streamline communication, adds structure, and defines impactful recognition practices.It should be fair and equal for each person, and systematic in giving out rewards and incentives to those who earn it. Display information about it and get people excited by offering diverse rewards. Make use of technology and create a digital space for everyone to socialize and engage on. This will keep everyone in the loop, and it gives management a social space to announce updates and celebrate employees who succeed.Publicly celebrating everyone when they earn it is important to adding a positive element to the company culture. Everyone responds to recognition differently, so it s important to find out what motivates everybody. Ask for feedback and adjust the rewards to improve the results.3. Perform regular evaluations.Don t wait a full year to check in with people. Sit down one on one with employees on a frequent basis to gauge how they are doing and to offer help if they seem to be underperforming and struggling with their workload.When supervisors do this, employees feel noticed and are motivated because they see the impact they can have on operations. Provide them with impactful performance data so they can visualize where they are succeeding and where they should be making improvements.Train managers to give constructive feedback so employees can get personalized direction on their performance. Help them define an action plan, and check back in with them regularly to make adjustments until they find what works for them.4. Foster strong relationships.Not everything has to be addressed through strict processes and stuffy meetings. Prioritize getting to know the staff on a personal level. The 2015 Employee Job Satisfaction and Engagement Survey by the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM) found that 58 percent of the 600 employees surveyed say their relationship with their immediate supervisor is  very important. Prioritize building stronger relationships and connecting with employees as people. Host fun get-togethers outside the office and talk about hobbies and personal life details in an appropriate way.Employees are more than just an asset -- ask about their kids, go to their band s shows, read their blogs and start a book club. The culture needs a human element, and fostering close relationships with everyone is the key to building that kind of culture.Kes ThygesenKes Thygesen is the co-founder and head of product at RolePoint, a complete social recruiting suite that provides unrivaled access and reach to quality job candidates.Read more",Leadership,2017-03-19 18:00:00
/article/289940,5 Questions You Must Ask to Keep Your Best and Brightest Talent,Creativity emerges because of our human messiness -- not in spite of it.,"Organizations love the safety of structure. We establish hierarchies, functions, divisions, teams, clusters and groups. We sort workers into classes. We designate bosses to oversee other bosses. We track revenue and customer channels. We count and group each expense. Everything is gathered and arranged into tidy haystacks of commerce.Yet this focus on organization inevitably clashes with the human aspects of life. Most of us were taught to dutifully maintain the barrier between home and work. From the first burger we flipped, it's been ingrained in us that work is orderly, home is messy and the two never should meet. The world, though, never works out quite that cleanly.Free-range employees.The reality is we are human -- a term that differentiates us in a positive way from the inorganic world in which we spend our workdays. It s OK to spend time on our favorite websites when we should be focused on our work. It s normal to eat the donuts in the break room only when you're sure no one is looking. We naturally bring personal worries and issues into the workplace. We are untidy and cluttered, and it's all part of our evolutionary urges. Even in the confines of the supermarket aisles, we're moved to buy the chicken labeled as ""free-range."" It might not necessarily taste better, but it soothes our desire for less restrictions. Deep down, we might even be jealous of the chickens (up until a certain point, of course).Related: Embrace Your Employees' Differences to Become a Stronger Business LeaderIf we recognize the pull of the unstructured, why do most business leaders insist on a clear demarcation between personal and professional lives? Why do we segment employees  lives instead of seeing them as whole individuals?One plausible answer: fear. We all know how messy our lives can be. No self-respecting manager wants to insert her- or himself into the drama whirlwind. It s easier to demand that employees solve their personal issues on their own. The mandate always has been clear: Don t bring your personal baggage into the workplace. Another possible reason for failing to embrace the whole employee is even less flattering. Many employers continue to see their employees as widgets. When we examine employee survey responses, we find that employers too often view their employees as machines producing an hour of labor. And that hour of labor must be deployed for the organization's benefit. In today s knowledge economy, however, it's quite possible we've got it all wrong. Just how workers most fully contribute to a business' success might not fit within the rows on a timesheet.The 'Age of the Employee.'Companies used to call all the shots, confident that employees would stay put for their entire careers. No longer. We now live in the  Age of the Employee.  Improving workers  conditions for social reasons is a noble thought, but it isn't necessarily why we've seen the balance shift. Economic success depends on creativity and talent more than it requires raw labor. Winning organizations find a way to attract, engage and retain the best talent. Management s conundrum: Those superstars have many more options than they once did. Consider the difference between Apple and the manufacturing firms of the 20th century. In the 1900s, behemoths built their empires on labor and infrastructure -- sheer manpower. Apple, however, has secured its success primarily by producing creative and innovative products that consumers want (but don't necessarily need).In fact, most of the goods and services in the modern marketplace aren't necessities. Inventories either are physical or virtual warehouses of luxuries. To attract buyers, a company must offer a compelling offer. And talent -- not force -- produces that compelling quality. Related: 4 Innovative Benefits That Will Help You Snag Top TalentYou re going to let your employees do what?Here's where it starts to get a little uncomfortable for businesses and managers. If they want to be the most compelling standout in their market, they have to let people create. As we know, people aren t neat and orderly like assembly lines. People are complex, and they have lives outside of work. We teach that the ""Age of the Employee  will force organizations to meet the needs of the whole employee. Only then can workers generate the type of intellectual property that means the difference between nameless failure and chart-topping success. Related: Why 'Kids These Days' Make Great Workers  Nikola Tesla's life provides a well-used cautionary tale about the need to consider the whole employee. Tesla originally sought Thomas Edison as a mentor and employer. But Edison couldn t find a way to accommodate Tesla s quirkiness. Edison was about trial and error, and Tesla s mind operated much differently. Tesla eventually left Edison's workshop, taking his genius and ideas with him to George Westinghouse. Westinghouse soon became a formidable competitor to Edison -- mainly because Tesla discovered a better way to transmit electrical current. In fact, Tesla's alternating current (AC) is the standard today. Obviously, not everyone is a fit. Keeping Tesla in his shop might not have worked out well for Edison. But the exception shouldn't govern the rule, and in new business, that rule reads like this: The more talent you have, the better your organization will be. Executives, talent professionals and human-resources leaders need to think differently to keep the Teslas of the world from leaving their companies.As you develop your own organization's employee experience, ask these questions to build an operating environment that will help attract, engage and retain the best and the brightest. 1. Is your employee experience (EX) engineered to promote hourly output or actual value?Despite opposing research, many leaders assume the number of hours worked is the best way to measure an employee s value (or even the leader s own). In other words: Hours worked = the best work product. Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer seems to advocate this line of thinking. She recently appeared to brag about working 130 hours per week. Yet there's no real science or data to support this longstanding corporate doctrine. In reality, the equation is:The right talent = the best work product, regardless of how the work product comes into being. Related: 7 Warning Signs You're the Dreaded Micromanager2. Are you looking to create a good cultural fit for your employees? Is your employee value proposition (a subset of your EX) engineered to attract employees that mesh well with your business objectives? If you need software developers, have you structured your EX to support their needs and interests? A Salt Lake City-based company recently started a billboard campaign intended to entice developers. It promised them the opportunity to develop cool code and still have time to see their families. 3. Are you creating a culture that aligns with the needs of the whole employee? Creativity doesn't live only within the hours between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. Inspiration might strike when a young software developer is attending a conference on data visualization and learning new things far away from the office. Viewed through the old-school lens, though, it could appear this employee is doing something that many once considered unproductive. Related: How to Create Productive Workspaces for Your Company4. Does your culture support and promote learning and curiosity? This question is related to the previous point. Humans are organic, and their intellectual contributions must be cultivated. Brilliance cannot be squeezed out of an employee like you force toothpaste from a tube. Innovation comes in flashes, fits and starts. It pops up in unexpected places, from the shower to the racquetball court.5. When was the last time you really examined your business practices as they relate to your employees?It feels safe to follow the tested path. But when it comes to employee relations, are you keeping pace with peers in your market? It would be misguided to believe the same tactics that got you where you are today will guide you toward tomorrow s accomplishments. The only real insight you should take from prior achievement is that it worked -- once. Past success is a poor predictor of a bright future. Consider the  gambler s fallacy:  After five bad hands in a row, you're due to get a good one. But the probabilities are exactly the same each time a new game starts, and it's no different in business. Each new business generation is like starting all over again with the same odds as your first hand. You're not owed a break, and you certainly shouldn't bank on the promise of a winning streak.Related: 6 Ways Millennials Have Changed Business PracticesAs you build or modify your employee experience to be more responsive to what workers seek in the ""Age of the Employee,"" these questions might uncover some uncomfortable answers from time to time. That's OK, too. It's the organic, human world of chaos and change that creates innovation. The environment you develop to support those discoveries should not only accommodate that messiness, it should embrace everything that whole employees bring to the table.

/article/289142,How This Introvert Founder Became a Billion-Dollar Leader,The key is compassion and energy.,"						This story appears in the March 2017 issue of Entrepreneur. Subscribe  Paul English sold Kayak to Priceline in 2012 for $1.8 billion. Now he is reentering the industry with Lola, a mobile app that combines AI with human travel agents to plan and book trips. And at both companies, he says, the key to success is the people he hires. By texting with Lola agents, users can book hotels and flights, get restaurant recommendations and get help with itinerary planning. Were you a fan of travel agents back in the day?Really back in the day, I used AAA. But I ve also used a cruise travel agent, Wayland Travel for a safari, and, last year, American Express  concierge service in Japan. The trip to Tokyo was motivated by the documentary Jiro Dreams of Sushi. I was obsessed with it -- not because of the sushi, but because of this whole idea of what happens when a human being commits their life to perfection. Immediately after seeing the film, I got a couple of friends to go with me. One said she could get us a reservation at Sukiyabashi Jiro. Guaranteed. But at the last minute, her attempt fell through. So I called American Express and asked,  What s the best sushi restaurant in Tokyo?  They gave us a really unique recommendation that I never would have discovered on my own.Related: 5 Mega-Successful Entrepreneurs Who Are IntrovertsHow do you vet Lola s agents for that level of knowledge?We have one woman who has been to every island in the Caribbean. When we get a Caribbean question, it s delegated to her. But if a question is too exotic for us, we advise our agents to be transparent. They might say,  I haven t been there before, but I can do a ton of research for you. You identify as an introvert. How did you learn to be extroverted for work? Do you have to flip a switch in your brain?I have 50 people in my company. Sometimes it s comfortable for me to sit in front of my computer and do email and Slack all day. But if that s literally all I do, it s sucking energy out of the room. People want to engage with me. I need to force myself to get up. It s a lot easier to transmit energy face-to-face than to transmit it electronically. I always keep my calendar open for breakfast, lunch and dinner. So at the last minute, I can just grab a few people I haven t seen in a while. Sometimes we have an agenda, but mostly it s just socializing, which is really important. There s efficiency to Slack and email, but without that human connection, it goes flat.Much of your work goes back to this  human  element. At Kayak, you made your coders field phone calls for customer service issues. How come?We re doing it at Lola as well. Only humans can have compassion. If you don t put them on the line together, you build layers of buffers between customers and engineers: customer support managers, product managers, designers, quality assurance engineers, engineering managers  By that point, the customer is so far removed from the engineer, the engineer has no compassion for the customer. By forcing the engineers to talk directly to the customers, they can design software to better address their problems.Related: The 10 Most Critical Factors That Dictate Startup SuccessWhat are some other lessons you learned at Kayak that helped you with Lola?The most important thing any entrepreneur can do is focus on the team. When I interview people, there are two things I look for. One is their GSD --  get shit done  -- score. Do they have technical chops? The other 50 percent is: Are they energy amplifiers? Are they someone whom people enjoy being around? A lot of what I focused on at Kayak and what I m focusing even more so on at Lola is playing the role of coach or organizational psychologist. I observe interactions, debug them and make sure we re set up for success.What is your debugging strategy? If I have two people who don t work well together and I just separate them, I ve lost the ability for those people to give each other positive energy. So when something is dysfunctional, I talk to each person individually and then bring them together and say,  You re both extremely valued here, but you re not clicking, and I want to know what we need to do.  Sometimes it s just a matter of being open and naming a problem.That s very hands-on. Many managers hate dealing with personnel issues. But you obviously see it differently: Without these one-on-ones working, the whole company won t work.Yeah, and it won t work well. I m not interested in running a  successful  company, I m interested in running an exciting company where people love their job.You once hired a guy who d earned an Olympic medal in rowing. You said,  This guy is hard-core, and I bet that translates.  In that instance, you were right. Have you ever been wrong? I ve made the mistake of hiring someone whose style is so radically different from the team that it just didn t work. So the trick there is, I want diversity of style, but not too much diversity. There s a fine line.You ve talked about having bipolar disorder and your own hypomania and OCD tendencies. Do you become fixated on prospective hires? My friends call it my pedestal complex. When I meet somebody who has a skill I don t have, I put them on a pedestal and worship them. And my friends are like,  Oh, God, here he goes again.  I probably fall a little in love with everyone, in some way. But I ve seen this movie enough times to know how it s going to play out, so I try to manage my own expectations. Like, there s a guy I just hired who is developing the user interface of the next version of Lola, and he s unbelievably strong. I m trying to temper myself so I don t focus too much on him, because what if he disappoints me, like, a month from now and he s not as fast a coder as I think he is? I m attracted to shiny new objects.In Tracy Kidder s new biography of you, A Truck Full of Money: One Man s Quest to Recover from Great Success, he explores the idea of whether your manic spells are responsible for your entrepreneurial confidence, or whether you succeed despite them. What do you think?They definitely played a role. There s this romantic notion about the intersection of art and mental illness. But I do a lot of work with homelessness in Boston, and there are a lot of bipolar and schizophrenic people on the streets -- and let me tell you, it s not very romantic. Mental illness can be very cruel. But if you re just touched with some type of mental illness and it makes you look at the world differently than most people and you happen to be creative and/or bright, it can be a wonderful thing. My manic phases last weeks and sometimes months. I have enormous energy, I get by with little sleep, I m always excited and I m always excitable. I can lead a team when I have that kind of manic energy. So in that sense, it s useful.Related: 6 Truths on Why Introverts Make Great LeadersPhilanthropy has been important to you throughout your career. But a lot of entrepreneurs, especially those who are just getting started, pour every penny back into their business. At what point should people start thinking about others?If I could have only one word on my tombstone, I d want it to say  kindness.  I want to be known as someone who cares about other people. Maybe I give to a particular 501(c)(3), or organize a group function at a food bank, or I m kind to an old lady I meet on a bus. All of us need to be thinking about kindness. One, because it s the right thing to do, and two, if you re kind and you care when other people are in pain, it s going to give you really good skills as an entrepreneur. Successful entrepreneurs invent services that make things easier for people.You ve taught classes on entrepreneurship at MIT and elsewhere. If your students learned just one thing from you, what would you want it to be?If I had a class of 50 students and wanted to predict by the end of the semester which one would create a billion-dollar company, I think it would be the kid who can energize a team of five. So, my one lesson is: Can you energize a small team and lead them and listen to them and care about them and motivate them and get them to work out disagreements and get them unified in one direction? I believe that is a skill that can be learned.",Inspiring Your Team,2017-03-03 12:00:00
/article/289942,How a Stronger HR Function Could Have Helped Uber Avoid the Sexual Harassment Scandal,Don't blame HR for Uber's problems.,"The last few weeks have been rough for Uber. In a blog post that went viral, former Uber engineer Susan Fowler told of being sexually harassed by a manager, disrespected by HR and ultimately blocked from transferring to a different team and advancing in her career at the company. In subsequent reporting, many have pointed a finger at CEO Travis Kalanick s alleged view of the function of human resources solely as recruiting and hiring, while little attention was paid to employee development, career coaching or manager training.We on the outside may never know the  real  story, but this should be a cautionary tale for companies with similar attitudes toward HR. Uber wouldn t be the first aggressive startup to put revenue growth and recruiting above all else, including employee experience and company culture. According to Recode, Uber didn t even hire a head of HR until it had already hit 500 employees.Related: Uber CEO Travis Kalanick Says He Needs to 'Grow Up' after Video of Argument with a Driver ReleasedTo its credit, Uber is taking action now, including hiring former U.S. attorney general Eric Holder to investigate allegations of sexual discrimination and having Kalanick meet with more than 100 female engineers. However, Silicon Valley is small, and once a company s reputation is damaged, it s harder to convince people otherwise.This highlights the reason companies have to take a strategic view of HR departments instead of only seeing them as mere recruiting centers. I m really proud that, at Udemy, our team is called Employee Success, not HR or Human Capital Management. That was a very deliberate decision. We don t just hire people and leave them to fend for themselves; we make employee development and experience top priorities. They re core to our culture, we have measurable company goals around improving employee engagement, and employees understand we re invested in their success.Here are a few ways companies can ensure employees feel valued and avoid having HR issues destroy productive work relationships:Build a culture of inclusion and take it seriously.Don t just pay lip service to the value of diversity; bake it into how you hire, manage and develop people. Accept the reality of unconscious bias and work tirelessly to educate your workforce on what it is and how to overcome it. Support grassroots efforts by your employees that celebrate diversity and inclusion in a way that is authentic to your company.Related: Uber CEO Travis Kalanick Launches Investigation into Sexual Harassment ClaimsTrain all managers. Whether they were managers at previous jobs or have just been promoted from within, all new managers need training to understand exactly what your organization expects of them. At Udemy, for example, new and experienced managers alike go through our Learn to Lead program, which explains our talent philosophy and gives specific guidance on things like how to have difficult conversations, coach employees and assume a growth mindset.Listen and respond. When ex-Uber engineer Susan Fowler spoke out, she ran up against a bureaucracy that seemed designed to marginalize concerns like hers. Employees need to be able to speak candidly about issues and feel confident that steps will be taken to resolve conflicts fairly. Documented policies and processes must be circulated for all to see and applied with consistency and transparency, regardless of who s involved. Most important, top management must prioritize and champion transparency and open dialog.Related: What Businesses Can Learn from #DeleteUberShow zero tolerance for bad behavior.At Uber, according to Fowler s account, certain high-performers seemed to act with impunity as long as their contributions could be tied to revenue generation and growth. But at what greater cost? Much has been written about  brilliant jerks,  and why it s not worth sacrificing effective teamwork and a healthy environment just to appease a few so-called rockstars.Companies risk their long-term success when they regard workers as replaceable resources instead of assets to be nurtured. By empowering HR to offer employees meaningful support in their career journeys, they can increase engagement and retention and avoid making negative headlines.Lisa HaughLisa Haugh has more than 15 years of experience leading legal and HR functions for a range of startups and mature companies.

Subscribe  For the second year, Entrepreneur partnered with CultureIQ to find the best office cultures in America. For more companies, tips and profiles, check out the rest of 2017's Top Company Cultures package.Work should be gratifying. We should appreciate our colleagues. Our peers should inspire us. And our happy, efficient, productive workplaces should -- and will -- lead us all to greater success. A high-performance culture leads not only to employee engagement but also to measurable business results,  says Greg Besner, founder and CEO of CultureIQ, which makes software that helps companies improve their culture. But you don t need to be told that. Of course all that s true. Of course it s what we all want. So why is it so hard to pull off?There are a lot of small answers to that question, but here s the big one: Company cultures fail when a company doesn t consciously focus on making it better. Good culture doesn t just happen -- or if it does, it s fleeting and fragile. A truly strong one is nourished and grown, like any relationship. And oftentimes, when trying to cultivate a healthy culture, it helps to look at what other companies do, understand what they get right and adopt some of their best ideas.That s why Entrepreneur partnered with CultureIQ to find the best office cultures in America. We measured 10 areas that are predictive of high-performing cultures -- collaboration, innovation, agility, communication, support, wellness, work environment, responsibility, performance and mission alignment -- to quantify the success of the culture. We wanted to know: Who is worth learning from? And what makes them so good? After surveying thousands of companies, we narrowed the list down to 50 rankings across three different company sizes -- small, medium and large -- to bring you our Top Company Cultures of 2017.

We spent five months in the middle of 2016 inviting all companies to apply. Once they did, their U.S. employees completed a survey of multiple-choice questions. The answers were used to assess a company s strength across 10 core qualities of culture: collaboration, innovation, agility, communication, support, wellness, mission and value alignment, work environment, responsibility and performance focus. We combined scores with the employee Net Promoter Score to create a cumulative CultureIQ Score (CIQ), which is what determined the ranking. The companies with the highest scores made our lists. (To be considered for the ranking, a company must have at least 25 employees, have been founded before January 1, 2015, be headquartered in the U.S. and have enough employees respond to be considered a representative sample. For franchises, only the corporate employees were surveyed.)Andrea Huspeni and Jason FeiferAndrea Huspeni is the special projects director at Entrepreneur.com and Jason Feifer is the editor-in-chief at Entrepreneur magazine.Read more",Top Company Cultures,2017-02-21 12:00:00

/article/287650,7 New Trends Top Companies Use to Separate Performance from Compensation,"Whether you place emphasis on teamwork or individual performance, it's essential to research which method will work best for you.","Awarding higher pay and bonuses to top performers seems like the straightforward way to incentivize and retain great employees. The most popular format being performance-based bonuses, which keep base pay manageable and provide incentives for better performance. However, research shows us that this may not be as simple as it seems.A study by Willis Towers Watson found that only 20% of employers in North America actually believe merit pay is effective in driving high performance.Traditionally money was seen as the main incentive used to motivate employees. Higher productivity results in higher salaries and bonuses. For companies, it s been used as the main tool to attract, retain and engage employees. Today we ve learned that the key to motivation is much more complex than that.What psychologists and thought leaders have found is that money can actually demotivate employees from working at their peak performance by leading to a prioritization of rewards over learning and innovation. In one of the most widely viewed TEDTalks, career analyst Dan Pink explains that it s actually intrinsic motivators like autonomy, mastery and purpose that drive real motivation.To provide their employees with more opportunities to grow and develop, many companies are now moving to continuous, peer-based and rating-less systems. The key question that many of them face is how they can continue to make compensation decisions, without inhibiting the feedback process.In a recent E-Book we identified five trends companies are following to delink performance from pay. Here is a summary of what we found:1. Keeping one annual review for compensation decisionsThe most commonly used method is to introduce more continuous informal feedback and quarterly performance reviews, but continue to keep one annual review specifically for making compensation decisions. Rather than being in the dark until the annual review, employees will know where they are and how they ve improved at each quarterly check-in. Compensation is still linked to end of the year feedback but the feedback they receive throughout the year is focused on growth and development.2. In rating-less systemsWith more and more companies switching to rating-less reviews, this question has emerged as the main obstacle: without ratings how do we calculate compensation? Some companies have taken the position that ratings based reviews leave too much potential for bias. For example, a person s communication skills can often be assessed differently depending on how communicative the rater is or how much they value communication within the team. However, when compensation decisions are based on a qualitative review the potential for rater bias actually increases, giving managers more leeway to decide how they want to award pay. Here are two ways companies are overcoming this:3. Performance calibrationCalibration meetings include a group of managers who discuss the performance of each employee.Together they come up with the best way to allocate pay and bonuses. Including multiple perspectives into the decision process is meant to separate rater bias from reviews and allow for a more accurate allocation of pay4. Peer ReviewsWho better to ask about an individual s performance than their teammates? Instead of depending on managers to make the majority of the decisions, some companies are basing pay solely on peer reviews. To avoid introducing ratings, employees are asked a series of questions about their peers, for example: How much did this person grow over the past 3 months? Please provide examples. This person is your strongest team member. Explain why. 5. Objectives and Key ResultsSetting Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) is the process made famous by companies like Google, Intel, Adobe and Linkedin. The idea is that allowing employees to set their own goals provides greater clarity in what s expected and what needs to be done to perform well. On top of this, individual OKRs can more easily be aligned with team and company objectives. How these companies set compensation:Employees regularly set their own OKRs with manager approvalAt the end of the performance period, compensation decisions are made by assessing whether and how well employees reached their OKRsEmployees may not always complete their OKRs but assessing how they went about achieving them is taken into accountThis is combined with a review process during which information is gathered about their performance from their self-assessment, manager and peersCompensation is then decided based on OKRs, plus factors such as skill development, collaboration, leadership abilities and their contribution to the team/company6. Getting Employees to give more feedbackRather than trying to separate pay from feedback, some companies are actually using bonuses based on peer feedback to boost engagement. A joint study by SHRM and Globoforce found:  Peer-to-peer is 35.7% more likely to have a positive impact on financial results than manager-only recognition.  And dramatically,  When companies spend 1% or more of payroll on recognition, 85% see a positive impact on engagement. To implement this, some companies are allocating budgets to each employee. They can then use this to award cash bonuses to peers along with positive feedback. Rather than leaving pay solely up to managers, this system includes everyone in the decision process.One of our clients came up with an innovative way to gamify peer feedback. Employees are given the opportunity to award gold, silver and bronze ratings to each piece of feedback they receive. Those who have shared the top most helpful feedback with their peers receive a bonus.7. Complete transparencySome companies are rejecting individual performance based bonuses altogether in favor of complete transparency. For example, Buffer has come up with their own salary formula based on the person s role, experience level and loyalty (years with the company). This essentially eliminates the compensation question altogether. In this type of system, everyone knows exactly where they stand and feedback can truly be focused solely on growth and development.Alternatively, some companies have decided to slash the idea of individual rewards altogether, instead basing pay on team performance. Keep in mind that a study by PWC found that the ideal team size in this type of system is under five employees, with 60% of people becoming demotivated over five and 90% becoming demotivated in a team of over ten. Familiarity with team members was also an important factor.ConclusionIt s important that you find the best system for your culture and company objectives. Whether you place emphasis on teamwork or want to give individuals more autonomy over their personal development, it s essential to research and understand which method will work best for you. No matter what you choose, the most important thing is that you clearly communicate to your managers and employees how this new system will work and how it will impact them.

/article/288666,The Hidden Costs of Undervaluing Human Resources,Effective talent-management systems combine traditional HR functions with newer elements like talent development and retention.,"The addition of millennials into the workforce has caused businesses to reevaluate how they manage and support their employees. This change has brought with it the belief that ""human resources"" is an outdated term which should be replaced with ""talent management.""Related: Measure These 5 Talent Metrics for Greater Success in Hiring and Managing EmployeesBut, what some fail to grasp is that true talent management is a revitalization and extension of HR roles, and that HR's core functions remain necessary for business success.While talent-management programs may meet the varied expectations of a multigenerational business environment, HR operations must not be ignored. Mismanagement of these systems places you at risk of legal penalties and exposure to hidden costs that can damage your company s reputation and profitability.Lack of HR expertise Entrepreneurs often underestimate the complexity of HR functions and the field's requisite legal requirements. There are thousands of federal and state laws employers must meet, or face significant penalties.The Affordable Care Act alone can trip you up in hundreds of ways. That's why you need to hire or outsource this role to someone who understands these complicated laws and how they apply to your business. Otherwise, you could risk heavy fines.Your HR system also performs critical employee monitoring, support and development functions. I asked Gary Corcoran, CEO at Advance Systems Inc., about this, and he said,  Today s HR functions must be matrixed, yet fluid, to address the dynamic needs of modern businesses.""These multifaceted processes,"" Corcorn continued, ""include individualized benefit options and career-development opportunities, to encourage employee satisfaction and retention. You need the ability to track and analyze employee data, including time sheets, vacation and personal days, bonuses and other personnel data functions that impact pay and document productivity. Fortunately, resources are available to support these processes. So, reduce your costs by using these resources to identify your company's inefficiencies or needed staffing adjustments. The data these resources help you collect also provides legal protection against unwarranted discrimination suits or employee-compensation challenges.  Employee turnover Entrepreneurs have a reputation for being micromanagers, especially when they're running startups; and without an effective HR/talent management system, they risk losing more than just employees.Related: Why You Need to Embrace the Big Data Trend in HRIf you're one of those entrepreneurs, your belief that no one else can do the job as well as you may lead to a poisonous work environment, low morale and high stress, all of which will result in high employee turnover.In fact, you can't do it all, and that's why you need an HR manager, or department, to help. After all, the cost of hiring a new employee includes advertising the position, staff time for interviews and the hiring process overall.This is followed by training and a drop in productivity while the new hire learns how to function within your organization. Overall, the cost of employee turnover ranges from about 16 percent for an hourly, unskilled worker to as much as 213 percent for a skilled, highly trained employee.This added cost can make it difficult to meet investor expectations or attract new ones. Your business might also gain a reputation as a bad work environment, which will repel qualified job applicants. While there is a growing trend of rehiring former employees, you may not have this option.Here, Corcoran weighed in again:  The inclusion of a meaningful HR program within your startup plan allows you to avoid this damaging misstep,"" he said. ""An effective talent-management program will encourage employee loyalty, attract investors and increase your bottom line.""Talent management without strategic planningEffective talent-management systems combine traditional HR functions with the newer key employee-valued components. The focus gets shifted beyond employee-onboarding, benefits management, and employee separation to talent development, employee satisfaction and long-term retention.Because of this broader scope, talent management should become a recognized component of your own company s strategic planning process.Strategic planning, in fact, requires an unflinching evaluation of your business using data on your current resources and liabilities, as well as analyses of your market and competitors. This information can give your leadership a vision for growth, branding and market positioning and help leaders develop a plan to achieve it.Meanwhile, corporate leaders must recognize that their employees are their company and not forget this important resource during a strategic-planning process; otherwise, the result can be costly. Accordingly, talent management must have a seat at the planning table. Such talent management/strategic planning integration can save a business money through scheduled hires and employee adjustments that support corporate goals.  Bottom lineHuman resources is a vital business component that is too often undervalued by entrepreneurs. That's unwise, because HR supports company growth, talent development and investor satisfaction.Related: The Pursuit Of Talent: Six HR Tools And Technologies Every Business NeedsIneffectual or missing HR systems also carry high costs and potentially significant legal penalties.

/article/287938,Pain-Free Performance Reviews? Possible. Here are 5 Tips for Getting There.,"The ""annual"" performance review system is broken. And fixing the system won\'t be easy. But start with more frequent, less critical feedback.","Let s face it: Everyone, employees and managers, dreads performance reviews. The tired ritual of sitting down for an hour once a year is uncomfortable and unproductive. No wonder companies like General Electric and Adobe are redefining how they approach feedback.Related: Employee Reviews Should Include the CEO So, what exactly is going wrong? A TINYpulse survey of employees and managers found that performance reviews are simply too time-consuming. To combat this, managers tend to focus only on what s happened recently, rather than taking a holistic look at performance.Their feedback then looks at past missteps instead of coaching employees on how to improve in the future. Other problems persist, from a lack of follow-up on criticism to a perception of manager bias.Improving performance reviews is critical for maintaining a healthy organizational culture. Refocusing the process on praising good work and identifying specific, measurable areas for improvement is essential for growth. Here are five tips on how to transform your performance review system.1. Make them more frequent.The single biggest problem with performance reviews is that they typically occur once a year, thereby attempting to tackle too much at one time. This encourages managers to focus on recent performance instead of evaluating what happened during the entire year. Eleven months of excellent work can be seemingly erased with a single off month.This might be why Globoforce found that 51 percent of employees surveyed said they believed performance reviews are inaccurate.The lack of frequency also makes the process more stressful. It feels like a formal event designed to illuminate the employee s every flaw. Instead, more, regular reviews can incorporate feedback into everyday activity. Consider moving to a system with short, focused reviews occurring at least weekly. They ll also allow managers to evaluate recent events that are fresh in their memory.2. Strive to be objective.According to our research, 10 percent of employees and 17 percent of managers surveyed believe that manager bias is the most significant problem with performance reviews. So, structure performance reviews around specific, measurable metrics. The more you can tie a review to data, the better, whether the focus is sales figures, website hits or recruited clients.This makes the process less about personality and counteracts any potential accusations of bias.Related:  4 Ways to Avoid the Worthless Annual Performance Review and Give Valuable Feedback Avoid making statements, like,  Laura is a team player  without having evidence to support them. Come to the review with examples of how Laura is a team player and how that quality increases productivity. Consider using peer reviews, as well. This is an easy way to see if your perspective on an employee is not an outlier and to discover contributions you might not have otherwise noticed.3. Be balanced.Most managers stray one way or the other. It s easy for them to give only praise or only criticism. Unfortunately, both are ineffective. Managers who shy away from offering criticism fail to challenge their employees to grow. Employees may feel that their work doesn t matter -- the manager will always dish out praise, even if they screw up.On the other hand, managers who offer a litany of complaints are unlikely to succeed as well. A Glassdoor survey found that 81 percent of participating employees said they re more likely to work hard if they receive praise.That's no surprise: Constant criticism is likely to make employees feel defeated. Instead, a performance review that focuses on praise and contains a couple of well-defined criticisms will help you achieve a balance.  4. Be goal-oriented.Any criticism should be offered in the spirit of improvement. Scolding an employee for past performance or trying to  build a case  against an employee you plan to terminate isn t productive. When offering constructive criticism, ask the employee a series of questions instead of telling him or her what went wrong and what could be done differently. This way, the employee won t feel threatened and will be more likely to improve their performance.Use as many specific, concrete examples as possible to illustrate every point. Work with the employee to devise a plan on how to improve aspects of his or her performance, then check in later to see if the plan is working. Think of your role as that of a coach or mentor. You re providing guidance for employees for long-term improvement. This is especially important for new employees or internal hires adapting to new roles.  5. Be predictable.Nobody wants to be surprised in a performance review. If you ve set clear expectations for employees, they won t be surprised when you sit down for a conversation. Another way to avoid surprises is to set a brief agenda ahead of time. Using a tool that provides instantaneous feedback is also a good option. Regular, targeted, brief feedback gives employees an up-to-the-minute picture of how they re doing.Related: The 5 Must-Use Steps to Successfully Conduct a Performance Review With Employees The takeaway? The annual performance review system is broken. And fixing the system isn t easy: We re still learning about how to best approach performance reviews.One thing we're learning is that the process needn't be as excruciating as a trip to the dentist s office. We know, for instance, that frequent, objective feedback is better for both managers and employees. By focusing on praising employees for good work and coaching them in needed areas of improvement, you can transform the process into an opportunity to build stronger relationships with employees.David NiuDavid Niu is a Seattle-based serial entrepreneur and founder of TINYpulse.

Full Contact.Each year, this software firm offers their employees $7,500 to take a  paid paid  vacation. They literally pay them to go on holiday anywhere they like. The only rules? You actually have to go somewhere, and can t do any work or answer work related calls or messages. They stand by the idea that employees who actually go on vacation without dealing with anything work related return in a better state to work, fully ready and committed to push towards the company aims. Employees also return with a different, fresh outlook.These  paid paid  vacations also supposedly eliminate the issue of people thinking they re the only one who can solve a problem. Once people return from their holiday relaxed and find things running smoothly, they will feel less pressure to handle everything themselves and develop a heightened sense of trust for their coworkers.If it s not quite in your budget to be giving out large amounts of holiday cash, it s always possible to instead let people take a couple of extra days paid leave, or a long weekend once in awhile, where they can also leave their work responsibilities behind and really get away. People will appreciate their hard work being recognized and be thankful for the chance to disconnect from their responsibilities, even for a short time.Related: How to Make Employee Engagement a Top Priority2. Southwest Airlines.Southwest Airlines is a company revered for their employee engagement practices. With employee engagement levels having remained high over the years, they have a team full of committed, enthusiastic people who are passionate about the company s vision and values and willing to help the company continue their success. They ve set the bar high -- from allowing existing employees from various departments to design their own uniform and giving them autonomy over aspects of their work life they d never normally get a say in, to becoming a glowing example of customer service due to their collective of happy, committed employees.The company allowed employees from any department to apply to collaborate on new uniform designs, with results really reflecting personality and company culture in a way that wouldn t have been achieved had employees not been given a say. Employees were responsive to this, describing it as an  unforgettable experience.  The company encourages employees to stay inspired to do things differently. The viral video of one flight attendant rapping the safety information goes to show the kind of attitude the company has towards keeping things fun and unique, creating a great experience for customers and employees alike, and giving a great company image. Recognizing those employees who really go the extra mile is another key factor of Southwest s engagement practices. Each week, the CEO gives a  shout out,  publicly praising employees who have gone above and beyond at work. There s also a monthly recognition in Southwest s magazine, featuring an employee who shined that month.This kind of recognition keeps employees aware that they re valued and that their hard work and commitment to the company doesn t go unnoticed. Providing praise is just as important as constructive feedback. People love to feel appreciated and motivated. It's helps them continue going that extra mile.As the company founder points out, competitors can t simply adopt the levels of engagement and commitment found in the company  - it takes a special kind of employee and company culture.  They can buy all the physical things. The things you can t buy are dedication, devotion, loyalty -- the feeling that you are participating in a crusade,  -- Herb Kelleher, Southwest Airlines Founder.Related: Employee Engagement Is More Important Than the Customer3. Legal Monkeys.This legal record management company established a simpler, smaller way to show employees that their hard work is valued. Their Appreciation Board is a glass picture frame where employees can write a note and present the board to someone they want to show appreciation to. Whoever receives the board is free to keep it on display on their desk until they are ready to pass it on to someone else. Each achievement also being posted on the company Facebook page to increase visibility outside of the team.Ideas like this are great. They re not only simple to implement, and won t disturb daily workflow, but they build a real-time feedback culture, encouraging people to give positive feedback and show appreciation for their peers and coworkers.4. Screwfix.One way this U.K.-based hardware company keeps their employee engagement levels up is by keeping an open, honest company culture. Every two weeks, employees are given the opportunity to provide feedback without rules or guidelines to their managers. They are encouraged to give feedback on everything -- how things are going, how they think things are managed, how the company interacts with customers and ideas for improvement. Among other initiatives, one outcome of this is the implementation of a new customer card, which speeds up the in-store process, identifying customers and allowing them to make quicker purchases. Like many other initiatives now in place, this would never have come to fruition had the employees not been asked for their input.Having this kind of regular, 360-degree feedback in place not only means things don t get overlooked as often, it keeps the conversation going and ensures a company culture where people really feel as if they make a difference; that they re more than just their role and really benefit the company as a whole. Many of the improvements can come from an engaged staff team who understand the business objective and are given a voice.  -- Andrew Livingstone, Chief Executive, ScrewfixRelated: Is Better Employee Engagement the Solution to Hiring Woes?5. Dreamworks.Although employees at Dreamworks Animation are provided with perks such as free refreshments, paid opportunity to decorate workspaces and company parties after big projects are completed, a practice they really appreciate is that at such parties and events, they are encouraged to share their personal work and projects with their coworkers. This opens up an appreciation of non-work related projects, boosts creativity and makes employees feel that they are more than just the work they do for the company.With other companies like Google also giving employees the time to work on and pitch their own projects, this is a great way to really tell your employees that you not only trust them, but really value their input and creativity. This keeps people feeling both in control and passionate about their work.While it may not be feasible for your company to provide huge amounts of money for  paid paid  holidays or assign large percentages of time to personal projects, these organizations definitely show the value of integrating employee engagement into daily company culture. A lot can be learned from their practices, even in the form of small daily changes that show employees that they are contributing to the company. Implementing great employee engagement practices is a sure-fire way to improve company culture and have a team full of happy, productive and passionate people!Steffen MaierSteffen Maier is the co-founder of Impraise, a web-based and mobile solution for actionable, timely feedback at work.

/article/283847,How Keeping a Human Element in Your Hiring Process Sets You Up for Success,Smart companies engage top job candidates by making a personal connection and finding ways to move more quickly on key decisions.,"Companies spend more time than ever before finding talent and making good hires. Glassdoor's 2015 Why Is Hiring Taking Longer? report revealed that between 2010 and 2014, the average time it takes to hire an employee in the United States increased from 12.6 days to 22.9 days. How can companies compete for talent as the time to hire continues to rise?Employers need to maintain a human element during the hiring process. Just as important, they must provide a positive candidate experience that moves quickly enough to keep top talent engaged. Robert Half's Time to Hire survey found that nearly one-quarter of workers lose interest within one week of the first interview.Related: 3 Benefits of a Better Thought-Out Hiring ProcessHere's a look at how employers can move forward on a compressed timetable while maintaining a more personal approach. Start an employee referral program.Employee referral programs are an effective tool to reduce hiring time, but that's just one of their many benefits. Of the 107 human resources (HR) professionals surveyed for the iCIMS Impact of a Successful Employee Referral Program study, 63 percent reported their companies have a documented referral program. Most HR specialists know the advantages that referrals bring: More than half said referred employees are better cultural fits, stay longer and are more satisfied.  Related: 5 Ways to Determine Which Applicants Will Be Loyal EmployeesA robust social-recruiting strategy is part of any successful employee referral program. Posting photos and content that communicate your workplace culture can emphasize the human element behind the company and your employer brand. Encourage employees to make the most of their social-media networks. They can share job openings on their personal accounts and make connections on LinkedIn. Focus on creating employee testimonials and posting them online so job seekers can see real-life accounts and success stories directly from the organization.Related: Use Referral Bonuses to Find Top Entry-Level TalentGet talent moving.Create a talent-mobility program that provides employees opportunities to grow and advance within the organization. When companies invest in professional development for staff, they're prepped to hire from within. This has the added perk of making succession planning a lot easier. Scrambling to fill positions takes resources away from what's needed to maintain daily operations. When an executive or manager leaves the company, employers need a pipeline of qualified workers who are ready to move up the ladder.This is precisely where talent-mobility programs shine: They prepare top talent to advance when the opportunity presents itself. HR saves time and money by bypassing external job postings. Plus, the HR department's hiring professionals know which internal candidates are the best fits to embody and convey the company's culture. Onboarding and training also move along more smoothly because the employee already is acquainted with the company.Related: Don't Bid for Prima Donnas When You Can Develop In-House TalentMake the most of your applicant tracking system.An applicant tracking system (ATS) can be your best tool for managing a fast-moving and intelligent recruitment process. If you have an ATS in place, consult your software provider to learn how the system can coordinate communications scheduling. It s crucial you maintain communications with all job seekers -- even passive ones. Schedule follow-ups to target previous candidates who showed talent but perhaps were underqualified for past opportunities. The same is true for applicants who fit your company culture but might not have been right for a particular role during earlier hiring processes.

It's important for recipients to know they're hearing from someone in their network and not a bot within an automated system. They'll sense your genuine interest and be more apt to consider beginning the process anew with your company. Use interactive screening techniques.Technology has enabled companies to cut down on screening time without sacrificing a human touch. Consider interactive screening procedures that engage job seekers. Phone interviews are fine, but video interviewing adds another dimension.It s best to provide candidates with a sampling of company information before setting up a video interview. Include an introduction clip that briefs them on the company's founding and current position, its most influential core values and its employee and brand culture. These cues help them see beyond the surface of your organization's website or social media posts and learn enough to determine if they might fit in well.Related: Which Type of Interview Is Best for Your Company?Video interviews provide flexibility for candidates and hiring teams alike. Because applicants can respond and record at their own convenience, they're primed to project their best selves This eliminates some stressfulness and relieves nerves. Applicants know they'll have the chance to provide a clear, articulated answer that truly represents who they are and what motivates them. This technology also gives hiring professionals a way to share responses with other qualified company employees. When hiring teams do convene, members come ready to discuss their impressions and can collaborate in more informed ways to reach decisions.Kes ThygesenKes Thygesen is the co-founder and head of product at RolePoint, a complete social recruiting suite that provides unrivaled access and reach to quality job candidates.Read more",Inspiring Your Team,2016-12-20 14:30:00
/article/286738,4 Industries Wearable Tech Is Already Changing Forever,"Wearables are an example of technology that won't replace human workers, just make them vastly more effective at their jobs.","Free Webinar | August 16thFind out how to optimize your website to give your customers experiences that will have the biggest ROI for your business.							Register Now  Technology hasn t erased the need for human workers - yet. However, it is certainly changing the way people work. Across all industries, automation has eliminated repetitive, mundane jobs, allowing professionals to focus on other work. Instead of processing thousands of invoices by hand, for instance, employees can use a portal to pay vendors and invoice clients, with all payments made electronically. This puts the employee in the position of merely managing payments rather than doing the hard labor to make them happen.Wearable technology has long been associated with fitness, but with augmented-reality glasses like Google Glass, wristbands, and other wearables, there are numerous ways to arm employees with the tools they need to be better at their jobs. Here are some specific industries that stand to benefit from wearable tech.HealthcareThe medical field is perhaps the biggest beneficiary of wearable tech right now. CES 2016 was overwhelmed with companies interested in disrupting the healthcare space. Innovators envision a not-so-distant future where a patient s blood pressure, blood glucose levels, and body temperature can be monitored using wearable trackers. This might not only allow nursing home-bound patients to remain safely at home, but it may also let healthy patients know well in advance when health issues occur.Vision care will also see major changes in the coming years. Innovations like 3D printing will revolutionize how you get glasses. Eyeglasses can already be purchased online, but 3D printing means customers could print their own frames at home after an online vision test. With a plastic grinding machine, glasses could even be ground up and fed back into the printer to create frames with a different shape.Related: Wearable Technology: A Powerful HR ToolLaw enforcementPolice officers put their lives on the line each day to do their jobs. When an officer pulls over a driver or arrives at a crime scene, it s crucial to have access to information on every party involved. Currently this is done through the use of in-car laptops that allow officers to manually enter in a license plate number and wait for information to arrive.However, technology has streamlined criminal information to make it easier for officers to access everything they need quickly. This information could eventually be incorporated into future verisons of a tool like Google Glass, where facial recognition software could give officers criminal information on everyone they encounter at a scene.Related: Wearable Tech Will Soon Be Work Attire in These 4 IndustriesEducationEducators have already turned attention to tablets to replace textbooks, although mass adoption will likely be years away. For wearable technology, augmented-reality glasses are likely to be the most useful, allowing students to record lessons for playback later. Teachers could also use a Google Glass-like product to incorporate facial recognition technology to help them remember students  names at the beginning of a new school year.Of all of the advancements, however, virtual reality (VR) may be the most exciting. With the latest VR technology, students may soon be able to take virtual field trips. Traditional field trips are both costly and limited by region, but using VR headsets, students can visit The Louvre, see the pyramids in North Africa and Central America, or even enjoy American sights like New York s Museum of Modern Art.Related: Wearables at Work? What You Need to Consider.SportsFrom Olympians to college athletes, wearables can be used for performance measurement. The challenge is creating sensors that don t interfere with their movement in any way. The National Hockey League (NHL) is currently working with a company to develop trackers that measure everything that happens on the ice. Chips will be inserted in hockey pucks and the backs of players  jerseys and will interact with cameras placed around the arena.For athletes recovering from injury, tools will soon monitor a person s progress throughout the rehabilitation process. Coaches and medical professionals can then check athletes  progress to determine if they re ready to resume playing. Similar technology could also be used to prevent athletic injuries, alerting coaches when an athlete is approaching a predefined threshold.Wearable tech is gradually evolving from fitness bands to trackers and glasses that can be used in a variety of ways. Even in fields that have been slower to adapt to a tech-powered business world, wearables can help make employees more productive and effective, potentially even changing lives.John BoitnottJohn Boitnott is a longtime digital media consultant and journalist living in San Francisco.

Most agreed that automation technologies will increase employee productivity, engagement and collaboration.Related: 3 Reasons HR Needs to Be Involved in Planning a Business's StrategyNot only that, but these professionals believe that smart tech will improv HR processes and provide for better communication around the office. Whether at a large corporation or a small startup, HR professionals say there are a number of benefits for companies creating  smart offices. Increased productivityOver three-quarters of human resource respondents agreed that work is not where you are, but rather what you get done. To boost productivity and help employees get more done, HR professionals believe installing automation and smart technology can help. In fact, 41 percent consider that outcome to be the most worthy of investing in new technology.Streamlined HR processesOver a third of surveyed HR professionals say that custom mobile apps will help them develop more efficient HR practices, and one-third have already started using them.Often in small businesses, a human resource department is not a priority. Being able to incorporate mobile tools can strengthen a small business s human resources to make up for any shortcomings in that area.A way to attract talent and improve operationsFrom creating a state-of-the-art office to seeking tools that support growth, a company s reason for investing in smart technology varies. Overall, 39 percent of surveyed HR professionals say their motivation to invest in high-tech is to attract top talent and improve business operations.Related: 9 Business Tools for Working Smarter Instead of HarderSmall businesses that employ smart technology will not only make themselves more attractive to prospective recruits, but will help to assist their human resources and business processes.

They also admit that tools for wireless streaming (23 percent) would also have a positive potential impact on the productivity of employees.Reduced costsAlthough upfront costs on new smart technologies can often be high, they reap many benefits. Forty-two percent of HR professionals find that automation will result in at least a 10 percent reduction in required headcount over the next three years.

/article/283228,6 Reasons Why Business Leaders Should Implement Official Mentor Programs,Mentorship programs benefit employees as well as company culture and profits.,"The mentor-mentee relationship has been commonplace in business for a long time. In today s rapidly changing and hyper-competitive global economy, executives are looking for every edge they can find to increase revenue, profit and market share; they're leaving no stone unturned. One successful trend has been the rise of formal mentor programs. A study by the American Society for Training and Development found that 71 percent of Fortune 500 companies surveyed had some type of corporate mentorship program.Related: Create a Corporate Mentoring Program and You May Reap the BenefitsAs the CEO of Peak Sales Recruiting, I have seen many of our world-class customers leverage the power of mentorship programs; here are six reasons why your business should, too:1. Accelerates growth and developmentThe aforementioned study by the American Society for Training and Development found that 75 percent of executives surveyed credited their mentors with helping them reach their current positions. In fact, Warren Buffett, Colin Powell, Cal Ripken, Jr. and even Oprah give credit to their mentors for helping lead to their success. While official managers can often become mentors, that is not always the case. An official mentorship program can give employees the chance to not only connect and deepen relationships with fellow colleagues, but also learn from the company s top performers. 2. Helps recruit and retain talentData from an Emerging Workforce study showed that 35 percent of employees surveyed who said they didn't receive regular mentoring planned to look for another job within 12 months. The cost of a bad hire is enormous and a mentor program can be a key driver to help attract and retain top talent.3. Attracts millennialsDeloitte s 2016 Global Millennials Survey, which reached out to 7,700 mllennials in 29 countries, found that a staggering two-thirds of them plan to leave their current organization by 2020. With 83 million members, millennials have already supplanted baby boomers as the largest sector of the U.S. population and by 2025, they will make up 75 percent of the workforce.As a result, companies have been investing significantly to figure out how to adjust their corporate goals and culture to attract and retain millennials. Millennials prefer mentors over disciplinarians, and as such it is critical to offer them more  carrots  than  sticks. Related: 6 Tips for Developing a Mentorship Program That Keeps Millennial Employees Growing 4. Reverse-mentors baby boomersMentoring does not solely benefit junior employees. The meshing of millennials and baby boomers, along with the influx of technology, has led to ""reverse mentoring."" The concept began with several Fortune 500 companies but has quickly gained momentum.Retired General Electric CEO Jack Welch is widely credited for bringing the practice to the United States. After returning from an overseas business trip in 1999, he ordered his top leaders to find a junior-level mentor to teach them computer skills. The Wall Street Journal noted that companies such as Hewlett-Packard, Cisco and Ogilvy & Mather have formal reverse-mentoring programs that are having positive results.  5. Benefits are vast for those involvedThe benefits of these programs are vast and wide and impact the mentor, mentee and the organization as a whole. Mentees can increase their self-confidence and interpersonal skills and acquire a better understanding of the organization's culture and unspoken rules, both of which are critical for success.Mentors are able to  give back  by sharing hard-earned knowledge and experiences, which can increase feelings of self-worth and job satisfaction levels. Furthermore, the organization as a whole gets to demonstrate to the employee base that it is committed to investing in their career development.  6. Can benefit the CEOThe Harvard Business Review, in an article titled ""CEOs Need Mentors Too,"" did a two-year study and found that dozens of executives were getting counsel and feedback from high-profile veteran leaders from outside their own companies. The burden of making business decisions at a very senior level does not need to be made alone. While the buck may stop with you, good ideas and counsel can come from anywhere and should be tapped into, especially since chief executives today are lasting an average of only 7.6 years in their role, down from 9.5 years in 1995.Related: 3 Steps for a Mentorship Program That Works Companies that invest the time and resources to formalize and implement mentorship programs have a real opportunity to dramatically improve their corporate culture, recruiting efforts and, ultimately, their profits.Eliot BurdettEliot Burdett is an author, sales recruiting expert and the co-founder and CEO of Peak Sales Recruiting, a leading B2B sales recruiting company launched in 2006.

/article/285532,The Startups Trying to Fix The Bias Problem in Hiring,Solving the unsolvable problem in human resources.,"Implicit bias in hiring is so hard to root out because, well, it s implicit. Even when managers talk a good game about increasing diversity at the office, their actions rarely match their intent: In three studies, researchers at MIT and Indiana University found that organizations that tout meritocracy actually show the greatest bias against women. And homogeny isn t only unfair -- it s bad for business. Companies with the most ethnically diverse teams are 35 percent more likely to have returns above the national industry median, according to McKinsey. Related: The Case for Blind HiringBut how can a company fix the problem, and avoid fueling managers  conscious and subconscious biases? A new crop of startups has a solution: blind recruitment. It s a hiring method that conceals candidates  gender, race and education background -- enabling a person to interview or perform job-related tests and be considered solely on those merits.

/article/284550,How Google Uses People Analytics to Create a Great Workplace,"Hint: It's about the people, for the people, and by the people -- and you can translate the big ideas to your much smaller company.","Ever since the term ""employee engagement'' started being widely used in the 1990s, it's been hailed as the key to high productivity and retention, profit increase and better customer satisfaction. Companies took notice of the benefits and sought to turn this abstract concept into a trackable metric. Many companies began administering annual employee-satisfaction surveys.These snapshots help companies check in with team members and assess how happy their employees are in the workplace. While the practice now is widespread, some thought leaders in human resources (HR) have begun questioning the annual survey's accuracy and usefulness.Related: How to Make Employee Engagement a Top PriorityThe problem with most feedback tools.How do you know the answers you re getting are valid in terms of what you re trying to achieve? A survey by Impact Achievement Group and HRmarketer discovered 48 percent of all respondents did not believe employee surveys provide an honest and accurate assessment, compared to 31 percent who thought surveys painted a true picture.Some argue that employees are more apt to answer survey questions positively -- creating a sense that everything seems fine (at least on the surface). Employees who give falsely high marks might fear retaliation or feel a general disinterest toward a survey that takes time out of their busy work day. Others might believe their answers won't make a difference. This sense of apathy is evidenced by the simple fact that many companies have trouble achieving high participation rates.Here's the most revealing finding from the Achievement Group/HRmarketer study: 58 percent of respondents agreed that results did not -- or only slightly -- helped managers gain a better understanding of what behaviors or practices they could change to improve. If surveys don t yield any actionable information, will their results make any difference in how a workplace is run? This loop perpetuates the apathy problem. If employees are conditioned to believe they won't see actual changes in their work environments, what incentive do they have to fill out a satisfaction survey?  Related: 5 Ways to Promote Simplicity and Boost EfficiencyA recent LinkedIn post from Forbes writer Liz Ryan had some pretty harsh words about employee-satisfaction surveys:  Employee Engagement Surveys are the business equivalent of giving the prisoners in a penitentiary a survey to complete once a year and slide through the bars of their cells. The survey process cements an unequal power relationship. Is she right? Are engagement surveys an HR check-off box at the least -- and a tool for damage control at most? Do these surveys simply give employees the pretense of a voice within a company? Maybe it s time to rethink employee-satisfaction surveys and how we administer them.How Google does it differently.At Google, surveys aren't just about checking the pulse of the workplace, they re about constantly striving to improve it. The company s People Operations team (formerly known as HR) uses feedback to optimize different aspects of its people processes and align them with its unique work culture. As a result, the company reports an average participation rate of 90 percent. Nearly every decision the company takes is data driven -- and that's representative of the culture in a majority engineer workforce, too. But the very nature of the HR field focuses on interpersonal relationships in the workplace. It can be difficult to assess based on pure input/output metrics alone. Productivity metrics are extremely important to gauge effectiveness, but they don't tell the whole story. For this reason, Google integrates the human aspects through use of people analytics. Mixing quantitative and qualitative data enables leaders to really dig deep into the company s inner-culture dynamics. Google has used people analytics to improve the workplace across a number of studies. A few notable examples appear below.Related: The Google Tool That Helps You Make Better HR DecisionsLeadership Case Study: Project Oxygen.Through surveys, company leaders learned that most Googlers are averse to hierarchy. Many employees -- cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin among them -- questioned the need for a management level. They thought they simply might flatten the company structure. First, though, they engaged the company's people analytics team to determine whether having managers makes a real difference.In Project Oxygen, People Operations workers analyzed managers' performance ratings and the upward feedback gathered in employee surveys. They then compared these results with productivity metrics. The outcome? At Google, great managers lead to more engaged and productive teams. The people analytics team took the research a step further to identify which characteristics made a great manager. The team returned to comments from surveys, performance evaluations and great-manager nominations. They then conducted double-blind interviews with the company's highest- and lowest-rated managers.Related: 4 Ways Your Leadership Development Is Failing ManagersRather than prove managers unnecessary, Project Oxygen discovered mid-level leaders were essential to create conditions in which other employees could thrive. To be truly effective, though, the company had to turn away from supervisory tactics that ran counter to what Googlers need from a manager. Micromanaging was at the top of the list. Related: How to Increase Accountability Without Breathing Down People's NecksGoogle turned Project Oxygen's findings into the company's Top 8 management behaviors and now uses the list as a guidebook to identify and train leaders from within Google's ranks. The initiative's data-based roots make it easier for managers to accept these standards and move toward meeting expectations. Teamwork case study: Project Aristotle.In another study, Google sought the perfect formula for creating effective teams. Leaders looked at each team's performance metrics and then at perceptions of effectiveness itself. People analytics acknowledges that abstract terms means different things to different people. Through Project Aristotle, Google learned that executives equated effectiveness with productivity. For employees, team culture was the most important measure of effectiveness. Meanwhile, team leaders ranked ownership, vision and goals as the most important influences. To capture these varied factors, the people analytics team examined qualitative surveys from the three major employee groups and compared the information to sales performances (stacked against quarterly quota). Combining human experience with hard data allowed Google to see which teams fared the best. Even more important, the results helped Google understand why certain teams succeeded. These findings formed the basis of Google's five essential factors to create a positive work environment.  Translating Google's lessons to other companies.Google's process provides HR insights into employee engagement. It also creates trust between employer and employee. Googlers feel a sense of equality because they directly shape how their company is run.Laszlo Bock, Google's former Head of People Operations, described the strategy in a recent Harvard Business Review article. His piece listed four steps leaders can take to ""move from hunches to science"" in their own decision-making processes. Bock's strategy (1) asks employees to identify the company's most pressing people issues and (2) suggest ways to improve, (3) encourages the analytics team to share feedback company-wide and (4) finally empowers leaders to run experiments that test which data-supported theories work best.Related: Leaders Earn Trust By Doing This One ThingIt's impossible to overstate the importance of engaging the human aspect in HR efforts. Pure performance data alone isn t enough. Qualitative results help leaders truly understand the underlying dynamics at work in their companies. Done right, employee surveys play a crucial role. Start by asking what workers want to improve and take the next steps to move forward from there.

Without them, businesses wouldn t have dedicated teams of talented people, and without people, there is no business.Here are just a few of the ways HR staff are critical to the success of every organization -- and to every CEO:They work to hire the best.It sounds simple, but hiring is a deeply complex process. In fact, 48 percent of CEOs surveyed by CareerBuilder in 2015 said their companies had lost money due to inefficient recruiting. And that process isn t getting any easier.Among recruiters surveyed by Jobvite this year, 95 percent expected recruiting to be as or more challenging in 2017. But that s where HR departments come in. They re not trying to hire people as fast and cheaply as possible -- they re looking for the best people for the job, and that saves money in the long run.An HR department is more concerned with post-hire metrics like performance and retention of new hires than metrics that measure the hiring process, like cost and time-to-hire. This focus on the success of new employees is critical to the overall health of the organization as a whole.Related: How This Company Is Helping Businesses Find Zen in Human Resource PaperworkAccording to a report published by Gallup in May, turnover involving millennials alone costs the U.S. economy $30.5 billion annually. But when HR takes the time to find the best talent for the job, and then finds ways to keep these individuals satisfied, talent sticks around. Retention keeps companies moving forward while saving both time and money.They re focused on employee engagement.Employee engagement is seen as one of the biggest workplace problems. Gallup s 2013 State of the American Workplace survey of more than 350,000 respondents nationwide estimated that disengaged employees cost U.S. businesses between $450 billion and $550 billion each year in lost productivity.But HR is on the case, leading the charge to make sure employees are engaged. Engagement, in fact, can be boiled down to just a few factors, including employee recognition, feedback, learning and development, plus compensation, benefits and work-life balance.So, whether an HR department is finding new learning and development opportunities, collecting employee feedback with regular engagement surveys or developing recognition programs and incentives, the HR staff is always looking for the best engagement strategies to fit their employees and company culture.And motivating, recognizing and engaging employees has a huge impact. Among employees surveyed by Globoforce in 2016, 82 percent said that when they feel appreciated and recognized, they feel more engaged, and 78 percent feel more productive.Their insights improve the business.HR has a unique view of the company and the people behind it, putting them in the perfect position to help make important business decisions. While the HR department isn t traditionally thought of as a part of the strategy team, 65 percent of CEOs in the CareerBuilder survey said that, post-recession, HR opinions carry greater weight with senior management. What s more, 73 percent said their HR leader had provided data that they had incorporated into their business strategy.If things are working as they should, a company's HR department has a deep understanding of talent and how employees work, and tracks the data to back up their suggestions. More than half (57 percent) of CEOs in the CareerBuilder survey said HR executives can show ways to increase efficiencies and cut costs by better using the company s human capital.When the HR department and C-suite work together, the results are powerful. A 2014 survey by EY found that when companies boasted strong collaboration between HR and finance, they also reported higher earnings and stronger improvement across a range of HR metrics, such as employee engagement.Related: Why You Need to Embrace the Big Data Trend in HREffective HR departments, then, help organizations get the most from their people, while also keeping those people happy.

/article/283996,4 Ways Effective Leaders Deal With Incompetent People,"Paradoxically, the weakest members of the team can improve the rest of the team.","Good leaders need to know how to work with a variety of people -- even the ones they wish they could just fire. They have to be able to motivate underperformers, collaborate with annoying coworkers and overcome difficult employees. While this makes a leader s job frustrating, aggravatingly incompetent team members are often inescapable.And since firing or avoiding these people isn t always an option, leaders need to learn ways to keep their cool and manage them professionally. After all, even if a team fails because of a subpar member, it reflects poorly on the leader.Here are four tips on surviving as a leader when there are incompetent people on the team:1. Communicate clearly and explicitly.A lot can go wrong when there s a lack of clear communication in a team. People have to guess -- often incorrectly -- about what they re supposed to do. When an issue arises, everyone starts pointing fingers, causing tension and stress. Nothing gets done in such a toxic work environment. However, it s more common than many leaders realize.Related: How to 'Win' an Argument Without Losing the RelationshipThe Work Management Survey 2015 from Wrike asked 1,464 professionals about how they get work accomplished. The top work stressor was missing information, with 52 percent of respondents naming it as an issue. Also high on the list were unclear leadership (44 percent) and unclear accountability (44 percent). It s up to leaders to create an environment where everyone is on the same page, and there are no excuses for why something did not get done.Establish a communication system that everyone is expected to follow. Provide examples about how the team will share information and discuss their progress. For instance, let employees know that after every meeting or important face-to-face conversation, there will be a written follow-up that provides a summary of what was discussed and next steps. That way, everyone can refer to the notes when they need information.2. Document everything.Sometimes there are difficult coworkers who always cause trouble. It doesn t matter what a leader does, eventually something becomes a big problem. And rather than admitting their fault and working to find a solution, these employees turn the situation into a ""he said, she said"" argument.Avoid the fallout of these confrontations by documenting everything. As soon as there are signs of trouble -- whether it s a team member not pulling their weight or someone making inappropriate comments -- start recording the details. If there s an argument, have both sides give their accounts.If things ever get to the point where senior leadership gets involved, there will be clear documentation about what happened and who is at fault. Be as objective as possible in these situations. Remember, a calm approach will always appear more rational and prudent than someone screaming and placing blame.Related: 15 Things Your Boss Is Tired of Hearing3. Stay cool.Everyone has their breaking point -- that line where they can t stand dealing with difficult coworkers any more, and they explode. However, great leaders should avoid ever crossing that line. Maintaining good mental health is essential to staying calm.First, know when to take breaks. According to a 2015 study published in the Journal of Environmental Psychology, conflicts are more likely to break out in open offices. When tensions begin to rise in the shared workspace, walk away and find a place to de-stress. This provides time to stop and cool off before having to face an annoying team member again.Another option is having an appropriate person to vent frustrations to. A friend who does not work in the office is a great option. Bounce ideas off them about ways to deal with particularly difficult issues. The can provide empathy or perspective depending on the situation.4. Be prepared for the tough choices.After having to deal with incompetent or difficult coworkers for a while, it s tempting to just let them fall on their face. Instead of wasting time and energy pulling their weight, watching them fail seems easier. However, is that really what s best for the team?Research from Johns Hopkins Carey Business School found that deviant behavior from one team member causes others to work harder than if there wasn t misconduct. So while it can be incredibly annoying to work with incompetent people, in the end, it can improve the rest of the team.Related: You Might Be Guilty of This Workplace Habit and Creativity KillerAlways consider the needs of the organization before deciding to stop picking up someone else s slack. Think about how important the success of a project is compared to the possible damage the individual can cause on their own. If the former outweighs the latter, it s best to just continue working through the issues.Nobody enjoys working with difficult coworkers, but it s something every leader needs to do. More importantly, they need to be able to do it in a professional way. But by focusing on their actions rather than someone else s, they can still successfully manage the team.Thuy Sindell and Milo SindellThe Sindells are principals in Skyline Group International, Inc., Skyline Group is the leading provider of scalable leadership solutions with a foundation built upon decades of executive coaching with some of the most recognized companies i...Read more",Run a Better Business,2016-11-10 14:00:00

/article/282568,A New Solution for Efficiently Recruiting Talent,Small and midsize businesses often find themselves in a pickle.,"One of the biggest challenges for successful start-ups is the growing pains that come with scaling. Meeting customer demand is a problem many struggling entrepreneurs actually wish they had. But, once you get over the hurdle of building brand awareness, keeping up with the demands can be daunting.When you re just starting out, your team consists of passionate, happy warriors who believe in your cause and/or the lucrative future of the business. As you start recruiting from the broader labor force -- whose primary motivation is a bi-weekly paycheck -- finding great additions to the team can become a real challenge. It doesn t help that according to some reports, the hiring process is taking twice as long as it did just a few years ago; 23 days, on average, after the initial interview.Related: How to Hire Efficiently and Find the Right PeopleSo, if your firm is going to spend at least a month trying to find someone to fill a position, you need the best candidates possible. The last thing you ll want to do is repeat the process a few months down the line. Give the person with HR responsibilities in your organization four major attributes to seek out. To be honest, three out of the four in a single candidate is still a pretty big win. LocalCost-effectivePassionateExperiencedLocal employees who are passionate will be hard to find, but could prove more beneficial to the brand over the long-haul and represent a lower up-front investment. Local employees who are cost-effective can be found, but the churn rate is going to be higher. Or, you can broaden your net to find passionate hires that are cost-effective, but you ll likely need to relocate them, or offer a telecommuting option.The unicorn in hiring is an experienced recruit that is already nearby, willing to accept a wage that is below the market average and is passionate about your mission. These take the longest, and in many cases they ve proven too elusive.Related: Being a Small Business Can Be a Big Recruiting AdvantageSmall and midsize businesses (SMBs) in today s market are facing some serious challenges in finding great talent:Recruiting, done right, requires a huge investment of time and resource.One-third of new hires quit their job within the first 6 months.The recruiting process increases the cost of delivering quality products and services to the consumer, while at the same time decreasing the focus on the customer.Reaching the ideal candidate.It doesn t take a mathematics degree to understand that the more people who see your job listing, the higher your chances are of actually finding the perfect candidate. The internet is a powerful tool for getting the word out, but the problem is that everyone knows about it. More than 427,000 resumes are posted on Monster.com every week.It just isn t possible for a single listing on a single site to capture all of that volume, or even stand-out and reach every potential candidate for an SMB s open position. To understand how SMBs are competing in this environment, I reached out to an old friend with first-hand experience helping SMBs connect with future employees.Related: 7 Tips to Improve RecruitmentAdam Seabrook, the co-founder of Betterteam, offered these words of advice:  The online employment field is changing by the minute. The ability to reach and post jobs to more than 100 job boards with a single platform is a game changer for SMBs, and it s something they clearly value, based on the popularity of our tool. We ve seen how the recruiting process can be shortened to days, instead of weeks, by amplifying the visibility of an SMB s job posting. Online job postings are a great tool, but they need to be given their time in the light. There s a lot of competition out there for eyeballs. To quickly reach the perfect candidate, a job posting needs to be featured everywhere and anywhere.Give your HR team the guidance they need to focus their efforts.

/article/283538,"Sheryl Sandberg, Lean In 2.0 and Corporate Gender Bias",Research finds we are still 100 years away from gender equality in the C-suite. That's unacceptable.,"It is now more than three years since Sheryl Sandberg, COO of Facebook, wrote her ground-breaking book, Lean In: Women, Work and the Will to Lead. Lean In,  I believe, is shorthand for  Go for it, if you want it. In her book, Sandberg acknowledges that there are many systemic obstacles to the advancement of women in corporate America. However, her focus is what women can do to maximize their chance of success in spite of these obstacles.Well, more and more women are leaning in. That includes applying for leadership positions and/or negotiating for more equitable compensation.There is some good news.Women who lean in do better than women who don t. However, women who lean in are also facing substantial resistance.Late last month, Sheryl Sandberg wrote an article for the Wall Street Journal entitled:  Women Are Leaning In -- But They Face Push Back.  In what could be called  Lean In 2.0,  Sandberg focuses primarily on the systemic obstacles and not on what women can do to overcome or navigate around them.Sandberg s article came out on the same day as a study conducted jointly by LeanIn.Org and McKinsey & Co. Among the findings: we are still more than 100 years away from there being gender equality in C-suite positions. Further, men are 30 percent more likely than women to be promoted into a management position.Related: 5 Positive Ways to Overcome Betrayal in Life and BusinessThis is bad news for women (and men). It is beyond dispute that businesses do not reach their full potential if there is not gender diversity among those holding leadership positions.The 'too aggressive' penalty.One of the reasons for the absence of acceptable progress in terms of gender equality is what Sandberg calls the  too aggressive penalty. Citing the McKinsey/Lean In study, Sandberg states in the WSJ article,  women who negotiate are 67 percent more likely than women who don t to receive feedback that their personal style is  intimidating,   too aggressive,  or  bossy,  and they are more likely to receive that kind of feedback than men who negotiate. Don t negotiate and don t advance. Negotiate and wear the Scarlett B coded in other terms. This is the classic double standard, and it is indefensible.So what do we do to shatter the double standard that provides a coat of cement for the glass ceiling? Six suggestions (for starters):Acknowledge the problem.We cannot solve the problem unless those who have power to correct it acknowledge that it exists. And, too many still deny the problem. I have never experienced labor pains. But I would be a fool to deny their existence.Related: 3 Signs Your Relationships Lack ReciprocitySo share data with your leaders, for example, the McKinsey/Lean In Study. Consider sharing other academic studies framed in business terms that identify the scope of the problem. The Harvard Business Review and Catalyst.org are great resources, to name but two. Don t attack or admit bias.Don t attack your leaders. That will do nothing more than make them shut down, if not worse. Plus, it may be used later as an admission of organizational bias. Instead, try something like,  we know this problem exists in the business world, and we would be a bit na ve, if not arrogant, to assume we are immune from the problem. Focus training on unconscious bias.As Sandberg and others acknowledge, some of the bias is undeniably unconscious. Focusing on the unconscious in training gives leaders a  safe  way to change. I was not aware.  Well, now you are. Message to leaders: with conscious awareness, unconscious bias can and must be avoided.Eradicating gender bias cannot be over-emphasized.When emphasizing the need for change, talk about the business imperative: bias is bad business. Do not call the training sensitivity training. Most leaders view that as soft fluff. This is business training to maximize profitability. The message would be the same if there were no men in leadership; make that clear!Follow Us: Women Entrepreneur on Facebook, Twitter and InstagramShow leaders how to address unconscious bias.Leaders may not realize that their feelings are due to unconscious bias but they should be consciously aware of their emotional reactions (or they shouldn t be leaders). When they find themselves feeling someone is too aggressive, pushy, bossy or strident (I could go on), encourage them (in their heads) to move from labels to specifics behaviors and then ask themselves the million-dollar question: do I laud this precise behavior when engaged in by a white man?Hold leaders accountable.Training leaders is just a start. We need to hold them accountable. If there is conscious bias or unconscious bias (usually evidenced by a pattern), leaders must pay a price. However, this should be done in a way where you correct the wrong but don t create an admission of bias. This is easy to say but deceptively complex to implement. But it can be done with reasonable legal risk and substantial business upside if thoughtfully implemented.Let me end by quoting Sandberg from Lean In:  She is very ambitious  is not a compliment in our culture. It s on all of us to change that for our collective benefit.Jonathan SegalJonathan A.

/article/282548,Inspiring Leaders Know to Choose Their Words Carefully,Clear language and a sincere message will bring out the best in your employees.," I would like to take a moment and make something clear to everyone. I do not expect, nor do I want, any of you to miss or sacrifice important family obligations for work... In fact, I will go so far as to say that if I find out that you are working with me while missing important family responsibilities, it will disappoint me greatly. These excerpts are from a 2014 internal memo (recently gone viral) Vice President Joe Biden sent to his team members.The language he chose is precise and particular. Biden warmed the heart by addressing the note to  My Wonderful Staff,  and signed off with a sincere  Thank you for all the hard work.  He stressed how important it is that his valued employees maintain a healthy work-life balance. And he owned this directive, by clearly stating how personally disappointed he will be to learn after the fact that an employee has missed a crucial family moment because of work.Related: Your Words Have Impact, So Think Before You Speak He also included a very detailed list of what he considers  family obligations,  including birthdays, religious celebrations and graduations. This information was so valuable to his team -- since most of us, especially when we re swamped, will  grade  family obligations on a sliding scale from  critical  to  OMG I simply can t take a day of just for that! Why language matters.We know that spending too much time at work (or working at home) can lead to unhealthy and unproductive teams. But do we understand the impact of language? Poor choices of words, especially coming from company leaders, can affect employee morale, productivity and health.Let s take a look at a couple of scenarios, from the employee s perspective, where poor word choices can have powerful effects:Scenario 1: Heading into an important meeting you ve spent weeks preparing for, your manager turns to you and says,  Let me do the talking. You can take notes. Result: You immediately feel demoralized. It s clear your manager doesn t fully trust you, and in turn, you begin to doubt yourself.Scenario 2: Your boss is annoyed because there was a simple error in one of your monthly reports. Mistakes happen. But, your boss expects perfection.  Why can t you be more like Tony?  he says,  He would never allow something like this to slip through the cracks. Result: Aside from feeling hurt by this overreaction, your boss has now turned the tables on poor Tony as well. You are envious of him and resent the implication that he s better than you. Your boss has created team divisions and you no longer work as well together.Related: 4 Communications Missteps Lethal for Your Career Scenario 3: Work has been extremely stressful and you re having issues with a coworker. You talk to your manager about it, hoping for a resolution. Instead, he trots out the old line  You know, with the economy the way it is, you should feel lucky to have a job. Try harder to work it out on your own. Result: When a manager doesn t offer help and reminds you that you should be grateful to have a job, it essentially tells you that you re not worthy. Communications like this erode corporate loyalty and build resentment.Turn the negatives to positives.Words can hurt. But leaders can use positive language to create an environment of trust, a place where employees feel safe and valued. Here are some tips to help you turn negatives into positives:Be attentive and respectful. Be present when an employee requests a one-on-one with you. Don t check email or text. Actively listen to what they re saying and if you don t agree with them, keep your emotions in check. Suggest a follow-up discussion and craft your response in a way that benefits you both.No matter how stressed you are, don t explode over every mistake. Your employees aren t robots. Unless these errors are a running trend, mention it, but resist using language that will humiliate or make your teams fearful. If you don t, you ll end up with a resentful workforce without the self-confidence to help your organization grow.Use positive language even in a negative situation. Have a less than stellar team member? Let them know that their behavior is unacceptable, but don t take this opportunity to belittle and berate them. Be firm, but respectful. Instead of focusing on the negatives, highlight good things they do bring to the table. Never use insults, and allow them some time to have the floor to explain.Related: When Negotiating, Choose Your Words Very, Very Carefully Vice President Biden s memo made his team feel valued, trusted, and secure.

/article/281978,The Future of Work is 'Remote.' How You Can Build a Killer Remote Team.,"Think: communication, trust and company culture as three keys to building your team.","Each year more companies are choosing to leave the office behind and create a remote team. Trello and Github are just two examples of businesses, creating virtual offices that allow workers from all over the world to join.For an early-stage startup, a remote team can be especially beneficial. It drastically reduces company overhead, maintains a flexible schedule and helps recruit the best talent possible. Remote teams are also cheaper and faster to get started and gain momentum. Even for the traditionalist company, the benefits of building a remote team are enticing.Related: We're Turning Into a Freelance Nation. Here's What That Looks LikeBut actually assembling that dream remote team in the first place is an art that's still being refined. Which leads to the question: How do you build an awesome remote team?First, familiarize yourself with three core tenets of operating a remote business: communication, trust and culture. You ll have to set clear standards for each of these aspects early on so your business can operate seamlessly.1. CommunicationCommunication is hands-down the most important aspect to focus on here. Without consistent communication, a remote team will fall apart. Each member needs to understand his or her responsibilities and deadlines, and everyone needs to be regularly checking in with each other. Some tips:Communicate face-to-face. In a team environment, there s no substitute for talking with others face-to-face. Scheduling video calls with your team -- or parts of your team -- is one of the best ways to make sure everyone s on the same page. Skype and Google Hangouts are your friends here. Make face-to-face chats a regular part of the workweek.Keep the conversation going. While video calls are important, you also need to create ongoing communication channels. Many companies use Slack to keep real-time chat going, which approximates the in-office experience. Trello is another invaluable tool to aid in project management and organization.Create a communication schedule. A remote team needs clear-cut rules on how communication will happen. Set aside days and time slots for meetings, and specify how other tools - like email and Slack -- will be used. This will prevent an astounding number of problems from happening and will keep everyone equipped with the information they need to do their jobs.Also consider monthly or quarterly virtual town hall meetings in which all employees can hear from the founder or senior management on company performance and other key pieces of information. This will keep teams engaged and aligned and create a sense of togetherness.2. TrustThe absence of trust will crush a remote team. All employees relie on one other, and you need workers who will be honest and motivated. All workers should be self-driven to complete their tasks, as no one will be checking in every hour to see if they re slacking off.Hire the right people. To build trust in an online team, hire the right people. As Alex Turnbull wrote on the blog Groove, A great startup employee doesn t necessarily make a great remote startup employee.  The traditional hiring process doesn t work for a remote team. Discipline, drive and organization are three vital characteristics that every remote worker should have. You won t be able to look over your employees  shoulders, so you need to ensure they re capable of self-management.Ask the right interview questions. Ask specific questions during the interview process to gauge the applicant s work ethic and level of motivation. Look out for specific answers about how the applicant manages time and organizes the workday. The ability to describe these processes will help create a more productive team. Here are some of my favorite questions to ask a remote hire.What tools and/or processes do you currently use to manage projects, personally or professionally?How would you prioritize your work if your manager wasn t available for a few days suddenly?What does your work environment look like?When you do great work, how do you like to have your work recognized?What motivates you to want a telecommuting job?Aside from interviewing via phone or video chat, I also highly recommend a round that is completely text based. While verbal communication is important, in remote roles the ability to explain your ideas or problems through clear, concise written communication is critical.Of course, you can use employee management software; Hubstaff is one company that does this successfully. Still, it s up to the workers to get things done, so a team that's willing to hustle is key.Related: Getting the Most From Your Remote Workforce3. Company CultureRemote teams need a company culture too. In fact, culture is more helpful for a remote team than it is for an office-based one. Because your workers are spread across different cities -- or even countries -- you ll have to go the extra mile to unify your team and establish a group ethos.Create a culture of work. In the words of Zapier Founder Wade Foster, Culture is about how you work. He argues that workers should be motivated to work because they find the work rewarding. And he s absolutely right. For a remote team, culture means working toward a common goal.That s why you need workers who are motivated and dedicated. If your team doesn t enjoy the work, then nothing will ever get done. In other words, work needs to be fun for everyone on your team.Strengthen relationships. Since a remote team is interdependent, you ll need to get to know one other s work styles. Learn everyone s strengths and weaknesses and work on them as a group. Encourage workers to help others solve problems and answer their questions.Learn to work remotely.Remember that every day, working with a remote team is a new experience. You may run into some unique problems -- like how to reconcile time zones --- that make you look at the team environment differently. You ll adapt your policies, and think up new ones to account for these unexpected issues.Read This: Remote: Office Not Required by Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson | Amazon | Indigo.ca | Barnes & Noble Remote teams are changing the face of business, and it s likely that the majority of the workforce will be soon be almost completely remote.

/article/281947,How to Find Your Best Employees and Keep Them Around,Don't trust your intuition when it comes to rating employees.,"We are often quick to judge someone's job performance.It's so terribly easy to say  He is a bad employee.  It's a little less likely to hear someone say  She does her job really well.  But both of these sentences are often meaningless, based on personal affection and intuition. How do you really figure out who your best people are?This is the model employee.A good employee has a set of distinctive characteristics in addition to specific work related knowledge. While different jobs require different skill sets you can be pretty sure that all good employees have a recognizable similarity in their mindsets.Keeping these employees around requires a lot of effort.According to Globoforce, the No. 1 reason most Americans leave their jobs is that they don t feel appreciated. In fact, 65 percent of people surveyed said they got no recognition for good work last year.Here are the traits of a model employee.They want more. They are not happy with achieving the bare minimum. Whether because of ambition or because of personal satisfaction, they are only happy if they can do more than is expected of them.They ask questions. They want to know things and understand processes. They don't accept facts at face value, and they are looking for ways to exploit systems to get further.They're passionate. They care about their job performance. These are the people whose eyes start to shine when asked  What is it that you do?  And they are the ones who passionately defend their ideas and plans.They're weird. They have their personal quarks, which make them different from most employees. That shows, they're creative, and think outside the box.They like to prove others wrong. They are driven by a wish to be right. If they have a crazy idea, and everyone is saying it can't be done, they'll find a way. They do need some sort of reigning in from their managers but most of the time, it's better to let them fly.Related: How to Deal With These 4 Employee FrustrationsHow to find model employees and keep them aroundIt's very hard to evaluate those characteristics with performance review tools or systematic analyses. You can evaluate people with one-on-one meetings, but doing those on a weekly basis can be a huge waste of manager's time.You need to find these people though. If you don't hire them or, even worse, if you accidentally let them go, your team loses more value than you realize. You must also keep these people happy. Happy employees are 12 percent more productive and take a lot fewer sick days.To see what your employees are really made of I advise using weekly status reporting methodology called Plans, Progress, Problems (PPP).Related: 5 Ways to Empower Your EmployeesTry a weekly status report, and look for subtle signs.I've used PPP for a long time now and working in different teams I've noticed some similarities between different people who use it.First, PPP requires employees to list their plans for the following week. Some people make sure they don't have too much planned, and they'll definitely be able to finish what they planned. But then there are others who have a lot of plans and a lot if ideas. Often they don't finish all of them in a week and have a lot of overdue items. These are the people who want more and who like to prove others wrong.A lot of overdue items is also an interesting part of PPP. At a first glance, it might seem that it shows laziness  - sometimes it does -- but usually the lazy ones are too uninterested to even make plans. So it's actually a sign of people who want to do more than they are able. If you a have a person like that in your team they might require some help with focusing, so sit down with them and talk things through.Related: 6 Reasons Why Your Best Employees QuitGood employees are worthy of recognition. It's every manager's and leader's task to figure out who they are. Use PPP or use one-on-one meetings. Give grades based on your gut or trust the yearly review.

/article/281981,"Millennials? Focus on Individuals, Not Demographics.",Millennials aren't all that different from older generations.,"Millennials tend to get a bad rap. You hear a lot of things about them. They re entitled. They re not loyal to their employers. They spend too much time on social media, and they don t know how to build in-person relationships.Related: 4 Strategies to Connect With MillennialsWe ve been led to believe that this generation, which now makes up the largest percentage of the workforce, is completely different from any other before it. As a result, employers are scratching their heads, asking questions like, How do we hire millennials? How do we keep them engaged? An how do we keep them from leaving? Last year, there were 53.5 million millennial workers in the United States. Nearly 1,300 of them work here at CHG; they make up 55 percent of our team. And, frankly, we ve found the ""talk"" about millennials to be more fiction than fact. Here are the realities we ve experienced.1. Millennials are just like everyone else. No, really.The studies that have highlighted the contrasts between millennials and other generations have been far overshadowed by studies that discredit the disparities.According to the Harvard Business Review, to the extent that any gaps do exist, they amount to small differences that have always existed between younger and older workers throughout history and have little to do with the millennial generation per se.We ve found this to be true at our company. We regularly survey our people about what they like and dislike about the organization. For the most part, the same themes appear -- regardless of age.Related: How to Motivate Millennials, By MillennialsEveryone wants his or her work to have meaning.A study by Deloitte found that 90 percent of millennials surveyed wanted to use their skills for good. Our own surveys show that millennials want to work for a company that cares about them, and they want to feel that their work matters.We hear that same message from all of our employees -- so frequently, in fact, that we decided to change some of our internal programs. Throughout the company, we now hold regular standup meetings, where employees can share how their work has had a positive impact on our clients or how our people have made a difference to each other.We also offer company-paid, volunteer time off so our people can do the things that are meaningful to them outside of work. Each employee receives eight hours a year to give back to the community in whichever way he or she chooses.Everyone wants to grow.One of the things I love about our people is their desire to learn, and our millennials are no exception. A study from the Intelligence Group found that 79 percent of millennials surveyed wanted their boss to serve as a coach or mentor. To meet this need, we ve put together formal and informal mentorship programs and upped our emphasis on training and development.We now offer onsite classes, ranging from emotional intelligence (EI) to servant leadership, plus a dozen or so more. We believe that career development should be driven by employees and guided by leaders. Our people determine their own development path, and their leaders work to support them in achieving their career goals.It s about individuals, not demographics.It s tempting to want to overhaul your company culture to meet the needs of a younger generation. But, remember, just because a group of people fits into the same age group doesn t mean they re all the same. We ve found that when you implement policies that champion the individual, the collective group benefits as well.We re lucky to work with great employees of all ages. Though there may be some differences in how individuals in different groups dress, which channels they use to communicate or where they consume media, we re all looking for similar things in a job.Related: 4 Truths You Need to Know About Millennial Job HoppingThese include the chance to grow, the opportunity to make a difference and the ability to be seen and heard as an individual.

/article/281919,4 Unconscious Biases That Distort Performance Reviews,"We often don\'t fully understand everything that shapes supposedly ""objective\'\' evaluations.","Objectivity is the foundation of an effective performance appraisal system.You want a system in which your top performers are recognized and then given opportunities to advance their skills while low performers are given the advice and motivation they need to improve their performance. Unfortunately, this isn t always the case.A CEB survey found that nine in 10 HR leaders don t believe annual performance reviews result in accurate information.Imagine you have a talented employee that gives 110 percent but finds their performance evaluation doesn t reflect all their hard work. Eventually, their disillusionment will turn into disengagement. Then they ll begin to look for another job, where they feel their work will be appreciated. The U.S. Department of Labor reported that the No. 1 reason Americans leave their job is because they don t feel appreciated.Whether we realize it or not, our brain has a natural tendency to sort information into groups in order to process it easier. This can lead us to make snap judgments about a person without even realizing it. Some psychologists call this the Idiosyncratic Rater Effect. They found that on average 61 percent of a rating is based on the judgments of the rater rather than the ratee. When one person s unconscious bias is applied to performance appraisals, it can lead to inaccuracy, favoritism and even unfair treatment of employees, based on their age, sex, race or sexual orientation.Fortunately, there are ways to mitigate the effects of unconscious bias. Here are four common types of bias that affect performance appraisals and how to overcome them.1. Central tendency bias.This is one of the most common forms of bias that can impact your performance reviews. Whenever you have a five or three point scale, raters have a tendency to lump the majority of their employees in the middle. This happens most often when managers have a low performer and just can t bring themselves to give them a low score, fearing they ll damage their employee s confidence. This is actually worse for low performers, as it doesn t clue them in to the fact that they need to improve, or give them any valuable information about what they need to focus on.How to overcome itIn the past, to overcome this natural tendency tactics, such as forced rankings, were used to push managers to rank each of their employees against each other. But as we have seen, forced or stack ranking has a negative impact on performance. Ranking employees against each other creates high competition and animosity within teams. Rather than working together, teams begin to work against each other to receive a higher score.To overcome central tendency bias, base performance appraisals on specific competencies.Everyone has their strengths and weaknesses. Maybe one of your employees is not a strong public speaker, but they re a good writer. Rather than focusing on public speaking, push them to improve their writing skills, and give them assignments that allow them to build this strength.The most valuable information an employee can get from the review process is insights into their strengths and weaknesses. Encourage managers to really highlight both in each employee s review so that afterwards they can create an effective development plan.Related: Should You Ditch Annual Performance Reviews? It Depends.2. Recency and spillover bias.Our ability to recall an employee s performance can also have a major impact on their results. Accurately remembering how each employee did throughout the year is almost impossible. It can be especially difficult to recall projects that were completed during the first and second quarter.Recency bias occurs when managers rate an employee based on their most recent performance - forgetting about the entire picture. Alternatively, spillover bias occurs when managers continue to rate an employee based on past performance, failing to take into account recent improvements.Forgetfulness on the part of the rater can actually lead an employee to be over or under valued for their work. This is especially demotivating for employees, who show improvement later in the year but continue to be rated based on their previous performance.How to overcome itDitch the annual review. It s much easier for people to recall the performance of an employee over the course of three months than over the course of a year. Consider implementing quarterly or bi-annual reviews. This doesn t have to take up more time. There are new tools that can help you set up reviews quickly and more frequently.3. Negativity bias.With more frequent reviews, you also want to make sure that your employees are getting the most out of the information they receive. When employees are used to getting feedback, they re more likely to know how to analyze and use it effectively - although some people have to learn this skill. People have a natural bias towards negative situations. This is a natural defense mechanism that helps us remember and avoid dangerous situations.Negativity bias can also get in the way of our professional development. Instead of learning from constructive feedback, it can instead induce fear or anger.How to overcome itHelp your employees develop an open mindset to feedback by giving it continuously throughout the year and coaching them on how they can analyze the information they receive. Create a development plan, and stay on top of goals.Related: The 5 Must-Use Steps to Successfully Conduct a Performance Review With Employees4. Halo Effect, confirmatory and similarity bias.These types of bias are based on our perceptions of others. The halo effect occurs when managers have an overly positive view of a particular employee. This can impact the objectivity of reviews, with managers consistently giving them high ratings and failing to recognize areas for improvement.Whether positive or negative, we also have a natural tendency to confirm our pre-conceived beliefs about people in the way we interpret or recall performance, known as confirmatory bias.For example, a manager may have a preconception that their male report is more assertive. This could cause them to more easily recall instances in which they asserted their position during a meeting. On the other hand, they may perceive their female report to be less assertive, predisposing them to forget when they suggested an effective strategy or were successful in a tough negotiation.The halo effect is often a consequence of people having a similarity or affinity bias for certain types of people. We naturally tend to favor and trust people who are similar to us. Whether it s people who also have a penchant for golf or people, who remind us of a younger version of ourselves, favoritism that results from a similarity bias can give certain employees an unfair advantage over others. This can impact a team to the point where those employees may receive more coaching, better reviews and, as a result, more opportunities for advancement.Related: 4 Ways to Avoid the Worthless Annual Performance Review and Give Valuable FeedbackHow to overcome itBasing performance on one person s perception makes biased reviews much more likely.

/article/281139,5 Tips Before Implementing Your Wellness Program,Learn what you need to know before implementing a wellness program of your own.,"With large companies, like Google and Facebook, taking wellness programs to extremes - and spending a large chunk of money in the process -- it can be difficult to understand how the costs balance out for smaller businesses. With just a little digging, though, it s clear that employee wellness is a sound investment for even the smallest of businesses.At a small business, employee wellness brings about a unique set of benefits. Yes, you could still see a positive ROI, which is a great perk to wellness in any business. You might also notice improved productivity, easier talent acquisition and retention and an increase in brand recognition.Perhaps you ve heard about all these great wellness benefits. Maybe you re thinking of starting a wellness program where you work. Or you might even be revamping a program you ve already implemented. Regardless, there are a few things you should know before diving into a wellness strategy.1. There s no  right way. There really isn t a formal definition of ""wellness program."" Your wellness program can include anything from providing health education materials to bringing preventive services into the workplace. There are a wide variety of things you can work into your program, and it s completely dependent upon your corporate culture and goals.Many people get caught up in the idea that employee wellness needs to include crazy and expensive wellness perks. That s simply not true. Your program can be as robust or as simple as you need it to be. Don t get caught trying to find rules, requirements or the right way to do wellness. None of those things exist.2. Inclusivity is important.One common misconception about employee wellness is that it excludes people with existing health conditions. Many people worry that wellness only works for people who are already relatively healthy. If that s the case in any wellness program, it s not being done right.You can t force employees to participate in your wellness program, but you do need to make it accessible to every employee at your company. If disabilities or health conditions are a concern, plan for that and make adaptations to your wellness activities as needed.3. Adaptability is mandatory.Like many corporate strategies, a wellness program isn t something you can plan and then forget about. It needs to be a living, breathing strategy that changes as your company changes. Be flexible.Ultimately, employee wellness should mesh seamlessly with your corporate culture. In a startup or small business, that culture can change as you try to settle into your industry, and develop your corporate identity. Let your wellness program be adjusted according to your culture.Related: Why Your Workplace Wellness Program Is Unhealthy4. It s actually working.There s no reason to be skeptical about whether employee wellness is worth your effort. It is. And there s plenty of research to show it. In fact, according to a survey by Kaiser/HRET, 59 percent of employers reported their programs actually improved employee health. Similarly, wellness activities have been associated with an eight percent increase in productivity.The best way to tell if wellness is working at your company is to be sure you build you program with evaluation in mind. Obviously you ll have measures to track your direct ROI - just as you would with any new business investment. You can also track things like biometric health results, productivity and employee satisfaction year-over-year (YoY) to determine the longer term impacts your program is having.Related: Are Wellness Programs Right for Your Company?5. You re not alone.A majority of companies have begun to think about employee wellness as a business strategy. While the percentage of smaller businesses that have actually begun implementing wellness programs remains fairly low, few small business owners dispute the idea that a wellness program would be good for their bottom line.Increasingly positive attitudes toward employee wellness suggest a coming surge of wellness program implementation. Staying ahead of that surge can help give your business an edge and one added benefit. Being an early adopter of employee wellness allows you to differentiate your business from others in your corporate space in regards to both public image and recruitment of talented employees.Related: How to Cope When the Mandatory Workplace Health Program Is Driving You CrazyStarting a wellness program is a great way for a small business to invest in both its workforce and its bottom line. Getting started with employee wellness can seem overwhelming or confusing, especially when it comes to scaling down the large, expensive wellness programs that are often thrust into the public eye.If you re considering wellness where you work, or trying to get a program started, you ve made an excellent first step.

/article/281329,When to Hire Raw Talent vs. Job Experience,"Experience is a must for some jobs, but people with raw talent offer unique benefits.","You have two candidates for a position. One is experienced and knowledgeable while the other is inexperienced but talented. Which one should you hire? Making the right decision can be a source of competitive advantage for your business.Here s a few quick rules of thumb for when to hire for each and the pitfalls to avoid.When to hire for experience.If you are hiring for a leadership position. This may seem obvious, but it can be tempting to put a promising person with a stellar individual track record in a position to lead. Excelling in a management role, however, is very different from excelling as an individual contributor. If this person has no experience managing others, it will be difficult for him or her to build and guide a team.Related: 4 Real and Workable Answers to the Skills GapIf you need specialized knowledge. In addition to leadership positions, prioritize experience for jobs that entail doing something the organization either 1) doesn t know how to do or 2) doesn t currently do well. Experienced people will bring not only the skills needed but also process and procedure.When to hire for talent.If you are hiring for practically any other job. Often you are hiring simply to add another person to an existing function. For instance, you need another software developer to join a team of eight, and there is already a clear process and workflow in place for how the job is to be done.In a case like this, look for the most productive and talented person you can find, without much consideration for experience. Employees with raw talent offer many advantages. They may create new ways of solving problems and/or develop innovative products or services that a more experienced person might overlook. In addition, they may be more malleable, hardworking and loyal.Avoiding common hiring pitfalls.Decide ahead of time whether experience or raw talent is more crucial for success in the position. If the hiring team does not understand the job requirements and how to staff it, they will waste everyone s time interviewing the wrong people. Or worse, they will hire the wrong person for the job.Related: 8 Habits More Important to Success Than Raw TalentDon t equate job experience with talent. Many people have experience being mediocre. Look for candidates with not only a track record of success, but also signs of talent that go beyond their natural abilities. Seek traits that demonstrate exceptionalism (a good way in particular to judge candidates without much work experience), creative initiative, cultural fit and job-specific motivation -- in other words, the employee wants to work specifically for your company. These types of employees provide much more value in the long run.Don t be a resume snob. Many leaders and hiring managers tend to be overly impressed with candidates who seem to have the most amazing combination of experiences. They focus on people s alma maters, where they ve worked, or what titles they ve held rather than what these candidates have actually done or their potential. Just because someone worked at a great company doesn t mean he or she will be a great employee.Don t skimp on job training. Hiring managers sometimes prioritize experience, believing that the candidate will get up to speed faster and require less training. This is rarely the case. For example, lack of training becomes a problem when hiring managers approach the work differently than the new employee.The experienced employee begins doing the job his way, only to find out that the manager -- who didn t bother to train the new employee carefully -- wants it done her way. This is frustrating for both. The manager feels like she is losing time every day, while the employee believes his experience is being discounted.Cultivate your employees. Beyond the initial training, invest in every new employee regardless of experience. Offering professional development opportunities and room for advancement will benefit everyone and help you retain your employees.Related: How Investing In Employee Training Benefits Your BusinessExperience is crucial in many positions but talent at all levels advances organizations.

She wanted to move back to her hometown of Miami but couldn t imagine leaving behind one of her favorite treats: lemon pepper chicken wings from Wingstop, a local chain. So before moving, she applied to be the Dallas-based brand s first franchisee in Dade County, Fla. And the company said yes.Today she has two Wingstop restaurants in Florida that bring in more than $1.2 million and two more on the way, and she still owns that healthcare business in Dallas. She attributes her success to determination, perseverance and a positive attitude.

/article/280224,Learn From These 3 Ways Airbnb Won the Trust It Needed to Succeed,HR professionals could learn a lot from Airbnb about how to increase trust within their companies.,"How important is trust for an organization? In a survey by Interaction Associates, more than 80 percent of employees said being effective in their work requires a high degree of trust in their co-workers (85 percent), boss (82 percent) and direct reports (81 percent). For any organization to grow, innovate and succeed, having trust is key.Yet, a study by Ernst & Young (EY) found that only 49 percent of employees trust their boss and their team members. And even less trust their organization (46 percent).Another recent study by Edelman showed that the lower you go in the hierarchy of an organization, the more trust decreases, with employees being less likely to trust managers and executives than peers.Today, trust is eternally important.With the increasing speed of innovation, companies need to be fast to stay on top of new trends. To create more agile organizations, we need more agile skill development and learning.The need for a faster rate of innovation is driving managers to give their employees more autonomy over their work. This in turn is leading to a rise in remote working. However, for this more autonomous system to work, a high level of trust is an absolute must.The difficulty is, if you only interact with your team on a working level, is it ever possible to create trust? The leaders of the new sharing economy may have the answer.How is the sharing economy getting strangers to trust each other?In her TED Talk, The currency of the new economy is trust, Rachel Botsman expounds on the idea that we are currently going through a collaboration revolution.Companies like Airbnb, Uber and Bla Bla Car are at the forefront of the paradigm shift toward a sharing economy. People are trusting strangers to stay in their apartment alone for a weekend, and pick them up from the airport on time.With such low levels of trust - even between people we see on a daily basis -- how are these companies getting people to trust strangers in their own homes?Botsman explains that in this new economy trust is essential. The way people create trust is by sharing feedback with each other after exchanging services. In her view, all future transactions will be based on an amalgamation of the feedback we receive online from different sources, creating a virtual reputation for ourselves. However, at first sight this might be disconcerting for some.Do we really want an online reputation following us around?Airbnb Co-Founder Joe Gebbia explains how the company tackled the trust problem in an insightful TED Talk.From its inception the company had to deal with what they called the stranger-danger bias. Getting people to invite strangers to lounge on their couch, and sleep in their bed when they re not around seemed like an impossible task.One reason for this is what psychologists call homophily or similarity bias.People are much more ready to trust someone, who is similar to them. Without any way of connecting on a personal level, a stranger is too much of a risk. Airbnb set about to change this by designing for trust in three key ways.Related: 'Human Resources' Just Doesn't Tell You What HR Really Does1. Create a profile.Airbnb found that having hosts and guests create a profile with their pictures and links to social media helped to create a more familiar picture of the other person.Your potential host is no longer a stranger, but someone who likes to travel, like you, and enjoys the same music. However, a 19-year-old traveler and a 65-year-old retiree may not necessarily find they both have a penchant for vegan food and heavy metal music.The next challenge was coming up with a way the young company would overcome similarity bias.Related: 6 Ways to Lawfully Embrace Social Recruiting2. Secure reviews.Airbnb conducted a study with Stanford University on similarity bias.What they found was that high reputation actually beats high similarity.According to Airbnb, a host without reviews is four times less likely to get a booking than a host with at least one. A host with 10 reviews is 10 times more likely to book their home, thereby counteracting the potential for similarity bias.If you think about anytime you ve ever used Airbnb, it makes sense. You are much more likely to trust someone, who has 10 reviews than someone, who seems nice but has no reviews at all.Reviews are therefore one of the most successful ways Airbnb creates trust between users. Like Botsman, the company calls this its reputation system. Guests and hosts both receive reviews from each other each time they use Airbnb, and this information is displayed on their user profile. However, the team also noticed a tendency for users to give overly positive reviews to avoid receiving negative reviews in return.To encourage good quality feedback, Airbnb decided to make reviews available only after both guest and host had finished completing them. This way both parties won t feel swayed by the feedback given by others, resulting in more objective assessments. This small change actually increased the rate and objectivity of the reviews that were given.Related: This CEO Says the Key to Being a Good Boss Is Getting Out of the Way3. Prompt more interaction.Another way Airbnb encourages trust is by getting people to have more meaningful interactions with each other. The challenge was to get guests and hosts to exchange just the right amount of information during their initial contact. Share too little, and people will not gain a sense of trust; share too much, and a red light might go off.To solve this dilemma, the Airbnb team put design thinking to use. Gebbia explained that when sending a request to a potential host, the system actually guides users to share more by using prompts, which ask you to tell the host a bit about yourself. They also used the size of the box to suggest a certain length.Steffen MaierSteffen Maier is the co-founder of Impraise, a web-based and mobile solution for actionable, timely feedback at work.

/article/280706,Social Media Is for More Than Just Marketing,"In the business world, social media has become a go-to for brand development and customer care.","Snapping photos on the beach and sharing regular status updates has become the norm for communication. Whether it s announcing your newborn baby or venting over daily frustrations, nearly every social media platform allows you to share your (digitally altered) life seamlessly.In the business world, social media has become a go-to for brand development and customer care. It s an easy way to stay in touch with customers and creatively market your products or services. 63% of millennials report staying up to date on brands through social media, and 46% of millennials use social media when making online purchases. Businesses are beginning to digest these statistics and leverage social media s role in their customers  lives. Now, 78% of companies report that they have teams dedicated solely to social media.Though social media fits neatly into an effective marketing campaign, it can be used for much, much more than that.Customer serviceWhile traditional support channels hide the customer behind the interaction, leaving you with just an email or phone number, social media support is a real glimpse into your customers  lives. It can serve as a fantastic customer service tool that adds transparency and humanity your customers appreciate. Questions are often answered for all to see, leaving little room for poor, half-baked responses.It s also highly efficient. Tons of businesses use Twitter as a support and customer communication tool. You can educate thousands of followers with one tweet and cut down on emails, calls, and chats. This is especially useful during service outages, product releases or any time you expect high demand.These channels generate valuable feedback too. Facebook and Google+ reviews offer valuable customer happiness insights and add a level of trust for prospective customers researching your business. Positive peer reviews are also more likely to land you a sale than self-marketing, so these rating features go a long way.Customer engagementWhen you re present on someone s feed, you re more likely to influence their next plan or purchase. Offer rewards through social media. Create contests and incentives for people to  check in  at your location, or offer coupons in exchange for page likes and shares. At the very least, you ll gain some screen time on their social feed and catch someone s eye. And ideally, you ll encourage repeat business that evolves into a loyal customer base.Increased engagement means increased customer retention. The more you can get your followers chiming in or clicking through -- whether that s with exclusive deals, helpful content, or genuine and thoughtful messaging -- the better your chances of keeping them around. Try spurring discussion on your page or around a specific post by inviting your followers into the conversation. The topic doesn t have to be your business or services, but something relevant to your industry that builds an association with your brand.Product developmentUser commentary can shed real light on companies  strengths and shortcomings. Listen to what people say and incorporate the best feedback into your business/product roadmap. Customers will appreciate their impact and likely offer more constructive criticism down the road. Plus, what better way to improve your products and generate new ideas that your target audience really wants?The life of a product or service can also be extended by resurfacing older content. For example, if you publish a blog post about a new product, plug last month s release too. When you re-share  old  news along with fresh content, you can revive interest and catch the eye of users who missed it the first time around (likely a lot of them, since our feeds are so oversaturated these days). And since we re on the topic, don t forget the role social media plays in product marketing.E-commerceWelcome to the age of online ordering. It s more convenient and cost-effective than traveling to the store or making a phone call, especially now that the majority of online retailers have free and fast shipping options. As of 2015, 69% of adults shop online monthly and 33% weekly. If you only sell products at your location, you re limiting your reach considerably. Online and mobile ordering remove the geographical constraints that limit your market.So how can you leverage social media for online sales? First off, shareability. When you sell online, you can offer discounts to buyers who share a product or service with friends over social media. Groupon is a great example of this: if you get X amount of friends to buy the same deal as you, your purchase is free. Secondly, social media can be used as an independent online shop. Facebook pages can serve as online shops. Pinterest is a prime online commerce tool. And that s just the tip of the iceberg.Human resourcesBusinesses are no longer only limited to ads and word-of-mouth to find the best employees -- top talent can be recruited through social media. Sites like LinkedIn let them share job openings site-wide and conduct better candidate screening. The social element adds a whole new layer to the traditional interview process. You may  connect  with a potential candidate before you ever interview them, gaining access to their network, interests, endorsed skills and more. This modern transparency is a far cry from old school hiring.It s a whole new world for job-seekers too. You can apply for positions right through LinkedIn and even see how many applications have already been submitted, or check out a company s Glassdoor reviews for a glimpse into their culture. My college newspaper has a Facebook group for its alumni staff; members are constantly sharing openings at their companies and encouraging others to apply. And on any site, users can easily share listings with friends and family who may be interested.NetworkingWhile making connections used to mean circling up at a conference and trading business cards, these days you can gain as much -- if not more -- networking value from social media. It s never been easier to engage with other professionals and make highly personal connections that flourish and last. You can also tell a lot from a person s profile and the content they regularly publish.LinkedIn is obvious for this purpose, but Twitter is an incredible networking tool as well. Much like walking up to a circle of strangers and introducing yourself, you can start conversations or join active discussions by tweeting at other users. Twitter lacks the  friends-only  vibe of Facebook -- its users typically welcome followers they don t know personally, and the most active often interact daily with people they ve never met face-to-face.ConclusionIt s easy to see what the future might hold with social media. Be your own time machine -- stay up on the latest industry trends and anticipate advances to get a head start. Research what customers are saying about competing brands and let that inform your strategy. Better to learn from another company s mistakes than make them, and better to celebrate their successes as teaching moments too. If used to its full potential, social media can drive success creatively and at little cost to businesses.

/article/280059,6 Ways to Lawfully Embrace Social Recruiting,Checking an applicant's social media profiles is reasonable due diligence but there are legal considerations you need to know.,"I hear too many lawyers strongly discourage employers from ever looking at an applicant s social media accounts. Yes, there are legal risks, but those risks can be mitigated.As important, there can be legal and business risks in not looking at social media during the hiring process. So we're actually talking about risk management, not risk avoidance.What are the legal risks if you look at an applicant s social media profiles, such as on Facebook, Instagram or LinkedIn?  By the applicant s pictures or words, you may learn things about the applicant s membership in a protect group, such as his or her likely race, religion, disability, age, etc.Even if you don t consider doing it, an applicant may unlawfully argue that you did. It's not easy to prove the negative.On the other hand, you may find valuable information that lawfully may be considered. In one case, an employer found racist posts by a managerial applicant.I was glad the company learned of this, or they would have hired the miscreant. Think of the legal and business risks that could have occurred if they had hired him.Most people are perfect, at most, twice in their life: at birth and in an interview. Reviewing social media accounts can help you determine who the person truly is who you're considering hiring. Here are six recommendations to minimize the legal risks, and maximize the business rewards of reviewing social media profiles as part of the hiring process.1. Do not look at social media profiles to screen applicants.Using social media to screen applicants is using it too early in the process. Generally, it's unnecessary and risky. It's unnecessary because you should be focusing on the position s objective criteria at this point. And it's risky because an unqualified applicant may claim that she was rejected because you saw she was an older Asian woman, for example.2. Consider looking at social media at the end of the hiring process.Review social media only at the end or near the end of the hiring process. Some employers include this step as part of  their background check.The risk is much lower because, after interviewing the applicant, you will already know that the applicant is, as in the prior example, an older Asian woman. Additionally, fewer applicants will have their social media profiles reviewed so it has fewer risks.But there still is some risk. An individual may post information you otherwise would not learn about in the interview, such as he that he's gay or on medication for depression.The risk must be balanced against the value of what you may learn. Another case could be an applicant posting pictures of themselves wearing virtually nothing.3. Human resources should review social media.Someone on your HR team - not the hiring manager -- should review candidates' social media account. HR professionals are better equipped to focus on what can and cannot be considered.Related: Use Your Employee Referral Program in Social RecruitingYou should tell hiring managers that they can't check social media accounts. If you don t tell them they can't, they will assume they can and may do so at the wrong time, or consider factors they shouldn't.4. Only review public information.Never ask an applicant for his or her social media password. It is like asking an applicant for the keys to his or her home.Related: 13 Social Media Power Tips for Getting the Job You WantApproximately 20 state laws prohibit employers from asking for social media passwords. In all states, it can be criminal under federal law.5. Keep your process consistent.You don t need to look at social media profiles for every position in the company. But it's also dangerous to do so only when you feel like something may be off.Selective social media reviews can be seen as based on discriminatory factors. Indeed, the gut feeling may be based on implicit bias if the person is different from you - whoever you may be.Related: 3 Ways to Be Constantly Recruiting Star Talent Through Social MediaSo decide before you begin recruiting for a position whether a social media screening will be part of the process and document it. Just don t do it because of who the person is.6. Print out any social media posts that you intend to consider.We all know that individuals may delete or hide posts from the public; therefore, print out anything you find as soon as you see it. Note what disturbs you about it. This preserves the argument, by negative implication what you did not consider, namely, an applicant s membership in a protected group.Jonathan SegalJonathan A.

/article/279916,'Human Resources' Just Doesn't Tell You What HR Really Does,"HR titles are changing for the better. Soon you\'ll begin to see titles, such as ""Chief Happiness Officer"" and ""Mood Coordinator.""","Here s a simple truth. Human resources is an outdated term.The HR director or HR coordinator no longer just focuses on hiring and firing employees and making sure the company is in compliance with benefits and payroll.In fact, many businesses are even shying away from the title HR coordinator, as it may sound stuffy or scary, and - worst of all -- it appears to commoditize human beings. Certainly, people are an organization s greatest resource, but they aren t smartphones, replaced with the newest model every two years. They re also not raw materials or working capital, used until the supply is depleted and then replenished in time for the next initiative.To remain competitive and productive, it s up to the C-suite to revitalize and invigorate employees, so they continue to perform their best. And that is a key reason many successful organizations are changing ""head of human resources"" to  chief people officer,   chief happiness officer  and mood coordinator. Related: 4 Things CEOs Want From HR LeadershipJust as the phrase to describe HR professionals has evolved and expanded, so, too, have the duties of that department.The HR departments of the past were segregated as their own separate entity, not part of the employee team and also not quite part of upper management. But how can an organization focus on building a strong company culture and creating happy employees with a strong purpose if the person in charge of that function isn t part of the team they seek to lead?The HR department requires a cultural overhaul, some reputation management and a PR facelift. HR is evolving in creative ways to fit today s innovative HR titles.Related: If You Need Better Leaders, Who You Gonna Call? HR.The new generation of HR titles doesn t leave room to treat people like commodities. Once HR personnel begin thinking of themselves as a chief happiness officer or even mood coordinator, it opens the door to viewing employees as people with feelings, goals and ambitions both inside and outside the office. It s the job of today s HR professional to take into account those aspects of workers  personalities as they seek to manage the overall cultural climate of the office, workplace morale and productivity.Perhaps it was the millennial influence that affirmed for employees that personal fulfillment matters in the workplace. Or maybe it s technology that blends work and life into one, giving employees more flexibility to perform their duties on their own terms. In all likelihood, a number of factors have given way to the evolution of HR.Related: Why You Don't Need an HR Manager. Really.With the growth of flex-time, video conferencing technology and bring your own device (BYOD) policies, the HR professional is managing more moving parts than ever before. The upside is that each of these factors, when managed well, empowers employees to do their jobs with greater efficiency. And empowered employees are happy and productive employees.HR s role today covers employee engagement and empowerment, employee experiences (the day-to-day office experience as well as workplace amenities and organized team-building activities) and the workplace culture. And that s before you get into recruiting and candidate experiences.It s no easy feat, which is why HR professionals must find the balance between workplace flexibility and getting the job done. In the past, it was the HR leader s job to ensure everyone was treated equally. Now, it s about treating every employee fairly - and taking steps to ensure that everything, from their hours and primary work location to their benefits, and even the technology they use, is customized to the employee s specific needs.HR and technology have blended. Smart HR teams have evolved to keep pace. This department no longer simply manages people but also works with the CIO to manage the technology they use - all with the goal of happier, more productive workers. HR directors, who get CIOs in their corner, will discover limitless possibilities to use technology to build a video culture, enable workplace flexibility and enhance productivity.As the role of the HR department continues to evolve, the very concept of human resources may be phased out. And new titles may reflect leaders, who are not gatekeepers and enforcer of rules, but partners in creating a company culture built upon the shared values of the organization and its workers.Meghan M.

/article/279775,4 Marketing Strategies You Need to Make HR Better,"Boost your brand, improve employee morale and mange talent.","HR pros play a lot of roles -- employee liaison, culture keeper, people leader, coach. But here s a new idea -- the best ones are also marketers. They boost employer brand and improve the overall experience for employees. And when HR adopts marketing techniques, they can better manage talent.Here are the marketing principles every HR leader should incorporate:1. Have a target audience.Marketers have a deep understanding of their audiences. They study demographics, attitudes and behaviors to create detailed customer personas and target messages to specific groups of people.Related: What HR Pros Need to Learn From the Rest of the CompanyHR can use the same strategy to better reach employees. After all, employees receive hundreds of emails every week -- yet 50 percent of those surveyed in theEMPLOYEEapp s Mobile Trends in the Workplace survey said they still feel out of the loop. Why? Because the messages aren t tapping into their interests.Start by learning everything about the employees targeted in the message. What motivates them? What are their goals? What do they value most? What are their concerns? What financial and non-financial  offers  will they respond to? How do these answers vary from department to department? Between managers and employees?Then, use this knowledge to target messages and HR programs to specific groups of employees, instead of sending generic information to everyone.For example, company announcements should look, feel and sound different depending on who the audience is -- different employees want different information in different ways. They want to know how it will affect them. How will it change their everyday work life? What s in it for them?Let s say the company is adding a new wellness program. The message to employees should outline the program and how it can benefit them. What are the rewards for participation? The message to team leaders, on the other hand, should outline ways to encourage their team to get involved.Think like a marketer to deliver the most relevant and important information to each employee.2. Every channel. One brand voice.Marketers know that if they want to get the attention of their audience, they need to use more than one method. A campaign cannot be successful through emails and newsletters alone. Marketers use a mix of media to convey their messages. They use video, images, interactive websites, social media and more. In fact, the best marketing is viral -- it s what other employees say about the programs.Related: A Comprehensive Guide to Building a Better Content Marketing StrategyAnd emails aren t enough to reach employees. In theEMPLOYEEapp survey, 80 percent of employers said they use email to communicate, but 30 percent of employees said they ignore emails from their employer.According to Wrike s 2016 Mobile Productivity Report, 90 percent of surveyed professionals believe a mobile device is critical to getting their jobs done.So use text messages, mobile apps, internal social networks and other mobile-optimized resources to communicate. Upload videos and pictures to engage employees in newsletters and announcements. Start a company blog and double down on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and other platforms employees use. The more ways employees can access and digest information, the better.But reaching everyone with a wide array of uncoordinated themes, benefits, colors, and tone seems scattered. Would P&G, Unilever, Disney or the best brand-builders in the world take a shotgun approach to building the value of their most important assets? Have a strategy and a voice, and have them show up in everything the company does.3. Bring it all together.Marketers want to make the buying process easy for customers. And like marketers, HR wants employees to  buy  into programs, initiatives and benefits enrollment. It connects them to their work in broader ways.When HR focuses on a branded employee experience, encouraging program participation becomes easier. Bring all programs, initiatives and information together in one easy-to-use platform. Think of it as a hub that integrates the most important HR benefits, programs and initiatives in one convenient place.Employees don t have to switch back and forth between multiple websites and keep track of information separately. When they can access everything in as few places as possible, participation becomes so much easier. And, in many cases, it s much easier for employers to manage, too.4. Measure effectiveness.Marketers track and measure everything to find the best strategies, adjust what isn t working and get the most bang for their buck. Data is everything in modern marketing.Related: HR Analytics: How Should Big Data Be Used in the WorkplaceHR teams can also track and measure data to continually improve processes. Decide what metrics are most important to the company culture and overall business goals and track them to drive employee engagement. Are employees responding to messages? Are they getting the right messages at the right time? Are they participating in programs? Are they happy? What can be done better? Some new HR systems learn about people and take action so employers don t even have to.HR isn t an easy job. But when leaders look at it from a marketing perspective, HR strategies can improve the employee experience and build a consistent and strong employer brand.

/article/280223,What's in a Name? New HR Titles Reflect These Professionals' Strategic Importance.,How does 'people operations' strike you? 'Chief people officer'? 'Chief happiness officer'?,"HR professionals are the glue that holds a company together, but the term  human resources  doesn t necessarily scream excitement to the everyday person. In fact, to some it feels outdated.Related: 8 Business Name Mistakes That Investors Hate to SeeA lot of times, employees aren t even exactly sure what the ""HR department"" even does, outside of basic paperwork or answers to questions about benefits.But, the thing is, HR has never been more strategic, and that s why more and more employers lately have been shifting away from the traditional ""HR"" label and to the more exciting one of . . .  people operations. This is not just a rebranding effort -- it s about reinvigorating traditional HR with a new mindset. While the traditional HR department is focused primarily on compliance and hiring, ""people operations"" takes this skill set a step further by looking at the best ways to empower employees to meet goals and drive results. People operations  isn t the only new label you ll see out there. With more strategy comes even more responsibilities, which in turn calls for snazzier new role names that get at HR s new set of priorities. What other new HR titles are out there, and what do they mean? Here s a look:'Chief people officer'More and more employers are realizing just how important their people are -- and just how invaluable their HR department is. In fact, a July 2015 CareerBuilder survey found that 57 percent of CEOs surveyed said that HR executives provide actionable talent data and other research that helps companies devise strategies to meet larger business goals. What s more, 73 percent said that their own HR leader had provided data they had incorporated into their overall business strategy.To give these professionals a greater voice and role in the company as whole, many organizations -- including my company, Namely -- are adding a ""chief people officer"" to their HR teams. When the HR department is structured to include this position, it not only has a greater role within the company, but employees feel more valued. They feel just as important as Finance, Operations and other business functions that have a presiding VP. Related: What's in a Name? In Branding, Pretty Much Everything.While the chief people officer title has more influence, its priorities are similar to those of a traditional head of HR. Strengthening HR operations comes first before its team members can turn their attention to forward-thinking strategies.'Chief happiness officer'Just like a ""vice president of people,"" a ""chief happiness officer"" position puts the HR department in the C-suite -- at least figuratively. While a VP of people oversees everything from recruitment to onboarding to talent development and mobility, the chief happiness officer has a more singular focus: employee contentment.It might sound silly, but happiness can have a huge impact on employee performance. After all, a February 2014 study conducted by researchers at the University of Warwick and the Institute for the Study of Labor found that happier employees are 12 percent more productive and are more passionate about work. With that kind of impact, it s no wonder employers are putting professionals on a mission to make their people happier.Heroku takes a unique approach to the challenge with what it calls ""vibe managers."" These new office managers focus on the little things, to keep employees happy and engaged. For example, vibe managers have done everything from organizing team bar outings, to finding an old TV compatible with an old-school Nintendo. But vibe managers do more than cater to the wants of employees. More importantly, they listen to what teams are saying, anticipate their needs and meet them before employees need to ask.Whether they re called a vibe manager or chief happiness officer, these professionals look at all the different aspects that make up traditional HR, only through the lens of the employee experience.'Chief of culture'HR has known the importance of company culture for some time, but executives are now starting to see its value, too. According to a 2014 global survey of nearly 1,200 C-suite executives by McKinsey & Co., spending time on culture was a key priority for respondents who had successfully transitioned to the C-suite.That s why more companies are adding chiefs of culture and chief happiness officers. While many employers add these positions as a way to maintain company culture during periods of rapid growth and major changes, Stericycle did so to shift its company's focus from operations to its employees. Although the company was already financially successful, the CEO felt it could do more for its people.Related: The 8 Must-Follow Rules for Rebranding Your Company (Infographic)No matter what the reason, culture officers work with HR and executives to make sure programs, initiatives and processes reinforce and reflect the company culture and values.Matt StrazMatt Straz is the founder and CEO of Namely, the HR and payroll platform for the world's most exciting companies.Read more",Human Resources,2016-08-08 17:30:00
/article/279479,4 Reasons Why Smart Companies Are Going Remote,More young professionals are opting for remote work opportunities and freelancing -- here is how businesses can get in on the trend.,"As someone who loves and is lucky to live near the ocean, I enjoy occasionally working remotely near the beach, with a cup of coffee and a laptop, enveloped in the soft sounds and cool breeze of the ocean. Fortunately, improvements in technology and new business mindsets have made it possible to do so much more often.In fact, 38 percent of U.S. workers currently work as freelancers and that number is estimated to grow to 50 percent by 2020. Not only is it more convenient, there are also examples of ex-corporate professionals who make twice as much freelancing.This trend is not only for ambitious individual freelancers. Many large and innovative companies are also adopting remote work strategies. BaseCamp, Upworthy and Buffer, just to name a few, now allow employees to work from anywhere.Related: We're Turning Into a Freelance Nation. Here's What That Looks LikeThe reason for this shift is that working remotely (anywhere outside the office) can actually offer a myriad of benefits. For companies, working remotely can help reduce costs, increase productivity, and boost employee well-being. For workers, the option to avoid stifling commutes, bland cubicles and ineffective meetings are becoming much more attractive and preferred by young employees.Additionally, working remotely offers employees the opportunity to achieve work-life integration rather than just work-life balance.If you need more evidence, consider these four reasons why many smart companies continue to go remote.1. Happier and more productive employeesA study from TINYpulse demonstrated that remote workers are increasingly happy in their work because of the freedom and flexibility that working remotely offers. The study also showed that remote workers feel more valued and an overwhelming 91 percent felt more productive overall.The study also showed that workers appreciated having the choice between working remotely and reporting to an office, which empowered them to achieve work-life integration and ultimately perform better for the company.2. Recruit and retain top talentHigh performers get work done wherever they are, so offering your best talent the ability to better meet family obligations, fuel creativity and spur productivity by working remotely is a benefit that helps both them and you.Related: The Freelance Economy Is Booming. But Is It Good Business?Additionally, a study on remote workers in China found that high-performers were more likely to stay at companies that offered remote positions and when employees were allowed to integrate the benefits of remote work into their work day, overall performance actually improved.Lastly, companies that hire remote workers open opportunities to find top talent from a broader global talent pool. Tech talent in particular crosses borders at growing rates as innovative companies take full advantage of the global market.3. Promote healthier workers and bottom-line.For employees, remote work can significantly enhance personal health with the right routines and balance. Remote workers have more time and freedom to exercise regularly, eat healthy meals at home and take ""recharge"" breaks from work when needed. All of these benefits are vital to physical and mental health and help employees be happier and more productive.Allowing employees to work remotely also has significant benefits for the environment. Research by Global Workforce Analytics estimates that if employees with a remote-compatible job worked remotely at least half the time, society could save annually:$20 million in gas54 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions (equivalent to taking almost 10 million cars off the road for a year)640 million barrels of oil (worth $64 billion)119 billion miles of highway drivingFurthermore, research from Nielsen indicates that 55 percent of global online consumers are willing to pay more for products and services from companies with a positive environmental impact. This means that going green (through remote work) could actually result in a net-positive impact to the bottom line.4. Create superior long-term business performance.Many top tech companies have already made the shift to allowing remote workers, including Automattic, Mozilla and Toptal, just to name a few. According to Toptal s website, employees are ""recognized for what you do, not your time in a chair."" Related: Federal Government Hopes to Get a Grasp on the Sharing EconomyFor these companies, a remote work strategy is more than just about making employees happy or improving the bottom line today. It is about creating a sustainable and long-term strategy through a cohesive high-performance culture.Jerry Porras, Professor of Organizational Behavior at Stanford, found through his research that superior long-term business performance comes from tightly integrated, values-driven teams. While it is never easy, these companies are figuring out ways to stitch together remote workforces that embody the principles outlined in Porras s research.  While keeping remote teams cohesive is not simple, many businesses are rising to the challenge. Companies are deploying remote work methods like streamlined team communication, retreats, and video chat. Others are encouraging the use of and even creating their own coworking spaces, which allows for the commingling of talented professionals to meet, network and ultimately benefit from increased collaboration.As technology continues to improve and the ""remote work revolution"" continues to evolve, the top performing companies will continue to find that balancing remote work strategies with a well executed business culture will keep them ahead of the competition.Peter GascaPeter Gasca is an entrepreneur, consultant and author.

Just keep it in your car.,"Local HR laws are confusing enough; try throwing in factors like multiple offices and remote employees spanning multiple states, and as an employer, you're looking at a tangle of rules and regulations. From the East Coast to the West Coast, the Midwest to the South, each state has different laws governing everything from payroll rules to discrimination policies.Related: Where Marijuana Is Legal HR Policy Needs to AdjustToday s HR professionals are bound to come across new, and sometimes even strange, HR laws. Here s a look at some of the craziest workplace laws on the books across the country dealing with some of the hottest topics in employment:Noncompete agreementsNorth Dakota: Although noncompete agreements are pretty standard in today s workplace, they aren t enforceable in North Dakota. Noncompete agreements are allowed only between or among business partners and between the buyers and sellers of a company, but may not include employees.Arkansas: When noncompete and nonsolicitation agreements in Arkansas need to be revised because they're overbroad, employers have to start from scratch; in fact, the whole agreement needs to be thrown out and employers need to start over. The courts won t allow for the editing of those agreements.SalaryCalifornia: California is notoriously tricky when it comes to HR compliance, and overtime is also calculated differently in the state -- a factor which is especially important, considering the recent update to national overtime rules.In the Golden State, employees are paid time-and-a-half after an eight hour day, 40-hour work week and for the first eight hours they work on the seventh consecutive day worked in a week. Employees are also entitled to double-time pay if they work more than 12 hours in a day, or more than 8 hours on the seventh consecutive day of work.Indiana: In Indiana, reducing employee pay is nearly impossible. Wage deductions are permitted only with a written agreement that the employee has to sign and that he or she may revoke at any time. It also must comply with one of the allowable reasons for reducing pay as outlined in the statute.

Notifications must also detail the day and place of payment and the specific methods used to determine pay.Utah: Although most states require employers to provide an alternative method of pay to direct deposit, Utah allows employers to mandate direct deposit if their federal employment tax deposit from the previous calendar year was at least $250,000, and if two-thirds of their employees are already using direct deposit.DiscriminationMichigan: Discrimination isn t limited to race, age and gender in Michigan. Workplace discrimination or harassment based on height or weight is also against the law.Ohio: In the Buckeye State employers aren t the only ones held responsible for discrimination claims -- managers and human resources staff may be liable, too. These individuals can be held accountable with, or separately from, the employer in these cases.Drugs and alcoholMinnesota: In most states, failing a drug test is grounds for termination, but the law requires employers to do things differently in Minnesota. Employees who test positive for drugs or alcohol must be allowed their first time to complete treatment programs and return to work.Arizona: In Arizona, employers can t discriminate against employees who use medical marijuana, based on their status as a cardholder, or if they test positive for the substance in a drug test. There is an exception for safety-sensitive positions, but it s usually unavailable to multi-state employers, as it requires employers to have a drug test policy that complies with Arizona s drug testing statute.Terms of employmentSouth Carolina: At-will employment disclaimers aren t valid in South Carolina unless they are printed on the cover page of employee handbooks in underlined, capital letters.Georgia: When employees in Georgia leave for active military service, they are guaranteed to have a job waiting for them when they return.

A group of professionals, who have a growth mindset, are driven to push themselves to constantly learn.Offer career development resources, such as career coaches, online training, guest speakers, tuition reimbursement, mentorships and other educational programs. These options encourage the staff to define their career path.Talent mobility initiatives also help companies attract top talent. Job seekers and employees alike know the value of professional education.What s more, according to a May 2014 study by the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM), 42 percent of 600 employees surveyed say their organization s commitment to professional development is  very important  to their job satisfaction.Even when companies offer such programs, they continue to struggle with scaling the business. Why? Because they don t have a goal in mind.Define goals.In the words of Stephen Covey, begin with the end in mind. Without a goal, companies have no sense of direction and therefore no plan. After all, what good is a group of employees who have the motivation to grow but lack a clear strategy?First, help employees set personal goals. If a customer service representative wants to learn about product development and move up in the department, assign them a coach to break down their long-term goals with short-term targets.After employees develop a vision for their future with the company, ask them for input on redefining organizational goals. Perhaps the current ones don t focus on expansion or aren t specific enough.When employees have a voice in setting organizational goals, they can provide input to help the company identify critical performance priorities. These priorities could be profitability, customer satisfaction and conversion rates. After prioritizing what needs to be updated, identify a few strengths and weaknesses within the company's processes.Related: This is Why You Need to Let Your Best Employees GoThis collaborative practice gives everyone a clear understanding of the current state of the company. Leaders should work to clarify the vision, mission and values that align with the team. Use any noted weaknesses to define expectations. For example, if the work order processing time is more than 24 hours, set a goal to keep it under 24 hours, and start planning how to hit that goal.The worst offense a company can make is to leave their team in the dark. When several staff members provide input on goal setting, they develop a deep understanding of the big picture, allowing them to recognize the impact they can make on the large scale operations.Announce the changes.Armed with a clear strategy and a team full of motivated workers, it s time to inform the entire staff about the updates to the company culture, core values, vision and mission statement. Never assume that everyone is familiar with the changes. Instead, play it safe, assuming nobody knows, and start drumming up excitement.Unfortunately, it s all too common for companies to fail at aligning their staff with the big picture. According to a 2015 study by Achievers, 61 percent of employees don t know their organization s cultural values.Related: How to Create Paths to Career Advancement That Matter to Your EmployeesWhen employees are informed, they know the identity of the company and can see where they fit into the plan for company-wide growth. Provide educational materials to all levels of the organization. Distribute newsletters and post announcements. Hang signage, and use other visual aids in the workplace to share the new organizational culture.When employees know what values steer the company and what the organizational goals are, they are more motivated, engaged and excited to grow with the company. Create an environment and a culture that speaks the new brand s language.Create a reinforcement plan.What s the use of redefining company culture without reinforcing it? Essentially, this cultural shift is getting everybody into a growth mindset, where people believe their talents and abilities can be strengthened with persistence and education.Plan to proactively deliver this message of growth daily through multiple channels. Assign brand ambassadors to engage employees and get them excited about the improved organizational culture. Supply brand ambassadors with training on how to expand brand awareness through outlets like LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter. After all, excited employees are one of the most effective talent attraction tools.Related: Young Talent Demands These 6 Things for Their LoyaltyAdditionally, create branded internal websites with social elements like employee profiles, comment sections, sharing capabilities and notification functions. This way, employees can be messaged when an opportunity that aligns with their goals and competencies opens up.Make sure to deliver newsletters and announcements regularly to keep employees informed. For example, companies like Ritz Carlton initiate daily huddles to keep everyone updated, engaged and motivated.To successfully create a culture that facilitates large-scale growth, it s crucial to invest in developing employees, strategizing on large and small scale goals, creating a talent mobility program, communicating well, building a supportive environment and consistently reinforcing the company's message.Kes ThygesenKes Thygesen is the co-founder and head of product at RolePoint, a complete social recruiting suite that provides unrivaled access and reach to quality job candidates.Read more",Talent Management,2016-07-15 18:00:00
/article/277523,How to Create Paths to Career Advancement That Matter to Your Employees,You retain top talent by helping them climb to greater heights.,"It s no secret that offering professional development opportunities and career training appeals to job candidates. According to a 2014 Global Workforce Study conducted by Towers Watson, career advancement opportunities matter most to employees when deciding to join or leave an organization.It s a great benefit to advertise, but how exactly are companies delivering on internal talent mobility?Here s how companies can create and define specific career paths to retain top talent and attract the best of the best.Establish training programs and criteria.Before recruiting, define goals and expectations for each role. Knowing what is needed informs hiring and results in better cultural and competency fits.Align each employee s goals with organizational goals. For example, if the goal is to improve customer service, incorporate training on conflict resolution for customer service representatives.Cater modules to each individual employee. This requires an evaluation of everyone, looking at how their skills align with company expectations. The best way to develop career paths, tailored to each person, is by gathering feedback to create career development plans.Related: Attract Top Talent: Show Them You Have What They WantEncourage feedback.Employees should have a voice in their career paths. If they re hired in product research and want to move over to sales, help them develop an action plan. A transition like this requires cross training.Management needs to know about the potential they have in their hands. Unfortunately, most don't. According to a 2015 Talent Mobility Research Report, only 42 percent of the 257 companies surveyed understand their employee s unique skills and experience.Incorporate regular evaluations where managers assess an employee s skills and experience and help them define their specific goals. When companies invest time and energy in listening to their talent, they re creating a trusting environment, which is crucial to retaining top talent and building a team dedicated to growing with the company.Consider the employee experience. The employee experience is what an employee encounters during interactions with different career elements - everything from environment and customer base to coworkers and leadership - that affect their cognitions and influence their behaviors.Employers need to step in their staff s shoes to see how they experience their day-to-day and how they perceive their role within the larger picture.Help them draw that connection and see how they fit. Provide them with perspective through consistent feedback so they can both correct their mistakes and understand how they re succeeding.Bottom line: When your employees understand their impact and see how they affect the growth and success of the company, they feel more important and engaged in their work.Related: This is Why You Need to Let Your Best Employees GoCreate a trusting relationship.Investing in an employee s development and career growth demonstrates a high level of respect and trust. The 2015 Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM) study found that trust between employees and senior management was the second most important contributor to job satisfaction.The same study also found that respectful treatment of all employees at all levels was rated as  very important  by 72 percent of employees, making it the top contributor to overall employee job satisfaction.Keep employees satisfied by creating a relationship built on trust and respect. The best way to do this is to treat them like humans, providing them with guidance and emphasizing the value they bring to achieving organizational goals.Be transparent and present. When management is visible, they re showing support and demonstrating they feel like a member of the team not a boss. Establish credibility as a leader by taking ownership when necessary, avoiding blaming others and being consistent. When managers do this, they are leading by example.Related: Young Talent Demands These 6 Things for Their LoyaltyBy reaching out and establishing an open communication channel, employers are not shrouding the business in secrecy. They re exercising transparency, encouraging employees to see their progress and develop a sense of ownership.The ideal world consists of dedicated employees who respect their managers and feel comfortable discussing their goals. They want to learn and grow within the company, achieving organizational goals and taking steps toward that vision.Help create this ideal by laying the framework for career paths and being explicit and open about expectations while celebrating successes.

/article/277454,Is Your Organization Playing the 'Gossip Game?',Utilize pulse surveys to keep your organization on the same page.,"Most of us have played the gossip game -- where you whisper a phrase or saying to the person next to you at a party. Then, that person whispers what they heard to the next person, and the pattern is repeated as the  supposed  message makes its way around the room. The fun part is when you compare the original saying with the message that was actually heard by the last person. The discrepancies are both humorous and alarming especially when you think about messages that might really matter.Leaders often face a high-stakes version of the gossip game as they implement change within their organizations. Just like the whispered sayings at a party, corporate communications often become corrupted as they trickle down through the organization.To illustrate this problem, we sometimes use a farming analogy and say that ""the water (or the message) isn t making it to the end of the row.  My business partner calls this phenomenon the  Irrigation Effect. Communication breakdowns are problematic, not only because the messages become distorted, but also because they can create expectation gaps with your employees. When expectation gaps exist, trust is compromised and employee confidence is eroded. Effective leaders do their best to minimize expectation gaps whenever possible, as they realize these gaps have a destructive effect in building the right employee experience.A key way to combat communication failures is through people analytics and the effective use of pulse surveys or employee sentiment tools. Academic institutions figured out this concept a while back when teachers started using remote control devices to poll their students in real-time to see if concepts were being understood.Pulse surveys, or employee sentiment tools, are software platforms that allow organizations to administer daily, weekly or monthly surveys in addition to their regularly scheduled, organization-wide surveys.Typically, pulse surveys are used by HR leaders to get a feel for an organization s operating climate at any one given moment in time.As suggested, any business leader can take advantage of these tools to get a feel for how well a key message was received or will be received in the future.Communication surveys can be timed to guide communications before messages are sent in order to assist in understanding whether messages are being properly received. They can also be conducted after the fact in order to help tweak the change process, when needed.Related: What a 'Best Butt' Award Says About Bad Corporate CultureLet s consider a case a study.Suppose a healthcare organization needs to decrease those instances where a patient accidentally falls. The organization s leaders have implemented a protocol requiring their staff to assist patients when they leave their rooms. To assess how well this initiative is being followed and understood, the organization's leadership team could conduct a simple pulse survey, asking the following four questions:How important is the  fall prevention  initiative to our organization? (5: Critically Important, 4: Somewhat Important, 3: When Possible Effort, 2: Just Make an Effort, 1: Not Important, 0: I Do Not Know About This Initiative)Who is responsible to ensure that falls do not occur? (Stack rank a list of potential groups)When was the last time the  fall prevention  initiative was discussed within your teams? (5: Today, 4: This Week, 3: Last Week, 4: This Month, 5: Never or Do Not Know)In your own words, what is the  fall prevention  initiative? (Open comments that are analyzed by a text analytics tool)After reviewing the survey s results, management could either reinforce their original message or make corrections to ensure that alignment exists.Related: How to Use Analytics to Unlock a Treasure Trove of InformationLet s look at another scenario.Assume an organization is changing how it handles performance reviews. A single question could be,  Why do we conduct performance reviews? A text analytics tool could analyze the responses and then create comment categories and provide management with some pretty interesting insights.Communication surveys should only take between two to three minutes to complete, but the information is invaluable in knowing how an initiative is being received and implemented.Although software applications do a good job in trying to minimize survey fatigue and in improving participation through gamification techniques and other strategies, too many pulse surveys will cause both fatigue and a significant drop in participation. Thus, care should be used when considering how often communication surveys are administered.Related: The Crazy Creative Way This Company Got Workers to Read its HR MaterialsLeaders need to deploy surveys carefully and with restraint to ensure these types of surveys retain their effectiveness. Nonetheless, if employees feel that communication surveys are respectful of their time, and they see that meaningful change comes about as a result of the surveys, a culture of turning feedback into results will start to take root within your organization.Pulse surveys are commonplace within many organizations, and polling your people can be an effective analytics tool. In particular, using pulse surveys to enhance or evaluate corporate communications is one way that forward-thinking leaders are using people analytics to improve leadership, communication and their organizations in general.Matthew WrideMatt Wride is the COO for DecisionWise, a leadership and management consulting firm.

/article/277029,4 Tips for Keeping that New Hire,Hiring is a huge financial investment. Make sure you protect it.,"						This story appears in the July 2016 issue of Entrepreneur. Subscribe  Hiring people is a lot of work -- and a huge financial investment. In fact, the Center for American Progress says it costs roughly 20 percent of a new hire s salary just to get them signed on. So once they re hired, you ll want a lineup of great tech that gets them excited and keeps them engaged, says David Secunda, founder and CEO of Boulder, Colo.-based HR startup WorkBright.Before they re hired When an employee quits early, it s often because they had very different expectations about the job -- which means you didn t hire the right person. Use social media to provide transparency into your company. Create  Day in the Life  videos on YouTube to profile employees, special events and other  insider views  of the business. Be honest about all positions -- even those parts that aren t glamorous. Once they re hired Use onboarding programs like WorkBright or Red Carpet by Silk Road to collect info on the new employee, and pair them with a like-minded mentor. Create a series of email messages, delivered on a set schedule using a tool like Constant Contact, to orient them to what makes your company special. And immediately plug them into your employee-only social media platforms, then ask them to post a photo and share a bit about their history and why they re excited to join the team.Employee orientationDocument tools like Google Forms can collect nonsensitive paperwork immediately. Many incoming staffers today prefer completing their onboarding from their smartphone, which is quick and comfortable, and increases their commitment.Keep it goingUse a tool like SurveyMonkey to ask questions: Does someone at work encourage your development?

/article/277798,What a 'Best Butt' Award Says About Bad Corporate Culture,"Yes, companies have bad employees and managers, but they operate amid a culture that allows them to behave poorly.","It seems like, on the first day of your new job, every employee handbook circulated covers the general rule that telling someone they have a nice butt isn't a good idea professionally.That's why a recent controversy at an Indiana restaurant chain is such a head-scratcher. At least one manager at Scotty's Brewhouse in Indianapolis was fired as a result of a team-building event gone wrong. Several employees received trophies akin to ""best bartender"" or ""best server,"" presumably as some kind of reward for good service.But one employee got a trophy that was entirely unwelcome: ""Best butt."" Not only that, but, after receiving the trophy, she was then told to turn around in front of everyone so people could take pictures of the asset that won her the award.The server, whom the local media didn't identify, was, unsurprisingly, not amused. In fact, she felt humilated. I feel like I m more than just a butt,"" the woman told a local television station. ""I feel like I m smart. I m going to school. In fact, she deserved a trophy for nothing short of work ethic, it seems.  I have two jobs so I can make money and continue to go to school,"" she said, ""and then get my degree and not work two jobs anymore. The corporate bosses at Scotty's meted out an ass-whooping for the offense. In a statement, company owner Scott Wise said he was ""completely unaware"" of the awards, nor did he or anyone else in senior management ""condone or sponsor this event.""Related: How Does the EEOC Fare in the Discrimination Wars?""As a result,"" Wise said, ""we took immediate action that included terminating management, and I have instructed our teams to immediately do additional sexual harassment training companywide, beyond the initial training process new managers go through already when they are hired.""From a communications standpoint, that touches on the Holy Trinity of messaging that companies like Scotty's want to make in a crisis: It was an isolated incident, we handled it swiftly and we're working to make sure it never happens again.But there's also something hollow about the response. Sexual-harassment policies, like all corporate efforts to root out bad behavior and discrimination, can be filled with grey areas. All hiring, for instance, involves some kind of discrimination. Many a manager has spent a good amount of time wondering whether a colleague's compliment over a dress runs afoul of unwelcome-communications policies and needs a disciplinary response.This doesn't seem to be a grey area. Talking about someone's ""nice butt"" to them is an event worthy of termination at most places, for obvious reasons: It objectifies someone in a sexually aggressive away, which runs a high risk of being unwelcome by the receiver. That's first-day training material: No touching, no whistling, etc.Having a trophy engraved seems to take this to a whole other level of asininery.Related: 5 Ways to Manage 'Mad Men'-Era Sexual HarassmentAnd that's where an isolated firing and retraining might not do the trick Scotty's management needs. Many employees test company policies, but only enterprises with permissive cultures allow some to blow past boundaries in the way that happened with the ""nice butt"" trophy. It's probably not surprising that this happened in a bar environment, which is more laid back than a cubicle-farm office. A neon Bud sign is a modern sub rosa, a signal that much of what happens in the confine of the bar is meant to stay there, or at least to never be mentioned (or remembered) again. Many employees at bars and restaurants know and accept this. The banter that goes on in kitchens or behind bar with staff would make a Teamster blush and cause blood-pressure spikes in the average HR representative.But that's no license to humiliate or take away human dignity from someone, and that's what happened at Scotty's. Beyond simply a rogue employee or two, Scotty's corporate culture bears some responsibility and needs an assessment. After all, it was Scotty's overall culture that, presumably, allowed people to be hired and promoted to the point where a nice-butt trophy didn't command a second thought. At the very least, it's a cultural indictment that a single management team at one restaurant could have an event like this without anyone in the corporate suites knowing about it or approving of it beforehand. Yes, all companies have bad employees and subpar managers, but bad culture often allows these people to go unchecked. That's the blame of leadership, not the bad actors in question.Related: Tinder Suspends Co-Founder Over Sexual Harassment ClaimsHere's the good news. Scotty's seems like a great business. It's been around 20 years, has about a dozen restaurants and looks to be welcoming and inventive with its food. (I'm particularly intrigued by something called a Chupacabra burger.) This isn't some roadside trucker tavern that can't get out of its own way. It seems to have bright marketing minds, committed leadership and it knows a crisis when it sees one. A cultural audit is at least easy to begin, even if the findings are troubling.And there's better news: Scotty's can use this to try to hire more people who work their tails off, support themselves, pay for their education and contribute to a positive workplace culture.That would be a very nice end.Ray HennesseyRay Hennessey, the former editorial director of Entrepreneur, is Chief Innovation Officer at JConnelly, an integrated communications firm in New York, and a senior advisor to Alley, a coworking community in Manhattan.

/article/275972,Businesses Shouldn't Underestimate the Real Benefits of Parental Leave,Employers who accommodate families are rewarded with more committed employees.,"The United States is woefully behind when it comes to parental leave. Currently we are one of the only countries that does not mandate paid leave of any kind. What s more is that right now only 12 percent of private sector workers have access to paid family leave benefits through their employer. This leaves thousands of new parents with the challenge of caring for a burgeoning family while trying to earn an income.While we still have a long way to go, the United States is making progress. Three states -- California, New Jersey and Rhode Island -- currently offer paid leave programs funded through employee-paid payroll taxes. New legislation requiring paid leave has been rolling out across the country, with New York City and San Francisco recently enacting paid leave policies. Additionally, more and more heavy-hitting companies like EY, Coca-Cola, Netflix and Facebook are also getting on board, including parental leave policies for both parents.Though adoption of paid leave policies is a clear benefit to employees, it begs the question: what is the real impact of parental leave on businesses?Related: Facebook Expands Parental Leave Ahead of the Birth of Mark ...Parental leave can be a boon to your business.For small to medium-sized businesses, the impact of adopting a paid family leave policy can be significant. Budgets are already tight in a competitive market and staying compliant with state and federal medical and unpaid leave regulations can be incredibly complicated. However, incorporating paid family leave may also benefit your business.For one, the flexibility parental leave affords can lead to increased productivity when exhausted new parents have some time off to rest and organize family responsibilities. Paid leave benefits can also help employers garner employee loyalty and recruit top candidates in the global market. In fact, according to the White House s Summit on Working Families, nearly half of parents have chosen to pass on a job that would conflict with family obligations.So how can you successfully develop a paid family leave policy? Here are three ways to make the transition to providing paid parental leave more successful:Related: How to Calculate the Right Parental Leave Policy1. Know the laws.  First, know the laws and regulations for the states and cities where you conduct business so that you can develop your program in compliance with those laws.For most businesses with 50 or more employees, you are required to comply with numerous federal regulations, one of which is the Family and Medical Leave Act. This act requires that employers provide 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave per year for eligible employees. While you aren t required to offer paid leave, you are required to give employees 12 weeks off for parental leave.To make sure you re compliant, it may be worth the expense to hire an HR consultant or legal counsel who can help you sort through the nitty gritty of the regulations that pertain to your company, especially if you operate in multiple states or cities.2. Know your budget and business goals.Additionally, it is critical to know exactly what kind of policy you can afford to adopt. Having the best leave policies in the world aren t going to do your workforce any favors if your company folds. Before you implement your paid leave plan, talk to a financial advisor so you can plan out your business strategy and know all of the variables involved, such as how many weeks and what percentage of pay you can actually provide.Ideally, every business leader should consider parental leave, along with other paid time off programs, in the earliest stages of the business. You may not be able to afford to have a fully paid leave in the beginning stages, but with time you can scale your leave policy as your business grows.In our experience working in small businesses, providing paid parental leave was not an option. We were candid and asked employees to suggest options that might work for him or her. We got creative and found workable solutions, such as allowing new parents the option to temporarily work part-time or telecommute and providing longer lunch breaks so parents could see their children during the day. Giving employees the opportunity to suggest flexible solutions to juggle their work and personal lives paid off in our business.Related: 4 Data-Backed Reasons You Need to Offer More Parental Leave3. Know how to divide up the workload.Lastly, it is crucial you work with employees going on leave to ensure their work responsibilities that need to be covered are temporarily divided among other team members, or clearly articulated to a temporary employee. If you don t have defined job descriptions, ask employees requesting leave to write out each of their responsibilities, who will be covering for them and any necessary information others will need to know. For those who are covering these tasks, make sure you express your appreciation while also helping them balance their workloads.Plan ahead by starting the conversation with an expectant parent as soon as possible after the employee announces the news. This will allow you to develop a workable plan for managing your business operations while meeting the employee s time-off needs.Ready or not, parental leave is on the way.Parental leave is coming our way and businesses need to be ready for it. These changes in policy are critical to promoting the personal well-being and success of the millions of working parents in our country. By supporting your working parents with compliant and flexible leave programs when they need it the most, you create a more productive and engaged workforce, enhancing your employment brand and corporate reputation.

Hands off your keyboard, we ve got news for you. It s likely that an employer will spend less than 15 minutes reviewing that application, if someone reviews it at all.A recent study by research firm Future Workplace and HR software company CareerArc revealed that short review time and other statistics based on a survey of about 1,200 job seekers and employers about the application process.We ve all been there: researching a company, writing a cover letter, preparing a profile, putting in hours of work for a single job application, just to find out that -- well, we actually never find out anything. From a pool of 767 job seekers, more than 60 percent admitted that they rarely or almost never receive notice of a company s decision or status of a job application. Of those job seekers, a whopping 85 percent doubt that a human being ever even reviewed their application.If that s not discouraging enough, it s not untrue. Nearly 40 percent of 357 employers admitted to using an automated pre-screening tool for candidates, and of those more than 60 percent agreed that it s likely some qualified candidates were dropped in the process.Throughout the survey, employers acknowledged that their process was probably discouraging to job seekers, but many said they were attempting to improve it. Roughly 40 percent of surveyed employers said that better communication with candidates throughout and after the application process was an important area of focus. Almost three quarters say they have or plan to invest more time, money and resources to improve the overall candidate experience.Good thing, because four out of five seekers say they would probably not consider other job openings at a company that failed to notify them of their application status the last time.Check out the infographic below for more statistics about the job process.Click to Enlarge+ Rose LeademRose Leadem is an online editorial assistant at Entrepreneur Media Inc.

/article/276805,HR? Mobile Technology Will Make You Rethink Your Strategy.,The influx of millennials into the workforce makes it imperative that employers use mobile technology to appeal to them.,"Free Webinar | August 16thFind out how to optimize your website to give your customers experiences that will have the biggest ROI for your business.							Register Now  The use of mobile technology is on the rise, with employees using their smartphones on a regular basis. And, if you're an employer, this increase isn t necessarily a bad thing. Related: A New Wave of HR Technology Is Disrupting the MarketWrike s 2016 Mobile Productivity Report found, for instance, that 44 percent of the more than 850 professionals surveyed said they checked their phones for work more than 20 times per day.Ninety percent said they believed that their use of mobile technology was critical to getting their work done.Advancements in tech are inspiring businesses to use tech to improve productivity, engage their employees more and streamline processes to save time and labor. Here s how mobile technology can be used to augment your human resources function, as well:1. Put opportunity in everyone s pocket.Make it easy for job-seekers to find opportunities within your company. Some employers are failing the mobile generation by sticking with clunky, awkward interfaces, which turn off many candidates.A September 2014 Jibe report found that 20 percent of the 1,000 job seekers surveyed said they would give up on an online job application if they couldn t complete it on a mobile device. Yet, in spite of 70 percent of job-seekers looking to apply for a job via smartphone, only about a quarter of large companies surveyed said they had optimized their hiring process for mobile devices.Don't let this be you: Instead, invest in a mobile-friendly application experience to attract good talent. Mobile technology should be a main focus for a social recruiting strategy as well. When investing in expanding outreach through social media, keep the candidate experience in mind.Optimize for mobile devices, and use social media to connect with people. A 2015 LinkedIn report found that 47 percent of the 3,894 HR professionals surveyed called social media an effective employer branding tool.Don t make people who are interested in your company dig deep to find important information. Use a social-recruiting strategy that targets relevant audiences, with social media posts about the company, the culture and any opportunities available.2. Hire with confidence.When focusing on social recruiting, you'll also find it useful to create an employee-referral program. Since social recruiting and employee referrals are among the most successful sources of hire, use these channels with confidence.The influx of millennials into the workforce makes it imperative that employers use mobile technology to appeal to them. Create an employee-referral program that allows each participant to access the web-based portal anywhere with any device that connects to the Internet. This will encourage staff to participate in the referral program.  Additionally, implementing an internal interface for HR professionals will help simplify collaboration. This should be a space for quick, web-based document-sharing, where everyone can weigh in on important candidate information to make decisions faster.Ultimately, allowing employees and HR professionals to access information on demand will simplify the process of submitting and tracking referrals, screening candidates and making hiring decisions.Related: 5 Technology Roadblocks Costing You Great Talent3. Onboard new hires.Welcome candidates with a digital experience. Paperless processes reduce waste and automate document-management, offering convenience to HR staff and the new hire alike.Deliver onboarding information and documents directly to the new hire s hands with an internal employee portal where he or she can find all company resources regarding processes, policies and the like. No more bulky employee handbooks! Branded portals will engage the new employee with the message and essence of the company in an instant.A talent-management platform will enable your human resources managers to pull reports and share them with their teams, enabling management to measure the quality of onboarding, review performance metrics and identify the overall quality of hire for the talent acquisition program.4. Provide real-time recognition.Mobile technology allows for instant communication. That means employers can target employees who are exceeding expectations, and issue a reward immediately. Even if the reward is a simple recognition, like a personal thank-you message, the gesture will motivate all team members and make them feel valued.Provide real-time feedback with performance-tracking so employees know how they stack up against expectations.

/article/273975,Should You Allow Employees to Record Meetings?,"It may sound like a good idea to keep a digital record of your meetings, but it can lead to a host of problems.","Free Webinar | August 16thFind out how to optimize your website to give your customers experiences that will have the biggest ROI for your business.							Register Now  Businesses today are filled with smartphones. Employees use those smartphones to check email, make work-related calls, and research information they need to do their jobs. They may also snap photos and record video or audio, sometimes even without anyone even realizing it.If you run a business, personal smartphone recordings could put you in a sticky situation. You want to encourage employees to freely use their devices, but you also have a responsibility to protect the privacy of your employees and customers. Here are a few things you should consider before making a decision about video and audio recordings in the office, particularly during meetings.Related: Why Successful People Never Bring Smartphones Into MeetingsBenefits of recordings.Audio recordings actually do have a valuable use in workplaces, especially during meetings where a great deal of important information will be shared in a short space of time. Today s tools let employees record information and save it or convert it to text for later reference. However, if for some reason a business has a legal issue, a recording could hurt a business s case. Even if you fully believe nothing illegal could happen in your workplace, it is possible that it could become an issue at some point.One way to provide the benefits of an audio recording without the risk is to record proceedings yourself. You can use a transcription service or voice-to-text translation tool to provide a text-based version of everything that was discussed. This type of document is more effective than minutes, since it will describe everything that was discussed, rather than simply summarizing.Related: 3 Mobile Apps for Converting Voice to TextLegalities of recording meetings.When it comes to recording in-person conversations, the law may give a business leader a great reason to set a policy. In most states, it is against the law to record an in-person conversation without getting the consent of at least one person. In eleven states, the person recording must get the permission of everyone involved. In the case of a group meeting, this means that everyone in the room who might be recorded must give permission before the recording can proceed. You should check with laws as they apply to your state and make a decision specific to each situation.However, if the employee does request permission to record a meeting, an employer could be tasked with making a decision in front of a roomful of people. If there is a reason for the employee to record, such as a pending legal case, the request could bring attention to the issue, making things awkward for the employer. At any time, any person has the right to say  no  to the request to be recorded without explanation, but that doesn t mean an employer should do so. It s likely best to set an anti-surveillance policy first so you ll be able to refer back to that policy as a reason.Related: The 'George Costanza Defense' to Stealing Trade SecretsSetting policies.An anti-surveillance policy can actually be a positive to the many employees who are increasingly concerned about the level of surveillance that appears to be a part of so many workplaces. State clearly that you value the privacy of your workers and want to ensure their safety. Your employees will see this as a protection of their rights. With a policy in place, chances are employees won t ask unless there are special circumstances that require it.In some instances, however, the issue may be one of personal protection. An employee who has been accused of violating your workplace harassment policy may want to record a disciplinary meeting with HR. While consent to this is up to the individual organization, it could appear that you have something to hide by refusing. If you do consent to allow a recording in these instances, experts recommend making your own recording of the meeting for your own protection. Also before consenting, you should note the laws specific to your state. If you re in one of the eleven states where consent of all parties present is required, make sure each person states consent on the recording before the meeting begins.Smartphones make it easy to record meetings and conversations for a variety of purposes. In the workplace, however, those recordings can lead to an invasion of privacy. There are instances where employees may feel they need to record a meeting and experts advise making a decision on those as they arise. By having a policy in place and taking measures to record meetings on your own when necessary, you ll be able to deal with most instances where employees would ask to record.Dan SteinerDan Steiner is an entrepreneur, Internet-marketing expert and author from San Luis Obispo, Calif.

/article/272478,Wearable Technology: A Powerful HR Tool,"From promoting a healthy lifestyle to enhancing workplace safety, there's a lot of potential for companies to see.","Wearable technology -- devices like smartwatches and fitness trackers -- is hugely popular these days. People from every demographic are mapping their fitness accomplishments and keeping tabs on sleep patterns, heart rates and weight loss goals. In fact, according to eMarketer, nearly 40 million U.S. adults over 18 used wearable technology in 2015 -- a jump of 57.7 percent over 2014. The usage of wearables is projected to hit 81.7 million adults by 2018.Some businesses are exploring opportunities to turn the wearable device trend into a powerful HR tool. From promoting a healthy lifestyle to enhancing workplace safety, there s a lot of potential for companies if they have a clear implementation strategy and a focus on personal privacy.Encourage employee wellness initiatives.Studies show that healthy employees cost less: They have lower healthcare costs, fewer lost work days and they re more likely to stick around if their employer has an excellent wellness program.Related: Wearable Tech Will Soon Be Work Attire in These 4 IndustriesAccording to a study published by ABI Research, 13 million wearable devices will be integrated into corporate wellness plans over the next five years. Wearables are perceived to offer encouragement to work toward better health, without appearing to be a requirement, and apparently, 44 percent of U.S. workers are already wearing them to work.A survey by Salesforce found that many companies are exploring other uses for wearable tech, such as workplace security (23 percent), employee time management (20 percent), and real-time employee communication (20 percent). And, as the market for wearables continues to evolve, business applications for wearables will grow also.Improve safety and on-the-job communication.Incorporating wearables can help ensure employee safety in hazardous work environments. For example, truck drivers can wear a  Smart Cap,  literally a hat with sensors in it, that helps keep tabs on their levels of alertness, reducing the risk of accidents due to fatigue or falling asleep behind the wheel.Enhance operational efficiency.Large distributors, such as Amazon, use wearable tech to give warehouse employees an extra set of eyes. Once outfitted with GPS tags and handheld scanners, warehouse  pickers  find the most efficient paths to take, when gathering order items, reducing time spent traveling up and down aisles. Use of the wearable tech speeds up order fulfillment increases daily shipments.Related: Wearable Tech Is Improving Employee Productivity and HappinessHave a clear strategy to secure employee buy-in.There is a barrier to adoption for any new wearable program: It can seem creepy. It s one thing to know how many stairs you climb in a day, but another to know your boss can monitor your heart rate, water intake, or activity levels on a sick day. Making use optional instead of mandatory and being transparent about how data will be collected and used, can help put employees at ease.While in some situations -- like workplace safety -- individual monitoring has a clear purpose, employees can have mixed feelings about personal privacy. Use it at a granular level, like employee discipline and you risk building mistrust and resentment; anonymize it too much and you could lose a lot of the data s value.Ensure security, back-end support for wearables.Privacy and security are serious concerns for any business; when you add personal information to the mix, any breach can severely reduce employee trust and morale and open the company to liability for identity theft and other potential legal entanglements. While wearable devices generally fall outside the scope of the FDA and HIPAA, the data collection activities associated with wearable devices could be governed by state privacy and security laws,  advised Health Law Gurus. They noted that some wearables send personal information without encryption, and in some cases, collected data is sold to third parties.Related: 4 Ways Wearable Tech Can Make Managers More EffectiveBefore handing out the wearable devices, think through the potential issues you may face and policies you ll need to support the initiative. Help employees understand any security risks and ensure you re familiar with the provider s terms of service, as some limit an employer s use of data. Wearables need to be supported by sound data collection software and reliable analytics, with a simple way to keep data in sync. Doing this well may take multiple tools, and may require dedicated maintenance of the organization s back-end system.Human Resources is dedicated to providing organization and structure to their company s day to day operations, and wearable technology offers a wealth of opportunities for employee engagement, including benefit incentives, increased productivity, and enhanced safety. However, you need to consider, very carefully, how you ll approach and implement wearable tech in your business.Meghan M. BiroMeghan M.

/article/273482,Overcoming Unconscious Bias Is Key to Building an Inclusive Team,HR pros recognize an unconscious bias as a driving factor underlying homogenous workforces.,"The concept that diversity in the workforce is good for business is nothing new, but it is becoming increasingly supported by very compelling data. Just last year McKinsey and Company released research showing that companies that are gender-diverse are 15 percent more likely to outperform financial expectations. Meanwhile, ethnically diverse companies can enjoy a 35 percent likelihood to outperform expectations.Perception is not reality however. An MIT economist published a study that found an interesting dissonance between actual and perceived diversity when it comes to two important metrics: employee satisfaction and financial performance. Offices that presented the perception of a diverse work environment yielded an increase in satisfaction among employees, however, perceived diversity did not lead to improved revenues. Conversely, the actual presence of diversity reduced satisfaction, but drove financial results higher. Why is this the case? The answer may be in our subconscious; our most primal instincts that steer us to avoid risk and stay in our comfort zone.Related: Why Diversity In the Workforce Is ImperativeMore researchers and HR pros are giving credence to the concept of unconscious biases playing a significant role in workplace diversity. Unconscious bias (also referred to as implicit bias) affects how we feel about everything from gender, race, age, weight and religion -- all of which are driving factors underlying homogenous workforces -- even in companies that claim to foster diversity. While unconscious bias is not an entirely new notion, it is just starting to gain momentum in corporate efforts to advance workplace diversity. Many organizations are even developing specific departments or programs to combat the impact of unconscious biases -- often referred to as diversity and inclusion. This is a telling shift as it indicates the business world is finally admitting to an issue that has silently segmented workplaces for ages.The unconscious bias.Our brains are bombarded with about 11 million bits of information every second, yet we are only equipped to consciously process about 40 bits. So where does all of the unconsciously processed information go? This information becomes deeply engrained in the thoughts, feelings and beliefs we carry with us. These subconsciously absorbed slices of information are stored, and convert into deep-seated biases that inform every snap judgment we make, whether good or bad, and whether we like it or not. Unconscious biases manifest as survival mechanisms, helping us to better sift through the constant barrage of information, to make decisions based on instinct rather than logic. One common manifestation of this information is micro-aggression; subtle slices of aggressive behavior (body language, phrasing, etc.) which are subconsciously displayed and absorbed by the people around us. Individuals may not intend to release any sort of aggressive negativity -- but it happens and it impacts everyone in the vicinity.Related: 4 Ways Diverse Teams Can Boost an Employer's BrandA clear example of unconscious bias in the workplace is discussed in a Yale University study, which found that researchers will inherently rate men higher than women in terms of competence and hireability -- even in instances where they have identical qualifications. Adding an additional wrinkle to this: Both men and women will rate men higher, showing that gender doesn t determine or influence unconscious bias. This further illuminates the fact that previous efforts to stem off gender bias have not worked.Instead of focusing on awareness alone, it s important to shift efforts toward exposing prevalent bias within the workplace, and developing mitigation strategies to address them. We must recognize that we can t manage for bias in the moment we re making a decision, and instead design talent management practices and processes that negate the impact of potential biases. In a program I helped design and institute at HARMAN, we incorporate feedback from many stakeholders across the company, such as HARMAN Women s Network Site Leaders (an employee business resource group), and our summer interns (mostly Millennials). Doing so has allowed us to gain specific insights on the perception of unconscious biases and gather more ideas to build a functional program for a more inclusive workplace.A more inclusive workplace.So how are early adopters of unconscious bias mitigation programs getting started? The first step is getting buy-in from the organization s senior leaders. While this seems simple on paper, it requires leaders to have a high degree of self-awareness, allowing them to acknowledge the implicit bias they may be inadvertently allowing to take place, or even perpetuating -- which is not always easy.Related: The Myriad Benefits of Diversity in the WorkplaceTo raise awareness, HR professionals must develop the means to educate their executives, managers and the broader workforce. Our program at HARMAN teaches managers about the existence of unconscious biases and equips them with strategies for spotting troublesome situations, and tools to handle them accordingly. When managers lead by example, they create a standard to which all employees will instinctively adhere.On the heels of International Women s Day last March, HARMAN s Global Talent Management & Diversity (GTM) team developed a pilot workshop for its employees located at the company headquarters in Stamford, Conn. Throughout 2016 the GTM team will conduct a global road show to empower leaders in all regions with critical knowledge and skills needed to manage and serve more diverse teams and ensure that these concepts go beyond our internal goals, and allow us to build better relationships with clients and customers.Designing the infrastructure for these programs was, and continues to be an arduous task. To simplify this we also adopt strategies that have worked for other companies, or emulate programs that are endorsed by researchers or consultants well versed in the subject. It takes science to truly shift the way people think and behave. It s essential to create a measurement system to track successes and provide a deeper understanding of what works and what doesn t to further refine the process over time.ConclusionIs another training course the only answer to eliminating unconscious biases in the workplace? The short answer is,  no.  However, giving employees the tools to recognize and understand how our brains make swift and possibly unfair judgments is integral to ensuring that the workplaces of the future are attracting, developing and leveraging the diverse candidates they want and need to succeed. To initiate positive change will strengthen the leadership skills of all employees, yield unprecedented benefits to their personal development, and, ultimately, improve a company s bottom line.Christi DownesChristi Downes serves as vice president for Global Talent Management & Diversity, HARMAN, where she is responsible for designing and implementing world-class talent strategies across the entire life cycle of talent management, with a fo...Read more",Inclusion,2016-05-13 19:00:00
/article/273132,You Don't Have to Be a Rocket Scientist to Hire the Right Data Scientist,"They're the hottest new employees in business, but finding the right one is an art.","We ve all heard it by now: Data scientists have the century s sexiest job and they re here to save your business with their big data expertise. Everyone wants to hire one. But what are the chances you ll stumble across an actual data scientist unicorn who just happens to be a perfect fit for your business? Well, practically nonexistent.The thing about data science is that it draws from dozens of fields, including machine learning, data mining, analytics and artificial intelligence. Most data scientists hold graduate degrees in computer science, but many of them come from backgrounds ranging from electrical engineering to biology. In other words: No one data scientist possesses the breadth of skills needed for every data science position. Believe it or not: there are no unicorns.Related: Want big data to help your marketing team? Hire a data scientist.And, of course, competition for data scientists is fierce. You may know that McKinsey & Company has predicted that the U.S. faces a shortage of between 140,000 and 190,000 analytics experts by 2018. Meanwhile, the number of open jobs is on the upswing -- interest in data analytics talent increased by 15 percent from 2013 to 2014 alone, according to Indeed.So how can you hope to make a hire that fulfills your requirements from such a small pool of qualified talent? It starts with actually knowing what those requirements are.It seems simplistic, but data scientists rarely have equally strong backgrounds in areas like statistics, time-series analysis and database know-how. The secret is finding a candidate with the right mix of skills that match your business goals. For instance, if you run a retail business, a time-series analysis is a great way to understand patterns in product sales over time. On the technology side, you want candidates who have experience using the tools that are central to data science, such as Python, Spark, or R.Related: What hiring managers don't understand about hiring for data science.As with any job, it s pretty easy for a candidate to list the right bullet points on their resume. Luckily, in data science, it s also pretty easy to find out if a candidate isn t as savvy in certain techniques as he or she claims to be. An initial phone interview with a hiring manager who has a technical background should serve as a quick check. Beyond that, there are several ways to test the depth of a candidate s knowledge.First, a real data scientist is most likely going to have a collection of data-related passion projects or academic work that will tell you way more about his or her skills than any take-home problem you might assign during the interview process. Ask for a link to a project on the candidate s GitHub profile or a copy of a published paper. But don t stop there -- during the interview, ask hypothetical questions based on scenarios a data scientist might actually encounter at your business. How your candidate approaches the problems will tell you a lot about his or her critical thinking process and what tools he or she is most comfortable with. You might even want to hand over some sample data and ask for a quick analysis.Related: Four things a data scientist can do for entrepreneurs.But now, a word of warning: don t get completely bogged down in testing for technical skill. Data scientists have unique roles because they straddle the line between analytics and business strategy. If they lack communication skills or curiosity, they won t make the effort required to uncover business-changing insights and communicate them in a clear, concise way to your decision makers. And if that s the case, you re paying out a six-figure salary -- averaging around $120,000 for non-managers -- for little to no return on your investment.There are some ways you can ensure this kind of scenario doesn t play out. Ask candidates to explain technical concepts such as the difference between logistic and linear regression, to a hiring manager with a non-technical background to see if they take their audience into account. Employ behavioral interviewing techniques, where you ask questions about a candidate s past performance in particular situations. Involve multiple parties across all departments to ensure that your candidate is a good fit for your culture.What sets hiring a data scientist apart from any other employee is that so much rests on a data scientist s shoulders: The promise of profit has 75 percent of companies planning to invest in big data by 2017, and the range of industries now employing data scientists is staggering. Unless you want to be left behind, now is the time to make a data scientist hire. Just make sure it s the right one.Ian SwansonIan Swanson is the co-founder and CEO of DataScience, a company that combines human intellect and machine learning to tackle business problems.Read more",Inspiring Your Team,2016-05-12 17:00:00
/article/275284,Good Stuff Happens When You Have an HR Department of 1,Even a single human resources professional can bridge any communication rift arising between employers and employees.,"Many startups begin without a human resources department. The company is small, and hiring someone to manage just a few employees isn t the priority. But, as the company grows, things start to get complicated: The business needs HR.Related: How This Company Is Helping Businesses Find Zen in Human Resource PaperworkAnd, oftentimes, that starts with ""an HR department of one.""That s right. Growing businesses don t need an enormous HR team; even just one person can get the job done. Eventually, when the organization gets big enough, a larger HR department will be a necessity. But until a full team becomes necessary, a one-person HR department can be an amazing force.Here are three issues that even an HR department of one can help you solve:1. Lagging communicationThe smaller a team is, the closer its members are. Every employee is key and contributes his or her ideas and opinions. The small staff works alongside the CEO and founders to drive the business forward.Yet, as companies grow, the gap between the executive team and employees widens. Employees don t have the immediate access to the C-suite that they've grown used to -- but you never want their voices to get lost.In fact, a 2015 Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM) survey of 600 U.S. employees found that only 37 percent were ""very satisfied"" with the consideration managers gave their ideas, and just 23 percent were very satisfied with their communication with senior management.What s more, a survey of more than 800 full-time U.S. employees conducted by Globoforce in November of last year found that 47 percent of respondents didn't think their company leaders cared about or actively tried to create a ""human"" workplace.Related: 17 Great HR Resources for EntrepreneursThat s where the HR professional comes in. Even a single HR professional can bridge any communication rift arising between employers and employees. This one-person HR department serves as a representative for your people. Employees share their thoughts, concerns and ideas; and HR shares them with management.In addition, an HR person brings the employee perspective to business decisions. While the executive team focuses on scaling the business, an HR department of one is there to make sure it s sustainable -- built with the interest of employees in mind.2. Complicated complianceWith more employees, communication isn t the only thing that gets more complicated; compliance becomes a whole new animal.As new employees arrive, employers need to follow more regulations. For example, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) rules for 2016 require companies with 50 to 99 full-time equivalent employees to provide health insurance to at least 95 percent of their full-time staff or face a fine.It s new regulations like the ACA's that raise questions and concerns for smaller businesses starting to feel the impact of the new legal landscape. And the ACA is only a small piece of the compliance puzzle. New overtime rules -- which can particularly impact small businesses that rely on part-time, contract and flexible talent -- plus other changing laws make compliance tricky.Employers need an HR expert who can better understand and manage laws and apply them to a larger set of employees. The one-person HR department keeps the company on track so the employer never has to worry about compliance.3. Recruitment and onboardingAs businesses grow, they need more talent to keep the momentum going. And that requires recruitment and onboarding. Small businesses may already have their own hiring and training processes, but now they need to adapt, to hire and train more and more employees at the same time with the same amount of efficiency.This is where many startups stall. They can t hire the talent they need, when they need it. Research from Bersin by Deloitte found that companies surveyed spent close to $4,000 per hire in 2014. And that didn't cover the costs of lost time and productivity while any position sat open -- an average of 26 working days, according to the most recent data from the DHI-DFH Mean Vacancy Duration Measure published in April.Once companies do hire new employees, a lack of training can set them up to be unsuccessful. According to a survey of more than 400 employees by Learnkit in 2015, 40 percent of respondents said they would be more engaged at work if they had better onboarding. In addition, 61 percent of disengaged employees said they could do their jobs better with better training.How can employers fix recruitment and onboarding issues? With an HR department of one.The HR professional can help establish referral programs, reach out to industry contacts and use more effective sources of hire to recruit top talent faster. Then, they can set up formal onboarding processes, assign workplace mentors and more to engage new talent and keep those people around.The right toolsAll these responsibilities may seem like a lot for an HR team of one to handle, but it s possible, with the right tools and resources. A single HR professional can get the job done for a growing business by automating tedious tasks.Related: 6 Ways HR Leaders Can Help Humanize the OrganizationTech can take care of time-consuming administrative tasks like running payroll and enrolling employees in the right benefits.

/article/271378,Is Your Star Performer Ready for Management?,"If your star is missing one of the four skills described here, hit the 'pause' button before making the promotion decision.","More often than not, I have seen small business owners promote one of their young stars from a job as an individual contributor to a managerial position -- with less than stellar results. You may have had a similar experience and learned from your mistake. Or you may currently be considering promoting one of your own star performers. Related: 5 Signs Your Employee Is in Dire Need of a PromotionBut before you promote that individual to the first rung of management, engage in a ""best practices"" move: Pause and assess the individual. Determine what skills he or she may be missing or needs to strengthen. Otherwise, this person may assume a position that will ultimately create stress and become part of the statistical 50 percent failure rate in promotion estimated by the Center for Creative Leadership.From my experience, there are four skills that first-time manager/leaders are often lacking because they haven t received the training or experience:Delegation Creating goals for others Developing employeesLeadership communicationsThe number one missing skill here is delegation. As a single contributor, an employee gets work done by doing it on his or her own. Yet a manager gets work done through others, which requires an understanding of what needs to be delegated, whom to delegate specific tasks to and how to effectively delegate and monitor progress.So, how do you as the company leader know if your star performer has the capacity to delegate? The solution is to have employees you're considering for promotion put together a list of tasks they are currently doing that they believe should be delegated, and to whom they should be delegated. If they struggle with this exercise, it is time to pause and coach them or get them some training.Setting goals and objectives for employees, monitoring progress and communicating with clarity is another important skill that may be missing. Make sure the employee understands how to create smart goals and deliver them with clarity and purpose.In other words, make sure these goals are not only understood but also linked back to specific corporate goals. This linkage will reinforce the importance of the goal as well as the importance the employee has to the organization.Related: Should You Always Promote From Within Your Company?Finally, managers need to have a process for monitoring progress. Unfortunately, there isn't a good pre-exercise for this one; rather, it's going to require mentoring from you or someone else on your team. Developing employees may be a missing skill, but one that is a critical competency for leaders. Developing employees is also something that the majority of managers are ill prepared to do when they step into a management position for the first time. However, understanding when to mentor, versus when to coach, and identifying skills gaps and behaviors that need to be adjusted are important in order to create a development plan, and then monitor the plan. There are some great books to help build coaching skills, such as Catalytic Coaching by Garold L. Markle and The Coaching Manager by James M. Hunt and Joseph R. Weintraub.A related suggestion: Have a potential manager read these books and discuss with you what he or she plans on doing to coach future employees. Do this before this person is officially promoted. It may also be beneficial for you provide this individual his or her own coach, to offer firsthand experience of what coaching is.Communications becomes something different once an employee becomes a manager. All of a sudden, ""communications"" become focused on others. Specifically, a manager who wants to become a true leader needs to be able to communicate as a leader to inspire and develop others to be the best they can be.Managing further requires listening to opposing views and to varying opinions to gain an understanding, and bringing employees together as a cohesive team. It requires asking difficult and powerful questions when dealing with conflict and performance issues. So, before you promote, ask yourself these questions: Does this person listen to others and their ideas? Does he or she ask probing questions to understand other points of view? Do others want to listen to this person?When this employee communicates, does he or she make adjustments to the communication style preferences of the receiver? If the answer to these questions is yes, he or she has demonstrated the potential to communicate as a leader. If not, pause, coach and train.Because all of four of these managerial skills require knowledge of techniques and tools, and the ability to effectively put them into practice, you may be able to determine your employee's level of understanding but not his or her level of mastery.Related: Measure These 5 Talent Metrics for Greater Success in Hiring and Managing EmployeesSo before making that promotion, hit the pause button and determine this individual's level of knowledge in each of these four competencies. Then identify how to fill those knowledge gaps and create a development plan.

/article/274787,Leave Policies Are Leaving Out Some Key Opportunities,The only expectation most companies have from employee leave policies is that the worker returns. That's short-sighted.,"It's not the leave you take, but what you take when you leave that matters most.More and more, companies are offering sweetened leave policies. Put aside parental leave, which has its own set of rules and has evolved already from corporate perk to de rigeur offering. Also, let's not think of programs like a ""paw-ternity"" leave, where you get time off for getting a new pet.Think instead of the recent trend of companies encouraging employees to do someting to recharge their batteries. Most executives encourage the occassional mental-health day, but more corporations are offering a full-blown sabbatical. Genentech, for instance, gives you a six-week sabbatical after six years of service, while Adobe gives you a month after 10 years.The idea behind a sabbatical or paid leave of absence is that, once loosed of the shackles of worklife, you will return a happier, more creative and more productive worker when you return to your cubicle.But is that true? There has been very little academic research about productivity effectiveness in relation to sabbaticals in the corporate world. Academia, which made sabbaticals mainstream, has pumped out a ton of research on why they're the best thing ever, but one wonders about confirmation bias. Professors who get to take a year off every few years think taking a year off every few years is a wonderful idea.Instead, most of the positive benefits for companies are more anecdotal. That's not surprising, because improving the productivity and creative juices of the affected employees isn't the only endpoint. Just offering a program like this is seen as the kind of employee benefit every company needs nowadays to attract and retain the best talent. There's little downside for a startup to offer it, particularly since most won't survive long enough to make good on the promise. But small business and large corporations are competing in the same talent pool, and flexibility in the way you allow people to work is a key benefit.If I had to take this as a bet to Gulfstream Park, I'd wager that most companies will be increasing sabbatical programs in the coming year, or at least get more generous with smaller-scale leaves. (Millennials and Gen-Xers alike expect them, apparently.) But, my hope is that there's more thoughtfulness about these leaves so that companies can get a more measurable benefit from letting employees wander off from time to time.Related: How You Can Recharge Your Entrepreneurial Batteries With a Working SabbaticalTo that end, there should be two ""takes"" for every leave:Employees have to take an action plan with their leave.Constraints are great for creativity, but one of the big question marks with most sabbaticals and leaves is the open-ended nature of them. Like a boomerang, many companies send folks on their way, with the only expectation being they return at the end of the trip. Why not set a higher bar by setting expectations for what you expect from the employee when she returns?It doesn't have to be homework. In fact, it shouldn't be. But companies should take advantage of the temporary separation by having the creative juices the break is supposed to elicit start paying off right away. For instance, if a company has a pain point, why not task an employee to spend some time thinking through the solution? A month with new scenery, fewer work-related distractions and a decreased stress level could spark the kind of innovation to get around a particularly problem faster and more effectively than a bunch of folks brainstorming in a conference room.Related: How to Turn an Underperformer Into an Ideal EmployeeEmployers have to take an opportunity to test the rest of the team.When Intel launched its own sabbatical program, believed to be the first of its kind in corporate America, back in 1981, it did so not just for employee rejuvenation, but also for employee evaluation. Because other people will have to take up the work of the employee on leave, it's a great opportunity to see how other employees respond.That evaluation can happen in two ways. First, you can check attitude. Are people resentful that a colleague is off for that long, even if he was entitled to the time? Are people complaining about additional workload that's not normally in their scope? Those are pretty good red flags for employee assessment.But you can also expose team members to new challenges and see how they respond. If someone in sales takes a month off, it might be worth taking a promising person from the back office, who never had a client-facing position, and seeing how she responds.Related: How to Vacation Like a BossOr, you can use it in your internal succession planning. Rarely do you get an opportunity to see how deep your bench really is, but the sabbatical of an executive gives a great laboratory to see how certain people respond when they rise up the ladder.One way or another, there has to be an intention inherent in the employee taking the time off and an intention in the employer allowing it to happen, beyond anecdotal evidence that the leave period will somehow help the company.

/article/274542,Check Out What Happens When You Consider 'the Candidate Experience',Does your hiring process take empathy into account? It should.,"A human resource professional s best tool is his or her ability to experience empathy. Empathy creates an opportunity to step into the shoes of others to see a company from their perspective. It also paves the road for viewing the employee and candidate experience in a proactive way, to inform best practices.Related: 7 Interview Questions That Determine Emotional IntelligenceIn fact, there may actually be danger to an organization whose human resources department doesn t use the empathetic approach. Disregarding the candidate experience negatively impacts one of the most important aspects for any company: hiring.Hiring, of course, starts with the application -- which, for a hopeful candidate, is the employer s open door. The application can be engaging and simple, attracting strong talent, or it can suffer from various issues, repelling any and all types of professionals. A September 2014 study from Jibe found that a poor application experience deterred 25 percent of the 1,000 job seekers surveyed. Right off the bat, one in four people had lost interest and gone off to search elsewhere.While this study might be dismissed as inconsequential, the scenario it describes is, unfortunately, common -- yet not given the weight it deserves: A 2015 study by Careerbuilder, for instance, found that 82 percent of the 2,002 hiring managers surveyed said there was little-to-no negative impact on a company when a candidate had a bad experience during the hiring process.And that is just the kind of opinion that severely underestimates the message communicated during a negative candidate experience.For example, if a company's application process is riddled with technological issues and poorly designed, what's being demonstrated is a lack of interest in making the hiring process convenient and simple for the job seeker. If the application takes a lot of time and requires tedious, repetitive input, the message to the applicant is that the company runs inefficient processes.Here are a few ways companies can use the candidate experience to make a great application process:1. Ensure that career resources work.The September 2014 study from Jibe found that 37 percent of the 300 recruitment professionals surveyed were concerned that their company s application process was deterring quality hires. That hunch was legitimate: Almost 23 percent of job seekers surveyed agreed with the statement that if they had issues filling out an online application, they d never apply to that company again.Specifically, job seekers were most likely deterred from completing online applications if they encountered technological issues (60 percent), failed in their efforts to upload their resumes (55 percent) or couldn t track their application s status (44 percent).Empathy with ""the candidate experience"" can help organizations prevent such issues. Run through your company career site to get an idea of the experience the candidate goes through and ensure all links are live and operational. Question if the application is engaging enough to maintain interest and clearly communicate what's needed for a correct submission. Consider administering surveys for feedback on how to improve.2. Make applications mobile friendly.Mobile devices have dramatically changed how job seekers execute their hunt. A November 2015 study from Pew Research found that 94 percent of the 2,001 job seekers surveyed said they had previously looked for and researched jobs online using their mobile device.Nearly half of smartphone job-seekers surveyed, however, had had problems accessing job-related content because it wasn t displaying properly on their phone; or else they said they had difficulty reading the text in a job posting due to poor mobile design.And more than 33 percent said they had struggled to enter a large amount of text or had had difficulty submitting files or other supporting documents needed to complete their applications.Related: 6 Ways to Become a More Empathetic EntrepreneurInvest in making the application process mobile friendly to enable candidates to complete a full application for a position on their device. Here, there are several things to consider when designing the mobile side of the candidate experience.One tip is to keep things simple yet effective. If the application is complex, people will lose interest. That's why, to effectively vet talent, the company should know exactly what information is needed. Test how the application functions on personal devices, and run additional technology tests to identify what works. Find out where the bugs are.3. Communicate expectations.Candidates hate long wait times and being left in the dark about the process. The 2015 study from CareerBuilder found that 84 percent of applicants surveyed had expected a personal email response, and 52 percent had anticipated a phone call after submitting an application. Some 25 percent expected to hear back even if they were not being brought in for an interview.It s important, then, to keep communication lines open because that courtesy illustrates a respect for the candidate and his or her time, and expresses gratitude. These responses can be automated and should convey pertinent information about when the candidate might expect to hear back, plus details about the next stage in the hiring process.Related: This Is How Quality of Hire Should Inform Your Recruiting ProcessEven if applicants are disqualified, provide feedback about why. Providing a response shows respect and provides candidates with information about their qualifications. The advantage of this is two-fold: It deters talent who lack needed experience or skill sets from applying to subsequent jobs, and it engages with good talent who may be strong fits for the future.Andre LavoieAndre Lavoie is the CEO of ClearCompany, the talent-management solution that helps companies identify, hire and retain more A players.

/article/274422,"If You Need Better Leaders, Who You Gonna Call? HR.",Human resources has the advantage of occupying the high perch that 'sees it all.',"Good leaders are hard to come by. Almost half of the companies that participated in the Workplace Trends  Global Workforce Leadership Survey in February and March 2015 chose leadership as the hardest skill to find in employees. What s more, among the 1,000 employee participants, only 36 percent called leadership a strength in their organizations.Related: Where Have All the Good Employees Gone? Oops, You Promoted Them.One of the problems here is that when they analyze their leadership-development issues, most organizations put the responsibility on employees to improve, or on current leaders to train their teams. Employers expect their employees to attend leadership training events, take a development course or find a mentor to advance their skills and careers.Alternately, the pressure is on managers to identify leaders in their teams and train them to follow in their footsteps -- in addition to their regular responsibilities.But in this way, employers miss a big piece of the puzzle: human resources. HR needs to get involved in leadership development; otherwise organizations will be stuck in the same pattern. Here s how HR can help boost leadership development:1. Define leadership.What does great leadership look like? And what traits are the most important for a leader to have?The answers of course vary from person to person and company to company. For some, a great leader may be someone who focuses on communication and transparency, while others may see a ""leader"" as someone who helps pick up the slack when the team is in need.Everyone has an individual dea of what great leadership means, and each company needs something different depending on its culture and goals.That s where HR comes in. It s HR s job to get everyone onto the same page and define what leadership means within that particular company. HR has the power to define what the individual organizational brand of leadership is.2. Identify potential.Once the organization has a clear idea of what leadership looks like, HR can help identify which employees possess the right qualities for the job.After all, a study conducted by Gallup found that just 18 percent of current managers had the talent required for the role. But HR is uniquely positioned to pick out employees with the leadership skills employers need. HR professionals have a larger view of talent, performance and skills. Where managers and coworkers likely have a limited view of employees, HR gets the whole picture.From its vantage point, HR can review and compare feedback from managers, peers and clients. It can see skills and strengths, and identify those who exude the leadership qualities the organization needs. HR has a deep understanding of the skills needed and the best view of where those skills lie among employees across the organization.Related: Startup CEOs Reveal the 1 Question They Ask Every Job Candidate3. Develop skills.Having the right skills isn t enough to be a great leader -- professionals need training and development. And many employers fall short in this area. In fact, 39 percent of companies surveyed by Workplace Trends said they offered leadership development programs, but just 15 percent of their employees felt these programs effectively prepared them for their next role.It s not just new leaders who are missing out. Veterans feel that they aren t growing in their positions, either. Among those surveyed by Gallup, only 40 percent strongly agreed that they had had opportunities to learn and grow at work in the past year.So, the training and development programs already available may be ineffective because HR isn t involved -- and that needs to change. The reason is that HR can ""see it all"" -- the gaps in skills, the ways in which leadership development programs can be created to fit their organizations' definition of leadership and the preferences of those already in leadership positions for what's needed to foster growth.4. Offer support.Better training isn t the only way HR can contribute to leadership development. HR can build support for leaders into the processes and policies of the company. In other words, HR can set up recruitment and promotion processes, plus performance reviews to support and reinforce positive leadership.For example, HR can make sure the organization recruits for the leadership skills needed. These skills can be requirements for positions that involve leading others right now or developing talent for future leadership roles.In addition, HR can add leadership considerations into the promotion and performance-review process. That way, those who deserve a promotion but may not be suited for leadership can still get the recognition they deserve without being placed in a role they re not right for. And that benefits everyone.Performance reviews and management can not only screen for leadership qualities, but also reinforce what good leadership looks like in a organization.Related: 4 Ways to Make Leadership Development Part of Your Company CultureThat way, leaders will be recognized for their hard work as they continue to improve and develop.

Register Now  Why is it that human resources is the one department people love to hate? From the outside, the job looks simple. So, why can t HR professionals just process requests faster, be better organized and manage talent more efficiently? people ask.Related: How This Company Is Helping Businesses Find Zen in Human Resource PaperworkWell, those same people need to exercise a little more brain power here, because the notion that every HR department is old-fashioned, full of red tape and works in a bubble is a misguided stereotype.Nonetheless, because of the surplus of innovative HR tech available, some thought-leaders in the industry are questioning if we even need HR at all. Can't apps and platforms do what whole departments used to do? they ask. Can't they do it better?The reality is crystal clear: People are the most important asset to any business, and employers will always need experts to manage them. While tech can automate administrative work and take the productivity of many important HR tasks to the next level, HR professionals are -- and will continue to be -- a vital part of every business.In the age of automation, HR isn t going anywhere. Here s why:HR knows which new tech will benefit employees most.Tech will never fully replace the power of people. HR analytics are great, but people are the ones who make the important human decisions regarding employees.New HR tech can help give employees all the tools they need: self-service employee profiles, affordable employee benefits, a social news feed to keep everyone connected and more. But it's HR professionals who guide and grow a company culture, encourage career development and analyze the important ""people"" data coming out of the tech a company uses.Businesses don t need just anyone to drive the use of tech forward -- they need HR. In 2016, HR departments are more focused on innovation and adopting new technologies to improve employee experience, suggests Deloitte s 2016 Human Capital Report. And that s what's key -- they re focused on the employee experience.In a 2015 report sponsored by Visier and released by Harvard Business Review Analytic Services, 44 percent of the 323 CEOs surveyed said their workforce planning was driven by finance and didn't take talent availability into consideration.So, while those in the C-suite remain focused on speeding up processes, improving productivity, boosting profits and reducing costs, HR sets its sights on people. HR tech and processes bring a unique view to the table by analyzing which tools and resources will make work easier for employees. And employers need that point of view.Related: 17 Great HR Resources for EntrepreneursIn fact, a July 2015 CareerBuilder survey of 88 leaders at companies with revenue of at least $50 million found that 65 percent of CEOs thought that HR opinions at their organizations carried increasingly more weight with senior management.Employers need HR's unique input, then, to make sense of new tech and analytics and to make the best decisions for employees, the culture and the business as a whole.Employees need guidance, even with new tech.Tech can handle a lot of the time-consuming duties that used to occupy HR. It can automate payroll and benefits enrollment, provide paperless onboarding and maintain all employee data in one place for easy reporting. But these processes represent only half the picture.Specifically, there will always be a ""human"" side to human resources. Automation doesn t put HR professionals out of a job -- it helps them to do their jobs better, enabling them to spend even more time on the human and strategic aspects of their work.People are the resource best suited to provide opportunities for career development and standardize processes around promoting from within. People are the best resource for handling delicate workplace issues -- and then making a company culture the best it can be.Apps can help deliver benefits communications and information, but they can t answer individual questions or explain confusing plans step by step.Apps and tools can t really listen to employees. HR tech is a game-changer for communication. Social news feeds allow the whole company to communicate in real time. Mobile apps mean people can find and contact coworkers instantly. Surveys and reviews collect feedback whenever it's needed.But employees want a living, breathing human they can share their concerns with. And employers need someone to take that feedback and turn it into action. That person is an HR professional.No matter what technology is implemented to improve communications, HR is the sounding board and voice of employees -- a role in which even managers may even fall short. A 2015 SHRM survey of employees found that only 37 percent of respondents described themselves as ""very satisfied"" with the consideration their ideas received. And just 23 percent were ""very satisfied"" with communications with senior management.Related: A New Wave of HR Technology Is Disrupting the MarketEmails and social platforms may make communication easier, but HR makes that communication count.

Register Now  If you are an entrepreneur, the Information Technology industry is a wonderful place to make your living. No matter how large and well financed your competition may be, they all have the same Achilles heel: new ideas and the drive to make them a reality. The innovator s dilemma is alive and well in high tech.Moore s Laws govern the field of innovation.All new IT offerings I have experienced over my four decades in the business have followed Geoffrey Moore s technology adoption curve. The early adopters like to lead the pack in testing the usefulness of new things. Then, assuming these pioneers prove the worth of the new idea, the early majority jump on the bandwagon to ensure that they are benefiting from the innovation, and finally the rest come in when it is no longer deemed safe for one s career to stay with the dinosaurs. Eventually, even the real laggards have no choice but to move over - typically when their supplier will no longer support the old solutions. And, of course, the process repeats with every crank of the innovation cycle, which is getting shorter with every generation.There is no law that says that the current market leader cannot be the innovator. In fact most new tech inventions are discovered in the labs of the major players. However, their business model constrains their willingness to pursue the innovation with the single-mindedness of a start up.IT inventions typically also share Gordon Moore s law   they deliver two times the performance at a half of the cost of the generation of technology they replace.The impact of the second Moore s law is that new technology offerings must generate 2 to 4 times the volume of sales to maintain the revenue stream from the previous generation. This makes it very hard for established players to aggressively drive innovation into the market   it hurts their own income statement, at least in the early part of the cycle. It is a hardy business leader indeed who has the fortitude to cannibalize his/her own business in the hot pursuit of innovation.Related: Is This The Revival Of Artificial Technology?Entrepreneurial advantage and acceptance of risk.Here is where the opportunity for a start-up comes in. The new entrepreneur has no business that can be cannibalized. They have no public shareholders who demand a predictable profit performance curve quarter after quarter. They are backed by venture capital that is used to make large bets on uncertain outcomes. They have the advantage of knowing that the market wants a solution to a business problem if it can be produced at a quarter of the current cost. And with the exception of the microchip technology, the tech industry requires little capital equipment to deliver a new solution. One only needs a great idea, an innovative and imaginative engineer, a financial backer and the energy to call on countless prospects to make them share your vision.It usually takes the established players two or more years and several significant customer losses to recognize the threat of the innovation and begin to respond. Even then, given the lead-time needed to catch up, they often have no alternative but to acquire the innovator s business.Related: An Opportunity For Growth: Defining Failure In The Context Of EntrepreneurshipSeizing the right opportunity.My own company, Visier, is an interesting case in point. Visier is a cloud-based provider of workforce intelligence solutions, in essence providing insight for management about their workforce and optimization models for their future organization success.Historically, such insight was provided (if at all) by a locally developed set of queries and reports using spreadsheets or data warehouses and business intelligence (BI) tools. The market for spreadsheets and BI tools has developed over 20 years of hard work by a handful of large companies, such as Business Objects (now SAP), Cognos (now IBM), Hyperion (now Oracle) and Microsoft. The total product revenue in this market is about $15B annually, with perhaps another $40B in custom services that are necessary to make the BI technology work.The challenge with this approach is a very high cost (often $10M or more), very long lead-times (often more than 2 years), and a high risk of project failure due to technical complexity. In addition, BI tools require a significant degree of technical competence from the user, which most business people do not possess.We saw an opportunity to approach the problem differently, eliminating the services cost, complexity and the business risk. We developed a solution that delivers accurate business insights and plan alternatives to the hands of the business user, virtually instantly, with no dependency on any user technical skill. Cloud technology, coupled with in-memory and map-reduce processing, a deep knowledge of the application domain, the semantic linking of business terms and big data, and modern custom-designed graphics made the traditional BI tools based approach very vulnerable.In Visier s case, the combination of these new techniques actually produces a 20:1 cost advantage and significantly reduced time to success over BI, a virtually unassailable advantage.With this kind of economic efficiency, which established player will have the appetite to jump in with both feet?Time will tell.John SchwarzJohn Schwarz has over 40 years of business and IT experience, and was previously the CEO for Business Objects, now part of SAP.

/article/273635,Want a Better Employee Experience? Start By Simplifying Tech.,"The human urge to quickly respond to emails and messages is so pervasive, it has a name: telepressure.","Free Webinar | August 16thFind out how to optimize your website to give your customers experiences that will have the biggest ROI for your business.							Register Now  Technology is intended to make things easier -- especially in the workplace. Employers are implementing more and more platforms in the hopes of simplifying everyday tasks and communication.Related: Use Technology to Foster Collaboration in Your OfficeHowever, technology can inadvertently contribute to a negative employee experience, if you re not careful. When tech suffers from clunky integration, non-intuitive interfaces and weaknesses in the configuration department, employees get frustrated by the complexity and poor design of the very thing they rely on every day to succeed at their jobs. Plus, working with too many software platforms at work can contribute to information overload.Leaders recognize this but are not sure how to resolve the problem. In fact, a March 2014 study from Deloitte found that 65 percent of over 3,300 executives surveyed said they considered the  overwhelmed employee  an urgent, important trend, but 44 percent also said they were not ready to deal with it.Perhaps the solution lies with HR. After all, human resources plays a vital role in simplifying the workplace -- and today s HR professionals need to turn to ""design thinking"" if they hope to improve the employee experience.As outlined in Deloitte s Human Capital Trends 2016 report, the concept of design thinking is founded on each employee s personal experience. Utilizing digital HR and developing new digital tools with intuitive, simplified technology directly combats the overwhelmed employee by eliminating information overload and improving communication.If employees like the technology they work with, and it helps them do their jobs better, then platforms can contribute to a meaningful employee experience.The time to act is now -- be proactive, not reactive. Let s take a look at how employers can simplify their technology to make work easier for employees and reduce their burden:Related: 6 Recent Trends in Human Capital WorldUse one platformInvest in integrated technology that balances ease of use with necessary features. When employees need to access programs for work management, communication, benefits, calendars and reminders, they do not want to be lost in a maze of different resources.The advent of social media has informed how humans interact with technology in several ways. Let s face it: The ubiquity of Facebook means that employees know their way around user-friendly, simple software. Several companies offer software platforms with a similar feel and can give the same inviting experience to users, including comparable engagement features like news feeds and recognition.Choose essentialsThe purpose of work simplification is obvious: to simplify. Bloated processes are filled with excessive information and clunky operations. The first step in work simplification is identifying the waste. What steps seem unnecessary? What does each team need to complete its task? Are certain processes and technologies superfluous?Create an action plan to remove the excess and simplify what needs to be kept. Utilize only what is essential to strong performance and goal achievement.For example, if employees have to request time off through a portal separate from their HR platform -- where they typically review their benefits, pay stubs, and timesheets -- that adds an unnecessary step and also makes the staff responsible for yet another login and password. Integrating time-off requests into your HR platform solves that problem.Where else is ineffective technology wasting your time? Are you losing time monthly by processing payroll in one software, then inputting information into another program that contains other HR information? Find these time-wasters and cut them out.Manage in personElectronic correspondence can be burdensome and even detrimental to one s health. An April 2015 study published in the Journal of Occupational Health Psychology coined the term  telepressure  to describe the human urge to quickly respond to emails and messages. The study found that of 303 participants, those who obsessed over responding reported poorer quality of sleep and missed more work due to health problems.Avoid flooding people with emails and messages. Set clear expectations about response times to help employees manage their workloads. Encourage setting specific times throughout the day to address emails and messages to prevent telepressure.Despite the bad rap, meetings can indeed be productive and efficient, if conducted within a limited time frame. In-person meetings can also be improved with management platforms that assist employees with creating agendas and taking notes during team discussions. These meetings are best for addressing big policies, practice changes and strategic planning.Related: 5 Ways to Help Employees Help ThemselvesTechnology is meant to simplify work processes, so learn to maximize its benefits without overcomplicating the employee experience.

Register Now   Are disruptive technologies worth the disruption they cause?  is a question many HR professionals ask themselves when they hear promises of industry-changing technology.Although  disruptive technology  may sound intimidating, the term actually applies to the high impact it has, not the deployment process. In fact, some disruptive technologies can be implemented with minimal interference to daily routines, yet offer high levels of operational gains. Cloud deployment, social and collaborative tools, and predictive analytics are among the high-impact disruptive technologies which can be embraced by HR leaders, without fear of being buried in never-ending process management loops.The age of transformation.Technological change has driven new business implementations for the past decade. HR professionals today are bombarded with news accounts and analyst reports on the waves of disruptive technologies hitting the industry like mobile apps, analytic tools for people and data, and ever-evolving social networking platforms. This isn t always perceived as good news by those who are fully entrenched in their current processes and workflows, especially if they seem to be operating with an acceptable degree of success.The term  disruptive technologies  can be worrisome, conjuring up images of operational chaos. The pessimists easily envision workflows being abruptly halted and daily routines shattered, leaving personnel confused and disgruntled. It s not likely, however, that the phrase  disruptive technologies  was coined with the intent of scaring HR, but rather to describe new technologies that are expected to totally change operations and the underlying mindset, creating a lasting, positive transformation.Related: The Idea That Disruption Is Dead Is a MythChange does not have to be painful.While change does not have be something that is feared, it does need to be managed. Well-orchestrated change management or project management leads to smooth deployment of new systems. The value of change management surged in the 80s and 90s as countless numbers of books, seminars and training sessions were created on this topic. It is quite likely that every HR executive over the age of 50 has participated in at least one change management workshop.Today, we still talk about the importance of change agents in an organization and place high value on continual improvement. We track performance indicators so that we manage operations, finding opportunities to change practices for the better. Sometimes, small changes make big impacts, as we have learned through these exercises.A transformation whether scaled down or extensive does not have to be painful either. An underlying strategy helps keep the transformation controlled, measured, and manageable. Project managers, technology officers, change agents, talent science managers, and purveyors of the company culture all play a role in creating a landscape that is conducive to positive transformations and out-of-the-box thinking.Related: Want a Huge Boost in Efficiency? Make Some Small Changes.Disruption can be rewarding.As organizations consider investing in new HR technologies whether ones being launched today or on the horizon--it is important to weigh the potential gains and look beyond the obvious financial considerations. Rewards can take the shape of many positives, including productivity, ease of use, reliability, and greater visibility. While it is hard to assign a dollar savings to some abstract gains, those benefits do need to be considered.Predictive analytics is one of those disruptive technologies that promises big impact, without major interruption to existing systems and workflows. By measuring the cognitive and behavioral characteristics of candidates, predictive analytics empowers HR organizations to truly identify best-fit employees, and then integrate the data gathered during the analysis process into other core HR systems for a holistic picture across the employee lifecycle. This insight is key in ensuring that employees get the appropriate onboarding materials, the critical learning and growth opportunities they need for success, and in facilitating ongoing engagement that helps to increase productivity, while reducing turnover.Related: HR Analytics: How Should Big Data Be Used in the Workplace?Final Take-Aways.Disruptive HR technologies will continue to be touted in newsletter headlines and analyst reports. This is an age of rampant change with new IT solutions being developed at breakneck speed with super-power impact. It is up to HR professionals to research and understand the true value of each and they should also remember that just because a new technology is labeled  disruptive  it doesn t have be painful to deploy. Change is often a very good, welcome thing. Thinking out of the box and continuous improvement are always good things, good for HR, personnel and profitability. Sometimes, it just takes a brave, bold mindset to take advantage of the many disruptive technologies being introduced.

/article/272900,New Data Confirms Again That Women Make Less Than Men in the Same Roles,A Glassdoor study explores the gender pay gap in the U.S. and abroad.,"When it's still considered a surprise that the number-one reason young women leave their jobs is because they landed higher paying gigs, it's clear that the global conversation around equal pay for equal work is unfortunately far from over.A recent study from job-hunting platform Glassdoor pulled from data on salaries and job titles submitted by users, examining the state of the gender pay gap in Australia, France, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States. Glassdoor looked at the incomes reported by more than 500,000 U.S. workers and found that, on average, women earned 76 cents per dollar that men earn.Related: Women Made Incremental Progress in Tech the Past Few Years (Infographic)The data shows that the pay gap shrinks when it's between men and women who are around the same age and have about the same level of experience and education. But when placing a man and a woman side by side -- working in the same location, with the same job title, at the same company -- women still earned less, with female employees earning 94.6 cents of her male counterpart's dollar.Those types of stats aren't unique to the U.S. In Australia, women earn 82.1 cents per dollar; in France, its 85.7 cents per euro; 77.5 cents per euro in Germany; and in the U.K., women earn 77.1 pence per pound.Related: How Top Companies Aim to Close the Gender Gap in TechAccounting for a gender bias in the workplace, whether it is intentional or not, Glassdoor ultimately found that male-dominated fields are often the higher paying ones.Taking it a step further, Glassdoor looked at occupations where men and women were paid more than the other, or paid the same. For example, a female computer programmer sees a 3 percent discrepancy in base pay and earns 72 cents per every dollar earned by a male counterpart.

/article/269790,What the Healthcare Industry Could Learn From The Container Store,How are hospital CEOs indirectly impacting patient care via their employees?," If you take care of the employees better than anyone else, they will take care of the customer better than anyone else,"" Kip Tindell, chairman and CEO of The Container Store, has said. ""If the employees and the customers are ecstatic, the shareholders will be ecstatic too. Related: 5 Looming Obamacare Obligations Every Entrepreneur Needs to Know AboutNow, consider applying that advice to healthcare. But moving toward that ""employee-first  culture that Tindell is promoting, and substituting ""patient"" wherever he mentions ""customer,"" may seem counter-intuitive to healthcare administrators.Suggest to them that they should put patient"" first, and some of them will likely say, ""Not necessarily.""And that may make some sense. For years, the only model for compensating healthcare providers has been a complex billing system based on a schedule of predetermined fees for a long list of procedures. Each procedure is assigned a medical billing code, and when a physician runs a blood test, his or her staff finds the medical code assigned to that procedure, then submits it to the patient s insurance company for payment (sometimes called a reimbursement). This system, still widely used, is called fee-for-service.That model has advantages and disadvantages. One disadvantage is that its cumbersome standardized billing codes require specialized training, which in turn have spawned the creation of a cottage industry devoted solely to medical billing. Estimates are that 20 to 30 percent of a dollar s value in U.S. healthcare is lost in administration and billing.On the other hand, fee-for-service is straightforward. A healthcare provider renders a service and gets paid a pre-negotiated amount. And, ideally, costs are controlled due to the tension that exists between insurance companies and healthcare providers: Providers want the fee schedule to go up and insurance companies want to keep it the same (or to even implement reductions).Most agree this tension would function better if the true costs the patient bears were not obscured by health insurance systems.The Affordable Care Act (ACA), or  Obamacare,  tries to address this and a related concern with the fee-for-service model: its incentive for providers to order as many procedures as possible (think about collecting as many billing codes as possible to send to the insurance companies for payment). Consequently, the concern is that a provider becomes unintentionally focused on quantity as opposed to actual patient outcomes. ACA modifies the traditional fee-for-service model by partially compensating healthcare providers based on outcomes, as opposed to the raw number of procedures being performed. For example, financial penalties now exist for hospitals that experiencere-admissions -- meaning patients re-admitted because they weren't ready to leave the hospital, possibly because their care was hurried or inadequate. In this way, ACA is attempting to promote quality outcomes rather than focus on the decades-old fight over fees. Related: The IRS Has Put a Stop to this Obamacare WorkaroundWith this push toward outcomes-based compensation in healthcare, administrators can no longer afford a business as usual  outcome. Instead of concentrating just on keeping doctors happy, enforcing staffing policies,handling nursing concerns and promoting the hospital's services, today's hospital CEO needs to focus primarily on creating the best employee experience possible. And this is where The Container Store comes in: It's a model for healthcare administrators!The reason (backed by our data) is that better healthcare outcomes are tied to a better patient experience. The vast majority of nurses, medical assistants, physicians and other frontline staff enter the medical field to serve people and help make them better. Indeed, the war is won on the front lines of hospital rooms, with their beeping monitors and cups of chipped ice. While administrators are not on the frontlines, they are just as critical, assuming that they get "" that they indirectly impact patient care simply by making the lives of those in the trenches better. Specifically, they find ways to successfully engage their employees. Successful business leaders, including healthcare administrators, then, can do more to improve their organizations by focusing on employee engagement, not traditional growth initiatives. Our findings suggest that healthcare administrators should focus on ensuring their employees have meaning in the work they do, autonomy to help their patients, growth opportunities, the ability to impact their patients  lives for the better and a powerful connection to their clinic or hospital as well as to their patients and their families (hence, the acronym MAGIC). Why should a hospital administrator shop at The Container Store, to see firsthand how the  employee-first  mentality is working for others? Why should that administrator make a point of recognizing that that same mentality will make a difference for his or her organization?Related: Employee Engagement Is More Important Than the CustomerThe answer is that with the Affordable Care Act, the rules are different. One way to respond to these changing rules is to start focusing on your employees. So, healthcare administrators should take care to ensure they give their employees reason to give their very best, every day, to those who need the most important kind of help: compassionate and skilled medical care.Matthew WrideMatt Wride is the COO for DecisionWise, a leadership and management consulting firm.

/article/254677,How to Ask for a Raise -- and Get It,"Whether your managers like you or not, they're not just going to give you more money. Here are five tips on how to ask for it yourself.","If your New Year's resolutions involved adding zeros to the end of your pay check, you're in good company. A CareerBuilder survey shows that 57 percent of workers are dissatisfied with their salary. But unfortunately, most of us cringe at the prospect of having ""the conversation"" with our boss. And understandably so -- asking for a raise is hard.Many of us have rehearsed asking for a raise in front of the mirror at home. But only a fraction can actually bring ourselves to do it in the office -- and even fewer are successful.Why?Asking for more money is uncomfortable at best and often downright nauseating. You don t want to appear pushy, aggressive, egotistical or ungrateful. Plus, we hate asking for things when we assume the answer is going to be a demoralizing no.Related: Can You Convince Your Boss to Pay You a Bigger Salary?So, what happens?You think you're worth more or you need more, but you don t ask, so you don't get. This is business. Whether your managers like you or not, they're not just going to give you money, especially not the kind of money you're looking for. Over time, resentment builds up and affects your performance. Now, they definitely won t give you more money.The vicious cycle continues until you eventually leave, in search of greener, more lucrative pastures which seem to never materialize. The alternative? You stick around and increasingly grow bitter, counting down to the weekends and being that person in the office. You have to bite the bullet, muster up the courage and ask for a raise.How? With five practical steps.1. Time it right. Most people time ""the ask"" completely wrong. They request a raise when they are already dissatisfied or on the brink of leaving. Walking in with a resentful ""they don't appreciate me"" attitude and demanding money will get you nowhere fast. The best time to ask for more money is when you're happy with your job and are demonstrating value to the company.A recent PayScale salary survey found that when dissatisfied employees asked for a raise, less than 20 percent got it. Encouragingly, that same survey found that when satisfied employees asked for a raise, almost 50 percent got it. The lesson is clear: Ask when things are going well. It's also wise to consider appropriate timing from a company perspective. Most people ask for a raise during annual evaluations. That's bad timing, because managers are overwhelmed and the budgets have been set. The best time to request a raise is when you're being asked to increase your workload or when you just completed a big assignment. That s when people are recognizing your value.2. Know your worth. You're not going to get a raise because you want it. Everyone wants more money. You need to make a case for it. How? Do your research. How much are you worth in the marketplace? Are you underpaid relative to your peers? Are people with comparable experience and qualifications making more money in similar companies? Come armed with specifics, and you'll make a stronger case.If that doesn t help, try demonstrating your unique contributions to the company: Have you saved the company money? Brought in new business? Made the customers happy? Again, you need to think like your boss. What is your value to the company? Many times, even he or she isn't aware of the scope of your contributions. It's your job to increase that clarity.If those two strategies don t work, and only use this if it's true, demonstrate your need. If you have bills that are larger than your paycheck, explain that you need to make more so you can take care of your responsibilities and better focus on your job.Related: How to Get Paid More Today3. Don t lose your cool. Don t raise your voice or use non-verbal expressions of frustration or anger. Don t threaten or whine. (But, I've heard crying helps.)No one is sympathetic to a kvetch. You want to show your boss you're a valuable and committed member of the team -- not a loose cannon. Navigate this conversation without getting heated, and you'll walk away with greater respect from your superiors.4. Ask for more responsibility.Every company needs to accomplish certain tasks and pays their employees to get those tasks accomplished. Maybe by taking on more responsibility or widening your role, you can make their lives easier or eliminate the need to hire another person. This way, you effectively free up capital for your raise while saving them money.Raises and promotions are tied into value. Add measurable value, and you should be entitled to more money.5. If the answer is no, don t leave empty handed.If all strategies fail, ask what you can do to earn it in the future. There may be constraints that you don t appreciate. Turn this into an opportunity to request advice. Have them help you understand what you need to do in the future to get your raise. Try to create an arrangement where you can expect to renegotiate your salary once you've met certain concrete milestones. This way, you give yourself a goal to work towards.Asking for a raise isn't easy, but greatness never is. With the proper preparation and courage, you increase your chances of getting what you think you deserve. Don t push too hard but don't be a pushover. Strike that balance, and make your case.

Register Now  Data has the power to strengthen everything businesses do, from the new products they launch to the marketing campaigns they use to promote those products. Gathering information and putting that information to use has become big business, creating jobs and cloud solutions. When a business is more informed before making decisions, that business can get more return from every dollar it spends.In recent years, businesses have realized the value of people analytics in making human resources decisions. Learning as much as possible about current staff performance improves the choices made about hiring, training and promotion. With technology powering much of what businesses do, gaining access to this data is easier than ever. However, small businesses can save money and time by learning from the lessons large businesses are sharing.People analytics in big business.Google is one of the highest-profile users of people analytics for human resources. The company bases many of its decisions on data analytics, believing that the choices it makes about employees are more important than any other decisions, impacting the organization at all levels. By labeling its human resources department  people operations,  the company is saying that HR is as integral as any other area of operations. With the right people in place, businesses can provide better customer service and increase productivity while also minimizing cost.Engineering firm Stantec uses people analytics to predict outcomes, including employee turnover trends. By looking at areas of the company that seem to have an increased rate of employee resignations and terminations, Stantec can determine where changes might need to be made. Predictive analytics help the company to maintain adequate staffing across the entire organizations. This sort of analytics has been used in retail for years, as companies look at last year s numbers to determine how many employees are needed on the floor this year.Related: 10 Hilarious Signs You Should Not Take That Job (Infographic)Small business applications.Although small businesses can get the same benefits as larger businesses from people analytics, they often lack the resources necessary to gather information on employee actions. While cloud-based solutions provide an answer to that, often businesses simply need access to general information about hiring the right employees and getting the most out of them.Google s re:Work is likely to become a go-to resource for businesses in this situation. With re:Work, Google provides the results of the research it has done in the form of articles, case studies and tips from experts in various industries. Businesses can search re:Work for keywords or browse topics like hiring, managing or training. The platform is designed to demonstrate how organizations can help each other better cultivate and nurture top talent.Related: Why You Need to Embrace the Big Data Trend in HRAnalytics makes HR more effectiveAs businesses launch their own people analytics programs, Google is offering support in that area. The company offers guides specific to topics like running employee surveys and identifying and defining metrics. Following the guide step by step, businesses can learn how to set up their own people analytics and make the most out of them. The company also has a book on its insights, as well as a people analytics-based hashtag called #makeworkbetter.By observing the way Google has changed its HR activities as a result of its analytics efforts, businesses can determine which behaviors work and which might be less effective. One major change Google made was in its interview process. After discovering that more than four interviewers didn t increase the quality of hires, the company decreased the number of interviews required. The company also implemented an on-boarding process that it found increased productivity by 15 percent.Businesses are using analytics to power every important decision they make. A business s employees are its most important assets, so why not use analytics to make decisions about hiring and employee retention? By following the example of large companies like Google, businesses of all sizes can gather the information they need to improve their hiring, training and employee promotion efforts.Related: Hire Better Talent With a Big-Data ScientistJohn BoitnottJohn Boitnott is a longtime digital media consultant and journalist living in San Francisco.

/article/269795,3 Tips for Dealing With the Inevitable Departure of Key Employees,"Employee off-boarding is a regular part of business these days, but it could create positive opportunities for both you and your departing team member.","My father's generation, and many before him, had very defined expectations about work and careers. When they were young, they were expected to go to school or learn a trade, then work in the same job their entire career -- and most of them did.My generation (the X Generation) was one of the first generations to buck this trend. We had the same expectations -- to go to school or learn a trade, then work in the same job our entire career -- but we did not. Instead, we moved from company to company and even changed careers once or twice.Future generations of business professionals entering the workforce now have altogether different expectations, namely that they will go to school or learn a trade, but they are not expected to work in the same job or even stay in the same profession throughout their careers.Related: 9 Things Managers Do That Make Good Employees QuitThis evolution of attitudes is important, because for the next decade or two, we can expect that this generational mix of career expectations will be represented in and influencing our workplaces, with older workers expecting focus and loyalty while younger workers expecting choice and flexibility.While businesses continue to evolve themselves in order to retain key employees, the fact is that this trend of regular off-boarding is not likely to change. At no time is this trend better demonstrated than in January, after all year-end quotas are met, bonuses paid and equity options vested, when we see more and more employees leaving for new opportunities.Businesses therefore should be prepared to deal with this paradigm shift, and rather than ignoring or taking offense at an employee leaving, look to make the experience positive for you and your team with these tips.1. Plan ahead of time.First and foremost, all management teams need a plan to deal with the departure of an employee, critical or otherwise. It starts with having a thorough job description for each position in your organization. Beyond the job description, employers should document and regularly update ongoing tasks and responsibilities of each employee, as well as key personnel, customers and vendors that the employee interacts with daily. Having and updating this information often ensures that you are not rushing to compile it as your employee is walking out the door.Succession planning also requires that you have an ongoing process for monitoring and replacing employees, especially key employees, in the off chance they depart quickly and unexpectedly.Planning ahead of time for the inevitable challenge of a departing employee not only makes the process easier, it allows the departing employee to leave quickly without lingering and creating an atmosphere among the remaining team that could ultimately hurt motivation and productivity and threaten security.Related: 4 Things About Managing People I Wish I Knew When I Started2. Embrace change.Entrepreneurs need to adopt the expectation that it is not a matter of ""if"" but ""when"" a key employee will leave. Fred Wilson, a successful venture capitalist and founder of Union Square Ventures, certainly is no stranger to the fast-paced and high-turnover world of technology startups. As someone who has millions of dollars invested in companies, one would think that he would cringe at the thought of the disruption caused by the departure of key team members.Instead, Wilson encourages entrepreneurs to embrace change, saying, ""(E)very departure is an opportunity to rethink the role and the organization. You can t find an exact replica of the person who has left. But you can find a person who will bring different things.""3. Never burn a bridge.It is natural to feel disappointed, upset and even betrayed when an employee leaves, especially if you have put any amount of effort into training, nurturing and trusting that employee. Instead of allowing the employee to leave on a sour note, embrace his or her new opportunity and support the move. By making the already uncomfortable task of leaving easier, you create a brand ambassador for your compay who can spread the gospel of your culture and ultimately attract new talent.  Additionally, treating departing employees with the respect they deserve encourages them to cooperate and work with you and your team to make certain that their responsibilities and institutional knowledge are transitioned during and even after their departure.In the end, employees leave for any number of reasons. Perhaps they have outgrown the opportunities or seek more responsibilities than are available at your organization. Perhaps they are seeking to strike out on their own and start their own business. Perhaps your culture did not evolve or mature the way they anticipated. Or, perhaps they simply seek a change of scenery for their family.Whatever the reason, entrepreneurs need to understand that employee off-boarding is not only a regular part of business these days, but also that it could create positive opportunities for both you and your departing team member.And who knows, maybe after gaining valuable training, experience and life skills at another s expense, they can return and add even more value to your organization.Related: Why Companies Need to Think Carefully About OnboardingPeter GascaPeter Gasca is an entrepreneur, consultant and author.

/article/254137,4 Things CEOs Want From HR Leadership,What an HR executive must do to reclaim his or her rightful advisory role to the CEO.,"The head of HR is frequently, at least in the CEO s eyes, seen as the low man (or woman) on the executive totem pole. This occurs despite the fact that people are the biggest item on almost every company s budget, and that CEOs consistently list talent as a top concern.Related: Why We Replaced (In)Human Resources with 'Employee Experience'Yet, rather than being seen as a strategically valuable, business-oriented leader, the head of HR is often regarded instead as administration- and compliance-focused.How can HR leaders reverse this image and make themselves invaluable to the CEO and the business? Here are four ways:1. Match talent resources with company strategy.The ability to counsel the CEO in strategic planning and resource allocation is critical to HR s role in modern business. CEOs want an HR executive who understands where the company wants to go and what talent resources are required to get there quickly. And every group wants as many people as they can get to do the work.The CEO needs help to determine the right number of resources in every area to execute on the strategy and maintain balance across the organization. Small changes in the number of people in an organization can change a loss into a profit, or vice versa. The head of HR can provide the data and counsel to make the organization as efficient as possible.2. Help attract the best and brightest.CEOs want the HR department to proactively help find and hire industry stars -- not just put up job posts when a vacancy occurs. Filling empty positions is not enough to be successful. A true HR leader must help market the company in a way that attracts the best talent in the industry. Recruiting is a continuous sales process, and top-notch HR leaders will embrace it and add tremendous value.Related: What HR Pros Need to Learn From the Rest of the Company3. Deliver excellence in the onboarding process.HR leaders should drive good management practices by applying the mantra,  Don t micromanage, but do micro-train.  Too many companies hire good people only to let them flounder once they come onboard. Then they re disappointed when the new employee doesn't contribute quickly.HR can end this harmful dynamic by owning the onboarding process. Quality onboarding includes making the new hire aware of company history and general industry knowledge and having him or her attend meetings with key executives, in addition to the obvious job-specific training.These actions have multiple benefits such as driving high performance, creating a common language across the company and building a strong culture through shared experiences.4. Focus on employee engagement.Most companies don't measure employee engagement, much less manage it. This is yet another area where the HR executive can and should take the lead. He or she can:measure engagement through tools such as Gallup s Q12 survey.take action on issues surfaced. support the entire management chain in efforts to engage employees.It s especially critical for HR to coach and give feedback to first-line managers, many of whom aren't well trained and lack skills that are critical to keeping employees engaged and motivated.These are just four of many areas where a strong HR leader can provide real business value and reclaim his or her rightful position as a vital advisor to the CEO. Of course, the CEO should also be a champion of the HR function and willing to take an active role in all these areas.Choosing to work for this type of CEO is the first step toward success for an HR leader.Related: How HR Can Communicate Important-But-Boring Stuff to New HiresJoel TrammellJoel Trammell is CEO of Khorus, which provides business management software for executives.

/article/253419,8 Costly Mistakes to Avoid When Interviewing a Job Candidate,Save money and time by identifying great applicants the first time around.,"To be a great leader you must be a great interviewer, since the quality of your organization depends on your ability to find and hire the right people.As a professional speaker and consultant, I travel around the country conducting leadership development programs. I continue to be shocked by how many leaders are bad at interviewing and therefore aren t getting the best results for their organizations. It s an expensive mistake -- bad hiring mistakes cost companies millions of dollars each year.To avoid this pitfall, here are eight deadly sins to avoid when interviewing a job candidate.1. You don t know what you re looking for in a candidate.Before you start the interview process, it s important to decide what qualities you are looking for in a candidate. This criteria can generally be divided into three categories: competency, culture and experience. Make sure to craft questions that will help you determine an applicant s ability, cultural fit and previous work history instead of open-ended questions that aren t relevant.2. You ask illegal questions.Oftentimes, the leaders I work with are shocked to find out that many of the questions they routinely use are actually illegal to ask during an interview. By law, when interviewing a candidate you can not ask about race, creed, country of origin or religion. I often see job postings that ask at least one question prohibited by federal law.Related: 5 Ways to Take the Wind Out of Your Future Leaders' Sails3. You have no previous interviewing experience.Many organizations put leaders in interviewing roles, but haven t taught them effective techniques. Interviewing is both an art and science; most people require training to be able to distinguish between excellent candidates and subpar ones with excellent interview skills.4. You accept the first answer without digging any deeper.Many leaders will ask candidates question and accept their answers at face value. For example, when asked to give an example of a workplace accomplishment they are proud of, an interviewee may say  I m very proud of the fact that I won the Edge Leadership Award.  A bad interviewer responds by saying  congratulations that s really great!  In contrast, a great interviewer will want to know the specific accomplishments that helped the candidate win, along with more information about the award itself, including how many people receive it each year. 5. You always believe a candidate s answers.Many leaders are too trusting when interviewing a candidate. People in interviews often stretch the truth, massage the truth or, let s face it, blatantly deceive. Don t blindly accept a candidate s answers. Instead, ask follow-up questions in an effort to determine whether they are lying. You don t have to be accusatory -- this can be done in a professional, diplomatic and friendly way.Related: 15 Tips for Improving Your Skills Interviewing Job Candidates6. You don t require that candidates are interviewed multiple times by multiple people.  To loosely paraphrase Abraham Lincoln,  you can fool some of the people some of the time  The point is that if you have multiple people interview a candidate multiple times, it s very difficult for a candidate to fool everyone. The other advantage of having multiple interview is each person will have a different experience with the candidate, and learn new things about him or her.7. You don t ask candidates to prove their skillsets. For example, if a leader is interviewing someone for customer service position, at some point they candidate should demonstrate his or her skills by taking a fake customer service call. It is perfectly appropriate to test applicants on their listed skillsets, through role play, take-home tests or scenario-based case studies.8. You talk too much.In interview is a chance for a leader to get to know the candidate. I ve always believed that an interview should follow the 80/20 rule, which means the leader should talk 20 percent of the time and the candidate should talk 80 percent of the time. If the goal is to learn as much as possible about the interviewee, don t waste time with chit chat about yourself.

/article/253458,How a Partnership Between HR and Finance Can Move Your Company Forward,"In today's highly competitive business landscape, you can't have one without the other.","When it comes to business growth, the most pressing problems include a scarcity of funding and a shortage of human capital.Related: 7 Traits to Turn Good Managers Into Great ManagersThe solution? A sound relationship between the chief financial officer (CFO) and the chief human resources officer (CHRO). But CFOs and CHROs don t always have their goals aligned: Their perspectives can be vastly different at times and one of these executive s initiatives may limit the reach of the other s.Although CFOs and CHROs don t always see eye to eye, getting them on the same page and working together is critical to eliminate inefficiencies, work toward goals and achieve business success.Create a powerful partnership between both of these key players with these three steps:1. Engage everyone in strategic planning.The first step is to get CFOs and CHROs involved in the planning process. However, in some companies, finances tend to take precedence over talent. In a recent report sponsored by Visier and released by Harvard Business Review Analytic Services (HBR-AS), 44 percent of the 323 CEOs surveyed said that their workforce planning was driven by finance and did not take talent availability into consideration.If workforce planning is strictly focused on budget, however, companies risk missing out on top talent. Involving CHROs in the goal-setting process can create strategies that balance both finance and HR concerns.Today, more and more CEOs are recognizing this fact, acknowledging the importance of incorporating HR s perspective. In fact, a July CareerBuilder survey of 88 leaders at companies with revenues of at least $50 million found that 65 percent of those CEOs thought that HR opinions carried increasingly more weight with senior management. What s more, 73 percent said their own HR leaders had provided data they had incorporated into their overall business strategy.Takeaway: Allow CHROs to actively contribute when setting goals and creating strategies, and take their opinions as seriously as those of CFOs. Although CHROs are focused on human capital, their input improves the bottom line, too. The Careerbuilder survey found that 57 percent of respondents said HR executives could show ways to increase efficiencies and cut costs by better using the company s human capital.2. Align HR and finance metrics with company objectives.Data leads to better decisions, so it's important to use every piece available to guide goal-setting and achievement. But this doesn't always happen: Many organizations are missing a vital piece of the puzzle.In the HBR-AS survey, 57 percent of company leaders agreed that data on positions and talent was required to meet business objectives, and another 57 percent said they needed data on what was happening with talent acquisition and attrition at their companies to improve workforce planning. In fact, many companies already have this data -- they re just not using it at the executive level.These findings highlight the lack of communication between the hiring and business ends of organizations and a lack of understanding of what information is needed to meet objectives. Indeed, 57 percent of CEOs surveyed by CareerBuilder said HR executives could provide actionable talent data and other research to help them devise strategies to meet larger business goals.The takeaway: CHROs need to analyze the data they have and use it alongside data from CFOs to drive business results. Data from both sides should be examined together to determine the best course of action to meet company goals.Related: How to Keep Your Team a Team When the Company Starts to Grow3. Implement an ongoing review process.Once strategies have been set -- with input from both CFOs and CHROs -- you should set up an ongoing review process to test their efficiency. Considering that 48 percent of CEOs surveyed by CareerBuilder claimed their companies had lost money due to inefficient recruiting, human capital tactics need constant reevaluation in order to meet talent and finance goals.The takeaway: Use workforce analytic tools and software that make it easy to track, analyze and share human capital data critical to the company s bottom line. That way, your CFO can review the results and work together with your CHRO to improve your company's business tactics.How do your CFO and CHRO work together?

/article/254676,4 HR Priorities You Need to Focus on This New Year,Employers need to focus more on creating a culture in which roles are defined and communications are open.,"The new year has begun, and with it comes the opportunity to review the biggest problems from last year and determine their solutions. In a survey by Waggl in December, business leaders, HR leaders and consultants reported their top HR priorities for 2016. Those ranged from developing leaders, improving collaboration and changing company culture to focusing more on employees.Related: 3 HR Trends That Are Becoming Best PracticesAlthough priorities will vary from organization to organization, overall trends can guide decisions and help determine the biggest problems to target and fix throughout the coming year. Here are a few of the top HR issues to focus on in 2016:1. Develop leaders at all levels.Good leaders are hard to find, but they re critical to the success of employees and the company as a whole. That s why, in 2016, HR professionals are putting a greater emphasis on developing leaders from within the company.Among those surveyed by Waggl, 74.1 percent identified encouraging a growth mindset or leadership at all levels as a top HR priority for 2016. In addition, HR professionals surveyed by SHRM in November 2015 named developing the next generation of organizational leaders as the top future human capital challenge.To secure a long line of future leaders, training and development needs to start at every level. This begins with a culture of accountability and education. The implication here for employers is to invest in training opportunities, develop mentorship programs and establish other leadership-development programs.In short, get everyone involved -- not just those who will be promoted to a leadership position later this year.Related: Why You Need to Embrace the Big Data Trend in HR2. Improve teamwork.Under effective leaders are efficient teams who collaborate to complete tasks. But teams aren t communicating and working together as efficiently as they should be: Employees surveyed by Wrike in October 2015 ranked lack of collaboration and team members not pulling their weight among the top stressors at work.Dysfunctional teamwork is one of the top HR issues, and it s no surprise that 71.6 percent of professionals surveyed by Waggl said agility, collaboration and trust were major priorities for the new year. Those surveyed by SHRM agreed that teamwork is a challenge: Creating an organizational culture where trust, open communication and fairness are emphasized and demonstrated by leaders was the top tactic professionals said was needed to meet HR challenges.Although employers said they were interested in creating more collaborative work environments, there was a disconnect between them and their employees. So, the takeaway for employers seemed to suggest focusing on creating a culture in which roles are clearly defined, employees communicate openly and everyone on the team works together to get the job done.Teamwork starts from the top, so get management involved to lead the charge to better collaboration.3. Find the right talent.HR issues aren t limited to current employees -- employers are struggling to fill talent needs, as well. Employers want top talent who will push the organization forward, but such people are tough to find. In the Waggl survey, 71.1 percent of professionals ranked finding the right, innovative talent among the top HR issues for 2016.Although employers are looking for talent with advanced skills, most have trouble finding professionals with even the basic skills needed for open positions, a report from Burning Glass, suggested, in November 2015. On average, one in three skills requested in job postings was a baseline skill, the employer-respondents said, and gaps in these skills exist in nearly every industry.The lesson here was that, in 2016, employers need to find a balance between recruiting for baseline and advanced skills. Instead of searching for the unrealistic professional who  can do it all,  they should determine which few skills are the most important for the job and focus on them.The recommendation here? Use pre-hire assessments and other screening tools to test the skills that matter most. Tools like CredHive allow employers to view work samples from candidates and focus on practical knowledge instead of job requirements.4. Overhaul performance reviews.Ineffective performance reviews have been among HR's top issues for a while -- but that doesn t mean that they re going anywhere.Among Canadian and U.S. employers surveyed by Towers and Watson in November 2015, only 8 percent of respondents said that they had eliminated these reviews altogether. Yet, employers recognized the need for change. In the survey, 50 percent of respondents said they had changed or planned to change their annual review process in favor of more frequent interactions between employees and managers.Those surveyed by Waggl held similar views: Some 97 percent said that listening to their employees and incorporating their ideas was critical to an organization s success. Indeed, the annual performance review doesn't seem to be cutting it anymore. Some 81 percent of employers surveyed by Towers Watson said their managers spent too little time in ongoing conversations with employees about their performance.The lesson here is that employees want and need more feedback, and managers need more input from their team. In 2016, it will be useful to focus on facilitating ongoing conversations between employees and management about performance and goals instead of saving it all for the yearly review.HR software, internal communication tools and other networks can all help managers accomplish these goals, by connecting better with, and listening to, their teams.What HR issues are you looking to tackle in 2016?

Hopefully not for a moment longer now that L. Felipe Restrepo has stepped in. This week, the U.S. district court judge slapped the stingy content-marketing firm with a fine of $1.75 million to make it right with workers it forced to forgo pay while using the toilet and for taking other short personal breaks.The company -- which ironically publishes newsletters on best employment practices for businesses, including one titled  Keep Up to Date on Payroll  -- has until tomorrow to figure out how it will fork over the money. The hefty punitive tab accounts for both back pay and liquidated damages owed to 6,000 workers.

Adam Welsh, an attorney from the U.S. Department of Labor's Philadelphia office told the Inquirer. ""I think it's the rare employer who doesn't allow its employees to go to the bathroom. Rare?

Cruel and unusual is more like it.Related: What Businesses in NYC Need to Know About Discrimination Against Transgender WorkersIt bears noting that businesses throughout the U.S. aren t legally required to afford employees personal breaks under federal law. State laws pertaining to employee breaks vary. (You can look yours up here.) When employers do allow short, non-meal breaks, they are required to pay workers for the time they take, which federal law states can range between 5 and 20 minutes per break. Compensable work stoppages that qualify as brief personal breaks include smoke breaks, coffee breaks, breaks to make calls and receive visitors and, yes, bathroom breaks, too.With its employee management practices apparently in the toilet for years, it's no surprise American Future Systems reportedly has a hard time retaining employees.""It's a very high turnover because of that,"" Ivette Vigano, assistant director of the Labor Department's Wage and Hour Division office in Philadelphia, told the Inquirer.

/article/254176,3 of This Past Year's Worst HR Mistakes and How to Do Better,"What embarrassing things did Urban Outfitters, Walmart and the U.N. do that you should not?","HR mistakes can have serious implications for a company. They can create distrust between employees and employers, reduce engagement and negatively affect an employer brand.Related: Why You Don't Need an HR Manager. Really.In fact, in the 2015 SHRM Employee Job Satisfaction and Engagement survey, the 600 responding employees ranked  respectful treatment of employees at all levels  and  trust between employees and senior management  as the top two factors affecting their job satisfaction. Remarkably, ""respect"" and ""trust"" topped even benefits and compensation.It s the difficult job of human resource professionals to create consistency in the organization's core vision and its relationship with employees, to foster a positive and engaging workplace. And when HR mistakes happen, it s their job to pick up the pieces.Companies never intend to upset their employees, of course, but when that does happen, it s important to learn from others' shortcomings. Here are three of the worst HR mistakes from 2015 and what each company could have done differently:1. Urban Outfitters asked employees to  volunteer  during the holidays.What happened: URBN, the parent company of Urban Outfitters, sent out an email asking for employees to volunteer their weekend time at its fulfillment centers in order to prepare for the holiday season.Despite the fact that URBN s career site boasts that the company value[s] both individual and group achievements,  the leaked internal email made it clear that employees would receive only lunch and transportation for their hard work in this instance.Why this was an HR no-no: Aside from the issue of asking employees to work six-hour shifts without pay, the main big mistake here was not acknowledging the value of employees  time and efforts.And underappreciating employees can lead to poor employee retention. In a 2015 LinkedIn survey of more than 10,500 employees who had recently changed jobs, 32 percent said they did so because of dissatisfaction with how employers recognized their contributions.How to do better: It s understandable that URBN was asking its employees to band together as a team in order to better serve its customers during a busy time of year. But who wants to be part of a team that doesn t appreciate your hard work?When communicating with employees, consider how that communication will be received. Does the message align with your core values as a company? Is it transparent in both meaning and intent? After digesting the communication, will employees feel valued and respected? Even the simplest request can seem unreasonable, if it doesn t recognize the important part the employee plays in the success of the company.2. Walmart fired an employee over $5 worth of discarded recyclables.What happened: A Walmart cart collector found $5.10 worth of cans and bottles and redeemed them for cash via a machine inside the store where he worked. The employee had found $3.10 worth of recyclables abandoned in a cart next to a trash can in the parking lot and another $2 worth in a cart located just inside the store s entrance.His employers determined that the cans and bottles turned in from the cart inside the store were Walmart property and that therefore taking them constituted theft. The man was asked to sign a statement about the incident, even though he did not have his glasses with him and could not read the document. He was also denied a copy of the statement after he was fired.Why this was an HR no-no: There was a complete lack of clarity in the communication between the employee and his employers.Whether or not it s reasonable to release an employee over $2.00 of garbage is not the real issue at hand. No matter what the cause of the disciplinary action, Walmart did not take the time to ensure that its employee understood what he had done wrong or what signing the document meant for this employment.How to do better: When it comes to the codes of conduct employees are held to, it s important for organizations to be transparent on what is and isn t acceptable behavior. When infractions occur, especially in gray areas, employers should take the time to fully discuss why employees are facing consequences and what those consequences are.Related: 3 Keys to Hiring for Growth3. An unpaid U.N. intern lived in a tent because he couldn't afford housing.What happened: Twenty-two-year old David Hyde accepted a prestigious unpaid internship with the United Nations in Geneva, Switzerland, even though he knew he d couldn't afford the cost of living in that expensive city. After being denied other internships because he lacked the means to live while working without pay, Hyde lied during the application process and lived out of a tent while working for the U.N.Once his story broke, Hyde quit the internship and admitted he was trying to draw attention to the fact that unpaid internships inherently exclude young people with less wealthy backgrounds from valuable career experience.Why this was an HR no-no: As controversial as the motives behind Hyde s decision might have been, the big HR mistake in this situation was a lack of alignment between the organization s mission and values and how it was treating its employees.Article 23 of the United Nation s Declaration of Human Rights states that,  Everyone, without any discrimination, has the right to equal pay for equal work.  How can employees be expected to be engaged in their work to promote this belief when the interns they work beside are not paid? By choosing to not pay its interns, the U.N. created a disconnect between what the organization says it believes and how it acts.How to do better: An organization s mission statement should be a part of everything it does, from the work to the company culture to how the organization engages employees with that mission. Alignment must be clear, at every level, so that the company is living up to its own core values.What other HR mistakes occurred in 2015, and what lessons can be learned from them?Related: 4 Simple Ways to Make a New Hire Feel Welcome Andre LavoieAndre Lavoie is the CEO of ClearCompany, the talent-management solution that helps companies identify, hire and retain more A players.

/article/254126,3 Keys to Hiring for Growth,Entrepreneurs who take a strategic approach to hiring find abundant talent.,"Most entrepreneurial businesses start with an idea and one person -- the entrepreneur. Then they hire another person, usually a  jack of all trades  whose job description is anything the entrepreneur doesn t want to do or can t get done. As the business grows the team also has to grow. It is expanded to include employees with more specialized skills and more detailed job descriptions.While that expansion is a necessary part of growing a business, hiring is often among the most dreaded tasks an entrepreneur will face. In fact, the reluctance to develop a hiring strategy, document best practices and criteria, and initiate a talent search is one of the greatest limitations on the growth of a business.This week I had the privilege of participating in Entrepreneur Magazine s annual Growth  Conference. The topic was Hiring for Growth. At the Mixer that followed the conference another speaker mentioned that he was sorry he d missed that session because he felt that hiring was one of the weak links in his business. He asked me what I hoped the audience took away from what I d shared, and since he seemed to find it so valuable I thought I d share those three things with you as well.1. The talent you need may be under your nose.If you already have employees they should be your first go-to when you decide you need to expand your team. Regardless of what you hired them to do, or how their role might have morphed since they came on board, chances are they have changed as the business grew. Perhaps they have developed a talent that is exactly what you need and  you just haven t noticed. Or maybe they re itching to learn something new and grow into a different role.Moving someone who already knows your business, fits your culture, and has a proven track record of taking on new responsibilities into a more specialized or complex role and then hiring for the more entry level position is probably going to be more cost-effective and less of a headache than hiring from outside for a more advanced position.And if you have someone chomping at the bit to make a move, keeping them in their current position just because they re good at it is likely to mean you ll be hiring for both positions eventually. Because if they re really talented and ambitious they will be making that move, they ll just be making it away from  your organization.Overlooking the talent already inside your business is almost certain to cost you time, money and frustration.Related: To Avoid Hiring a Toxic Employee, Look for These 6 Qualities (Infographic)2. Scout for talent before you need to hire.If you re not even thinking about your next hire until the time comes that you need people to interview you re compromising the growth of your business and complicating your life unnecessarily.Where is your next hire likely to be hanging out right now and how can you connect with them or with people who know them? Perhaps you need to develop relationships with specialty schools or graduate programs. Maybe you need to connect with industry associations or join Linked In groups that are dedicated to the type of talent or interests you ll be seeking.  The key is to have the intel and the connections already in place so that when it is time to add to your team you immediately know where to look and who to call.Related: How to Get Top Talent When You Have a Bare Bones Budget3. Put the 'human' back in human resources.The essence of business is really simple. No matter how large or small, whether it sells products or services, or whether it s brick and mortar or totally online, every business can be boiled down to one or more people who deliver a product or service valuable enough that one or more other people will compensate them for it.That s it. Just people, serving other people. If you get so focused on your product or service, or so wrapped up in the description of skills and experience required, or so obsessed with pursing your target market or crushing your competition that you lose sight of the humans who make those products or services possible, or the humans who make up your target market, or even the humans who are pouring their own heart and soul into businesses that are similar to yours, you re missing the whole point of business and the deepest satisfaction and greatest thrill of being an entrepreneur.Related: How to Hire a Controller for Your Company     Dixie GillaspieEver since she was a little girl, Dixie s least favorite word was ""can t.""

/article/253827,Your Best Employee Is Your Weakest Link,"If the slacker everybody has learned to work around quits, no problem. It's the person who always picks up the slack you can't afford to lose.","The last time I used my go-to, standard illustration about the need for documentation and cross training I was doing a series of custom workshops for a medical management team. What if, heaven forbid,  I asked them,  one of you got hit by a bus tomorrow and didn t come to work? How much would it cost the business?''Usually when I deliver that line I see awareness dawning and heads nodding as the implications sink in, but that morning the faces staring back at me wore expressions of horror and even anger.I soon learned that only a few months before I was hired to revamp their systems and coach individuals on the team, their office manager and her father had been killed in a car accident. This wasn t a theoretical illustration for this audience. They d lived it.More than that, they were a classic example of the real  weakest link  in any small business. With their office manager gone they started to discover all the tasks they took for granted in the course of a day that no one else knew how to do.When I ask business owners and managers to identify their weakest link most of them will start a mental inventory of their team s attitude and skills. But in almost every case the weakest link isn t the slacker, or the prima donna or the dim bulb who is costing the business the most. Even without a tragic wake-up call, the weakest link is nearly always the person who knows how to do things no one else in the business can do. If that link breaks, even for a sick day or short vacation, it costs your business in small, but cumulative ways that you might not even notice. If they are able, or unwilling, to return to work those costs will accumulate fast.Related: Key Person InsuranceThe entrepreneur at a small business with only one or two employees typically has done most of the employees' tasks at some time and could still muddle through them, if necessary. But think of the cost of having what should be your most highly skilled (and compensated) person (that would be you) doing mundane but vital tasks.  As you grow there will be tasks that you ve hired someone to do just so you don t ever have to know how to do them. That s great, but make documentation and training part of the job description.If you have employees who are highly specialized, documentation is even more essential because it s unlikely that their knowledge and skills are duplicated in the organization. Who hasn t heard the horror stories of the tech start up whose engineer quit and left only sloppy records of their work on the project?If you have one trusted  right hand  person who is the only one who knows everything from the password to your online banking to where the bodies are buried, your weakest link is also enough rope for you to hang yourself with if that one trusted right hand turns out not to be trustworthy.Related: 4 Steps to Take When a Key Employee QuitsRegardless of the type of business you re in, how large or how small, a Key Person Audit is a smart item to add to your 2016 planning agenda. Identify the weak links and create a plan for documentation, cross-training where appropriate, and even a hiring strategy if you should need to replace a key person in your organization.I hope you never lose an employee to tragedy, or to a betrayal of trust, but life has a way of throwing us curve balls. The old parental standby is a good admonition for entrepreneurs as well.  Better safe than sorry  is a wise approach to evaluating and guarding against the day when your go-to person isn t there to go to.Related: Having Problems With a Key Employee?

/article/253744,How to Overcome the Greatest Risk to Your Company's Agenda,"Using people analytics, business leaders can pull back the shroud and decode the mysterious inner workings of their organization.","Not having the right team ranks third on the long list of reasons startups fail (behind lacking a market for the product and running out of cash). Indeed, out of more than 100 startup failures analyzed, 23 percent placed their problems at the feet of people.The good news: Most organizations already have the people necessary to drive a strategic agenda; the leaders just don t know their names yet.Using people analytics -- essentially any type of data that provide insights into an organization s workforce -- can pull back the shroud and decode the mysterious inner workings of an organization.HR data is pulled from a company s human resource information system or existing employee data, while relational data is found by asking employees questions about their co-workers. The combination of the two, plus the leaders  intuitions, provide important insights into what is happening at the company -- both what is going well and what isn t.Related: 3 Destructive Employee Syndromes No Boss Can TolerateFew tools allow a leader to see an overall view of his company, but that s exactly what people analytics does. Here are some of the benefits of using people analytics:1. Make a growing company seem smaller. Companies often divide customers into segments, so why not do the same with talent pools? People analytics can help by creating a whole picture that shows who is bridging the gaps, who is already on the team but underutilized and who could be the next great change agent.2. Identify allies. When implementing any sort of agenda, especially one that will radically change the way an organization works, know the change agents. It s a mistake to think employees are interchangeable: They re not. But some can have greater overall impacts than others, and it isn t always obvious who they are. People analytics can help identify allies, and you can work with them to grow their abilities to positively affect your organization.3. Smoke out enemies. If members of the leadership staff feel negatively about a forthcoming change,  they have the ability to totally overthrow the decision. Then, you are forced into a reactive position. But with people analytics, you can proactively identify who might stand in the way so you can think strategically when you prepare for changes -- and even predict outcomes.Related: What You Can Learn From Hollywood on Hiring and Managing Employees4. Stop focusing on everything but people.Entrepreneurs sometimes forget about people, because they simply have too many other things to think about. But that needs to change. According to professional-service company KPMG,  Well thought-out predictive HR analytics could become as important to the CEO as the balance sheet and P&L statement. The collection and use of people analytics can greatly enhance business outcomes and help solve problems. People analytics helps leaders see the totalities of their companies so they can effectively manage employees, mitigate risks and drive strategic agendas -- and ultimately avoid becoming just another startup failure statistic.

/article/253292,4 Simple Ways to Make a New Hire Feel Welcome,"No matter your age or how illustrious your resume, it's rough being the new kid in class.","Picture a new hire walking into an unfamiliar place full of people they don t know with only an office map and a heavy handbook for guidance. They feel nervous, isolated and lost. They re not sure how to act or who to turn to for help.Onboarding can be lonely but it doesn t have to be a solo venture, and HR professionals aren t the only ones with the power to make the new kid on the block feel comfortable. Existing employees can do their part to help new hires feel welcome in their new work environment.Getting the team involved in the onboarding process is critical because it brings employees -- new and old -- closer together, and office friendships breed better work and happier employees. According to Globoforce s Fall 2014 Mood Tracker Report, employees with friends at work are 47 percent more likely to love their companies.Here are a few creative ways to get the team more involved in the onboarding process:1. Introduce new hires to the company on a Friday.The team is busy. Breaking up their day with new hire activities and events may seem like a welcome change of pace, but it could be viewed as an annoying interruption. A busy Monday morning is not be the best time to take current employees away from their desks to bond with a new hire. Instead, introduce new hires to the team on a Friday when everyone is more relaxed and may have some downtime.Better yet, think of other opportunities for making great first impressions -- an all-company meeting before the new hire starts, a company party or a departmental outings. See if there s a fun alignment on office calendars before a new hire begins. When employees have greater freedom to talk and get to know their new co-worker without sacrificing their work, everyone can make a new employee s first day a good start.Related: 10 Tips for Successfully Onboarding Your New Hire2. Use the buddy system.  There s a lot to learn and a lot to remember in the onboarding process, and new hires can be easily overwhelmed. Don t let new hires go it alone.Assign each new hire a buddy or mentor to help with the transition. Buddies can be there to answer questions, give them tips and tricks for the job and provide support. With a buddy system in place, new hires will get more out of the onboarding process, become acclimated to the company and position faster and feel more connected to the team.In fact, a recent Google survey of 258 North American companies found that 88 percent of respondents who strongly agreed that their company supports knowledge-sharing and collaboration also strongly agreed that employee morale and job satisfaction were high. So, give current employees an active role in the onboarding process to lead new hires to success.Related: 7 Ways to Make the First Day Perfect for New Hires3. Create welcome traditions.The onboarding process should include an introduction to individual team members and to the company as a whole. To do that, and to get current team members excited and involved in the process, start unique traditions to welcome new employees.At A/B testing platform Commerce Sciences, for example, the last employee who joined the team is responsible for creating a starter kit for the next new employee. Employees fill these kits with whatever they want -- there are no rules and no limits on their creativity. The kits have included everything from books to coffee to nerf gun darts.No matter what the employees fill the kits with, they get excited to be a part of the onboarding process and new employees get a personalized welcome to make them feel more comfortable on their first day.Find a welcome tradition that speaks to the organization and works for the team. It can be something simple like bringing in donuts and coffee from the team s favorite spot down the block or more involved like a new hire happy hour -- whatever gets the team enthusiastic about the process.Related: 4 Tips on How to Bring Out the Best in Your New Hires4. Give a team-led tour.Anyone can show a new hire to their desk, the closest bathroom and where the boss sits. But only the team can point out which copy machine acts up, which nearby coffee shop has the best brew and to which conference rooms you should bring a sweater.Have the team, or a select few, lead the new employee around the office to give them the lay of the land. This way, new hires can get an inside look at how the office functions and can learn ways to make their time in the office easier. At the same time, the tour can help to break the ice, make new hires more comfortable and bring the team closer together.Related: When Is it Time to Cut the Cord With New Hires?Matt StrazMatt Straz is the founder and CEO of Namely, the HR and payroll platform for the world's most exciting companies.Read more",Onboarding,2015-12-07 17:30:00
/article/252065,"OK, So You're Not Google. You Can Still Compete With It for Top Talent.","You might not be able to pay as much as the big guys, but there are ways to acquire and keep the best candidates out there for your startup.","When it comes to talent, startups face a daunting task when it comes to competing with big companies. Alex Turnbull, the CEO of helpdesk software startup Groove, discovered last year that an engineering candidate was also considering Google, and figured he was doomed. His first thought? It would be impossible to offer competitive salary and perks, let alone the prestige of working for tech s largest brand. While I was offering salaries that were highly competitive in our market, there was no way I could compete with what Google could offer top engineers. And so, as that same prospect explained to me a week later, he would be taking their higher offer. For most startups, the phrase  talent acquisition  isn t used on a daily basis, but it s a part of their world whether they like it or not. And while engineering is the most obvious example in both early stage startups and established tech companies like Facebook, Apple or Google, finding and recruiting talented candidates is a challenge in other areas, too.Related: 3 Tips to Hiring Your Company's Gold-Standard StaffHowever, it s not all bad news for startups. Call it being lean, call it leveraging the David versus Goliath syndrome -- there are some built-in advantages that larger companies simply can t offer. Here are a few things to consider when competing with the giants.1. The best candidate wants to learn and impact the bottom line.By far the biggest draw for great talent is the ability to learn at a rapid pace. Many candidates, especially those early in their careers, are looking for an environment where they can really dive in and develop their skills. As Jake Gibson, founder of NerdWallet, points out, employees in a startup often get more responsibility and more experience than they can at a larger company.When you re working with a startup, time is short and resources are generally limited. As such, you have to do it all, and if you don t know what to do, you ve got to figure it out. This kind of environment is attractive to many candidates, and it affords them great opportunities to learn. This is especially attractive for many millennials and gen Z ers who value continuous feedback and improvement.2. Less is more.Working for a startup means that when you have a new idea, you start as small as you can, build smart, prove your concept, then scale it once you have evidence that it works. That continuous feedback loop is part of what draws people to startups in the first place. Engineering talent, for example, usually has a love of problem-solving. It s why they entered the field in the first place.Dealing with bureaucracy, paperwork and being required to justify budgets are a lot less interesting, and that s a built-in advantage for most startups. If you want to test something, you go for it. Once you want it to go live and be in production, or grow on a bigger scale, then you present data and make your case to the team.Related: To Recruit 'A' Players, Try This 5-Step Method3. Great talent knows there are tradeoffs, so be clear on what you think those are.One of the things that early-stage companies often overlook is that it isn t a zero sum game. For talented engineers, marketers, designers and others who are at the early stages of their careers, there is a clear calculation to be made. Putting Google or Facebook on your resume may be a strong signal for your career prospects, but it doesn t automatically increase your skills or assure a successful career.Even an ex-Googler pointed at this dynamic via a piece in Business Insider last year: Getting experience at a startup can lead to a stronger, longer career at an established company later.4. Job applicants will research you -- make it easy for them.The last and perhaps strongest advantage is that when it comes to brand awareness, you may not be able to compete with Google, but you can make it extremely easy for them to learn more about your company and the type of work they can experience and skills they can expect to acquire.Doing things like encouraging your most excited employees to provide company reviews online and short testimonials about what they re currently learning can go a long way. As much as possible, make sure you are telling potential job applicants what you believe in, and what they ll get an opportunity to work on. Doing so will help attract and retain not just talent, but the right talent for your company.While there are a variety of approaches for a startup to do that, you d be hard pressed to find a better example than Turnbull s blog mentioned at the beginning of this post. For the last two years, he s consistently shared his company s culture and learnings and showcased the day-to-day operations of Groove. And it s paid off. Over the course of the past two years, he s attracted and hired excellent talent and continues to attract great applicants by writing about what he and his team believe in.

/article/253503,3 Destructive Employee Syndromes No Boss Can Tolerate,"Mostly, it's good when people take ownership of their jobs but, taken to an extreme, it turns toxic.","For an entrepreneur having employees can either be the greatest blessing of your professional life or the bane of your daily existence. A lot of our decisions as we grow our businesses center around what jobs we should hire someone else to do, who we should hire to do them, and how we should motivate, compensate, and manage the people once they re on board.After nearly 30 years of managing employees, hiring employees, and coaching other people s employees, I can tell you there are three  syndromes  that will, without fail, make you wish you d avoided employees altogether. Here s how to recognize them, and why you should never put up with them.1. Not-my-job syndrome.You re probably familiar with this one. You may have even seen the meme with the picture of a dead opossum lying in the middle of the road with the yellow center stripe painted right over it. I have yet to know anyone who didn t get that meme, because we ve all known (or been) the employee who was so determined to never be the sucker who requests to perform any task not officially in their job description were met with disdain and, when asked why they didn t correct a potentially disastrous situation or mistake, they ll respond with some variation of,  That is not my job. Imagine what would happen if none of your staff ever did anything that wasn t, strictly speaking, their job. Every time you had a team member out on vacation or a sick day your well-oiled machine would start to hiccup. A heavier than expected work load, or a crisis in a project plan would cause a tail spin that would make heads spin. If you can t afford for all of your employees to have this attitude you can t afford for any of them to use  it s not my job  as a reason for avoiding tasks or responsibilities.Related: 13 Signs of a Disengaged Employee (Infographic)2. ""That s my job, don t touch it"" syndrome.We often mistake this one for the laudable trait of  taking ownership.  It s great when you have someone who takes ownership of the outcome of a task or project, but when they re so proprietary about it that no one else is allowed to pitch in you have just set your entire team up for a logjam. What you ll notice, when you know what to look for, is that others on the team don t contribute to the outcomes this person  owns.  They ll also often complain that others don t perform any task up to their standard, which again, we often mistake for a positive trait of an  excellence mindset  when really they re sabotaging the results that others are achieving.Once you view this attitude as proprietary rather than believing it is simply a desire to achieve excellent outcomes, you ll start to see how it s hampering others on the team from growing and developing. You ll also begin to notice that backups in process or breakdowns in systems often occur because this person can t keep up. You might even start to realize how dependent you are on this individual and how much knowledge and training they re hoarding. Unless you want to be a hostage to their need for control and job security you ll put a stop to their ability to ward off all offers of assistance.Related: What You Can Learn From Hollywood on Hiring and Managing Employees3. ""OMG, it s a crisis but it s OK. I ve got it covered  syndrome.I call this one the  White Knight Syndrome.  When you have an employee with this attitude you ll have very few dull days because there will always be some drama/trauma brewing. And you ll likely be adding this employee to your gratitude list on almost daily, as well. Because whatever the challenge, they re riding to the rescue.But when you pay attention you may start to realize that they re like the hero firefighter who turns out to be the arsonist. They re so addicted to the recognition for being the go-to person in a crisis that they re stirring the pot to make sure there is a crisis for them to go to. This might show up in the form of gossip that gets your team riled up about something that was, at most, a minor issue. Or it might take the form of more serious sabotage.The costs of having this individual on your team are obvious. Even if they do save the day every time, the increased stress and reduced productivity take a toll.Keep in mind that the behaviors associated with these  syndromes  are seldom coming from conscious mindset, and they re almost never malicious. They re usually symptoms of an emotionally immature or highly insecure mentality. It s possible that with coaching the syndrome can be addressed, the behavior corrected and the mindset shifted to one of team collaboration and support.Bu if you allow any of these syndromes a place on your team you ll find that the mindset pervades the entire culture, resulting in a destruction of morale for your team, loss of productivity for your business and an increase in headaches for you.Related: 3 Ways to Increase Employee Vitality as You GrowDixie GillaspieEver since she was a little girl, Dixie s least favorite word was ""can t.""

/article/253291,What You Can Learn From Hollywood on Hiring and Managing Employees,"From having a great reputation as a director, eliminating the wage gap and avoiding divas -- the movie industry is ripe with case studies.","The holidays are a time for family, festivities and award-seeking films. On Friday nights, some of us try to escape the stress of the office by losing ourselves in the best Hollywood has to offer. It s easy to forget that outside of the dark theaters, the movie industry faces a lot of the same work issues the rest of the workforce does.Studios spend millions trying to recruit the best cast, and salary negotiations can go on for months. Gossip magazines are full of stories about starlets spending most of their time arguing with co-workers. Does that sound familiar?Related: 6 Ways to Prevent Your Talented New Hire From Getting PoachedThe main difference between Hollywood's hiring practices and the real world is all the former's decisions are under the spotlight. Here are three common workplace hiring problems and the lessons we can learn from the movie industry on how to deal with them:1. The pull of a great director and employer brandThere are certain directors any professional in Hollywood would give their left hand to work for. A director s experience, vision and the creative challenge he or she brings to a set excites and attracts the best talent. Not every great director offers the same opportunity, but presentation and having a clearly defined way of working ensures that people who believe in his or her vision will want to work for him or her.Now think of the employer brand as a company s metaphorical director. It might take time and effort to build an employer brand that stands on its own, but each company has something special to offer potential employees. By recognizing and developing a clear personality and reputation for a company, employers and recruiters will have an easier time attracting and keeping top talent.2. The wage gap and salary negotiationsAfter Sony studios was hacked, actress Jennifer Lawrence discovered that she made significantly less than her male co-stars for the movie American Hustle. Granted, the actors she worked with -- Bradley Cooper, Christian Bale and Jeremy Renner -- know how to bring in box-office sales. But with the success of her blockbuster series, The Hunger Games, and her Oscar win for Silver-lining Playbook -- which also starred Cooper -- Lawrence has also proven herself able to drive revenue.The bigger issue isn t that a wealthy actress missed out on a couple million dollars -- it s a societal double standard. Lawrence has openly admitted that she didn t push her salary negotiations as far as her male counterparts. As a woman, she was worried that being more aggressive would make her seem  difficult  or  spoiled,  whereas the men were viewed as being strong and confident.Unfortunately, she wasn t necessarily wrong. Research from Harvard and Carnegie Mellon found that women are penalized more severely than men when they try to negotiate for more money.Although the sudden salary transparency was an accident, Lawrence and other actresses now have a clearer idea of what target pay they have grounds to negotiate for.Related: How Leaders Should Look at CultureThis problem isn t contained within Hollywood. A 2015 survey from the Harvard Business School of 71,000 employees found that at all pay levels employees don t know if they re paid fairly. Of the people that received average market pay, only 30 percent knew their salary was average.With more transparency about what a company pays its employees, wage discrepancies will begin to disappear. Employers will have a higher level of accountability in respect to the salaries they offer to each employee, and employees will be confident that they are being compensated fairly.3. Diva employees and cultural fitThe movie industry is full of actors and actresses that are notoriously difficult to work with, and these difficult hires can have detrimental effects on whatever set they re working on.It doesn t matter how talented a problem actor is -- he or she can be toxic to the work environment. Production delays, stressful environments and high turnover of other employees are common.The same thing happens in offices around the world. In a 2015 SHRM survey of 600 employees, 72 percent of respondents said respectful treatment of all employees was important to job satisfaction. However, only 33 percent were pleased with the level of respect at their offices, indicating problems with how employees treat each other are common.One way to avoid these tensions is to pay more attention to cultural fit during the hiring process. Everyone has had to work with the team member who was supposed to be a magnificent addition to the team because of his or her skills and experience. But in reality, that person was a nightmare to work with because he or she wasn t a good cultural fit.To keep from hiring diva employees, companies need to clearly define its culture and values. Then it s necessary to communicate those characteristics to potential employees. This will get everybody on the same page about how co-workers interact and work together, as well as which behaviors and attitudes contribute to overall success.What other lessons about the workplace can we learn from Hollywood?

/article/252805,5 Ways to Reboot Your Wellness Program,People ignore scare tactics and are incentives but making things fun will get them moving.,"Got wellness? Chances are, your wellness program is likely in need of a serious reboot. According to a recent survey conducted by Towers Watson and National Business Group on Health, most workplace wellness programs simply aren t making the grade. Half of eligible employees aren t participating in a single wellness offering, and less that a quarter are choosing to engage with diet and exercise programs.How can your organization do better? Here are five ways to revitalize your company s wellness program:1. Make health easy and  normal. Design an environment that makes the healthy choice easy and visible with  nudges,  or prompts. Small changes can lead to big results over time. El Camino Hospital, a healthcare provider based in the San Francisco Bay area, nudges employees toward enhanced well-being with a walking path that features art exhibits. Google s  Project M&M  had the company switch to smaller plates in their famous gourmet (and free) company cafes. The search giant also now stores candy in opaque containers to reduce temptation.Related: Employee Wellness Programs Are Due for an Overhaul2. Carrots and sticks don t work.Health incentives now average a whopping $880 per employee. Yet, most employees are still opting out. Instead of getting caught up in a losing battle of trying to lure employees into participating with rewards and penalties, follow the lead of companies like Dow Chemical to avoid incentives altogether. According to well-established research lasting motivation does not happen with incentives, but rather when employees (1) feel a sense of achievement, (2) have choice and the ability to participate on their own terms, (3) have opportunities to interact with others, (4) feel connected to a higher purpose, and (5) have fun.3. Swap out fear-based wellness.Workplace wellness is filled with clinical terms like  health risk appraisals,   disease management  programs and invasive, clinical assessments. Instead of trying to  scare  people into adopting healthy habits, focus on generating positive energy. According to research by leading positive psychologist Barbara Fredrickson with the University of North Carolina, a positive outlook generates creative thinking, builds self-confidence and promotes overall resilience   all qualities necessary for lasting lifestyle changes. Fear, on the other hand, saps motivation.Related: All About Wellness: 5 Steps That Will Make Your Company More Productive4. Go stealth.Seek out opportunities to embed wellness concepts into non-wellness initiatives that already receive organizational attention. Some top stealth opportunities include management training, leadership development, onboarding, community outreach, or even regular staff meetings. Virgin America sneaks wellness into new its hire orientations by issuing pedometers to incoming employees.5. Keep your eye on the pulse.Just like with any company initiative, you need to continually measure, evaluate and make adjustments. JetBlue checks in with employees regularly to garner feedback on their company wellness programs. The key is to embrace a  launch and iterate  approach. Don t be afraid to experiment. Start small, see what works and what doesn t, iterate and then try again.Wellness that works requires tenacity, big picture thinking and a willingness to learn through doing. Ultimately, though, transforming the health and well-being of your company s employees begins with a mind-shift. Rather than starting yet another program, start a movement. Design programs that empower employees to become agents of change catalyzing better health for themselves, their coworkers, family and friends.  Once that happens, the benefits of improved health will be felt across the company and at your bottom line.Related: 27 Insights for Creating and Sustaining Workplace HappinessLaura PutnamLaura Putnam, author of Workplace Wellness That Works, is the founder and CEO of Motion Infusion, a San Francisco-based well-being training and consulting firm that provides creative solutions in the areas of engagement, behavior...Read more",Workplace Wellness,2015-11-24 19:00:00
/article/252944,What Your Salary Says About You,A look at some of the commonly believed myths about compensation.,"Every individual's financial plan starts with earning money, but how much you make may often seem to be out of your control.Only 20 percent of people say they understand how their employer determines pay, according to compensation research firm Payscale.But that doesn't have to be the case, and it shouldn't be. ""Ten years ago, employers held all the cards. Now, employees can be much better armed with data,"" said Tim Low, PayScale's senior vice president of marketing. With sites such as PayScale and Salary.com, employees have a greater ability to research what their work is worth and a better opportunity to ensure they're being paid fairly.More than ever, employers must address their own compensation policies and work to keep employees satisfied while maintaining their bottom lines. In light of this new era of transparency, Payscale recently held a webinar for an audience of mostly human-resources professionals, in which they debunked a number of commonly believed myths about compensation.Here are the most commonly held misconceptions: Employers save money by underpaying employees.It is not in the best interest of a company to pay their employees less than fair value and risk creating high turnover. Low says it costs employers 150 percent or more of an employee's annual pay to hire and retrain someone new. On top of the monetary cost of turnover, company morale is greatly affected when good employees leave. ""Counting coins and paying pennies didn't work for Scrooge, and it won't work for you,"" said Aubrey Bach, senior manager of editorial marketing at PayScale, at the webinar.People don't leave their jobs because of pay.According to PayScale research, in 2015, the No. 1 reason people left their jobs was, in fact, pay. With the economy and overall job market improving, employees are better positioned to demand higher wages and walk if they don't feel they are being fairly recognized or compensated. ""It's not universally true across industries and geographies, but as the economy is expanding, employees do have a little more negotiating power,"" Low said.As important as pay is, however, job satisfaction can be raised in other ways. For example, workers in health-care and education fields often report high levels of satisfaction even in lower-paying positions. ""If people are leaving because of pay, dig deeper,"" said Mykkah Herner, director of professional services at PayScale, at the webinar. ""Job meaning and an employee's sphere of influence within their organization are important, too.""Talking to employees about pay will incite a riot.On the contrary, more pay transparency can help improve employer-employee relationships. And it may be better for companies to initiate the conversation rather than let workers simply hash things out on their own. ""If you aren't talking with your employees about pay, chances are that they're talking to each other and creating their own story of what [the company's] compensation policy is,"" said Bach. ""That's not a good thing.""But when companies have been more open about compensation policies, employees have responded well. In a PayScale survey of 71,000 employees, 82 percent reported that they were satisfied with their jobs, even if they were paid lower than average, if their employers clearly communicated why they offer smaller paychecks. ""Basically, communication equals more loyal employees,"" said Bach.More from CNBCAsia markets mostly higher after Fed holds rates steady, corporate earnings awaitedMessaging startup Slack is raising $250 million in a new funding roundBank earnings off to 'positive start' in this financial hub",Salary,2015-11-17 16:01:00
/article/252950,What's Sparking the Mass Exodus at Rent the Runway?,"In the last 10 months, the popular dress-rental startup has lost seven top executives.","In the last 10 months, Rent the Runway has lost its chief operating officer, chief financial officer, chief marketing officer, chief creative officer, chief technology officer, chief people officer, and head of partnerships. Some of those executives were let go; others left by choice. Four of the seven departed in the last two months.It is a significant exodus in a short time, and many former employees describe a corporate culture at the fashion company that is unwelcoming, stressful, and occasionally hostile.Jennifer Hyman, Rent the Runway s chief executive, says that the changes are simply a natural step in the life of a fast-growing startup.  Like any startup in hyper-growth mode, growth often brings change, and with it, evolution in the executive team,  she says.But former employees tell Fortune that the turnover is due to serious problems with the corporate culture at the New York-based dress and accessory rental company. Unpredictable and erratic Five former senior employees, all female, spoke withFortune on condition of anonymity because they did not want to jeopardize existing relationships or, in some cases, violate nondisclosure agreements. Each of them described a stressful work environment that can be unwelcoming and non-inclusive. Three of them likened the atmosphere at Rent the Runway to the 2004 film Mean Girls. Each one made that reference separately, without prodding. The culture is unpredictable and erratic,  says one former employee.  Everybody knew and talked about it amongst themselves, but it was never formally acknowledged. It s not like there were complaints to HR. People were too afraid. There wasn t even really an HR.  The former employee adds that there were  frequent screaming matches  in the office between top executives.Since May, Rent the Runway says, its general counsel has also been its head of human resources. Prior to that, the HR team reported to the CFO.A different former employee says:  You don t feel it s an environment where women support each other. It felt like high school, it was very clique-y. Another ex-employee adds:  As a business it is actually strong. But there s a lot of disillusionment and anger in the culture. There are a lot of talented young people there who are very bright but don t really realize that they re being treated in an unprofessional way. There is a private, closed Facebook support group called  Rent the Runaways  for people who have left the company. It has 96 members and, one member says, it exists because,  Everyone who leaves there has the same PTSD. A model that  did not work Harvard Business School classmates Jennifer Hyman and Jennifer Fleiss co-founded Rent the Runway six years ago as a dress rental site for women. It has ballooned to 850 employees (64% of them female) and has outgrown its offices, creating the need for a recent move to a bigger space in Manhattan s West Village. Hyman, 35, is CEO, while Fleiss, 32, is now head of special projects.The company has raised $126 million in venture capital and will not share revenue, but an investor says that revenue will be between $70 and $100 million this year.Fortune has reported that the company had just $28 million in revenue in 2013, which was 25% lower than its internal projections, and lost $14.5 million. It is not yet profitable.In July 2014, at Fortune s annual Brainstorm Tech conference, Rent the Runway announced a new business: an unlimited accessories subscription.  Very honestly,  Hyman now concedes,  that model did not work. It took us four to five months to fully realize it. When we launched, we got such great PR that it looked like an immediate boost, but it didn t sustain itself. It was a false positive. So we started iterating furiously.  In February, the company added dresses to the program, and in May added everyday clothing.More than a year and a half after the initial launch, the Unlimited service is still in beta.  Under the covers, we ve done 40 different iterations of this program,  says Hyman. The company says it has tens of thousands of women on the wait list. But a former senior employee says that many of the employees had serious doubts about Unlimited:  There have been so many different iterations and they still haven t fully figured it out. It s very much a prom dress rental company, but they re trying to be more, and the problem is no one wants to rent that everyday stuff. Board member Scott Friend, a partner at Bain Capital, believes the Unlimited concept will be the big money-maker in the future.  The core Rent the Runway business, which was renting dresses and accessories for special events, is on this nice trajectory, that s probably a couple-hundred-million-dollar business in the next few years,  he says,  But Unlimited, this subscription business for everyday fashion, is a far, far bigger additional opportunity. We needed a very different team to scale us In an interview at Fortune s offices, Hyman discussed the staff overhaul at her company and answered questions about the culture. The planning and perfecting of the Unlimited platform is the chief reason for the many staff changes at the top, she says. While thinking about the Unlimited idea, Hyman concluded that Rent the Runway can become a bigger company than Netflix. But many of the people who had been at Rent the Runway for years weren t capable of moving it forward, she felt, because Rent the Runway had been their first job. Given that Netflix is a $60 billion company and we don t have to watch TV or movies every day, but we do all have to get dressed the potential for Rent the Runway was 10 times bigger than I ever thought,  she says.  And I looked around at the team that I had and thought that we needed a very different team to scale us. This is not to say that you need to always have people who have  been there, done that,  that s not always true, but you need a mix of people who are Rent the Runway in their blood and then folks who had been C-level executives before, who weren t learning on the job  who have been to the rodeo. Three new executive hires, Hyman feels, have been to the rodeo: CFO Scarlett O Sullivan, a former Gilt Groupe board member and partner at Softbank Capital; chief logistics officer Chris Halkyard, former chief supply chain officer at Gilt Groupe; and events president Maureen Sullivan, a former president at AOL.Former president and COO Beth Kaplan, who left her role in October, is still a board member. She defends the culture and the staffing changes.  Has Jenn had to make some hard personnel decisions? Yes,  she says.  But the only critique I would give her from a people perspective is she didn t make certain decisions about people fast enough. If anything, she kept people around who were not a good fit.  As for the culture, Kaplan offers this:  I think it is a very passionate culture. For example, on a monthly basis, peers nominate other peers for a  core value  award. When asked about the culture at Rent the Runway, board member Friend says,  You re not the first person to voice that question. And it s funny because I can t tell exactly where it comes from. I haven t lived it as an employee, so I don t have firsthand knowledge. But I have firsthand knowledge of meeting with Jenn often, and I m skeptical [of the criticism about the company s culture].  He believes Rent the Runway is  in that awkward teenager phase. When asked about the comments from former employees, Hyman says,  It s extremely disappointing to hear because I care so much about the culture and about every single person who I ve ever hired. This has been by far the most emotional, difficult year of my career.  Asked to respond to the specific analogy of a Mean Girls culture, Hyman said,  I would describe it as the opposite of that. There are no cliques in the office. There is an openness. People feel extremely comfortable with me personally. I have office hours where they can come talk to me. A Cinderella experience During the interview, Hyman asked, Substitute me with any male founder, and would this even be a story?  The answer is yes. In fact, Fortune has written numerous articles about apparent trouble at male-led companies. (See, for example, Fortune stories on: GitHub, Pfizer, RadiumOne, Secret, Snapchat, and Twitter.)Rent the Runway s executive churn has taken place amid growing concern with whether technology startups, especially billion-dollar  unicorns,  are overvalued. In the last two months, Fidelity, which has invested in a number of startups, marked down the value of its shares in big-name startups like Snapchat, Dropbox, Zenefits, Dataminr, and Blue Bottle. Square, with Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey at the helm, priced its upcoming initial public offering at a value far below its previous private valuation.Rent the Runway has been valued at $500 million. It askedFortune not to publish this story because it could hurt the company s ability to raise money.In May, Doubleday published The Knockoff, a novel co-written by Lucy Sykes, a former Rent the Runway employee, about a woman leading a fast-paced, demanding fashion magazine who is trying to keep her ambitious assistant from stealing her job out from under her. In a post on the  Rent the Runaways  Facebook group about the book, one member asked if anyone had read it; someone responded,  Why read it when you lived it?  Another commented:  Read it front to back, it s undeniably RTR. When asked if anything about Rent the Runway s culture needs to change, Hyman says yes that it could do a better job of on-boarding new hires. But the day-to-day work environment, she says, is fun and feels like a family. The first core value we have is that everyone deserves a Cinderella experience,  Hyman says.  And I have experienced a Cinderella experience. And I really believe that most people who ve come to Rent the Runway have had a Cinderella experience.

/article/252714,Startup CEOs Reveal the 1 Question They Ask Every Job Candidate,What's the most important question to ask during a job interview? These startup pros weigh in and explain why.,"The companies in this article were included in the Entrepreneur360  Performance Index.Part of the appeal of running your own business is that you get to hand-pick exactly who you work alongside each day. But let s face it: it seems as if no matter how much you vet each candidate, you never quite know what you re going to get.The hiring process is challenging, especially for newer business owners. Determining whether an interviewee is well-suited for the startup environment is just the start. You must also consider whether they d fit your company s culture and core values, then take extra steps to ensure they d complement your pre-existing team.Click to Enlarge+Image Credit: NamelyThat s why we asked a range of startup founders featured in the Entrepreneur360  Performance Index their top, go-to question for potential candidates. Check out what they ask during job interviews and whether you should ask your potential hires the same thing: What's the one question you always ask when you interview someone? Why? If you didn't have to work, why would you come into the office? -- Gautam Gupta, co-founder and CEO of NatureBox, a monthly subscription service that delivers healthy snacks.Why: I try to understand the person's motivations and interest.I also try to understand where they want to take their career and how NatureBox fits within that path. Lastly, I'm looking to gauge their intellectual curiosity. What are your career goals over the next 3-5 years?  -- Matt Straz, founder and CEO of Namely, a cloud-based platform that helps businesses manage payroll, benefits and other HR needs.Why: Millennials are leaving their employers twice as fast as those from older generations, making average tenure in a job about three years. With that said, I look for hiring opportunities that could surpass that time period. We invest in the employee s development to keep them motivated to do great things because it aligns with their long-term career goals-- which is a win for the company. Why do you do what you do? -- Joe Coleman, co-founder and CEO of Contently, a software business that helps companies build audiences by managing the workflow of premium marketing content at scale.Why: By the time I interview someone, several people whose opinion I trust have already signed off on them, so I m really just trying to get to know the candidate. I try to get a sense of why they do what they do, their background, and what motivates them. At the end of the day, it s really important to hire people who contribute to the culture in a positive way. I don't ask questions; I talk to them.  -- Jamie Siminoff, CEO and chief inventor of Ring, the maker of the Ring Video Doorbell which allows users to answer the door from anywhere via smartphone.Why: I want to socially understand them, learn what their interests are and see if they are a cultural fit. I think asking typical interview questions can be like a game, but social interaction is much harder for someone to rehearse. It isn't so much a question, but rather we always look to see if the person across the table has a passion for their field. -- Aaron Firestein, co-founder and chief artist of BucketFeet, an online retailer that collaborates with artists to design and create footwear.Why: It s important for employees to have a commitment to our overall goal of bringing people together through stories and art. Tell me a brief version of your life story. -- Gabriel Weinberg, founder and CEO of DuckDuckGo, a search engine that focuses on user privacy and doesn t track your searches.Why: This reveals how they view themselves and what is important to them. Their answer can be used as a guide for the rest of the conversation, jumping off from various things they say. What do you like -- and don t like -- about Birds Barbershop?  -- Jayson Rapaport, co-founder and co-owner of Birds Barbershop, a brand of salons that markets affordable, high-quality cuts and color services. The company recently launched a line of hair care products.Why: I learn whether they ve had any sort of relationship with Birds. If they ve never been, have they spent time understanding what we re about? They ve either done their homework or they haven t. If you were given $1 million dollars every year for the rest of your life, what would you do?"" After an answer, I ask 'Ok so you've done that, what would you do next?' and continue asking that until they can't think of anything else.  -- David Simnick, co-founder and CEO of SoapBox Soaps, a maker of all natural, handmade soaps that donates soap products to children in need.Why: Usually the last answer or two shows what the person really wants out of life and tells me what they care about the most. It helps me understand what motivates them. Who were the competitors at the last company you worked for and how did your company differentiate itself?-- Ian Siegel, co-founder and CEO of ZipRecruiter, which lets employers post jobs to hundreds of job boards with one submission and sends job seekers postings via tailored email alerts.Why: I want to determine if the candidate had a strategic understanding of the business. Surprisingly few candidates can answer this question. I am especially impressed by candidates who have a grasp of existing competitors, potential competitors and what a disruptive, new market entrant could do.""Why Shoptiques?""-- Olga Vidisheva, founder and CEO of Shoptiques, an e-commerce destination that sells goods from local boutiques.Why: We only hire people with a clear enthusiasm for what we do, because those are the only kinds of employees who will help you innovate and who can grow with your company.Related: What Keeps You Motivated? 8 Entrepreneurs Explain How They Manage Through the Ups and Downs of Startup Life.Tanya Benedicto KlichTanya Benedicto Klich is a data and lists editor at Entrepreneur.com.Read more",Inspiring Your Team,2015-11-14 14:00:00
/article/252249,3 Tips for Managing a Boss You Don't Even Like,You could quit but why give them the satisfaction?," If you've ever had a job, you've probably felt that your boss is a jerk. They want too much, they set unreasonable tasks and they just don't get you. Yet, a key element of a harmonic work environment and stress-free life is a good relationship with your boss or a manager.If you're a manager yourself, then you should know: 50 percent of employees have quit their job because of their supervisor.Why should you bother?If you have a really terrible boss (the meme material), you may ask why should you even try to make that relationship work. In short, humans are happier when there's less conflict in our lives. According to Towers Watson, of 75 possible drivers of engagement the one that is rated as the most important is the extent to which employees believe their senior management have a sincere interest in their well-being.Also, there may come a time you need a letter of recommendation. If your boss seems bad, there are a lot of ways to make your work-life less stressful and more peaceful. Even if they sometimes are too demanding and act unfairly, establishing trust and partnership is a job for two people.Related: 4 Ways to Defuse Your Anger Before It Blows Up Your CareerYour boss is human.Relationships are based on trust, so it is demoralizing to learn your superiors don't trust you. If that's the case, you can go on thinking ""this job sucks,"" or you can do everything in your power to make your employer understand that you are doing impactful and meaningful work. Remember:Your manager can't read your mind.Your manager only knows what you're doing, if you let him know.Your manager is human.You can try understanding what your manager goes through. Leaders are often under a lot of stress. According to a study from Norway, one of the main reasons for that is bad relationships with their employees.If possible, know leadership s schedules and understand what they worry about. Be ready to offer your support. If you know there are problems, show some initiative and fix them. It's not sucking up if it helps the entire team.Related: How I Kept My Dignity and My Job When Our Billionaire CEO Screamed at MeCommunication.It all comes down to talking like reasonable adults. In Weekdone, I have established a system where I call my boss to lunch at least once a month. We go out, have a good time, get to know each other better (no talk of work there!).If you're in a bigger company or corporation, this may not suit you. If a manager has 100 people working for them, one-one-on-one lunches with each employee is not an option (unless everyone in a management position is willing to risk a severe case of obesity).In here it boils down to water-cooler talk and office communications.Stay professional. All this trust and empathy doesn't need to lead up to barbecue nights or parties. You and your boss still have a working relationship to respect.Don't send a friend request on Facebook or call them to the movies. Stay professional and build respect. This is the most foolproof way to build a relationship that pays off in the long run. Or as Andy Teach, the author of From Graduation to Corporation, has said: You don t have to love your boss but you need to be able to work well with them. One of the main reasons employees leave their job is because of their boss. A troubled relationship with your boss can negatively affect your morale, your productivity, your happiness, and of course, your career. A positive relationship can improve your morale, productivity and happiness which could lead to more career success in the form of promotions, raises and higher self-esteem. Everyone can contribute to the workplace happiness, which means that much too often, no-one does.I say, you should  Be the change you want to see in the world.  Make your boss happy.

/article/251965,5 Ways to Turbo Charge Onboarding at the Dawn of a New Hire's Tenure,"Use personalization to tailor the first few weeks of an employee's time at your company, and you'll be surprised at the level of lasting achievement.","There is an old saying used among mountaineers and hikers:  An hour in the morning is worth two in the afternoon.  That phrase rings true in many parts of life. We have all experienced times when success was based on previously-laid foundations. It certainly holds true for new employees joining organizations. What happens during those early days of onboarding has a significant impact on their subsequent contribution.Related: Personalize Onboarding to Jumpstart a New Hire's PerformanceWhat makes a successful onboarding process? It should help new hires ramp up to productivity fast and boost job satisfaction while maintaining a cost-effective human resources administrative overhead. Making onboarding successful is best done by providing employees with a personalized new-hire experience. Here, personalization means that new hires are presented only with targeted onboarding content which fits their particular needs: for example, materials relevant to their particular job role, department or location.Personalization like this keeps new employees motivated and ensures that their time can be managed efficiently. It is made possible through two separate, but connected, strands of technology.The first strand is the technology that supports the onboarding, tailoring what is presented to the employee according to their needs. For example, it would present the right options on drop-down menus for their particular circumstances and the correct documents for their current stage of progress through onboarding. The second strand, intertwined with the first, focuses on the new hire s behavioral attributes. A candidate s first 60 to 90 days on the job are crucial for many things, including staying motivated, reaching peak productivity sooner and staying with the company longer.This second part of personalization relies on working with every new employee s key behavioral strengths to ensure you meet them on common ground, where they are the most comfortable and productive. The key is to provide a behavioral assessment during the recruitment process, providing a view of their behavioral makeup which will not only feed into their assessment as a candidate but which you can also use to inform their entire career.Related: 7 Ways to Make the First Day Perfect for New HiresHere are five ways to turn that behavioral data into onboarding gold:1. Tailor their training.Everyone learns differently. Why hamper your new hires  chances of success by presenting them with materials that do not fit their preferences? If they find lectures boring, allow them the choice of self-service e-learning. If they prefer to discover for themselves, let them do that with resources tailored to their role.2. Let them find their own way.There is always more than one way to get from A to Z, and your new employees will have a range of ways of managing their tasks. In time, you can train them in your organization s preferred approach, but during the crucial onboarding period, use their core work behaviors to let them reach productivity quickly. Whether they prefer a rigid or a looser method, work with them in their own preferred style of task management.3. Give them time.As with task management, so with time management. Some employees will feel the need for tight deadlines to keep themselves on track, while others will be able to work in a more agile fashion. Again, the key in those early days is to work with the new hire s behaviors to adjust expectations and minimize stress.4. Understand their fit.We all know people have different degrees of extraversion, so why do we so often insist on treating everyone the same? Even if a new hire is an individual contributor, matching his or her preferences for interaction to what the role requires can greatly reduce stress and smooth the early weeks in the new job.5. Work with them.The task of getting the most from a new employee often rests squarely on the shoulders of their manager. Empower your managers by helping them understand the new hire s behavioral profile. With that information, the supervisor can work with the new hire to help him or her achieve.It costs time and money to hire well. The new employees who join your organizations are a tremendous asset. They are also expensive to replace. Take into account their core behaviors in the morning of their careers with you, and you may well be surprised with what they can achieve later on.Related: How to Train a New Employee to Be an All StarCharles CagleCharles Cagle is Infor s senior vice president of human capital management (hcm) development, strategy and operations, where he focuses on building, servicing and supporting high-quality cloud scale solutions within several...Read more",Onboarding,2015-11-10 22:30:00
/article/251623,Give the Gift of Time With a Family Leave Policy,Companies need to help get a child and parent off to a healthy start -- because they'll never have that opportunity again.,"Benjamin Franklin once said,  Lost time is never found again. That is especially true during the very special first few months that a parent spends with a child. After we announced Adobe s new family leave policies in August, the single most common question I ve received from industry peers is,  Will employees actually take the time off you re providing?  At first I was taken aback by the question -- what new parents wouldn t choose to stay home with a child when they are fully paid?Related: Does Your Company Have a Paid Family Leave Program Yet?But I quickly came to realize that there are two realities at many companies, the benefits on paper and the benefits in practice. And some other companies have left the parental time-off policy open-ended, which can make it hard for employees to choose the right amount for manager and peer expectations. Today we announced an expansion of our parental leave in India, building on the changes we made in the U.S. New mothers will get 26 weeks off -- an increase of up to 14 weeks. Unlike the U.S., India does mandate some time off for maternity leave, and the government is considering an increase. We hope that legislation moves ahead. But in the meantime, we are moving to extend these benefits immediately to our second-largest employee base after the U.S.  We hope it will make a positive impact for our working families and advance our diversity efforts as well.Related: 10 U.S. Companies With Radically Awesome Parental Leave PoliciesMy message to employees in India, the U.S. and any of our other sites around the world is this: Take the time off. Your manager will survive, your coworkers will cover for you and business will not end. There will always be a critical product launch or customer meeting, but there will only be one time that you bring this new family member home with you. After you ve taken the time to get everyone -- child and parent -- off to a healthy start, work will fall back into place, and you can hit the ground running.For employers who may be considering expanding leave programs for their own employees: This is one of the most worthwhile investments in your people you can possibly make. It s a gift that will mean less stress and exhaustion for your workers. It s also a gift to the new child, who will have a parent at home a little longer. As a culture, let s all take a step back and remember what matters.

/article/252337,You Can Get Better Job Candidates by Not Relying on These 3 Sources,"If you're having trouble finding and keeping quality employees, maybe it's time to take a closer look at where your applicants are coming from.","Sources for job candidate are not all created equal. There are some talent pools out there that consistently give you rock-star employees, but others that only seem to lead to bad hires.If you re having trouble finding and keeping quality employees, maybe it s time to take a closer look at what candidate sources you re using. Here are three candidate sources that aren t going to solve all your hiring needs and better options to turn to:1. Poorly worded job listings.Most of the time, the description you post online is a candidate s first exposure to the position. Make sure you re making a good impression. If your job descriptions are unclear or don t accurately match the actual responsibilities of the position, you re going to drive away quality talent.Related: To Recruit 'A' Players, Try This 5-Step MethodThe candidates that do apply may not be bad employees, but chances are they won t have all the skills you really need. Interviewing and hiring these employees will drain resources and lead to high turnover. A few months down the road, you may find yourself posting again on the job boards.The better optionUpdate the job description as soon as the position opens. The duties and required skills for a job evolve over time. What you needed five years ago, from a specific employee, might not be what you need today.Before you write a job post, ask yourself what qualities successful employees with that title had in the past. When you include these skills and experiences, give examples of how and why they are required for the position.For example, it s not enough to say a candidate needs to be a team player. Explain what types of projects he or she would be working on with others and what part he or she would play on the team. This will ensure that both you and the applicants are on the same page about all aspects of the job.2. Talent networksEven if your company has been successful in hiring through its talent network in the past, that doesn t mean it s the best option out there. While the candidates who make up your talent network are extremely interested in working for your company, they only make up a small percentage of the actual talent out there.The better optionExpand your talent network by incorporating social media. Just like job seekers who join your talent network, your followers are also interested in your company. However, many companies aren t considering this network as a candidate source. The 2014 Social Recruiting survey of more than 1,800 recruiters and HR professionals found that 48 percent of respondents post job openings on Facebook and only 39 percent do so on Twitter.Related: Effective Background Checks: 5 Factors to ConsiderBy posting about your job openings on social media, your candidate pool grows exponentially. It brings the opportunity to your followers, rather than making them go out and search for your open positions.3. UniversitiesAs any hiring manager knows, having a college degree does not mean a candidate will be a great employee. A 2015 survey by Hart Research Associates found that 58 percent of employers surveyed believe colleges need to make improvements to better prepare graduates for success in entry-level positions.Of course, there are positions that require a college diploma, but that doesn t mean obtaining the degree taught a candidate how to be a good employee. Universities that don t encourage students to participate in internships, complete long-term projects or develop communication skills are not going to turn out amazing job candidates.The better optionFocus your recruiting efforts on universities that have given you great employees in the past. Research what programs or resources they have to help students prepare for their careers and decide if those experiences would be appropriate for your employees. You can also reach out to schools that do an exceptional job providing students with job skills through an internship program. This will help you create a dependable source of amazing employees.What other candidate sources haven t given you the types of employees you re looking for and what are some better options?

/article/252039,3 Reasons You Should Increase Employee Pay Now,"An increase to the minimum wage has already become law in several cities, and a federal bill is under review. But there are benefits to taking action ahead of any mandates.","Minimum-wage increases are happening, whether you like it or not. In cities such as Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle, bills have been passed to gradually increase minimum wage to $15 an hour. New York City has a proposed bill that could raise the minimum to $15 and there s a bill before congress to raise the federal minimum wage to $12 an hour by 2020.But why wait until a law is passed to begin paying your hourly employees more?It s not just workers who are calling for pay increases. A 2015 Careerbuilder survey found that 64 percent of employers believe in raising minimum wage. It s time to put our money where our mouths are. We need to stop looking at wage increase as a bad thing that will only raise costs we ll have to pass on to the consumer.Related: 5 Actions to Take Right Now to Survive a Minimum Wage IncreaseGiving your employees a raise now, before you legally have to, can be a good thing for your company. Here are three reasons you should increase employee pay to help your company:1. It will help recruit and retain talent.The 2015 Jobvite Job Seeker Nation survey revealed that 61 percent of job seekers choose to take a new job because of the amount it pays. If you re having trouble finding the right employees for the job, take a hard look at the pay you re offering for the position.Money talks, and while vacation days and excellent health insurance are nice, it s not going to attract and keep top talent. Consider benefits the sprinkles on top of the salary cake. Unless the money you re offering is sweet and satisfying, potential employees aren t going to care about what else you throw on top.Since it s only a matter of time before minimum-wage laws change, increasing what you pay now will help you stand out to job seekers. Draw in top talent before it s too late and they re working for somebody else.2. It improves employee satisfaction.If you want your employees to perform well, you need to take their happiness and health into consideration. Helping employees manage stress goes a long way in improving their satisfaction and performance at work.Related: Should Tipped Minimum Wage Still Exist?Employers have done a lot to ensure workers are maintaining a work-life balance by offering things such as flexible hours. But that s not what s really stressing out employees. In a 2015 report from the American Psychological Association, 72 percent of respondents reported feeling stressed about money and 22 percent said they experienced extreme stress over finances.Increasing the amount you pay your employees will not only alleviate their present stress, but also help them feel more secure about their futures. The aforementioned CareerBuilder survey found that 36 percent of workers surveyed do not participate in a retirement plan and 28 percent were unable to set aside money for savings last year.The best way to help your employees manage their financial stress is to help them make ends meet. It will improve their productivity and satisfaction because they ll no longer be distracted by financial problems.3. It improves your company brand.A lot of companies worry that raising the minimum wage will mean they have to raise prices, and that will push customers away. Depending on how you decide to facilitate higher pay, your costs and your prices may go up. But that doesn t mean customers will be scared away from your brand.A 2015 report from the Hart Resource Association found that 75 percent of Americans support increasing the minimum wage to at least $12.50. Taking the lead and increasing your employees' pay before it s federally mandated will do wonders for your PR. You could attract even more customers by proactively changing wages because it s the right thing, rather than because you have to.Also, think about the types of employees you pay hourly, such as customer-service representatives and receptionists. These are the types of employees that have significant interaction with your customers and clients. They are the face of your company brand. It s important that they believe in your company, so they can do a great job in making your customers happy. After all, a happy customer is a repeat customer.Related: Chipotle Raises Prices in San Francisco After Minimum Wage HikeAndre LavoieAndre Lavoie is the CEO of ClearCompany, the talent-management solution that helps companies identify, hire and retain more A players.

The question is, how do you know if a job seeker is telling you the truth without resorting to over-the-top interrogation techniques?In the 2015 Jobvite Job Seeker Nation survey of over 2,000 adults, 31 percent of respondents admitted to inflating their skills on Twitter, and 27 percent fabricated references on Facebook.

Spend more time reading resumes.We all know hiring managers are busy and that they have to sift through hundreds of resumes for just one open position. Still, an August 2015 CareerBuilder survey of more than 2,500 HR and hiring managers found that seven out of 10 spend less than five minutes looking at a resume.Related: This Recruiting Hack Will Save You Time and Lead to Better InterviewsGiven the length of a typical resume, it definitely shouldn t take more time than that to read the words on the page. However, more time and attention needs to be given on processing what the information actually means.There s a tendency to use vague buzzwords in a resume in order to establish credibility, but knowing industry vocabulary isn t enough. Look carefully at how candidates use jargon and buzzwords, and decide if it actually makes a clear point.If a candidate says he  liaised with potential clients to foster new sales relationships,  it really means nothing. However, if he says he  developed new sales pitches that brought in 100 new clients,  he s got the evidence to back up the claim.To double check the information that s been given to you in a resume, cater your interview questions to the experience and skills each job candidate has. Ask them for stories of how they used or developed these skills to get a better idea of what their proficiency really is.2. Check out social media.Thirty-five percent of the 2,175 HR and hiring managers surveyed in a May 2015 CareerBuilder survey said they had sent friend requests to or followed job candidates. If it s already been established that job seekers can -- and do -- lie on social media, why would this be a good way to check out a potential employee?The great thing about social networks is that they allow you to dig deeper. You can reach out to people who are professionally connected to job candidates, and ask them to verify information or give their opinions of a job seeker s work ethics.Related: 4 Tips to Hiring The Right CandidateAlso take a look at the types of posts a candidate is making, not to look for inappropriate behavior, but to see their involvement in the industry. If a candidate claims to have 10 years of marketing experience, but follows no one else in the marketing world or never shares marketing related posts on Facebook, chances are she s not being truthful.3. Ask specific questions.During an interview, hiring managers tend to ask broad, open-ended questions to get more than just a yes or no response. Starting out with  tell me about yourself  is fine, but there needs to be more specific follow-ups.Ask for stories and examples about a candidate s experience and skill levels, and listen for specific answers. The more details a job candidate gives you in their responses, the less likely it is that they re exaggerating. Also, pay attention to whether candidates are just rehashing their resumes to you word for word. If a response sounds memorized or overly rehearsed, take it with a grain of salt.4. Ask if they re telling the truth.Most of the time when a job candidate is being dishonest, it s only slight exaggerations. No one but a real brain surgeon is going to walk into a job interview and claim to be one. It s more likely that a candidate rounded up their years of experience to five when it was really four years and three months.So if after interviewing a great candidate you still suspect they ve been less than 100 percent honest, ask them. Let them know that you plan to check out their resumes and references and would like to know if there s anything that won t line up. Giving candidates the chance to come clean gets you the real story and shows you that when it comes down to it, you can count on them to be truthful.Related: 5 Ways to Catch Job Candidates in a Lie Before You Hire ThemAndre LavoieAndre Lavoie is the CEO of ClearCompany, the talent-management solution that helps companies identify, hire and retain more A players.

/article/251715,3 HR Trends That Are Becoming Best Practices,Companies increasingly bring human resources into strategic discussions.,"In today s business world, the only constant is change -- especially when it comes to HR. The human resources department of yesterday, largely focused on mitigating compliance and employee-related issues, is long gone.Jason Averbrook, CEO of the Marcus Buckingham Company, explains here: A hundred years later, a lot of organizations are still running HR that same way; focusing on risk, focusing on compliance, focusing on the transactional side of it, but there s a whole new era, and things like unions and pensions and transparency of the workplace have changed. As today s workplace becomes increasingly transparent, more technologically advanced and less confined to titles and cubicle walls, HR will have to do the same.Here are some of today s growing HR norms and how to embrace those norms in order to grow and succeed as a department and as a company:1. A new business partner.Human resources professionals no longer function behind the scenes. In fact, their in-depth knowledge of the workforce has made them invaluable members of the team, especially when it comes to the decision-making process.A July CareerBuilder survey of 88 leaders at companies with revenue of at least $50 million revealed that a majority of CEOs (65 percent) agree that HR opinions carry greater weight with senior management. What s more, 73 percent say that their HR leader has provided data that they have incorporated into their business strategy.What sparked this shift in the CEO-human resources relationship?    Business leaders are beginning to realize the unique insight that comes from HR and the role it plays in strategic business planning. Human resource leaders make ideal business partners because they have insight that no one else in the company has: insight into individual employees and the workforce as a whole.HR interacts with employees on a daily basis and understands where their strengths and shortcomings lie. This enables them to provide valuable recommendations on things such as skills shortages, succession planning, employee performance and satisfaction -- the list goes on.How to embrace: Allow HR leaders to assist in making internal business decisions by inviting them to offer the  human  perspective -- how changes will affect your company s employees. Including them in these discussions will give leadership the insight they need to make important internal decisions.Related: Man Accidentally Sends Naked Selfies to HR Manager After Receiving Job Offer2. A new way of looking at things.To provide business leaders with insight they can apply toward overall strategy, HR professionals need to effectively and efficiently assess employees. To do that, they need to embrace the big data trend with open arms.An overwhelming 90 percent of CEOs say it s important that HR leaders be proficient in workforce analytics, with 35 percent saying it s  absolutely essential,  according to the aforementioned CareerBuilder survey -- and that s saying something.How to embrace: Use workforce analytic tools like employee engagement and satisfaction surveys, 360-degree review software,and social media to make it easy to track, analyze and share people data that is crucial to the company s bottom-line.Related: 3 Reasons HR Needs to Be Involved in Planning a Business's Strategy3. A new helping hand.Human resources software is on the rise. So much so that 53 percent of companies with more than 1,000 employees plan to invest in HR software this year, according to a 2015 study by The Starr Conspiracy Intelligence Unit.The automation of everyday processes has made headache-inducing tasks much less painful. Where HR is concerned, automation has literally put the human back in human resources by freeing up more time to spend strategizing with the company s leadership, finding and securing top talent and working with employees.How to embrace: Identify which processes or tasks take up the most time and would benefit the most from automation -- maybe it s new hire onboarding or payroll. Whatever it is, choose a system that seamlessly integrates with other HR processes.Related: 4 Ways to Entice Departing Talent to ReturnMatt StrazMatt Straz is the founder and CEO of Namely, the HR and payroll platform for the world's most exciting companies.Read more",Human Resources,2015-10-19 17:30:00
/article/250205,How This Company Is Helping Businesses Find Zen in Human Resource Paperwork,Zenefits benefits-management software might be a busy entrepreneur's best friend -- but is it a benefits provider's worst nightmare?,"						This story appears in the October 2015 issue of Entrepreneur. Subscribe  Human resources, most would say, is a monumental pain in the ass.The volume of paperwork facing small businesses is staggering: Beyond hiring and firing employees, HR encompasses the benefits that attract and retain staffers, like healthcare packages, investment options, vacation time, transportation subsidies and retirement plans. The field also spans everything from payroll management to regulatory compliance state and federal tax laws, as well as reforms like the Affordable Care Act, each with its own nuances and complexities.In the absence of a dedicated HR manager a luxury many small businesses simply can t afford all of this falls squarely on the founder s desk. The impact is enormous. According to nonprofit entrepreneurial advisory Score, HR responsibilities devour between 25 and 35 percent of the average small-business owner s time.Parker Conrad believes this is utter nonsense. The CEO of San Francisco-based software-as-a-service firm Zenefits knows firsthand how time-consuming and energy-draining HR administration can be: At his previous startup, stock research tools provider SigFig, he shouldered much of the burden. We never had enough money or we were always too cheap to hire any kind of administrative staff, so [my co-founder] and I were always the ones dealing with sending out offer letters, setting people up on payroll or signing them up for health insurance. It was a couple of hours per month that I deeply resented,  Conrad says.  I would stop off at Kinko s on my way home to fax in their insurance applications, because that was the only way to get things in to the insurance company. I remember every time thinking,  This is ridiculous. I can t believe they don t have systems for this. They do now. Zenefits, which Conrad and Laks Srini launched in April 2013, aggregates a multitude of HR functions into a single cloud-based dashboard. Employers connect their HR systems to the Zenefits platform for employee onboarding and offboarding, payroll management, disability/workers  compensation, time and attendance tracking, whatever and Zenefits software handles the rest, instantly and automatically completing tasks and processes that can require human staffers days or even weeks to accomplish.No less significant, Zenefits offers its software absolutely free to business customers, generating revenue by claiming commissions from its benefits provider partners e.g., health insurance carriers if the customer chooses to manage its benefits program through the Zenefits platform.What Zenefits does isn t sexy.  HR is essentially pretty boring,  COO David Sacks admits. But arguably no Silicon Valley startup is hotter. Zenefits has signed up more than 10,000 companies across 48 states serving more than 100,000 American workers and as of May was managing more than $700 million in health insurance premiums on behalf of its customers. In January 2014, Zenefits recorded $1 million in annually recurring revenue; this rocketed to $20 million only 12 months later, and Conrad projects the firm will reach the $100 million milestone by January 2016.Band of rebels (from left): CTO Laks Srini, COO David Sacks, Conrad.Image Credit: David FentonIn May, Zenefits closed a Series C funding round totaling $500 million  the largest private or public financing round recorded by any SaaS company since October 2012, when on-demand HR software vendor Workday raised $637 million in its IPO. Zenefits is now valued at an estimated $4.5 billion. This will be the fastest company in enterprise software to $10 billion. It could be the first $500 billion enterprise software company,  says Lars Dalgaard, general partner at Zenefits  lead investor, Andreessen Horowitz, and founder of cloud-based human capital management solutions startup SuccessFactors, acquired by SAP in late 2011 for $3.4 billion.  There are 5 million small businesses in America. They are all held back because there s so much admin work they can t get to, or they have to spend so many of their resources on admin work. What if all that admin work could go away, through software eating it all, and they could be in a position where they could spend all those resources on building great products faster? [Zenefits] will be the entrepreneur s best friend. Conrad s story isn t particularly sexy, either, but it s colored with rebellion. A self-professed mediocre student, the New York native nevertheless gained acceptance into Harvard University on the strength of neuroscience research he conducted as a high-schooler competing in the annual Westinghouse Science Talent Search (now sponsored by Intel). While nominally a chemistry major, Conrad focused much of his attention on his duties at The Harvard Crimson, the university s daily newspaper, rising to the position of managing editor. I spent too much time at the Crimson, and not enough in class,  sighs Conrad, now 35.  I got kicked out of school for a year.  He spent his sabbatical working at the daily Arkansas Democrat-Gazette in Little Rock.  Everyone there wanted to be Hemingway they all wanted to write the Great American Novel. That had never been my thing. What I enjoyed about journalism was leading this, like, pirate organization to sort of screw with the Harvard administration. I enjoyed the  band of rebels  aspect. That s when I said,  Maybe it would be fun to run an organization. Conrad had to finish his degree first, and after returning to Harvard to complete his studies, in 2003 he landed a marketing analytics gig at biopharma-ceutical giant Amgen in Santa Monica, Calif., eventually shifting to a product manager role. Three years into his Amgen tenure, Conrad s former Harvard roommate Mike Sha reached out to propose starting a company, and together they brainstormed a digital investment-tracking service. I really enjoyed my time at Amgen. It was a lot of fun, and I did pretty well. But I realized it was going to be a very long, slow career path,  Conrad says.  I thought,  Man, I will kick myself for the rest of my life if Mike goes off and does this and it s a huge success, and I didn t do it with him.  I didn t want to miss out. If I knew what I was getting myself into, I probably wouldn t have done it, to be totally honest. Conrad relocated from Santa Monica to San Francisco, where he and Sha launched Wikinvest (now SigFig) in early 2007. To cut expenses, they lived rent-free in an apartment owned by Sha s grandparents, located within a gated community exclusively for senior citizens. We lived illicitly in this retirement community for six months, which was the worst six months of my life,  Conrad says.  Every time you drove in, you had to check in with a security guard, and we would say we were there to visit Mike s grandparents. The downstairs neighbors were very nice and gracious and didn t tattle on us, although they easily could have, and the security guards just rolled their eyes. Conrad dedicated nearly six years to building Wikinvest, with projects including a portfolio tracker synchronized with users  brokerages; an interactive, freely embeddable stock chart; and Hurricane, a tool enabling real-time extraction of structured data, like earnings results culled from press releases.Conrad and Sha shared Wikinvest s CEO title and duties during its formative years, but by the time the company officially rebranded as SigFig in May 2012 revamping its investment platform to offer wealth management advice to consumers relations between the two men had disintegrated. According to Conrad, Sha s family agreed to invest additional funding on the condition that Sha would become the firm s sole CEO. Conrad remained with SigFig as president and head of product before exiting in July 2012. He started work on Zenefits the same day. When people ask me what I learned from my experience at SigFig, I always tell them that I didn t really learn anything at all, except that failure sucks, and you never, ever want it to happen again,  Conrad says.  But also, it s the kind of thing that gets you up in the morning. One of the things we talk about at Zenefits is that we want to hire people who have a chip on their shoulder an intensity to prove they can accomplish something, or prove people who have doubted them wrong. I felt a lot like that myself when I started Zenefits. I needed to prove I could accomplish something that I wasn t a failure, even though it felt to me like I was. That s how a lot of this stuff got started. Zenefits is an uncommonly personal startup. There s a reason Conrad is especially qualified to navigate small businesses through the maze of health benefits: While at Amgen, he was diagnosed with testicular cancer, and the experience gave him profound insights into the byzantine workings of the American healthcare system.As Wikinvest s de facto HR department, Conrad and Sha regularly advised employees on the intricacies of healthcare plans, helping identify the most appropriate coverage for each worker. When I moved to the U.S., I had no idea how health insurance worked,  says India-born Srini, Zenefits  co-founder and CTO, whom Conrad poached from the SigFig engineering staff.  Parker was the person who was experienced in all this, and he told me about the different plans. That s where [Zenefits] came from. This should be easier. Small businesses shouldn t have to struggle. Running a small business is hard enough. Conrad spent six months teaching himself to code the software underpinning the earliest iteration of the Zenefits platform before applying to Silicon Valley s Y Combinator and gaining entry into its winter 2013 incubator. He further fleshed out the concept by meeting with insurance brokers, investors and other experts, sizing up an HR market that was highly lucrative but saddled with antiquated, disconnected processes and technologies.Conrad s solution was simple yet sophisticated: an all-in-one, cloud-based tool that enables small businesses to automatically track and update all employee records and data and connect it to benefits providers via the web, effectively eliminating paperwork and its related time suckage. The problem I had at my last company wasn t just that the health insurance piece wasn t online,  Conrad says.  It was that every time you hired or terminated an employee, there were 20 different places where you needed to set that employee up or remove them. Over time, as things changed about them, all of these different systems had to be updated individually and separately. That was such a pain in the ass. [With Zenefits] you have one central system of record like a hub and it connects to all of these different spokes. Companies and employees know there s one place to make changes, and it automatically updates all these other systems and makes it as seamless as possible. Conrad s research also shaped the crucial decision to give away the Zenefits software gratis, with no contracts or hidden fees a model he co-opted from insurance brokers who sell their business customers not only insurance but also payroll systems and other administrative solutions, sharing a percentage of the resulting profits. On average, a broker who connects a small business with a healthcare provider collects between 4 and 8 percent of the company s health premiums fees that translate to several hundred dollars or more per employee per year, and keep coming in for as long as the business customer continues to maintain coverage.Holger Mueller, who tracks the HR sector as principal analyst and vice president at Constellation Research, contends that Zenefits  revenue model is the most revolutionary thing about the company, comparing its approach to Google, which also gives away its digital services for free (then monetizes its accumulated user data by selling it to advertisers). Zenefits is changing the way [HR] software is being used and being sold,  Mueller says.  Traditionally software is sold through licenses and subscriptions, and you pay for using it. Zenefits is making money on commissions. It s a totally different model for monetization. The question is whether Zenefits can retain that model. Some people say they re just doing it to gain market share right now. There s no question that giving away the Zenefits platform has dramatically accelerated its customer growth. Conrad says small-business owners and decision-makers are more receptive to exploring new products and services that don t require them to fork over any cash. That s held true from the earliest days of the business, when he would personally fire off emails extolling the benefits of Zenefits to potential clients (mostly existing contacts within his professional network, including other Y Combinator graduates).It s not just next-generation West Coast startups heeding the call, either: In 2013, more than 90 percent of Zenefits customers called California home and 80 percent identified as technology firms; today more than half of all businesses using Zenefits services are based outside the Golden State and operate in sectors other than tech.Charlotte, N.C.-based Passport, which develops private-label mobile payment apps for municipal parking and transit services, adopted Zenefits in February 2015.  Zenefits takes away a lot of the tedious work and allows me to focus on bigger-picture items,  says Jeremy Hay, Passport s director of talent acquisition and HR.  It s also a much more professional experience for the employee. Think about how you d feel if you were to sign up with a company, and all the paperwork s online, and you can digitally sign all of your documents online. It makes you feel like,  Wow, I m with a company that has it all together,  even though Zenefits is really doing all the legwork. The insurance broker establishment isn t going down without a fight. Late last year, officials in Utah moved to ban Zenefits; the state s insurance commissioner, Todd Kiser, sent a letter to the company calling its business model a violation of state laws. Many states, including Utah, do not allow insurance brokers to offer rebates to consumers to encourage insurance purchases; according to the Utah Insurance Department, free software counts as a rebate. The state petitioned Zenefits to pay a settlement fine of up to $97,000 with 24 months probation but pledged to waive the penalty if Zenefits would begin charging a fee for its software.Zenefits went on the offensive, enlisting the public support of high-profile investors including Marc Andreessen and Academy Award-winning actor Jared Leto, and in April, Utah legislators reversed the ban, updating statutory insurance inducement definitions to allow online companies like Zenefits to conduct business across the state.Zenefits also has run afoul of the legacy HR systems on which its platform piggybacks. In early June, payroll services colossus ADP suddenly blocked Zenefits accounts from accessing its ADP Run HR and payroll solution for small businesses, claiming that Zenefits traffic was overloading its servers and that Zenefits connected with ADP payroll resources in a manner that threatened to expose Social Security numbers and other sensitive customer data. ADP the world s largest payroll provider has cut thousands of their small business customers off from using Zenefits to automate their time-consuming payroll administration work,  Zenefits wrote in an open letter to customers that it later posted to its blog.  ADP did so without permission from these small businesses, and also without notifying Zenefits, who has partnered with ADP amicably since we were founded.  A public war of words followed, culminating in ADP suing Zenefits for defamation. When ADP first discovered that Zenefits  unauthorized activities in our Run payroll system were causing serious issues that threatened service disruptions for ADP clients, we were open to resolving this issue amicably,  an ADP representative said in an email.  However, Zenefits chose to embark on a public campaign of false statements and outright defamation aimed at discrediting ADP in the marketplace. These malicious actions and the refusal to retract defamatory statements by Zenefits led to our initial court filing. The ADP suit, filed June 9 in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, was pending at press time. In July, Zenefits filed a motion to dismiss, citing California s anti-SLAPP (strategic lawsuit against public participation) statute, aimed at preventing the use of legal action to censor critics. I think [ADP has] always had a bit of cognitive dissonance about Zenefits. On the one hand, we don t do payroll we re a sales channel for them for payroll. On the other hand, although people think of ADP as a payroll company, they make a lot of money by taking that core payroll business and upselling clients on all of this other stuff,  Conrad says.  I think what happened for ADP is that at a certain point, their view of us flipped from uncertainty to a decision that they absolutely didn t like us. Who knows? They might decide in six months to a year,  Oh my gosh, this is a mistake, we d much rather partner with Zenefits they have a lot of customers in the market, and we don t want to block ourselves out of all of those customers. Conrad dismisses the ADP lawsuit as  an attempt to shut us up,  adding,  I think ADP expected they would block us, and we would sulk off and curl up in a corner and die. What s interesting is they were telling customers they were going to sue us a week before they blocked us and a week before the alleged defamation occurred. The lawsuit was always part of an intimidation strategy to snip the connection we had with their system. Conrad insists that these threats to Zenefits  core value proposition don t worry him.  What keeps me up at night is our own internal stuff,  he says.  If somebody s going to kill Zenefits, it s going to be Zenefits. We ve got to keep moving quickly. Conrad is working to guarantee that forward momentum by calling in reinforcements. At the close of 2014, he hired Zenefits  first-ever COO: David Sacks, who served as PayPal s COO from 1999 until eBay acquired the company in 2002 for $1.5 billion. Sacks struck again in 2008, founding enterprise-focused social network Yammer, which he sold to Microsoft four years later for $1.2 billion.Andreessen Horowitz s Dalgaard persuaded Sacks to meet with Parker about joining Zenefits over the course of a nearly four-hour conversation at San Francisco s Dolores Park Cafe.  Because this company was growing so fast, Lars suggested to Parker,  Do you need a COO?  Sacks recalls.  Parker didn t want some kind of big-company, corporate-type person who wouldn t fit in with the culture. Because of my experience as an entrepreneur, the relationship clicked. Some tech-industry insiders expressed surprise that Sacks would agree to step into the No. 2 role, let alone that he would enter the HR segment.  When I joined, a lot of people didn t understand why Zenefits would be this huge company, although I think they re getting it more now,  Sacks says.  People don t want to be doing this stuff. They would so much rather have us take care of it for them. That s what makes it an exciting business. The market is huge, and the need is intense. Moving forward, Zenefits expects to carry even more of the load. Conrad says the company is poised to expand beyond HR into IT provisioning for example, automatically creating employee accounts for services like email, Salesforce and Box, then instantly deactivating those accounts when an individual exits the organization. The really cool thing is that all that work for the employer is sort of fixed, no matter how many of these various different spokes it s got connected up to our system,  Conrad says.  If you want to hire someone, and you have one thing you can connect up to Zenefits or a hundred things you can connect up to Zenefits, it s all the same for you. It s  I want to hire this guy, here s when he starts, and here s how much money I pay him.  That convenience is what makes Zenefits so powerful. Conrad has no intention of stopping at HR and IT. He believes the Zenefits platform will ultimately evolve into  an operating system for small business,  auto- mating and transforming virtually every facet of tomorrow s workplace culture. This is something much bigger than HR. All of the boring crap that you don t want to deal with, you can put on autopilot,  he says.  I want to make this something that s almost a new category. It s not an admin tool. It s not really a [human resources management] system. It s a much more ambitious effort.

/article/251477,5 Ways to Help Employees Make the Best Use of Benefits,"Ample benefits are a lure to top talent, yet research shows employees often don't take full advantage of what's offered.","In the ongoing war for talent, more employers are looking to benefits as a new way to attract and retain great employees.In fact, 41 percent of 2,595 employers, surveyed by MetLife earlier this year, ranked retention as the top objective of their employee benefits program, in the company s 13th Annual U.S. Employee Benefit Trends Study.Yet, benefits participation is not as great as it could be. The 2015 Aflac Open Enrollment Survey found that workers spend 10 times more effort on vacation planning and eight times more on selecting a computer than on choosing benefits.What s more, more than half (56 percent) devote 30 minutes or less when signing up for healthcare benefits. That means a good number of employees aren t taking full advantage of the offerings employers have.Here are some ways employers can encourage benefits participation:1. Help them understand what s being offered.To take advantage of benefits, employees need to understand what options are available, what s covered and what steps they need to take.A study published in the journal Health Services Research in May 2013, found a large portion of work-related injuries and illnesses are not billed to workers  comp insurance. In the study, nearly 40 percent of the 3,881 work-related cases examined were not expected to be covered by workers  compensation insurance.It seems the main barrier here is lack of awareness and education. Yet, with the right communication, employees will be more inclined to participate in a benefits program. MetLife found 45 percent of employees said their companies  benefit communications helped them understand the specific services for which they re paying and effectively educated them about options.Educate employees about the different plans available to them. Communicate the role benefits play in overall well-being and help employee understand the specific protections each benefits plan offers.Related: The 25 Best Companies for Employee Compensation and Benefits2. Make plans customizable to meet individual needs.Forty percent of employees say having a wide selection of benefits would make them feel more loyal to their employer, according to MetLife.Provide plenty of benefits options including medical, dental, and vision from leading carriers. Allow employees to customize plans with affordable options to meet their individual needs.3. Offer ancillary benefits to boost financial security.About half of employees experiencing financial stress are looking to their employers for help in achieving financial security through benefits, according to MetLife.Offer life or disability insurance to help employees and their families feel secure. Care for employees  financial future by supporting a 401(k) plan or FSA. Additionally, consider offering other wellness perks like commuter benefits or health club memberships to mitigate day-to-day financial burdens and encourage a healthy lifestyle.Related: How HR Can Communicate Important-But-Boring Stuff to New Hires4. Talk about benefits outside of open enrollment.It s only becoming more essential that employees understand benefits as decisions are shifting from being primarily in the hands of the employer to the employee, MetLife s study implies.  Talking about benefits only during open enrollment is not enough. Communicate to employees about benefits in a way that reflects seasons and life events throughout the year. For example, for those employees planning to start a family, have information already prepared regarding doctor visits and childcare.Offer educational tools and channels preferred by employees so they can stay informed year-round to make better purchasing decisions.5. Make it easy to sign up.Open enrollment can be a overwhelming time for both HR and employees. If employees have to wait too long, don t receive the information they need, or feel the sign-up process is too complicated, they may obtain benefits elsewhere -- either as a dependant or by taking out their own personal plan.Streamline the enrollment process by enabling online self sign-up. Use a benefits system that automatically enrolls employees with carriers using electronic data interchange feeds -- taking extra paperwork off HR s desk. Provide employees with digital guides to walk them through the sign-up process.Related: Pinterest Made a Deal With Employees That Could Rock the Startup World Matt StrazMatt Straz is the founder and CEO of Namely, the HR and payroll platform for the world's most exciting companies.Read more",Benefits,2015-10-12 20:00:00
/article/251248,4 Ways to Entice Departing Talent to Return,The day that employee you wish hadn't quit leaves is the best time to begin wooing her back.,"When top talent leave for better opportunities, it s a tough pill for any employer to swallow. They wish them the best, watch them leave, and that s it -- they re gone.But they don t have to be gone forever. A new survey conducted by Workplace Trends found that more and more organizations are welcoming back former employees. In the survey of 1,800 U.S. HR professionals published in September, 76 percent said they are more accepting of hiring so-called  boomerang employees  today than in the past. What s more, two-thirds of managers are welcoming back former colleagues with open arms.Engagement with former high-performing employees should not end when the work relationship is over -- since organizations receive many benefits from hiring boomerang employees. Yet, 80 percent of employees say former employers do not have a strategy in place to encourage them to return, with 64 percent saying there appears to be no strategy for maintaining a relationship.HR can and should maintain relationships with departing employees. Use these tips to stay on good terms with former high performers and entice them to return:1. Tell them they re welcome back.Open the door for employees to return by telling them they are welcome to come back. Telling employees they have the option is a simple way to plant the idea of returning by letting them know their work is valued. Employees who feel valued are more likely to come back.A 2014 survey of more than 1,500 U.S. professionals conducted by the American Psychological Association (APA) found that 92 percent of respondents who felt valued by their employer said they were satisfied with their job, compared with just 29 percent of those who did not feel valued at work.Feeling valued is critical to job satisfaction, but a survey conducted by TinyPulse in 2014 found most employees don t feel like their work matters. In the survey of more than 200,000 employees, 79 percent said they didn t feel valued at work.Telling employees that the organization would be happy to have them back shows them their work is highly valued by the employer. If professionals feel important to their team and organization, they are more likely to want to work where they feel valued again in the future.Related: 9 Things Managers Do That Make Good Employees Quit2. Keep in touch on social media.Employees already know what it s like to work for the organization they re leaving -- but they don t know what to expect from other employers. This is a huge advantage.In a survey of more than 10,000 professionals who recently changed jobs, published by LinkedIn in August, 49 percent of respondents said the biggest obstacle in the job search is not knowing what working for an organization is actually like.Remind employees about the company culture and their workplace relationships by keeping in touch with them on social media. Commenting on pictures, liking posts and chatting about their new job and more personal topics will maintain the relationship the employer has already built with the professional. That s important to bring employees back on board.After all, 36 percent of U.S. and Canadian employees surveyed by Virgin Pulse this year said they wish their employer cared more about their emotional health. In addition, 19 percent said they want their employers to care about their social well-being.Keeping up with former employees on social media not only helps to build a stronger relationship, but also it helps to build trust and transparency. And only about half of employees surveyed by the APA think their employer is open and upfront with them. Use social media to create more open and personal relationships with departing professionals.For example, use apps like Bond to set reminders when to connect with former employees on Facebook, LinkedIn and other social platforms.3. Write a great reference.Employee recognition goes a long way, and appreciating work when employees are walking out the door will encourage them to come back in the future.In a 2014 survey of more than 3,000 professionals published by CareerBuilder, 79 percent said they had no intention of leaving their current job that year. Among these loyal employees, 32 percent said they wanted to stay with their employer because they had a good boss who watches out for them, and 29 percent said they planned to stay because their accomplishments are recognized.Employees want their managers to recognize and appreciate their hard work and achievements. Show departing professionals their work was not unnoticed by writing a stellar reference letter or LinkedIn recommendation. If top employees leave without a recommendation, don t expect them to come back.Related: Why Do People Actually Quit Their Jobs? (Infographic)4. Offer more.Professionals switch jobs to move up in their careers, not to stay stagnant. To bring employees back on board, offer them more.More may mean a better position and a clearer view of how they can advance and grow in the organization. The LinkedIn survey found that the top reason employees leave companies is a lack of advancement opportunities, and the number one reason they join companies is for a better career path and more opportunities.Boomerang employees act in similar ways. When employees were asked for the top reason they would go back to work for a former employer if pay was comparable in the Workplace Trends survey, employee benefits and better career path tied for the number one response.With a better position, employees also expect a better salary. In the LinkedIn survey, 74 percent of employees said they got more money when they switched to a new job.Offer desirable employees more than what they had -- and more than what they have with their current employer -- to bring them back.Related: What to Do If an Employee Quits in an Epic FashionHeather R.

/article/250897,Zenefits Rolls Out Free Software to Help Businesses Comply With Health-Care Requirements,"With employers facing new Affordable Care Act reporting requirements in 2016, one human-resources tech company is automating the process.","Human-resources tech company Zenefits is launching a new, free product aimed to help business owners comply with upcoming Affordable Care Act regulatory and paperwork requirements.Starting in 2016, employers will have to file every year with the Internal Revenue Service, reporting on the health insurance coverage provided to their employees. If businesses don t report to the IRS, they will be hit with fees both for failing to file the required paperwork and for failing to provide coverage for employees where it is required.The first deadline business owners will face in the coming year is Jan. 31, when they are responsible for having sent out a report notified their employees of their coverage options. The deadline for filing with the IRS is for Feb. 29 for paper filings and March 31 for electronic filings.Related: 3 Benefits of the Affordable Care Act Every Business Leader Needs to Know AboutThe new Zenefits tool, which will launch this fall, automatically generates and submit forms to the IRS. It also helps business owners determine which staffers they are required to provide health insurance for, as reporting and compliance responsibilities differ depending on a company s headcount. If a part-time employee is working enough hours that he is approaching the threshold for being considered full time, the new tool will alert the business owner.Zenefits offers the software to businesses for free because, as with the rest of its human resources software technologies, the company collects commission when it sells services like health insurance to the businesses that use its platform.The San Francisco-based technology company has been growing by leaps and bounds, its headcount surging from 15 early last year to 1,000 now.

Online human-resources platform ZenPayroll announced today that it is changing its name to Gusto and adding services that put it squarely in competition with larger rival Zenefits.For small-business owners, managing payroll and benefits for employees has historically been a painful, headache-inducing process. That s where companies like Gusto and Zenefits come in. They automate and streamline the processes.Related: How to Make 5 Routine HR Tasks Quick and PainlessThe newly named Gusto is adding health benefits and workers  compensation to its payroll processing services, according to an announcement from the company today. At first, the health benefits service will only be available in California. It will gradually roll out to other states.The new name, which allowed the company to expand beyond payroll processing services, is a reference to a feeling of enthusiasm. Our new name Gusto was inspired by our customers and their teams who show courage and passion in the work they do every day. When you work on something you care about, with people you enjoy spending time with, it s an amazing feeling,  the three co-founders wrote in a blog post.  That energy. That oomph. That s Gusto.

/article/250320,3 Questions to Ask to Get the Most Out of a Video Interview,"Video interviewing isn't going anywhere. In fact, it's growing as a way for organizations to reach highly talented active and passive job seekers.","Video interviewing is growing as a way for organizations to reach active and passive job seekers. In a June executive survey of more than 700 professionals by Futurestep, an amazing 71 percent of respondents reported using real-time video interviewing to assess candidates, and 50 percent reported using video interviews as a way to narrow the candidate pool. These results suggest that the video interview  trend  has become more of an HR norm.Related: 4 Ways to Test 'Cultural Fit' During the Hiring ProcessThe challenge for entrepreneurs and HR professionals is getting the most out of every video interview. With that in mind, here are three questions that will provide valuable insight into candidates, and what to watch for in their answers:1.  Imagine this was a face-to-face interview. What would you do differently? In a 2013 study published in the Management Decision journal, researchers found that interviewers perceived candidates interviewed over video less favorably than candidates interviewed face to face.For many interviewers, looking at a candidate through a screen can create the feeling that they re not getting the whole picture. By asking the candidate what they would do differently in a face-to-face interview, interviewers can learn more about how candidates build relationships in person, how they carry themselves and how aware they are of how their communication style changes in different situations.What to watch for: Candidates who are strong in-person communicators may feel more comfortable responding to a question about a face-to-face interview situation. Keep an eye out for shifts in body language and more pronounced eye contact that suggest the candidate s ability to build a strong rapport in person.2.  How would you go about solving (insert challenging situation)? In the end, the candidate is being hired to do a job, and he or she is going to come across a challenge at some point. Use the video interview to find out more about how she would perform in that situation.Provide a challenging task the candidate might run into and have them explain how they would go about tackling the issue. This will help provide interviewers with a framework for how the candidate thinks through a problem and, as a result, may react when presented with a stressful situation in the workplace.Related: Will Your Interview Answers Get You Hired?What to look for: The candidate won t necessarily know the ins and outs of the organization s process, and that s OK. What s important is that the candidate s thought process is logical, sound and realistic. If it s a live video interview, watch for what resources the candidate leans on. Does the candidate use pen and paper? Does he or she struggle to perform the task in his or her head? Does he or she ask what resources are available to solve the problem?When it s a recorded video interview, keep an eye out for fast, efficient answers that seem rehearsed. It s possible the candidate worked the issue out first, then recorded their answer later.3.  Do you work well with (insert various personality types)? Why or why not? When Hyper Island surveyed more than 500 CEOs, HR professionals, directors and employees in a wide-range of industries about their hiring habits in April 2014, they uncovered a new trend in hiring: 78 percent of respondents felt personality was more important than a candidate s technical skills.Nowadays, success means being able to work with others. Even in independent roles, candidates will eventually have to interact with colleagues and managers, which means how they interact with different personalities can have a huge impact on their effectiveness. It s best to find out how the candidate will interact with the different personalities in the office up front.What to look for: Honesty and self-understanding. Hearing a candidate gets along with all types of personalities is great, but is it realistic?Look for candidates who acknowledge their difficulties with certain personalities and know themselves well enough to discuss the challenges they face. Candidates who understand how to approach interactions with difficult personalities and share their strategies for making these relationships work show the kind of a proactive self-understanding that can lead to success in the workplace.The bottom line: Focus on the little things.While candidates are answering these three questions, it s best to focus on things such as body language, eye contact and speaking with confidence along with the candidate s answers. These  little things  are actually big indicators for how a candidate will succeed (or not succeed) in the workplace and can help interviewers make the most out of every video interview.Related: 5 Questions That Reveal Whether a Job Candidate Is Startup MaterialAndre LavoieAndre Lavoie is the CEO of ClearCompany, the talent-management solution that helps companies identify, hire and retain more A players.

But a recent court decision in Europe might actually make some workers want to commute longer.On Thursday, Europe s top court ruled that the time spent commuting to and from work should count as part of the workday. The ruling applies to employees who don t have a regional office to work out of, like electrical technicians, for example.The time spent commuting to the first appointment and driving home from the last appointment is to be considered part of the work day, according to the ruling, which was handed down by the Court of Justice of the European Union in Luxembourg.Related: 10 U.S. Cities With the Longest Commute TimesTo not consider the time commuting to and from a job location work would  jeopardise the objective of protecting the safety and health of workers,  the ruling says.In Europe, employees are protected by the Working Time Directive, which dictates that they cannot work more than 48 hours per week.

/article/249586,3 Reasons HR Needs to Be Involved in Planning a Business's Strategy,"In a job market defined by competition for skilled talent, HR leaders can, and do, make an impact on an organization's bottom line.","In a job market defined by competition for skilled talent, HR leaders can, and do, make an impact on an organization s bottom line. From recruiting to employee development to retention strategies, HR teams are expected to bring data-driven solutions to the table that contribute to and lead the company toward its overall business goals.For CEOs, that means bringing HR leaders into the strategic fold.In a July survey of 88 leaders at companies with at least $50 million in revenue, CareerBuilder found 65 percent of CEOs agree that the opinions of HR leaders carry greater weight with senior management than ever before. Even more telling, 73 percent of CEOs have already incorporated data from HR leaders into their business strategies, suggesting this is not just a theoretical trend, but one that s being put into action.The big question is why? Why are CEOs just now realizing the importance of HR leaders in this competitive-talent landscape? What makes this post-recession economy the bridge for HR leaders to cross over to the strategic business-planning world?Related: How Companies Can Apply Big Data to Engage EmployeesSimply put, it s insight.HR leaders have the insight and data that can help companies streamline recruiting processes and optimize their human capital. They understand the company culture and are already involved in building a workforce that will help organizations meet business goals. Now, it s just a matter of officially involving them in the process.Still not convinced? Here are three key reasons CEOs should include HR in strategic business decisions from now on:1. They understand where the skills gaps are in organizations.The skills gap is a real concern for many companies. So real, in fact, that 48 percent of respondents in Spherion Staffing Service s 2015 Emerging Workforce Study cited it as the biggest issue facing their organizations. This struggle to find qualified talent to fill skilled positions is keeping companies from meeting their full-earning potential.HR leaders struggle with this problem every day. They are on the front lines of the battle for talent, so they know where, and at what levels (entry level, mid level, executive level), the skills gap is affecting their company the most. Because of this, they are valuable assets when it comes to long- and short-term strategic planning.By bringing HR leaders into strategic-business discussions, CEOs are rewarded with insightful recommendations about their organization s skills shortages and how to fix them through talent-management programs and succession planning.Whether it s developing in-house talent-development strategies, building multi-generational teams to help strengthen organizational learning or other customized solutions, HR leaders are in the best position to help CEOs and other strategic planners realign key business goals and success metrics to address the skills gap issue in their organizations.Related: 3 Innovative Ways to Structure Your HR Department2. They can help increase human-capital efficiency company-wide.At a time when, according to Gallup s daily tracking poll, only one third of Americans are engaged at work, how an organization manages its people is more important than ever.Good HR leaders have their fingers on the pulse of the organization and know why and where turnover is most prevalent. They understand that -- like 57 percent of more than 5,500 business leaders surveyed as a part of Payscale s 2015 Best Practices Report -- turnover is one of the biggest issues facing companies today. Because turnover is so costly for organizations, this knowledge can be critical in distributing talent and planning for the future.When CEOs invite HR leaders into the discussion and tap into their knowledge of the workforce, they are better able to take advantage of unique insights that can cut costs, reduce turnover and realign human capital to increase efficiency.3. They can provide actionable data to streamline recruiting.Forty-eight percent of CEOs admit to losing money because of inefficient recruiting strategies, according to the aforementioned July CareerBuilder survey. HR leaders can help solve the problem.Today, more HR leaders are focusing on developing and analyzing company-specific metrics that measure the efficiency of the hiring process in real time. Aided by talent-alignment platforms and data-analytics software, HR teams are now more equipped than ever to provide competitive fact-based solutions to quickly reduce inefficiencies in the recruiting process.These data-driven HR leaders can be instrumental in strategic-business planning by working proactively with CEOs and other executives to solve staffing issues, allocate recruiting resources and build programs that align the candidate experience with business goals.The benefits are clear. With data-driven insights and unique organizational knowledge, HR leaders are poised to make a huge impact in the boardroom. CEOs who take advantage of these insights in strategic-business planning can strengthen their businesses with creative, data-backed solutions to the issues facing their organizations.Related: How HR Can Communicate Important-But-Boring Stuff to New HiresAndre LavoieAndre Lavoie is the CEO of ClearCompany, the talent-management solution that helps companies identify, hire and retain more A players.

/article/249465,Where Marijuana Is Legal HR Policy Needs to Adjust,Drug testing is useless when all it reveals is that a team member 'medicated' with prescription pot at home over the weekend.,"We live in a changing time. After more than seven decades of prohibition, cannabis is becoming legal in more states and countries. Consumers across three generations are finding the plant and utilizing it as a recreational substance, as well as a cure for many different ailments.As of now, 23 states and the District of Columbia allow for some type of legalized marijuana consumption. Whether you agree or disagree with the movement, wide-scale cannabis legalization is upon us.So, how can employers integrate cannabis into the framework of employee relations? This topic speaks to me specifically as a business leader and co-founder of a tech company in the cannabis industry. Prior to entering the cannabis industry I guided corporate structural change for some of the world s top brands.We have long relied on the almighty drug test as the sole vehicle for determining an employee s substance issues, all but ignoring larger and more complex mental health issues. But the  quick fix  drug test is inconsistent, at best, and should never be the sole reason for termination.If we turn our attention to impairment instead of just drug use, it may be easier to ensure that our employees are performing at optimal levels:1: Set strict standards.Whether an employee works in finance or in the warehouse, he or she needs to know what standards are expected. Employees should be held to a level that can be easily articulated, with a metric that can be effectively measured. No one can help you determine impairment if you don t have standards set in stone.Related: Why Your Company Needs an Up-to-Date Marijuana Policy2: Leave assumptions at the door.I ve been proven wrong when I ve assumed the cause of someone s impairment at work is drug related. The actual causes were always something like stress, trouble at home or depression -- not drug use.3: Determine impairment.If you begin to see a decline in performance by any one person, you need to determine what is causing the drop. One evaluation method I like is computer-based testing provided by Valuation Research.  After a baseline is established, employees can be randomly tested to see if their minds and actions are impaired. At one start-up I helped lead, we had an on-staff therapist who would talk to employees, determine impairment and suggest treatment or solution options. This type of testing does not require a humiliating urine test and can uncover catalysts to impairment, like hangover, lack of sleep and prescription medication interferences.Related: How This E-Cig Franchise Is Moving Into MarijuanaStep 4: Take action.If you have determined (from computer based testing or otherwise) that there is, in fact, some type of impairment, allow the employee to explain Give him or her the opportunity to correct the behavior. We give those addicted to alcohol treatment options rather firing them, but we immediately test, label and terminate the medical cannabis consumer.We should be working to empower and inspire employees to heighten performance by encouraging their overall mental and physical health.It s time to treat all employees as genuine human resources.  Random drug tests are not the solution for companies that wish to attract and retain top talent, especially in states like Colorado where cannabis is completely legal. If we wouldn t fire an employee who shows up to work hungover, we shouldn t fire someone for using cannabis recreationally over the weekend.Every person on my team consumes cannabis. Some are only weekend consumers, some medicate daily. Most of us consume for recreational reasons and for medical benefit, yet our company has broken nearly every record in the tech social app space. We all show up to work on time and often accomplish more tasks in a given day than I ve witnessed at many other companies.I see a future in which companies led by thoughtful leaders and HR professionals will look more closely at employees and recognize them as people. I know if someone on my team began to slip in performance I would take them for a walk and inquire as to what was wrong. My first reaction certainly would not be to make him or her urinate into a cup.Related: Voters Approve Legal Marijuana in Oregon, Alaska and D.C.Todd MitchemTodd Mitchem is the Colorado-based co-founder and CEO of High There!, a new social networking and connecting tool for cannabis consumers all over the world.

/article/249594,Don't Underestimate the Devastating Consequences of HR Mistakes,The functional area of human resources is no less complex than accounting. There is a mind-numbing list of things that a competent HR professional needs to know about.,"Too many people think that human resources is a low-skill role that primarily involves paper pushing and can be done by essentially anyone. Nothing could be further from the truth.The functional area of human resources is no less complex than accounting. There is a mind-numbing list of things that a competent HR professional needs to know about, such as the Family and Medical Leave Act, COBRA, wage and hour rules, affirmative-action programs, worker s compensation, unemployment hearings, hiring guidelines and termination procedures. It is truly scary.Related: 5 Vital HR Tasks Startups Must Complete Before HiringIt can be very expensive to get these things wrong. For example, one mistake many small businesses make is to classify a group of employees as exempt (ones who do not receive overtime pay) that should be non-exempt (those that receive overtime pay). In such cases, the result of a wage and hour audit can be financially devastating. In addition to fines, your business will have to pay the overtime that it should have been paying.You may not have to go back many years for this to be a big number. Because you won t have good records of the overtime hours worked by employees you thought were exempt, the auditors will estimate this number for you. Trust us, the estimate will not be on the low side. While the costs can cripple your business, the time spent on the audit and fixing the mistakes can be equally damaging.For years, many small businesses have been able to fly under the radar. This is changing. The Obama administration has put a focus on giving all workers a pay increase. The Department of Labor and IRS are making the rules more difficult for small businesses and have greatly increased enforcement efforts.The chance of an audit is much higher than it was only a few years ago. Attorneys are now advertising on television trying to get potentially misclassified people to come forward. When it comes to most HR rules, small businesses are much better off being safe than sorry, but you can t be safe if you don t know the rules.Related: 3 Innovative Ways to Structure Your HR DepartmentIf you have even one employee, many federal and state employment regulations apply. To make sure your business is compliant, pursue one of two options:1. Hire a qualified HR professional.The best way to know that a prospective HR person is well qualified is to hire someone who holds an HR designation from the HR Certification Institute or the Society of Human Resources. People who hold these designations have passed a test ensuring that they know the rules and regulations.Find out if potential candidates hold a current designation. To maintain this designation, HR professionals have to meet continuing education requirements that ensure they remain abreast of changes in their discipline.2. Get outside help.Many companies need professional HR help, but can t afford a full-time professional. In such cases, hire a fractional HR manager or a consultant. Again, make sure that your outside help has the proper designation and that it is current.Such a person can help your business establish proper processes and procedures to ensure it remains compliant. A less knowledgeable person (for example, an administrative assistant) can implement the procedures. The HR professional will be available to help on an as-needed basis and she or he can periodically review the work to ensure things remain on track.Human resource issues are important. Don t take shortcuts that could cripple your business.Related: A New Wave of HR Technology Is Disrupting the MarketDoug and Polly WhiteDoug and Polly are small business experts, speakers and consultants who work with entrepreneurs through Whitestone Partners.

/article/249308,4 Video Strategies That Will Help You Recruit the Best Talent,"Technology has made it easier than ever to build effective, video-based recruiting strategies that allow companies large and small to expand their talent pools.","If you re not at least considering using video as part of your recruiting strategy, you re missing out. According to forecasts from Cisco s February 2015 Visual Networking Index, video will make up 80 percent of all Internet traffic by 2019, and 67 percent of that Internet traffic will be accessed via mobile devices.What does that mean for recruiting? It means reaching top talent using traditional methods is going to be a lot harder. The good news is technology has made it easier than ever to build effective, video-based recruiting strategies that allow companies large and small to expand their talent pools beyond their own backyards and source candidates from all over the country.Related: 5 Insights for Attracting Millennial Talent Inspired by the App They Can't ResistHere are four video recruiting strategies organizations need to start employing to attract and hire today s top talent:1. Company culture videosOne of the easiest ways for organizations to integrate video into their recruiting strategies is to show candidates why the organization is great instead of telling them. According to Aberdeen's October 2014 talent acquisition research, best-in-class companies are 75 percent more likely to use video tools for employee branding, enabling them to attract top talent.  That s great, but how?Organizations need to produce videos that emphasize company culture. Whether it s showing what the office looks like, relating the organization s mission and values or highlighting its community service programs, using video helps candidates see what really matters to the organization.Once the video is ready, focus on distributing it across different paid and free channels. For maximum exposure, host video front and center on the  Careers  and  About Us  landing pages, share it on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube accounts, and use paid advertising options to ensure active and passive candidates everywhere engage with the content.2. Employee-focused videosGet current employees involved in the video-recruiting strategy. Think about it: Organizations count on employees to engage with and refer strong talent. Why not let other candidates see how much those employees enjoy their jobs, too?Instead of relying on text to get the job requirements and expectations across, use video descriptions to show candidates what a day in the life as an employee in that role is like, and attach it to the job listing.For a truly unique perspective, interview employees about their roles in the organization and what they do on a daily basis to make an impact. Focus on things such as why they love their jobs, the challenges they face, the satisfaction they get from finishing projects and interesting facts about the employee, team or department.Share these video  biographies  with candidates so they learn more about the people they could be working with and what drives them to succeed.Related: 3 Reasons Why Your Hiring Process Is Killing Your Company3. Video applicationsVideo helps with more than just recruiting top candidates, it helps with the screening process, as well. Instead of having to sift through countless resumes -- or worrying that an applicant tracking system is missing qualified candidates -- some organizations are using video applications as a first step in the screening process.In fact, in a June survey, Futurestep found that 25 percent of the 700 executives surveyed work for organizations that use video applications as a part of their recruiting process. Not only do video applications help speed up the screening process, but also they allow hiring managers to evaluate soft skills such as communication style, poise and organization before they ever sit down with a candidate.4. Video interviewingOnce an organization finishes the screening process and moves on to the interview stage, video becomes even more useful. Whereas video applications allow candidates to highlight their strengths and weaknesses, video interviews allow organizations to dive deeper into the things that matter to them -- a key reason video interviewing has become so important to organizations.Futurestep s executive survey found 71 percent of respondents use real-time video to interview candidates and 50 percent use recorded video interviews to narrow the candidate pool. In other words, integrating both live and pre-loaded video interviews into the recruiting process has become commonplace for successful organizations.Video-interviewing software helps organizations extend their reach by getting rid of the costs involved with interviewing candidates who aren t locally based. Using recorded, on-demand interviews, organizations can eliminate both the costs and the time investment necessary to interview multiple candidates at different times.By reducing these costs, organizations are able to efficiently and effectively break down geographical and financial barriers to top talent, thus creating a deeper potential candidate pool.Implementing these four strategies will get organizations on the right track, but organizations need to continuously adapt and find creative -- and cost-effective -- ways integrate video into the recruiting process to successfully attract and capture today s best talent.Related: 3 Ways to Be Constantly Recruiting Star Talent Through Social MediaAndre LavoieAndre Lavoie is the CEO of ClearCompany, the talent-management solution that helps companies identify, hire and retain more A players.

Instead, they could be focusing on the human side of HR, like strategizing with higher ups or finding that next great hire.There s a better way. Here are a few HR processes costing organizations unnecessary amounts of time and money and what they should do instead:1. New hire onboarding.When it comes to onboarding new hires, first impressions matter. New hires make the decision whether they want to stay with an organization within their first year of employment, 90 percent of business owners said in Aberdeen s New Hire Onboarding 2013: A Look At New Hires Report.Make onboarding as smooth and painless as possible by letting new hires take care of onboarding paperwork online in advance. The first half of their first day shouldn t be spent filling out forms -- that risks disengaging a new hire quickly. Instead, they should be learning about the company and participating in their new role.Automating paperwork is key to saving time and money, but here s something else to consider: we re humans who relate best to other humans -- not technology. Once all the dotted lines are signed (preferably electronically for easy data transfer), leaders should think about who will help the new hire assimilate into their role.Assign each new hire a mentor. This person should be more than just their trainer for the week, but rather someone to go to throughout the first several months for questions or advice.Related: 10 Tips for Successfully Onboarding Your New Hire2. Benefits enrollment and education.Without good preparation, benefits enrollment can be a nightmare. New hires and existing employees bombard HR with enrollment questions -- some of which HR might not know off-hand.Take some of the burden off HR by using modern enrollment technology. Go completely paperless and choose a system that guides employees through electronic signup with benefits experts available to answer questions like,  Which plan is right for me?  To save even more time, integrate your benefits system with payroll.3. Timesheets and payroll.Gretchen Gavett s article published in the Harvard Business Review in January shows just how bad employees are at recalling and recording the hours they work accurately.In fact, employees who fill in their timesheets less than once are only 35 percent accurate, according to the AffinityLive study highlighted in the article, surveying 500 professionals last summer. Accuracy improves with frequency. Employees who record their time once a day are more than twice as accurate.For more accurate time tracking, allow employees to record their time electronically each day and make it a simple, automated process. Also, use a time tracking system that integrates with payroll directly. And don t waste time cutting checks anymore -- offer direct deposit, if it s not already available.Related: 10 Questions to Ask When Choosing an Online Payroll Provider4. Time off requests.At many organizations, here s what the time off request process looks like: An employee fills out a request on paper and puts it in a manager s inbox. Let s say the manager approves it. They turn it in to HR. HR documents it and adjusts pay, if applicable. It s a snooze, and a long drawn-out process for both HR and employees.Instead, allow employees to submit requests electronically for faster approval and automated documentation in payroll. Use a program that allows employees to see company time off policies, holidays and how much PTO they have available so they can remain informed to manage their time off more effectively.5. Updating employee information.HR spends hours each day entering and managing employee data surrounding payroll, taxes and benefits. But there s another side to human resources that tends to get shoved aside due to lack of time -- the soft side of HR management like birthdays, anniversaries and performance milestones. It s a lot to keep track of.Who better to keep track of employee information than employees themselves? Create a system that allows employees to update and manage their own profiles -- just like they do with social media. This will help HR keep up-to-date on all crucial employee data, without needing to email or ask in person.Employees feel more empowered, and HR will have more time to do what truly matters -- connecting with and celebrating employees.Related: 5 Inexpensive Ways to Create a Company Culture Like Google'sMatt StrazMatt Straz is the founder and CEO of Namely, the HR and payroll platform for the world's most exciting companies.Read more",Human Resources,2015-08-10 18:30:00
/article/247988,5 Ways to Generate Business Through LinkedIn,Make sure you're taking full advantage of the professional social network.,"						This story appears in the August 2015 issue of Entrepreneur. Subscribe  Let s start with the data: More than half of marketers surveyed say Facebook is the most important social network they use, according to the 2015 Social Media Marketing Industry Report by San Diego-based Social Media Examiner. LinkedIn came in second: 71 percent of marketers use it, but only 21 percent cite it as the most important social network. (Twitter ranked a distant third, at 12 percent.)But here s another interesting and perhaps more telling stat from the same report: While 66 percent of respondents want to improve their knowledge of how to use Facebook, a disproportionate 62 percent want to learn more about LinkedIn. And 66 percent of marketers plan on increasing their LinkedIn activities in the next 12 months. If your target audience is other businesses, our research clearly shows that marketers are doubling down on LinkedIn in the next year,  says Michael Stelzner, CEO of Social Media Examiner and author of the report.It thrills me to see LinkedIn gaining ground. I ve long held that it s the dark horse of the social media platforms and the workhorse of the bunch. If Twitter is where you go to meet people you don t know, and Facebook is where you go to talk with friends, then LinkedIn is where you can meet up to get work done.And everyone is there. I could trot out the oft-quoted stat that more than 300 million of us are on LinkedIn. Or you could rely on your own experience: Doesn t every professional you know maintain some kind of LinkedIn profile? Put it this way: I ve yet to meet a grown-up who isn t on LinkedIn, but I ve met plenty who aren t on Twitter or Facebook.You might think of LinkedIn as simply a kind of digital Rolodex a place to park your r sum  and perhaps network a bit. But it s also a rich tool for generating business increasingly so, in fact, because the network itself has developed ways to make this easier. The platform is designed with networking in mind for our members,  says Jason Miller, who leads global content marketing for LinkedIn Marketing Solutions.  But it s also an amazing tool for generating leads, and the key to that is the data LinkedIn has. So what s the best way to start?1. Nail the basics. Get a few fundamentals solidly in place before you think about tapping into LinkedIn s more robust capabilities. First, optimize your profile, considering: What keywords or terms do your customers use to describe you? The key to a successful LinkedIn profile isn t to describe what you do as much as to describe what you do for others. It s a subtle shift, but a significant one.Also, remember that LinkedIn is a social network the optimal word being social. To start, engage with prospects through sharing, commenting and liking. This is key to building trust and relationships and understanding the conversation on the platform before you dive in with your own content.Finally, establish your company s page as the foundation of your content and social strategy, in addition to your profile. Miller recommends publishing and sharing relevant content on your company page on a daily basis.2. Turbocharge your networking.Consider using Sales Navigator, a premium LinkedIn tool, to make your networking muscles a little more ripped. Priced from $47 to $99 per month (with a 30-day free trial option), it allows you to harness the network s data in a way that accelerates relationship-building with prospects.For example, it will recommend sales leads you should be connecting with on the site; allow you to track updates and news related to people and companies important to you; and unearth mutual connections including people at your own company who can introduce you.3. Drop the generic default messages.LinkedIn prepopulates forms with messages you can use to follow up or network with prospects I d like to connect with you on LinkedIn.  There s nothing wrong with them, per se. But relying on them doesn t signal how much you might value a connection, nor does it say anything unique about you.Noting that you can now (finally) send a custom connection request via mobile, Dave Delaney, author of New Business Networking, says,  Always send a customized message reminding the person where you met and what you talked about. Don t forget the call to action: book a coffee or lunch, or schedule a phone call. 4. Hypertarget your content. The LinkedIn Marketing Solutions suite offers several premium tools to help companies reach specific audiences. These include Sponsored Updates (think of this as native advertising on the LinkedIn platform); Sponsored InMail, which sends targeted emails to prospects but (here s the cool part) only when they re active on LinkedIn; and LinkedIn Lead Accelerator, which helps move your nurturing beyond the email inbox to include site and social advertising aimed at engaging anonymous people who have visited your website but haven t yet shared an email address.How might that last one work? Workfront, a Lehi, Utah-based project-management software company, used LinkedIn Lead Accelerator to engage its website s visitors after determining that more than 96 percent of them popped in and left. The company used Lead Accelerator to nurture those prospects with customized waves of LinkedIn Sponsored Updates and display ads. For instance, for several weeks after visiting and leaving the solutions page on Workfront s website, IT professionals would see sequenced ads related to tech solutions. (Non-IT visitors would see a different set of ads.)The results: Workfront generated more than 640 leads in three months at well below its typical cost per lead, according to Mike Ward, the company s vice president of demand generation and marketing.  The goal of this multichannel nurturing approach is to get more qualified buyers into meaningful conversations with sales,  he says.5. Publish long-form content on LinkedIn s Pulse platform.The Pulse publishing platform offers a valuable way to share your thoughts about issues that are most relevant to your business, because the audience is built in and because it allows you better and greater exposure than you might get on, say, your blog. When you publish a post on LinkedIn, it s tied directly to your profile,  Miller says.  Having your insights and thought leadership showcased at the top of your LinkedIn profile can be incredibly beneficial to expanding the conversation when prospects visit your page. This is especially true for topical issues: In May, Katie Martell, co-founder and CMO of Boston-based marketing technology company Cintell, wrote a piece on Whole Foods Market s attempts at targeting Millennials that garnered close to 300,000 views and 350 comments.Author Delaney recommends using Pulse to repost some of your best content, as long as it fits with the professional LinkedIn audience.Follow Entrepreneur on LinkedIn to stay current on business news.Ann HandleyAnn Handley is the Chief Content Officer of MarketingProfs and the co-author of the best-selling book on content marketing, Content Rules (Wiley, 2012)Read more",Project Grow,2015-07-28 19:00:00
/article/248367,Personalize Onboarding to Jumpstart a New Hire's Performance,"You want your newest team member to be excited, not bewildered.","There is an old Broadway tune that says,  It's not where you start, it's where you finish.  In the case of onboarding, however, I beg to differ with that philosophy a bit.  A new employees  onboarding experience makes a significant impact on where they finish, in terms of their contribution and productivity while on your payroll.A successful onboarding process should accelerate new hire time-to-productivity, improve job satisfaction and reduce administrative burden, most often accomplished by supplying the employee with a personalized new hire experience.  Personalized  refers to the notion that each new hire is presented only with the onboarding materials that are relevant to them (i.e. his/her particular location and the specific role in the organization). When you have technology to accomplish these practical steps aligned to each individual, you free up time for the new hires  first few days to be focused on meaningful activities that accelerate productivity and engagement with the organization.  The keys to successful onboarding include a smooth, functional process that presents only the relevant forms to the employee based on their specific needs. Technology that establishes the proper documents offered on drop-down menus and self-serve portals is important to streamlining the onboarding process. The second key works in conjunction with the first, which is a focus on each candidate s behavioral attributes, to avoid forcing a square peg into a round hole. Using behavioral insights, you can meet employees on common ground, where they are most comfortable, according to their own work behaviors, especially over the first 60-90 days.This data-gathering can be done quickly and effectively when using the right technology. A proven behavioral assessment administered early in the candidate s quest to join your company will provide tremendous insight into individual core behaviors. You can then not only apply these insights to the hiring decision, but also use them after hiring to customize the onboarding experience for every individual.After the tactical basics are completed, your customized onboarding process should include several strategic applications you want to explore to help the new employee hit the ground running.Related: 6 Must-Do Steps to Ensure New Employees Start on the Right FootTraining/learning preferences.Individuals have different preferences when it comes to training methods or learning new material. A behavioral assessment solution will reveal what training method your candidate responds to the best. For example, do they find lecture-style sessions boring, so much so that learning is hindered?  A self-paced e-learning course may be the most effective way to disseminate information for those candidates.Task management.As in the training realm, everyone has their own method(s) of progressing their assigned tasks from start to completion. You ll find some who are sticklers for process, and others who prefer a loose management style. Organization skills can be re-trained over time, but your concern during onboarding is knowing how to use the new hire s core work behaviors to show success and achieve productivity quickly.Time management.Does the new employee prefer to  go with the flow  when it comes to timelines and meeting schedules? Or does he/she respond better to a stricter, regimented approach that leaves little room for error? An understanding of these behaviors will help you and the new employee to adjust expectations and minimize stressful situations.Related: 7 Ways to Make the First Day Perfect for New HiresTeam dynamics.Understanding the new hire s behavioral preference, as it relates to team dynamics, can impact the employee s assimilation into the group environment. Even if a new hire is in an individual contributor role, there will be many opportunities for the new hire to interact with others and participate in team activities during the onboarding process.Supervisory relations.Behavioral onboarding delivers insight into the interactions between a new employee and supervisor. Issues may arise due to faulty expectations, poor communication, or a lack of understanding of the other s perspective. Without behavioral data, the supervisor may be taken aback by the actions of a new hire. But with relevant behavioral data on hand during onboarding, the supervisor will be more aware of situations that may influence the employee s work relationships with supervisors and peers.With this updated onboarding perspective in mind, let s change the words of that song a little bit:  It s not where you finish, it s where you start.  By starting on the right path using an onboarding program designed to streamline the employee s transition into position, plus applying the added knowledge of employee behaviors, you will be much more satisfied with where they finish.Related: Onboarding: 5 Steps to Get New Salespeople Up to SpeedCharles CagleCharles Cagle is Infor s senior vice president of human capital management (hcm) development, strategy and operations, where he focuses on building, servicing and supporting high-quality cloud scale solutions within several...Read more",Project Grow,2015-07-20 23:00:00
/article/248452,What HR Pros Need to Learn From the Rest of the Company,"To be of strategic importance, human resources needs to understand the company thoroughly and apply key skills.","Free Webinar | August 16thFind out how to optimize your website to give your customers experiences that will have the biggest ROI for your business.							Register Now  Human resources occupies a unique role in any company. Unlike other departments, HR has a strong connection to every department, from seeing how each team contributes to overall business strategy to zeroing in on individual employee needs. The modern HR professional goes beyond the administrative call of duty and embraces a relationship to everyone in an organization.It s that very connection and understanding that affords HR professionals the unique ability to act as a  chameleon  of sorts kindly borrowing certain strategies they see working across the org. Because HR chats with everyone, any employee can serve as a valuable mentor.The best HR leaders now enact multiple business strategies to take their companies to the next level. Here are four roles that will serve them well to emulate in their day-to-day:1. MarketingMarketing plays an essential role in the overall success of a business and, although it may not seem like it at first, it plays an equally important role in human resources. Think about it: at its core, recruiting is based on marketing the company and its open positions to job seekers. And the rise of digital marketing has made it easier than ever for HR to play the part of the marketing professional.  How it applies to HR: The global competition for talent has required HR to take on marketing. When it comes to attracting applicants to the company, it s partly up to human resources to market the company s employer brand and its reputation as an employer.One extremely effective way to do this is by helping job seekers visualize what it might be like to work at the company through culture or recruitment videos like this one by Shopify. Featuring corporate culture videos, employee testimonials and photos on social media is an effective way for human resources to market open positions and attract top-tier talent. Related: A New Wave of HR Technology Is Disrupting the Market2. AccountingTo go from administrative expert to strategic business partner, HR professionals need to be financially intelligent. They need to understand the universal business language: accounting.    How it applies to HR: Being well-versed in accounting can help with a number of business practices, from developing budgets to creating proposals. Most importantly, however, accounting helps HR professionals manage performance and identify return on investment (ROI).A knowledge of accounting makes it easier to crunch numbers and measure employee performance based on inventory, sales, customer satisfaction and more. Accounting can also help HR professionals calculate ROI to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of various HR-related initiatives, such as employee development, team-building and wellness programs.Related: 17 Great HR Resources for Entrepreneurs3. SalesWhen it comes to talent, human resources and sales go hand-in-hand. Just as recruiting comes down to marketing to job seekers, recruiting also comes down to direct sales. HR professionals need to understand sales strategy before they can make informed decisions about talent requirements.  How it applies to HR: To figure out what type of talent is needed, where to find it and how to secure it, HR needs to have a deep understanding of the company s products and/or services, as well as various market conditions. Understanding sales strategy helps human resources professionals identify where talent or skills gaps exist within the company and how to best fill those gaps.4. Customer ServiceLast, but certainly not least, human resources professionals need to take a page out of customer service s book. While human resources is increasingly becoming a strategic field, it is a service department, first and foremost. For the HR professional, the customer is the employee and customer service is the HR brand.How it applies to HR: Just as customer service employees strive to meet the needs of customers, human resources professionals focus on the needs of employees (both current and prospective). HR is typically the first interaction a person has with a company, so understanding job seeker and employee needs and how to cater to them is essential. Adopting a customer service state of mind is good practice for today s HR.Related: Improve HR Efficiency With These 5 Enterprise Tools Matt StrazMatt Straz is the founder and CEO of Namely, the HR and payroll platform for the world's most exciting companies.Read more",Human Resources,2015-07-20 19:00:00
/article/248343,How HR Can Communicate Important-But-Boring Stuff to New Hires,To get new employees up to speed as fast as possible avoid being deadly dull.,"In today s fast-paced business environment it s critical to get new employees up to speed and productive as quickly as possible. Especially for large or growing companies where multiple new employees join every week, there is significant ROI for anything that shortens the onboarding process.Then why do most companies  new hire orientation programs fail to achieve this goal? Because often this necessary information is presented in a lengthy text-heavy, slide deck that is as boring as your car s user manual. Slide 1: Vision, Mission, Values. Slide 2: IT and you. Slide 3: Your healthcare benefits. Slide: 4: Payroll. Slide 5: zzzzzzzzzzzz   The newly hired heads are nodding.HR is saddled with the responsibility of communicating dense, boring information: performance review guidelines, compensation levels, employee handbook, etc. They write newsletters, design intranets, produce videos and create loads of presentations. While tedious, much of this information is critical to the employee at some point. And yet, when employees set out to find a particular piece of information they have to slog through a morass of slides to find what they need.Related: Why You Need to Embrace the Big Data Trend in HRTo overcome these challenges, HR needs a method for communicating that is:Engaging: The audience needs to engage with the material. Boring, text-heavy slides won t cut it. Visual presentations with minimal text are the most appealing and compelling.Related: 5 Affordable Benefits Employees Appreciate But Few Companies OfferHolistic: There needs to be a comprehensive overview or map that clarifies the interrelationship of all relevant HR information. To help your audience understand your material, connect the dots so they can see the big picture.Contextual and cross platform: Employees need to be able to easily find the exact information they need when they need it, regardless of what device they are using to retrieve it. Create a fully accessible repository on your intranet or a document sharing service, like Box or Google Drive, with each file clearly labeled so employees can find what they re looking for.Collaborative: HR information is an aggregation of material from a variety of different sources. Therefore, HR professionals need to collaborate with their partners and colleagues around the company (often around the world) to pull this this information together. Their communication tools should facilitate this collaboration. Be sure to work off of a platform that enables contributors to work simultaneously to allow for maximized productivity and collaboration.Modular: In medium and large companies, some HR information varies by department. For example, sales commission structures are not relevant to other departments, and office policies specific to one geographic location may not be relevant to an office in another country. Keep in mind the audience at all times. Make smaller more digestible presentations that are relevant for each specific audience.Maintainable: HR information, like a company org chart, is always changing. It is critical, therefore, that that the communication media used to disseminate HR information is easily and cost-effectively maintainable. Find the right platform that can be updated on an ongoing basis, keeping the information in the same place for employees to access, but allowing the details to be modified by the owner.Now, let s return to the new-hire Orientation with these considerations in mind.Imagine an interactive, holistic map of important HR, finance, IT and facilities information. This map can be accessed in the cloud, on the desktop or from a smartphone. Its design is contextual so that the employee immediately understands where to drill down for specific information. The map uses a collaborative software so all departments can easily add and maintain their information over time. The map s structure is sufficiently general so that it, or segments from it, can be customized to different organizations within the company.A communication medium that facilitates such an effective New Hire Orientation would change the nature of HR communications.Related: Your New Employees Will Want These 6 Things When They Come on BoardTobey FitchTobey Fitch is the head of People and Talent for Prezi, a fast growing startup with over 50 million users and 250 employees, based in San Francisco and Budapest.

/article/247595,6 Best Practices for Managing Unhappy Employees,"To build an effective team, you have to be willing and able to consider and address the needs and concerns of your workers.","Leading a team isn t easy, and it requires specific skills that not everybody has. Even if you have these skills in spades, at some point, you ll find yourself faced with the challenge of dealing with an unhappy employee.If you handle this well, you may be able to turn an unhappy performer into a star employee who just needed a little attention and care. If not, you could lose that same would-be star performer due to job dissatisfaction, or worse, find yourself facing legal action from a disgruntled employee.While it s rare for things to get that serious, it s still important to protect yourself by learning the six best practices for managing unhappy employees.1. Assess the situation thoroughly.Though only a few letters different in spelling, assess and assume are two very different words. Before you jump to any conclusions, take the time to dig in and really find out what s going on with the individual. Find out why they re upset. They could be upset with you, their current job status or another member of the staff. It s also possible that they are unhappy due to something unrelated to their time at work.If the issue stems from something within your company, gather as much information as you can before deciding how to act. But even if it s a lifestyle factor influencing your employee s behavior, don t ignore it just because it comes from outside your four walls. Use it as an opportunity to show them that they re more than just a name on an HR folder.Offering assistance, whether through a formal employee assistance program or other means, will build their loyalty to your company.Related: 5 Ways to Make Your Employees Happier and More Productive2. Don t wait.The best time to address the situation was yesterday. The second best time is today. The longer you wait to address the issue after it s been identified, the more time it will have to fester, adding fuel to the fire. It may not be a fun-filled conversation, but it needs to happen sooner rather than later.Additionally, after confronting the situation, it may be necessary to address the rest of the staff. If there is talk amongst your employees, nip rumors in the bud. A short, concise statement letting other employees know that a situation has been addressed can save you a lot of meeting time and HR heartache in the long run.3. Privacy is key.While the staff as a whole may need to be addressed after the situation is resolved, initially, it s best to meet with the unhappy staff member one on one. This option not only protects you from the employee voicing their complaints for everyone else to hear, but also provides a perception of safety to the employee. They may be willing to disclose their real reason for unhappiness and a resolution may be reached in private, one that would not happen without the confidentiality found behind closed doors.In addition, this privacy will protect both you and the employee legally. Thoroughly document the conversations you have with the employee, as well as the details of any resolutions you come to. Type up your notes, print them out and have the employee sign them to prevent  he said, she said  confusion from affecting your working environment in the future.4. Cool is the best temperament.Working in a hot office is uncomfortable, whether you re referring to the temperature or to the level-headedness of the bosses. It s more important than ever to keep your head on straight when handling an unhappy employee. If they begin to get upset, simply speak gently and allow them time to calm down. If the situation escalates, ask them kindly to remain professional.If nothing seems to help, remove yourself from the situation and allow them space to express their anger privately, without you there. Employees who aren t comfortable handling their emotions may need some time to process them alone before they re able to come back and have a professional conversation.Related: 6 Ways to Improve Your Management Style5. It takes time.As business professionals, we want to fix things immediately. While this is a great attitude to have overall, it doesn t work in every situation. A quick turnaround in employee morale can really drive efficiency and productivity, but it isn t always possible.Keep in mind when dealing with an unsatisfied staff member that it may take more than one meeting to iron out the problem. If someone has been unhappy for a month, it may not be possible to bring the sunshine out from the rain in just an hour.This can be frustrating to entrepreneurs who are used to moving quickly, but during these times, remember that you owe it to your company and your employee to continue to work through the situation.6. Keep records.Above and beyond all else, document your conversations, meetings and outcomes. This is for your safety and the employee s, and it just might save you from a lawsuit. We all hope to resolve meetings with everyone wearing a genuine smile, clapping our hands and admiring our dedication as they tell us,  Thank you for everything you ve done.  Productivity picks up, and everybody goes back to being one big happy working family.Unfortunately, efforts to address and resolve the issues of unhappy employees don t all end this way. Instead of a positive outcome, you may find yourself in the position of issuing a performance improvement plan or laying the groundwork for an eventual termination.Whatever the case may be, make sure to keep records of any warnings given or actions taken. These records may be vital later if the employee takes legal action against your company. As a business owner and leader, it s important to create and keep handy a number of different standardized human resources documents (such as a disciplinary action form) that you can pull from and use on an ongoing basis. Doing so will help you excel in tough situations where clear processes and documentation are key to bringing about change.Not every job is right for everyone. Although it s your job to coach and develop the employees who are the right fit, it s equally your responsibility to recognize the ones who aren t and figure out the best time to part ways. If you can t save a disgruntled employee, it may be time to move on.Have any other suggestions for handling unhappy employees?

/article/247008,Need to Hire? The Benefits of Using a Staffing Agency.,A staffing franchise helps U.S. employers keep pace with a just-in-time work force.,"						This story appears in the July 2015 issue of Entrepreneur. Subscribe  While recovery from the Great Recession is well underway, in its wake there have been socioeconomic shifts that seem to signal permanent change.Home ownership is at its lowest rate in 20 years, and many young Americans are choosing to become lifetime renters. Before the recession, the savings rate averaged 2.5 percent. Now it has more than doubled. And even though all 8.7 million jobs lost have bounced back, perhaps the biggest change is in the way companies and many workers view employment.One of the big shifts? Employers are using staffing firms to fill job openings instead of hiring people directly. Imagine a company with an internal work force of 500 employees who had to shed 300 of them during the recession,  notes Jason Leverant, president and COO of AtWork Group, a Knoxville, Tenn.-based multispecialty staffing franchise that has experienced boom times in the past few years.  As the economy returns, and they need more employees, they are skeptical of going back up to 500. They ask,  Is this economy going to hold? The solution, Leverant says, is hiring through a staffing agency.  They lean on us. If they shed bodies, it s on us. It s now more of a just-in-time work force that follows the ebb and flow of industries. Now, post-recession, that s a huge value for employers. It s also a huge value for AtWork, which has more than doubled its unit count to 75 since the end of the recession. System revenue has increased from $66 million in 2009 to more than $164 million in 2014, with expectations that this year the company will pass the $200 million mark.We enlisted Leverant to fill us in on the big business of temporary staffing.Why wouldn t a company handle its own hiring and firing?Being an employer has gotten a lot harder. In 1900 there were two employment laws. In 1980 there were 125. Now there are 2,200 different laws or clauses that employers have to comply with. They now face the Affordable Care Act, workers  comp, health insurance, paid sick leave and the EEOC (Equal Employment Opportunity Commission). There can be multimillion-dollar penalties for noncompliance. They want to shift direct and potential risk away from the company.We re a separate employer of record, and our clients see the true value and time savings of using a staffing firm instead of putting everything on their HR staff.What s different about AtWork?We started in 1986, then began franchising in 1992 as four different concepts: a medical, a general personnel, a senior care and an executive search franchise.We realized during the recession that to survive, our franchisees needed to be diversified, and those with a hand in enough industries could weather the storm better. So in 2011 we consolidated our franchises, and now franchisees can add those highly developed secondary programs for just a training fee. That has made us stand out, and we ve seen phenomenal feedback from our franchisees and clients in the field. We re in the best position now in the brand s history.How do employees feel about working for staffing agencies?It s not just employers who are driving these changes. People in the work force today have a different viewpoint about temporary staffing than they used to. Everybody wants everything on demand now, and it s the same in staffing. It s a shift in lifestyles. Some people like to come in and work on temporary assignments, to say,  This is where I want to work and when I want to work.  With the skills gap opening up there s a demand for all different types of skilled workers.Do you believe the growth in your industry will continue?U.S. employers have seen a structural shift. We thought maybe it was a blip and when things recovered it would go back to normal. But we ve seen five years of growth in staffing. Our customers vary from Fortune 100 companies to mom-and-pop shops with one or two heads that don t want to deal with employment law. Things are not going back to the way they were.Jason DaleyJason Daley lives and writes in Madison, Wisconsin.

They take time to write -- and time is precious for businesses.On the other hand, job descriptions can be very useful. Job descriptions are the result of analysis -- the process of identifying and determining the particular duties and requirements and the relative importance of these duties for a given position. Once you have determined the duties and requirements you can write a job description, but you can also use the document to:1. Write job ads and interview questions.The first step in finding the right employee is to know what you need. Performing job analysis and writing a job description will help you to determine exactly what skills, experience, cognitive capabilities and behaviors you want in your new employee. Once you have determined these specifics, you can use them to write your job ad and interview questions.Related: Improve HR Efficiency With These 5 Enterprise Tools2. Develop new employee orientation.Fully understanding the job duties can help you to make sure that nothing is left out when you put together the orientation plan for your new hire. The job description provides you a list of essential and secondary duties. It gives you a complete picture. It will prompt you to remember the daily tasks and those that are performed less frequently as well as the individuals the employee will interact with.3. Create training and development specific to the needs of the job.What do you need to teach your employee to do? You know the skills your employee has. A job description outlines the skills required by the job. What better way to identify gaps between the two? What skills or experience does the employee need to acquire to be able to move into another job? Job descriptions can help you to identify development needs.4. Determine compensation and other rewards.Before you can decide how much you should pay for a particular position, you need to know what is required to perform the job. Job analysis will help you think through education requirements, specific skills and licenses, levels and length of experience. All of these effect compensation. Related: You Can Know What Employees Are Doing Without Being Big Brother5. Manage performance.Managing employee performance is easier if you have thought through the job requirements. In addition, many job descriptions will list performance expectations. For example, you may write that the employee will answer the phone, within three rings, using a specific greeting and a pleasant voice.6. Decrease liability.The Americans with Disabilities Act, The Family Medical Leave Act, The Fair Labor Standards Act and Worker s Compensation all rely on knowing what an employee must be able to do and/or under what conditions they work. These include, but are not limited to, essential job functions, when an employee can return to work from an injury or illness, whether a job is exempt and what physical or environmental conditions the employee can expect to experience on the job. Having your jobs documented can help to protect the organization and give guidance to employees and their physicians when necessary.While you are not required to have written job descriptions, doing so can make many of the human resources aspects of running your small business easier. If you need help, look for an experienced HR professional who can assist you in the process.Related: 10 Ways to Grow Leaders in Your BusinessDoug and Polly WhiteDoug and Polly are small business experts, speakers and consultants who work with entrepreneurs through Whitestone Partners.

/article/246700,Improve HR Efficiency With These 5 Enterprise Tools,What model will you choose for your enterprise resource planning software suite?,"Free Webinar | August 16thFind out how to optimize your website to give your customers experiences that will have the biggest ROI for your business.							Register Now  Enterprise resource planning (ERP) has consistently opened up new doors for businesses around the globe. We are now living at a point in time where finance, logistics, customer relationships and human resources are all tied into a simple platform.Related: A New Wave of HR Technology Is Disrupting the MarketThat platform extrapolates all related data and organizes it in a way that lets each department make decisions that play well into a number of particular strategies. Though ERP has all these intriguing applications, let s narrow our focus here to human resources.By using the latest technology in human capital management (HCM, a component of ERP), organizations can plan and execute strategies that can raise productivity through proper  management  of employees, if ever such a thing were imaginable.By coming as close as possible to quantifying the amount of knowledge, talent, experience, training and skill an employee has, ERP makes it easier to more expertly assign roles and responsibilities to the right people and make better hiring decisions to fill these areas' gaps.Now that you have an idea of ERP's relevance and significance on the human resources scene, next consider the five major tools that help implement and apply HCM.1. Microsoft Dynamics AXMicrosoft's tradition of acquiring other companies for their intellectual property led to its acquisition of Dynamics AX. Originally known as  Axapta, Dynamics AX has added many different modules on top of the software that allows it to function in almost any mid-market-to-large-tier business setting. Human resources was among the core functionalities found in Axapta 2.5 (the last version of the software) that it has kept and improved drastically.As part of the software, you get an interface that allows you to quickly sift through employment histories, medical information, certificates, courses and equipment on loan. Employees can also  self-service  by registering for courses and tracking their own performance.2. Workday HCMThere are many companies out there operating on tight margins and massive overhead within their supply chains. But wherever there exists little room for improvement, the talent behind the operation makes all the difference. Any firm working in the consumer products segment knows that trimming inefficiency in its workforce is probably the only way to squeeze out a bit more productivity when there is no other solution in sight.Workday s HCM software makes the effort of sorting out workforce issues much easier, with its human resources-oriented ERP package. Workday offers platforms for talent management, recruiting, payroll, time management and workforce planning, with complete metrics.Related: 4 Technologies That Free HR to Work With People Instead of Just Their Paperwork3. Epicor HCMEpicor s platform takes employee management to a level that seems to take the pages of an HR handbook and say, Let s plop some software on it to make it simpler.  Employees can request time off, manage their own goals and maintain competency profiles. Employers can track absences and hours worked and modify policies and budget from a single interface.4. Infor HCMFor those operating within the United States and Canada, Infor offers a suite of applications that not only provides effective payroll management, scheduling and more complex HR solutions, but also ensures compliance with a variety of regulations, including those governing tips.Enterprises operating outside these countries can benefit from a global HR module that comes with the added benefit of implementation through either a managed services infrastructure (for those who wish to forego the added cost of having a dedicated IT staff) or the decision to run Amazon s EC2 under an IaaS.5. SAP HCM with Panaya s AutomationThere can be no discussion about ERP without mentioning SAP, the mothership of ERPs that all other platforms secretly admire. According to that company s benchmarks, its HR solutions result in an average 32 percent reduction of employees while increasing revenue per worker by up to 20 percent. In addition to providing all of the workforce planning, talent management, task management and payroll software that a company needs to empower its employees, SAP s upgrade process is fully automated.Enterprise automation solutions like the one Panaya offers for SAP testing make it much easier to change the structure of the system without running the risk of breaking the platform. In a way, it is the cruise control of ERP maintenance, and a must-have for businesses that need the most up-to-date modules.By leaving all the tedious work of bug tracking and code cleansing to the magic of automation, there will be plenty of capital lying around to focus on more critical endeavors.The choices are endless, but a few are worthy.When the time comes to make a decision on a proper HR deployment, nothing is more frustrating than sticking to a piece of software that doesn t agree with the way things are done in your neck of the woods. In the end, the choice you make has to match your business model, as opposed to the model matching the ERP suite.Related: 5 Ways HR Technology Can Improve Performance ReviewsRohan AyyarRohan Ayyar works at E2M, a premium digital marketing firm specializing in creative content strategy, web analytics and conversion rate optimization for startups.

/article/246948,How Long Does it Take to Decide on a Job Candidate? The Answer May Surprise You.,Hint: Most people interviewing for a job have more than a minute to make a good impression -- but not much more.,"It's no secret that first impressions are powerful, particularly in the setting of a job interview. But just how much time does it actually take a hiring manager to measure up an employee and make a decision?According to a recent study published in the Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology, the answer is not much   but perhaps more than you were expecting.Related: 4 Tips That Will Boost Your Chances of Landing That InterviewThe study involved setting up interviews between 166 interviewers and nearly 700 undergrad and master's students at a U.S. university. All of the student participants were in the process of applying for real jobs. The interviews were each 30 minutes long. According to the findings, the majority of interviewers (60 percent) said they had made their decision within the first 15 minutes of the interview. Of that group, nearly 26 percent made theirs in the first five minutes. Only 5 percent actually made their decision in the first minute.Related: 5 Huge Resume Blunders -- and How to Avoid ThemThe rest of the interviewers (40 percent) said they were able to come to a decision after 15 minutes or after the interview was over. So, for the job seekers out there, if you're concerned that you're somehow doomed from the moment you sit down, it seems that statistically, that isn't the case.The researchers also found that the structure of the interview could also factor into the decision making process. If you have a list of questions that you pose to every applicant, that kind of set up can lead to a slower conclusion. Meanwhile, a more conversational, informal style of interview that is more about developing a rapport can lead to faster decisions.Related: 3 Questions to Ask Every Job Candidate You InterviewThe professors hold that veteran interviewers are more likely to make faster decisions about a candidate than their less practiced counterparts. However, those less experienced interviewers could also be influenced in their decision by the rapport they've built with the applicant.They also noticed that interviewers take longer to decide about applicants earlier in the process than at the end. Their recommendation for businesses looking to hire was to keep the number of consecutive interviews to four to prevent that kind of snap judgment burnout.

/article/246667,You Can Know What Employees Are Doing Without Being Big Brother,Distractions are epidemic and surveillance is bad for morale. The solution is engaged leadership.,"With a whopping 68 percent of U.S. workers not engaged in their jobs, according to a 2014 Gallup study of 80,837 adults, it s important for employers to stay on top of individual productivity. Thanks to modern technology, it s easier than ever to track employees while at work. The question is, how can employers track employee productivity without becoming Big Brother?There s a fine line between monitoring employee productivity and micromanaging. A 2014 Accountemps survey revealed that, of the 59 percent of employees who reported working for a micromanager at some point, 55 percent said it hurt their productivity. No employee wants to work for Big Brother, and no manager wants to be Big Brother.To avoid being known as the office control freak, here are four do s and don ts for tracking employee productivity:1. Track individual performance.How well a business performs comes down to how well employees perform. With that in mind, tracking individual performance is essential. Consider meeting with employees in a casual, one-on-one setting to get a better idea of how they are performing and the progress they ve made toward their work goals.      Don t track time. Tracking individual performance is one thing; tracking hours and days is another. Time-tracking tools measure the amount of time employees spend on particular tasks and projects -- not the quality of their work or the results of time spent. Performance should be measured in work done well and deadlines met, not how long it took to get the job done.Related: 3 Tips for Legally and Ethically Monitoring Employees Online2. Stay visible.What keeps employees from reaching peak performance? They could be distracted. In fact, a CareerBuilder study of 2,100 hiring managers and 3,000 employees released last year found that texting, office gossip, the Internet and social media are among the top distractions thwarting employee productivity.Being more visible to employees, from spending more time on the office floor to friending employees on social media, can help deter time-wasting activities like these.      Do trust employees to get the job done. Hovering over their shoulders gives the impression of a lack of trust. And with nearly 60 percent of workers polled in a 2014 Interaction Associates survey believing their organization lacks trust, it s time to stop hovering and start believing in success.  3. Use tech to monitor performance.When used right, technology can help employers and employees keep track of individual performance. Implementing tech tools, like 360-degree performance management software, can give employers a full picture of employee performance, without employers looking like Big Brother.  Don t use tech to monitor individual email, Internet and social media use, however. These are more personal platforms that have less to do with how employees work. Monitoring these things can make the workplace feel a lot less safe and a lot more restricting.If Internet and social media use become a problem, have employees use apps, like the Chrome extension StayFocusd, designed to limit the amount of time employees can spend on familiar time-wasting websites while at work.Related: Distracted and Overwhelmed Employees Are Costing You Big. Try These 3 Fixes.4. Motivate employees.The key to not being Big Brother is creating a work environment and culture that motivates and engages employees, so employers don t have to constantly track employee productivity. Empower employees by giving them ownership over their work. When employees understand how their work efforts contribute to the big picture, they ll be more motivated to work toward their individual goals.    Do make performance reviews less about employee performance and more about goal setting and employee development. Avoid discouraging reviews that only focus on what an employee is doing wrong. Spend more time focusing on the solution, not the problem.Related: To Motivate Employees, Find a Balance Between Job Enrichment and Job Enlargement Matt StrazMatt Straz is the founder and CEO of Namely, the HR and payroll platform for the world's most exciting companies.Read more",Employee Motivation,2015-06-01 20:00:00
/article/246781,This Business Owner Is Paying for His Employees' Kids to Go to College,The co-founder and CEO of bulk shopping app Boxed put his own money on the line to be able to provide for his corporate family as his own.,"When Chieh Huang was in first grade, his class went on a field trip to the aquarium. The teacher had asked parents to give their children a few dollars for souvenirs. Huang was the only child who brought none; his parents couldn t afford to spare any. A trip chaperone bought him a 25-cent purple eraser. He treasured it for years and years.The purple eraser is one reason that Huang, the co-founder and CEO of bulk shopping app Boxed, just set up a fund with his own personal assets to pay for the college tuition of all of his employees  children. Education is what gave him the opportunity to make his life better; he wants to be sure that everyone who works for him can provide the same opportunity for their children. The overall theme is upward mobility. I came from extremely humble beginnings. I really want these folks to know no matter what you do for us -- it could be literally down to cleaning the kitchen and cleaning the bathroom all the way to if you are a VP level person -- I really want people to experience that upward mobility that my family has,  he says.Huang s mother and father were Taiwanese immigrants who struggled to get good jobs in the U.S. because they weren t fluent in English. When Huang was young, his mother worked as a cashier as a Chinese food restaurant and his father, unemployed for long stretches of time, would work on the weekends selling everything from stationery to sporting goods equipment to make ends meet. Despite his modest upbringing, Huang graduated from Johns Hopkins University, funded by a patchwork of private loans, federal financial aid and scholarship money, and later went on to Fordham Law School.Related: What Inspires Entrepreneurs to Work as Hard as They DoHuang, who is now 33, worked as a corporate attorney before he was the CEO of gaming company Astro Ape, which was bought by Zynga. After the acquisition, Huang was the director of Zynga Mobile New York before he went on to found Boxed.  For Huang, any little bit he can do to help someone else go to college is worth it.  If I didn t go to college or if I didn t have the education that I did, it would be very difficult for me to do what I do now,  he says.  I also realize that a lot of folks can t afford college and if they don t go to college this generation, then future generations might not be able to go as well. How do we break that cycle? And that is what I really want to do here,  says Huang.The non-profit foundation is, so far, being funded exclusively from Huang s own pocket. He has put several hundred thousand dollars of cash into the fund, which is worth between $1 and $2 million, and the rest is his own Boxed stock. The college tuition payment is available to the children of the 60 full-time Boxed.com employees. Currently, there are 12 children eligible for the tuition payment reimbursement.The first beneficiary of the college tuition program will be the son of employee Joseph Bobko, the Head of Logistics of one of the Boxed warehouses. Bobko s son had a surgery that wasn t covered by insurance and to pay for it, Bobko had to dip into the son s college fund. With Huang s fund, Bobko s son will receive $20,000 to be able to go to college this fall.Joseph and Wendy Bobko, with their son Mark.Image credit: BoxedRelated: Secrets to Being Both an Executive and a MomHuang s expectation is that as the company grows, and the pool of eligible employee children grows, so too will the value of the fund. If the growth of Boxed so far is any indication, then Huang s prediction might be reasonably safe. In November of 2013, Boxed was four guys in a windowless conference room. They upgrade to Huang s garage. And only 18 months later, the Edison, N.J.-based company has 60 full-time employees, a total headcount of 100, and a national footprint. The majority of Boxed customers are between the ages of 25 and 44 and while Huang and his co-founders initially came up with the concept for city dwellers without the ability to get to a Costco, Sam s Club or other big-box retail store, the ecommerce company has been really popular among people who live in exceptionally rural areas, for whom getting to a Costco-like store would be a long drive.In addition to paying forward his own success, Huang also says he was inspired to create the college fund is to keep employees committed to the company over the long term.  After starting a few companies now and being in technology for a little bit, I have realized that my skillset is a very strange skillset in that I can t do anything without anyone else. I am not like an artist where I can stand on the street and make beautiful art, me, alone in an apartment. I have realized that I am literally nothing -- and in terms of every CEO on the planet -- they are literally nothing if everyone walked out the door and no one believed in them,  he says.Just as he needs his employees to believe in him, Huang also expects his investors to believe in him, too. So far, Boxed has received more than $30 million in venture funding from some of the most reputable firms in the business, including GGV Capital, First Round Capital and Peter Thiel's Founders Fund. Some of Boxed s current investors have volunteered to put personal and fund money into the college program and all future investors in Boxed.com will be asked to contribute to the college fund too, says Huang.  Huang knows that not all entrepreneurs and small-business owners will be able to follow in his footsteps of paying for the college of all of his employee s children. But he does hope that his action will be an inspiration for other business owners to reconsider what they might be able to do for their employees. It doesn t have to be as huge,  he says. It s all relative, and I absolutely think there is something that they can do. Hopefully, they are going to find that it s the right thing to do.

/article/246556,4 Ways to Get Truly Honest Feedback From Employees,"While positive feedback encourages people to continue doing what they do well, it's the constructive feedback that helps people -- and businesses -- grow.","Getting employees to give honest feedback can be like pulling teeth. After all, no one wants to upset their boss with complaints, criticism or suggestions. But just like employees, employers need to hear the good, the bad and the ugly.While positive feedback encourages people to continue doing what they do well, it s the constructive feedback that helps people -- and businesses -- grow.Related: How to Find Out What's Really Happening in Your OrganizationEliciting honest, constructive feedback from employees can be difficult, but not impossible. Instead of outdated employee grievance systems that don t work, here are four ways employers can gain better insight through honest employee feedback:1. Ditch the suggestion box.The anonymous aspect of the stereotypical suggestion box encourages employees to give their two cents because there s no fear of retribution. But that fear shouldn t be present if a company has successfully developed a culture based on open communication and an ownership mentality. Employees should feel empowered and realize they have a stake in the success (or lack thereof) of the organization.Instead, embrace transparency, just like marketing agency Quirk. Quirk created a public process -- in the form of a flow chart on the office wall -- that allows anyone in the company to suggest ideas, gather support for those ideas (through signatures) and potentially have them implemented. Suggestion boxes keep ideas and suggestions hidden, rather than empowering employees to voice their opinions, as Quirk s flowchart method does.    2. Ask insightful questions.Having an open-door policy is great, but it doesn t always motivate employees to come forward with their comments, suggestions or concerns. The key to bringing out truly honest feedback from employees is to take the time to meet with them in an informal, one-on-one setting.Knowing what to ask employees during individual meetings, whether they re performance check-ins, lunches or exit interviews, is crucial to drawing out honest, actionable feedback. Asking questions such as these can help employers gain better insight:If you were in my shoes, what would you change tomorrow? Why?What are you hearing clients (or customers) say about our business?What do you enjoy most about your job? Least?How can I help you be more successful?Related: Treat Your Employees Well -- They Are Your Best Brand Ambassadors3. Assign feedback coaches.It s one thing to receive feedback from a boss, but it s another thing entirely to give feedback to a boss. The key to getting candid opinions from employees might just be to allow employees to choose who they give that feedback to.Take The Motley Fool, for example. The multimedia financial-services company found a way to take the intimidation factor out of the feedback process. Instead of having employees report to their boss when it comes time to give or take feedback, they encourage employees to choose from a list of designated  feedback coaches. These coaches are well-versed in handling employee feedback and, most important, take some of the fear out of the review process. Designating a select few to handle employee grievances could be the key to eliciting honest, constructive feedback on everything from management issues to business solutions.4. Follow up with employees.In the end, how employers elicit employee feedback is irrelevant if they don t follow up with employees. When it comes to giving employers constructive feedback, the greatest motivator is to show employees their feedback is being considered or, better yet, applied. Employers can bet that once an employee has taken the time to give their opinion on a matter, they ll be watching to see if their opinion is truly valued.Even if an idea or suggestion remains just that, follow up with employees and let them know that their feedback is always appreciated and encouraged.

/article/246483,3 Innovative Ways to Structure Your HR Department,How to attract and retain the team you need is evolving as rapidly as the rest of the business world.,"Nikki has recently been hired as the new human resources director for a budding tech startup that is scaling up rapidly. It s an exciting time: What started as just a few dots on a tiny organizational chart has quickly ballooned into multiple sections and departments.As the startup grows, so does its need for a designated HR department. That s where Nikki comes in. She must determine how activities within the HR department will be organized, controlled and coordinated.Sound like a fun challenge? It certainly is. For startup owners and HR decision-makers like Nikki, here are three innovative ways to structure a successful HR department from the ground up:  1. Hire for people operations.When people think  people operations,  Google usually comes to mind. The tech giant pioneered this data-based approach to human resources, and today s most cutting-edge startups are following suit (as is the case with many things Google does).What makes people operations different from traditional HR? For starters, people operations is more than just human resources -- it s a data-based approach to understanding a company s most valuable asset: its people. Most importantly, this approach to HR is based on retaning employees by understanding what drives them.  When it comes to employees, eliminate the guesswork from employee satisfaction surveys, team assessments and social media. By having a dedicated team to solicit employee-related data, HR can more accurately identify issues that lead to disengagement and attrition, and thereby prevent it.Related: Google's Head of HR: It Doesn't Matter Where Candidates Went to College2. Boost a small team with big software.For small businesses with even smaller human resources teams, HR professionals often have to juggle multiple roles, from recruiter to talent manager to accountant. In an effort to put the  human  back in human resources, companies today are choosing to automate particular HR tasks to make notoriously tedious processes easier for both employers and employees.By automating time-consuming administrative HR functions, such as payroll, legal or benefits administration, there s more time to spend interacting with and managing employees. In this way, technology can literally put the human back in human resources. For companies with a small but growing HR team, software picks up the slack to make a small team feel super human.Related: A New Wave of HR Technology Is Disrupting the Market3. Adopt a business partner model.Companies that adopt this HR model rely on much more than your average HR generalist. In the HR business partner model, designated employees -- business partners -- from the human resources department work closely with the company s senior leaders to develop an HR agenda that closely supports the overall company mission.HR business partnering is becoming increasingly popular, as companies place more focus on aligning individual agendas toward common company goals. The business partner model requires HR to be more involved in almost every aspect of business, from financial status to sale projections to production statistics -- you name it.Rather than acting as the silent partner within an organization, business partners play an active role within the company. This integration of HR and other business functions makes it easy to identify, develop and align employees. And that s smart business.Related: 17 Great HR Resources for EntrepreneursMatt StrazMatt Straz is the founder and CEO of Namely, the HR and payroll platform for the world's most exciting companies.Read more",Human Resources,2015-05-26 17:30:00
/article/245907,This Startup Is Giving Businesses a Better Way to Offer Employee Perks,AnyPerk aims to 'enable happiness' through a variety of incentives.,"						This story appears in the June 2015 issue of Entrepreneur. Subscribe  Forget the balance sheet. According to Taro Fukuyama, the key to a successful company is a happy work force. And what makes people happy is a culture that recognizes them for being part of a team.This is the guiding concept behind AnyPerk, the company Fukuyama founded in 2013 with buddy Sunny Tsang. San Francisco-based AnyPerk offers HR departments a program through which they can incentivize employees with preferred pricing on hundreds of products and services nationwide. The perks, such as discounted gym memberships, restaurant and travel deals, clothing and free movie tickets, don t expire and can recur monthly.As Fukuyama sees it, the more appreciated an employee feels, the more likely they are to stay at their job.  Most of the time when people are feeling disengaged, it s because they feel their manager or the company doesn t appreciate them,  Fukuyama says.  Big companies like the Googles and IBMs of the world can negotiate deals and discounts directly with vendors. We provide a valuable service and economy of scale for everyone else. AnyPerk costs about $7.50 to $10 per employee per month, decreasing as head count grows. Once a company signs up, it receives access to hundreds of perks, as well as analytics that track employee savings and redemption stats to identify the most popular perk categories from quarter to quarter. HR managers use a web-based tool to pick and choose which perks from vendors such as Orbitz, AMC Theatres, Intelligentsia Coffee, Ray-Ban and Beats by Dre they want to pass along to employees. To say AnyPerk had humble beginnings would be an understatement; Fukuyama and Tsang came up with the idea in a Taco Bell parking lot. The two tell a colorful story of how they were so careful with money in the early days that at times they worked and slept in a friend s car. Two years, one pivot and one Y Combinator program later, AnyPerk was born.Investors seized the opportunity immediately. In June 2014 the company closed a $4.5 million seed round led by Tony Hsieh and Zach Ware of VegasTechFund and Stephen Ross of Vayner RSE. In February 2015 AnyPerk closed an $8.5 million Series A round led by Osuke Honda of DCM Ventures.Fukuyama says AnyPerk is  enabling happiness  for more than 1,000 companies ranging in size from mom-and-pop businesses to multinational corporations. Malwarebytes, an anti-malware software company in San Jose, Calif., has used the AnyPerk service since April 2013. In that time, Malwarebytes says, 154 U.S. employees have redeemed nearly $50,000 worth of perks.Results have been even more impressive at Virgin America. Benjamin Eye, manager of teammate engagement, says his user base of 1,800 employees has redeemed more than $190,000 in perks since late 2014. Eye notes that employees hail AnyPerk as a vast improvement over the modest program the airline had previously.  People love the immediacy,  Eye says.  In the past, to get movie tickets we had to wait for stubs by mail; now we can redeem a perk, get the voucher and book the ticket all at once, on a phone.  Eye adds that Virgin America has incorporated its own benefits into the AnyPerk system, so employees can access those offers from the same interface.Over the next few months, Fukuyama and Tsang expect to offer more ways to reward employees for exceptional work. The company recently launched its Reward feature, which empowers managers to dole out additional benefits to workers who exceed expectations. As part of this feature, employees can swap rewards for benefits of equivalent value in the AnyPerk program.AnyPerk now has 50 staffers, and Fukuyama says he hopes to eventually build a team that s large enough to assign one full-timer to every customer.  It s all part of our bigger goal,  he says.  Solving employee happiness is an ongoing thing.

/article/246725,How Companies Can Apply Big Data to Engage Employees,"Data solutions that track employee engagement, satisfaction, and retention are key to the future of building and sustaining a happy and motivated workforce.","Growing over the last several years, employee engagement is a big topic for businesses. Study after study shows the problems of a disengaged workforce including dwindling employee morale and the hefty price businesses pay for productivity losses from such issues. Unfortunately, employee-engagement issues have not plateaued. Indeed, less than one-third of U.S. workers are engaged in their jobs in 2014, which is the  highest reading since 2000,  according to research firm Gallup.Related: Without Good Analysis, Big Data Is Just a Big Trash DumpIt s pretty clear: No matter how much we talk about employee engagement, we re still stuck in a rut. It s time to re-think employee engagement. What better way to do it than bring big data into the equation?Big data has already demonstrated its importance in solving a host of business problems -- from increased customer intelligence and lead generations to helping form and drive better business strategies, big data has a widespread impact on modern business.How can big data help? In terms of customer experience, big data equips businesses with a vast amount of customer information. Using records of customer interactions, buying histories, social media, online communities and surveys, businesses can predict future actions faster and with greater accuracy than ever before. Many businesses, however, forget that our number one customer is our workforce. Therefore, it s our responsibility to create an environment that helps our employees flourish. Just like we strive to build healthy, happy and long-term relationships with our customers, we need to empower and build trust with our employees. However, it isn t something that develops organically. Trust can only be built over time. But it is worth the effort to begin thinking about your employee engagement efforts, since engaged, valued employees will bend over backwards to remain loyal. When you have the right tools and analytics in place, you can measure everything right including individual performance, team spirit, interactions between departments and the overall company culture. Data-driven strategies to engage the workforce In the pre-big data days, businesses had a tendency to sideline problems with intangible solutions. Culture management was one such issue. How do employees behave? Do they reflect the company values in their actions? Is there a positive work culture? More than 80 percent of companies say they conduct employees satisfaction surveys, according to the Society for Human Resource Management, but  many admit that they don't understand how to interpret the results nor what to do to improve survey scores.  How do we change this? A few ways would be to create teams that includes people familiar with the work being performed and hire and/or train staff with exceptional analytical skills. Don t be afraid to share your employee data with key partners and stakeholders -- people who aren t part of the process but who have a vested interest in the outcome and are willing to challenge the status quo.Related: 3 Things That Successful Entrepreneurs Know About DataUse data to know your employees better: Determining what inspires employees, what deters them, and what they don t care about allows employers to motivate their teams to greater performance levels. With the huge reserves of HR data at their disposal, businesses can go beyond their gut feelings, and make better decisions for their employees. They can gather the most relevant metrics on their workers, to understand, analyze and act. This ensures that their employee-engagement strategy is effective.Apply the right metrics: Pick a few simple metrics that ll give you insights into areas of concern. Start with finding the answers for basic questions, like  do your employees feel proud to be a part of the organization?   As an employer, do you give them enough incentives to stay motivated?   Do you spend enough time to hear and resolve the grievances of your employees? Measure the right KPIs: Focus on the most important employee-based key performance indicators (KPIs) for your business. Applying big data analytics to monitor your employees' performance helps you appreciate the top performers. It also opens up a whole new way to identify and support your underperforming and unsatisfied employees before things get worse. Big data s predictive capabilities even let you know which employees are prone to accidents, health problems, or show early signs of dissatisfaction. This also stops negative employee behavior from growing. Data may be a lynchpin in understanding how to find and keep the best talent.Data solutions that track employee engagement, satisfaction, and retention are key to the future of building and sustaining a happy and motivated workforce. The early adopters of data-drive employee engagement strategies are bound to find themselves ahead of their competitors.

Register Now  There s a pattern in the lifespan of human resources (HR) technology companies of the past two decades: they get gobbled up. The pioneering firms in HR technology from the late 1990's to early 2000's were mostly acquired by bigger enterprise companies in need of a few product parts. IBM acquired Kenexa, Oracle bought Taleo and SuccessFactors was acquired by SAP.With those acquisitions, founders and early employees left and innovation died. Then came the Great Recession and all investment ended. Today, industry experts like Sheeroy Desai, CEO at recruiting and HR management platform Gild, think job growth is finally hitting stride. Though some bigger players appear stagnant and still, HR tech companies are growing quickly, as hot, agile startup technologies enter the field.Related: Why You Need to Embrace the Big Data Trend in HR In the past decade this stagnation has allowed Workday to emerge as a new disrupter,  Desai remarks,  but with almost no real competition even Workday has not brought the level of innovation that is truly needed. Almost every current HR function operates under 20th century principles of past practices, efficiency, risk avoidance, legal compliance, and hunch-based people management decisions,  remarks HR thought leader, Dr. John Sullivan. But, today, there is a new set of entrants who are challenging the status quo.These companies are different from their predecessors in HR technology, in that they are founded by fresh-eyed engineers and non-HR practitioners approaching technologies and processes from a consumer perspective. HR tech companies like Zenefits (now valued at $4.5 billion in just two years) in the HR benefits space, Expensify in employee reimbursements, ZenPayroll changing payroll, and Gild in the area of recruiting.Bigger, faster, better.According to the Industry Trends in Human Resources Technology and Service Delivery Survey by Information Services Group (ISG), those HR technologies succeeding are the ones where:They ve built user interfaces that deliver a consumer-like experience and include mobile and social capabilities.Cloud technology is creating massive economies of scale for HR customers at the same time, reducing IT resource involvement.Real-time workforce visibility and flexibility allow for organizations to respond to changing market conditions.New technologies can be integrated into surrounding business processes.Related: 4 Technologies That Free HR to Work With People Instead of Just Their PaperworkHR tech is,  out of necessity, playing catch-up to marketing and operations technology advancements. Data-driven marketing predictions and decisions are made more quickly from today s advanced big data collection and interpretation. But old-school, limited HR practitioners don t have these same decision-making tools. It s costing companies in employee engagement. Instant feedback mechanisms can significantly improve engagement and motivation by consistently guiding employees in the right direction,  warns Matt Straz, founder and CEO of Namely.Meanwhile, some are suggesting that advanced predictive analytics may be the future of HR and talent management. That s where the engineers and data crunchers come in. Better HR technology directly affects them. Think spotty expense reports or desktop-only benefit form completion. Today s HTML5, social authentication and flat, optimized UI design is an entire toolkit of material to work with to improve legacy systems.Data shows organizations are upgrading to these new capabilities, too. While incumbent companies appear to be missing this wave, and have lost sight of the needs and pressures of their customers, fresh, new customer-engineered technologies are advancing the human resources industry.Related: 5 Ways HR Technology Can Improve Performance ReviewsAndre BourqueAndre Bourque (@SocialMktgFella) is a cannabis industry consultant who frequently writes about cannabis trends for Entrepreneur.

/article/246416,How HR Can Gain Workers' Trust,"When HR acts as the facilitator of employee engagement, they establish countless conversations with the employee population, each of which is an opportunity to gain employee trust","Q: How can HR regain the trust of workers?-- Steven ShorrockA: An HR organization will be trusted only if it is valued by both the employees and management. An effective way to make this happen is by driving employee engagement, as it can improve retention rates while increasing profits.           At Ceridian, we have seen our employee engagement scores increase substantially through a disciplined and transparent employee engagement process. The first step to establishing an employee engagement program (and regaining trust through it) is to have open and honest communication with the employee population. In a small company, this may consist of one-on-one conversations and group discussions. In a larger organization, however, the process needs to scale.Related: What Are Performance Reviews Really About?For instance, every six months at Ceridian we perform a broad employee engagement survey of all employees. HR works with each department to and does several employee reach-outs to drive employee participation in the survey. After the survey results are tabulated, HR reviews the results with the senior executives to identify and develop programs for the areas that are the most important for the employees. The programs that we develop are specific (i.e. explicitly address items identified by the survey), actionable (vs. vague or general commitments) and measurable. It s important that we be able to determine our progress as we work towards our engagement targets.The results and employee initiatives are then shared with people managers and then again on an all-hand call with all employees. It is important that the survey results -- both the bad and the good -- are shared openly with all employees. Without this open communication, there is no basis for trust or credibility.After the initiatives have been communicated, HR takes the lead on arranging collaboration, tracking progress and communicating results of each employee program. Every month, HR reports on progress to the executive team and every quarter the progress is also reported to all employees.It s important to note that employee engagement doesn t have an end point: There are no  one and done  fixes or programs. Rather when a culture has a healthy level of engagement, employees expect their HR organizations to continuously identify new priorities and initiatives and trust them to follow through.Related: How to Avoid Startups' Biggest HR PitfallsAnother crucial factor is the personal integrity of the leaders in the organization -- HR, the executive team and people managers. It is impossible to establish organizational trust and credibility when it s not present at the individual level as well. When leaders act with integrity they not only set a positive example but also set a clear expectation for the same behavior from their teams.When HR acts as the facilitator of employee engagement, they establish countless conversations with the employee population, each of which is an opportunity to gain employee trust. When employees trust and are open in their communication through the survey process, HR also gains the insight they require to delivery very high impact programs that generate significant bottom-line value to the organization.Related: Avoid These 5 Small-Business HR MistakesDavid OssipDavid Ossip, CEO of Ceridian. a company that provides human-resource software to businessesRead more",Ask the Expert,2015-05-20 17:00:00
/article/246352,5 Vital HR Tasks Startups Must Complete Before Hiring,Bringing on new workers adds a layer of complexity that most entrepreneurs either don't want to deal with or don't know how to address.,"You re an entrepreneur. A visionary. A big-picture-oriented business professional with big dreams and big plans. And since this is where your strengths and skills lie, it s no wonder the words  human resources  seem to stop you dead in your tracks.Growth-driven business owners face a double-edged sword when it comes to expanding their operations. On the one hand, bringing on employees is a necessary part of scaling a company. But at the same time, hiring these new workers adds a layer of complexity that most entrepreneurs either don t want to deal with or don t know how to address.Related: W-2 or 1099? Why It Pays to Classify Your Employees Correctly.I can t give you the motivation needed to tackle HR issues head on, apart from telling you that they re a necessary evil that s better addressed before small issues blow up into major problems. But I can tell you what you need to do to prepare your startup to scale.Tackling each of the following five tasks before bringing on employees will put your growing company in the best possible position for sustainable success.1. Register for an employer identification number.Depending on the type of business structure you registered initially, you may already have an employer identification number (EIN). If you don t, you can register for this nine-digit number quickly and easily through the IRS website. Once established, this number signifies that your business is legally allowed to hire employees in the eyes of the IRS.As a side note, if this isn t your first business -- or if your current business is undergoing certain structural changes -- you may be required to obtain a new EIN or multiple EINs. Check out the IRS s  Do You Need a New EIN?  page for more information.2. Understand tax and classification reporting requirements.Filing for your EIN is easy, understanding your tax and classification reporting requirements is regrettably less so. Essentially, as a business owner,  you re responsible for paying federal income tax, unemployment tax, Social Security tax, Medicare and state income tax (where applicable) for all eligible employees. This requires two separate processes.First, you must determine whether the employees you re hiring can be considered traditional employees or should be classified as independent contractors. The IRS outlines the criteria for each classification here, but the gist is that traditional, common-law employees have a lesser degree of control and independence than those who will ultimately be designated as independent contractors.Beyond establishing your workers  classifications, you ll need to put systems in place to ensure the tax payments you re required to make for each of your workers are funneled to the right state or federal agency. Most accounting software programs can help with this, as can your local accountants.Related: 8 Things You Must Do to Protect Your Assets3. Report new hires to your state.Yet another requirement startups will need to comply with as they bring on new workers is a provision of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act, which specifies that all new hire data must be reported to the appropriate state agency within 20 days of each employee s first day or by the first pay date following this 20-day window.Fortunately, this reporting process is generally simple, and typically involves reporting only the employee s name, contact information and hire date. The Small Business Administration offers a list of New Hire Reporting Centers to help you find your state s center.4. Purchase workers  compensation insurance.Next up, you ll need to purchase workers  compensation insurance to protect any employees that are injured while on the job. State requirements vary significantly regarding the purchase of this policy, and your premiums are likely to vary based on your industry, the age of your company and other factors.  Your best course of action? Talk to your banker or insurance agent to be sure you re covered.5. Verify candidate employment eligibility.One final requirement all business owners face when bringing on new employees is the responsibility for verifying that the people you re hiring are, indeed, eligible to work in the U.S.Typically, this is done by requiring all new hires to complete a I-9 form, which requires documented proof of citizenship or valid work visas. While you aren t required to submit this paperwork to the government, it s a good idea to keep it on file at your office, along with copies of the documents your new hires provided. You may also choose to run completed I-9 forms through the government s everify program for added certainty.Certainly, none of these tasks are as fun as brainstorming new product lines or mapping out new marketing campaigns. But if you re going to expand by bringing on new workers, they re just as vital to your success as these more obviously profit-oriented activities are.Protect yourself by completing them in a timely manner, as well as by learning from the hiring tips other successful CEOs have to offer.Related: 9 Tips for Hiring and Managing Interns Startups Need to KnowEric SiuEric Siu is the CEO of digital marketing agency Single Grain, which has helped venture-backed startups and Fortune 500 companies grow their revenues.

/article/244998,4 Tips to Best Use Assessments for Hiring,"You can use these tests to help you to determine how individuals think and solve problems, their behavioral preferences, values, ethics and what natural aptitudes they possess.","Small-business owners often ask us whether they can use assessments to make hiring decisions. The short answer is yes. You can use assessments to help you determine who to hire. As usual with employment practices, there are a few caveats to mention.First, if you are going to use assessmentsm, make sure they are scientifically  reliable  and  validated. This is necessary to ensure that the assessment meets the requirements set forth by the Department of Labor and Equal Employment Opportunity Commisssion, as well as statues such as the Americans with Disabilities Act. If you are not sure about a particular assessment, ask the person supplying the product or seek out a knowledgeable employment attorney or human resources practitioner. Related: What to Look For When Hiring Your First EmployeesSecond, you should never choose or eliminate a candidate based solely on the results of an assessment. Rather, the assessment should provide one piece of the puzzle. The more interesting question is  should I use assessments. Personally, we are fans of several assessments and believe employers can use them in a variety of ways to enhance everything from hiring to employee development and team building. You can use assessments to help you to determine how individuals think and solve problems, their behavioral preferences, values, ethics and what natural aptitudes they possess. However, this is an article about using assessments in hiring, so let s take a quick look at some do s and don ts of using assessments in this employment process:1. Determine the type of assessment. As mentioned above, there are a tremendous number of assessments available. Some measure behavioral style while others measure a person's ability to deal with stress and change. First, determine what you want to measure. Don t use an assessment just because it is well known or it is pops up first on the Internet. A bit of research may help you to find a great product for your particular situation. 2. Carefully read the assessment descriptions. For instance, extroversion as defined by the Myers Briggs Type Inventory: Getting your energy from active involvement in events and a lot of outside activity and people.  This is different from extroversion as defined in the Big 5 assessment:  Characterized by sociability, talkativeness, assertiveness and excitability. Make sure you understand what the assessment measures.Related: The Licorice Test and Other Unconventional Tips for Hiring3. Know what you need.You must know what you are looking for in the perfect candidate. For instance, you might want to measure outgoingness. However, depending on whether you want a salesperson who will spend most his or her time interacting with others or an analyst who will spend much of his or her time working independently, the ideal hire will look very different. A behavioral assessment is only helpful if you understand what behaviors would be successful in that particular job. Do your homework and develop a profile for the job you are trying to fill. 4. Determine patterns.If you have employees currently in this position, have them take the assessment to see if there are any patterns. This can be helpful in determining if the assessment gives you results that make sense. As you continue to use a particular assessment you will continue to see paterns emerge. Assessments can provide decision-makers with another source of data during the all-important hiring process. Yes, we would encourage you to use assessments. However, make sure you use a legal product that measures what you want to measure. Do your homework. If you do, assessments can be a valuable tool.Related: 3 Ways to Be Constantly Recruiting Star Talent Through Social MediaDoug and Polly WhiteDoug and Polly are small business experts, speakers and consultants who work with entrepreneurs through Whitestone Partners.

/article/246343,10 Ways to Grow Leaders in Your Business,Founders need lieutenants they can trust to help grow their businesses. The best way to find them is to train them yourself.,"There are many reasons why organizations spend enormous amounts of time and resources on developing leaders. One of the most important examples would be that  Organizations with the highest quality leaders were 13 times more likely to outperform their competition in key bottom-line metrics such as financial performance, quality of products and services, employee engagement, and customer satisfaction. If you want your organization to fall into that category, then use the following 10 tips to help develop leaders within your business.1. Use big data.As Heather Huhman reminds us in Entrepreneur,  Previously employers have relied on assessments such as IQ tests, skills aptitude tests, and even physical exams to answer questions like  Should Sarah be promoted?  or  Is it time to fire Bill?  Now we have big data to help us locate the right employees for our business and even predict how long they ll remain at the company.There are many companies now that use data to determine the best talent. I've used several but the best indicator that I've found is using the enneagram test. I make all new employees take this test. This helps me to better know how to make them a leader. Not everyone can become a leader the same way. Every personality is different and this test will help you better evaluate different types of leaders.Related: Why You Need to Embrace the Big Data Trend in HR2. Develop leaders early.Leadership development should take place as soon as possible within your organization by assessing and analyzing the strengths of potential future leaders. While big data can be used, you can also discover which employees have what it takes for certain jobs by letting them identify themselves as potential leaders in leadership positions.This is a technique used by Fred Smith, founder and CEO of FedEx; ""Our Leadership Evaluation and Awareness Program explains the demands of management as well as the personal characteristics and traits needed for successful leadership. I find it interesting that, once they know the demands and requirements, some 70 percent of the participants drop out of the program.""3. Educate and train employees.Another way to develop future leaders is by constantly providing them with the education and training needed to become a leader. This could be accomplished by having employees attend webinars, conferences or classes to help them refine their leadership skills.4. Challenge employees.Give employees a chance to challenge themselves by assigning them unfamiliar tasks. It s an effective way to push and test their skill levels. As The Wall Street Journal notes, it s all right if they fail since it  offers valuable lessons that can add new skills, improve confidence, and solidify employee commitment. Watch to see if the employee just determines the task is above their skill level or if your employee determines that they will do what it takes to learn the new skill.5. Let them interact with current leaders.Companies like Southwest Airlines have found an effective way to give employees first-hand experience in a leadership role is for them to shadow current leaders. While speaking to Businessweek, Elizabeth Bryant, senior director of talent management at Southwest Airlines, stated ""It goes beyond formal training and is part of everyday life at Southwest, where employees at every level are exposed to leaders so they get to see how the leaders think.""Bryant added ""Even informal mentoring and exposure to company executives helps to broaden people's perspectives and stimulate their passion about the job.""Related: You Don't Have to Be a CEO to Develop Leadership Qualities6. Teach them to network.Networking is vital for everyone in a leadership position. Take for example how operational, personal and strategic networking was examined by Herminia Ibarra and Mark Hunter. The professors discovered that effective managers were able to locate the individuals within their organization who can help them complete a task or project.Encourage employees to improve their networking skills through training or by having them communicate with co-workers they don't know well.7. Rotate employee positions.For many innovative companies, employee rotation has become a great way to engage, motivate and work with different team members. Furthermore, by not locking employees into a single position, it s developing additional skills in each employee that could be used if they have to fill-in for another team member.Susan Heathfield, a human resources consultant, informed Charles Coy on the Cornerstone Blog that employee rotation is helpful because, ""It helps employees spread their wings and extend their boundaries.""Related: 4 Ways to Successfully Develop Employees Year-Round8. Provide support for employees.While you want to challenge employees and encourage them to get out of their comfort zones, you also need to make sure that you give them the proper support whenever assigning new tasks. This can be done by encouraging them yourself, directing them to someone who can help, providing them with the right support and frequently evaluating their work.9. Inspire employees to be passionate.Some of the the best leaders that I've ever met inspire others to become leaders by their passion. Employees will take a little bit of that passion and it will grow within them. Develop passion in your employees and they will become the biggest factors in the success of your business.By letting employees be creative, encouraging them to work on side projects and sending out employee surveys, you will have found a couple of ways to discover which employees are authentic and have bought into your company s culture. Keep in mind, you don't have time for everything.10. Give them a little power.It s important to give employees the right tools and resources to succeed. But, you don t always have to hold their hand. Furthermore, you may have to give up a little control by giving them the power to make certain decisions.According to Avery Augustine of The Muse,  I learned this firsthand when I was put in charge of a client event while my boss was out of town and completely out of touch. With no one else to lean on, I was forced to make decisions on my own, no matter how unsure I was. Eventually, I became more and more confident in making decisions solo (even if it took a couple slip-ups -- a.k.a.  learning experiences  -- to solidify that skill.)

/article/246262,4 Technologies That Free HR to Work With People Instead of Just Their Paperwork,Technology is giving human resources staff more time to help employees individually.,"From automated emails to applicant tracking systems to video interviews, technology provides essential tools for HR teams today. A 2014 survey by The Starr Conspiracy revealed that more than half (57 percent) of the 210 companies surveyed said they plan to invest in some type of HR technology solution in the coming 12 months.  As more companies integrate tech into everyday HR processes, the risk increases that some will lose sight of the human aspect of human resources. But embracing tech doesn t mean dropping the human side of HR. When used right, technology enables businesses and HR professionals to be even more personable.Here are four facets of HR where technology is commonly used and how to make the most of that tech without neglecting the human side of business:1. Talent acquisition.The hiring process is a key function of human resources that has been largely affected by technology. Applicant tracking systems (ATS), for instance, help HR professionals manage their candidate pool. Once that pool is narrowed down, it s time to begin screening applicants, and many companies are now relying on video technology to paint the perfect candidate picture.While applicant tracking systems have made hiring managers  lives easier with keyword filtering and video interviews , do applicants feel the same way?  How to Humanize: ATS software and video interviews are designed to aid the hiring process -- not take it over. The goal of a keyword search is not to turn up the best candidates, but to eliminate as many candidates as possible. Keyword search shouldn t be used if there are only a handful of applicants.Instead of replacing traditional face-to-face interviews with video, consider using video technology during the screening process. Video interviews make the screening process more personable by allowing candidates and hiring managers to connect visually.Related: The 3 Essential HR Technologies for Filling Your Talent Pool With the Right People2. Employee onboarding.Automating certain aspects of the onboarding process just makes sense. It makes onboarding simpler for both employers and employees by making it easy to assign, track and store new hire paperwork, training and tasks. However, from automated welcome emails to online paperwork to training videos, the human in human resources can get lost in the tech.How to Humanize: Automating time-consuming administrative aspects of the onboarding process, such as new hire paperwork, means HR professionals can spend more time with new hires. It literally puts the human back in human resources.To further humanize the onboarding process, consider assigning new hires a mentor for their first few weeks on the job. While training videos can be helpful, they don t replace learning from a seasoned employee.Related: Your New Employees Will Want These 6 Things When They Come on Board3. Open enrollment.Open enrollment is often the cause of benefits-induced headaches, especially when relying on outdated enrollment systems. Modern enrollment technology simplifies the enrollment process for all parties involved by enabling employees to easily select and manage their benefits online.  How to Humanize: While automating the enrollment process can help take some of the pain out of open enrollment, ongoing communication is the key to making the process run smoothly. People trump tech when it comes to helping employees make more informed decisions.By automating open enrollment, more time can be spent conducting benefits fairs, lunch-and-learns, and meeting with individual employees. More tech, more time, more communication.Related: How Small-Business Owners Can Win the Health Insurance Game4. Talent management.According to Deloitte s Global Human Capital Trends 2015 report, performance management is changing. Of the 3,300 organizations Deloitte surveyed, 89 percent changed their performance management process or plan to change it within 18 months. We can expect tech to play a more prominent role in the process.How to Humanize: Talent management technologies, like automated feedback and transparent goal-setting, help bring out the best in employees. But that tech should supplement the performance review process -- not take its place. Continue to meet with employees in an informal, one-on-one setting to discuss goal progress and development.Related: Measure These 5 Talent Metrics for Greater Success in Hiring and Managing EmployeesMatt StrazMatt Straz is the founder and CEO of Namely, the HR and payroll platform for the world's most exciting companies.Read more",Inspiring Your Team,2015-05-18 18:30:00
/article/245934,3 Reasons HR in the Cloud Just Makes Sense,"Cloud storage is secure, improves employee access to their data and simplifies system upgrades.","Free Webinar | August 16thFind out how to optimize your website to give your customers experiences that will have the biggest ROI for your business.							Register Now  Chances are, by now, companies have gotten wind of the cloud -- cloud computing, cloud storage, public clouds, private clouds, you name it. In fact, many companies are using the cloud in some way or another and may not even realize it.The cloud is taking the business world by storm (pun intended). According to a 2014 report by Forrester Research, the public cloud market is estimated to reach $191 billion by 2020, a significant climb from $58 billion in 2013.Where human resources is concerned, the cloud just makes sense. Implementing a cloud-based HR system helps ease some of the stress associated with a growing business and its growing HR needs.Here are three reasons to consider moving HR to the cloud:1. Increased mobility and flexibility.Possibly the biggest benefit of moving portions of HR to the cloud is the ability to access work-related software or information from any device, anywhere, at any time. Adopting cloud-based HR solutions empowers employees, plain and simple, by giving them more flexibility to access information.Most importantly, the self-service aspect of cloud-based HR solutions eliminates the stacks of paperwork associated with basic HR processes. Employees instantly and easily request days off, update personal information, and more from their devices. Crazy simple data entry? Yes, please.Related: 4 Signs It's Time for a Cloud-Based HR Platform2. Easy implementation and innovation.Say goodbye to days spent going back and forth with contractors, consultants and customer service. With cloud computing, implementation is quick and painless. Plus, thanks to open APIs, many cloud HR solutions are designed to integrate with applications already in use. This make implementation less stressful and it won t disrupt day-to-day business.In addition to saving time and money on implementation with the cloud, cloud computing also saves time and money when it comes to innovation. Automatic system updates and upgrades make it easy for cloud-based HR software to stay cutting edge and increasingly useful.Related: 4 Reasons Small Businesses Should Migrate to the Cloud3. Data is safe when hosted properly and diligently.Should sensitive HR data really reside on the Internet? Are the advantages worth the risks? These questions continue to plague employers who are still up in the air about cloud-based HR solutions.According to KPMG s 2014 Cloud Survey Report, which reflects perspectives of more than 500 global business leaders, 53 percent of respondents cited data loss and privacy risks as the most significant challenges of doing business in the cloud, followed by intellectual property theft (50 percent). In fact, when it comes to selecting a cloud solution, cost has been eclipsed by security and data privacy.The security of a company s HR data comes down to the company hosting that data. These companies will have policies and procedures in place to secure their infrastructure and data.

/article/245886,What Are Performance Reviews Really About?,'Enough about you. Let's talk about me.',"Ever get the feeling that, judging by what came up in your performance review, your boss must have been talking about someone else? If so, you re not crazy.It s entirely possible that how you re being evaluated has less to do with you than with the person on the other side of the desk. At least, that s the conclusion of an intriguing study led by Steven Scullen, a professor of management at Drake University. A team of researchers spent months analyzing performance ratings of about 5,000 managers from a wide range of industries. Each was evaluated by six colleagues of different ranks, including bosses, peers, and direct reports.Not only did the six raters each give different ratings for almost every manager, the study found, but  65% of the variance in ratings was attributable to personal biases and idiosyncrasies of individual raters,  while only 25% could be traced back to how well each manager actually did his or her job. For example, one person might give you low marks on strategic planning,  says Scullen.  But that doesn t mean a different one would share the same view. Much of the variation comes from raters  different opinions of the importance of strategic planning, or their own skills in strategic planning, or other personal factors that have nothing to do with the work you performed. Bosses  ratings were somewhat more consistent than either peers  or subordinates , the researchers found, and thus probably more reliable. Still, even bosses  ratings of the same person s performance varied by as much as 51%, versus anywhere from 62% to 71% in the ratings that came from peers and subordinates.Companies could make reviews more accurate, Scullen says, by having more than one person do them, and then averaging the results.  It also helps to get independent views, rather than a panel of evaluators where there is one dominant voice and everyone else just goes along,  he adds. Even better, he suggests trying  as much as possible to come up with a truly objective, quantitative measure    easier for some jobs (sales, for instance) than for others   so that individual raters  biases carry minimal weight. But employers need to spend more time clarifying our definitions of what we want from each role, what success looks like, and then communicating that,  Scullen says.  It should be an ongoing discussion with the person who s being rated. Deloitte apparently agrees. Based partly on Scullen s study, the global consulting and audit giant recently announced it is revamping its entire performance-appraisal system, scrapping annual reviews and 360-degree feedback altogether.More from Fortune MagazineChina s Baidu Partners With Paypal to Tap Chinese TouristsChallenging Alibaba, Amazon Launches Prime Now Delivery in SingaporeUnited Airlines Is Being Sued By the Owners of a Giant Rabbit Found Dead After a FlightAnne Fisher Anne Fisher is the ""Ask Annie"" columnist & management/workplace contributor for Fortune.Read more",Performance Reviews,2015-05-05 17:43:19
/article/245708,How to Avoid Startups' Biggest HR Pitfalls,There's no exact science for keeping your founding team members around for the long term but there are a few things you can do to increase your chances of being surrounded by those same early employees further down the line.,"There s no exact science for keeping your founding team members around for the long term but there are a few things you can do to increase your chances of being surrounded by those same early employees further down the line. You know what they say about startup hires: early in, early out. While it s true that  they  say that, I m not actually sold on the truth of the sentiment itself. Plenty of companies navigated their growth in such a way as to keep early executives on board.In my experience with those teams, there are a few key things management kept in mind to ensure retention, all of which can be applied to businesses of any size or industry. 1. Consider why your early hires started.There are plenty of reasons not to join an early-stage company: a lack of stability, insurance and regular hours, to name a few. So, as a founder or top executive, when you re thinking about the rest of your startup founding team, you should ask yourself,  With all the reasons to not come on board, why did they actually do it?  Identify what it was that drew each early hire into your company in the first place. Once you have that figured out, make it a priority to keep that specific element in place for each individual even after you make it through the early stages of the company.Related: Avoid These 5 Small-Business HR MistakesWhatever that characteristic was must have been pretty powerful; it overpowered all the negative components and external pressures telling those individuals to take the job at the safe, well-established company instead. For some people, the early intrigue may have been the excitement and fast pace that comes with a startup. For others, it could have been the autonomy that came with their elevated position, the gratification of creating a brand new product or technology, or enjoying how their contribution affected other areas of the organization, such as partner or sales growth. If you work to ensure that initial appealing factor remains in play over time, you ll have much better luck keeping those particular individuals on the team.2. Consider the roles in question for your initial employees.As much as each individual on your early team differs with regard to personalities and preferences, their roles and responsibilities do, as well. Think beyond what may have led your early hires to your company and consider what led them to their chosen profession in the first place. Engineers, for example, are often astute problem solvers driven by that need to identify the elegant, concrete solution. If you take away the opportunity to fulfill that goal as time goes on, someone with that natural inclination might take his talents elsewhere.Related: When Is it Time to Cut the Cord With New Hires?Different professions attract different types of people. Focus on matching your expectations of the individual to his expectations of the job, and you ll have a much easier time establishing an engaging dynamic that encourages him to stay on board long term.3. Consider what will continue to motivate original team members.Once you ve figured out why your initial team members came on board, think about how you can keep building the appeal. While maintaining those initial intriguing characteristics is important, it s equally critical to identify the opportunities that will add fresh interest over time. We ve all heard that Silicon Valley urban legend of the startup that hits it so big everyone in the company becomes a millionaire but that probably won t be the case at your company. There may be some individuals who do enjoy those benefits, but don t bank on monetary motivation being the sole source of encouragement for your early employees. Focus instead on developing a culture that works toward collective accomplishments rather than a collective paycheck.Most individuals that go the startup route have a strong sense of ambition and a competitive nature driving them toward that high-risk/high-reward environment. Always be looking ahead to the next goal and next benchmark for these team members to ensure the best chance of keeping them involved.There s no exact science for keeping your founding team members around for the long term, and there s certainly always the risk of those individuals being the first to get bored or fed up and head for their next venture. Just keep these perspectives in mind as you develop your team, your business model and your company culture, and you ll greatly increase your chances of being surrounded by those same early employees further down the line.

/article/245688,Johnson & Johnson Just Gave New Parents Seven More Weeks of Paid Leave,"The new employee policy applies to all new parents -- maternal, paternal, same-sex and adoptive.","Consumer products giant Johnson & Johnson today announced an additional 7 weeks of paid leave for U.S. employees who have recently become parents. That brings total paid leave up to 17 weeks for moms and a minimum of 9 weeks for dads.The new paid-time-off policy applies to all new parents, whether maternal, paternal, same-sex or adoptive, and goes into effect on May 1. Johnson & Johnson will retroactively honor the new policy for anyone working at the company who became a parent on or after May 1, 2014, according to a blog post announcing the change in policy.The time off does not need to be taken consecutively, but must be taken during the first year of the family s birth or adoption.Related: Parental Employment Benefits Around the World (Infographic)Parental leave in the United States -- or, more pointedly, the lack thereof -- sits in stark contrast to the much more generous paid leave policies in other countries. The U.S. government mandates that new parents get 12 weeks of unpaid leave during which time their job is protected, but it does not pay companies to give their employees time off after they become parents. The U.S. is the only developed country that doesn t pay for maternity leave, according to a report from the White House published last summer.By comparison, new parents in Estonia get more than two years of paid time off and in Germany, parents get nearly a year. This is according to data compiled by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and organized by the Pew Research Center.Correction: An initial announcement from Johnson & Johnson misstated the number of additional weeks parents will have off under the new policy.

/article/245395,How to Land a Job at a Startup,3 factors play into your hiring potential -- big time. Here's what will get you hired.,"As a startup owner who receives resumes daily, I ve noticed an interesting advantage most startups have over corporations.They re magnets for prospective recent graduates and a fair number of ex-entrepreneurs!There's no doubting the reputation startups have acquired over the past decade or so: the rock star-like young professionals; the hip offices; the (eventual) perks.Startups are prime workplace real estate these days for every prospective new-hire, and they continue to set the trends in hiring tactics and practices.The startup world is an attractive prospect for ex-entrepreneurs in that it allows them to work as pseudo-entrepreneurs -- they still get to flex their entrepreneurial muscles while gainfully accepting the consistency of a paycheck. Although ex-entrepreneurs may not like to admit it, the need to re-enter the workforce could happen for different reasons.Related: 3 Ways to Be Constantly Recruiting Star Talent Through Social MediaTurns out new businesses have a high failure rate.According to a recent Harvard business school study by Dr. Shikhar Ghosh, three out of every four venture-backed businesses fail to provide investors any return. When failure knocks on the door, one of the options entrepreneurs might entertain would be to going back to work for someone else -- at their startup.Startups need workers who are eager to take the initiative and make decisions that others won t. Only those that succeed in making these essential hires, who aren t afraid to set trends, have any chance of survival. Mark Zuckerberg once said in an interview,  I will only hire someone to work directly for me if I would work for that person."" This is where you, as an ex-entrepreneur, will be invaluable.Here are three factors that have big impacts on who gets hired at a startup.1. What have you done?Clearly state what you've accomplished either working for yourself or for someone else.Many candidates are guilty of overstating events and accomplishments on their resumes. On the other hand, many others make a different fundamental mistake: They never state, in clear language, what they ve done for a previous employer or in their academic pursuits.No one has the time to decipher the finer points of your resume. You re trying to say why you're the best person for the job. If it's hard to read, your resume will be thrown aside. Explain clearly, in as much detail and jargon-free language as possible, what you successfully did in a previous role.If you broke sales records for software sales by selling a million units in two weeks via a sales method you derived yourself, state it clearly with figures included. Another key thing to do is to frame points on your resume as tangible achievements instead of responsibilities.Related: Google's Head of HR: It Doesn't Matter Where Candidates Went to College2. Placement mattersDo list your accomplishments as close to the top of your resume as possible.How many prime candidates have made the fatal mistake of letting their finest achievements get lost in the clutter of words that is their resume? As previously stated, a hiring manager at any organization is sifting through thousands of emails to find that one gold nugget -- a daunting task.If that's the case, you want your nugget as close to the top of that pile of dirt as possible. Let your finest achievements be listed as close to the top of your resume as possible. Most hiring managers will spend less than 10 seconds on each resume -- something has to catch his or her eye before that window of time runs out.Your best bet is to maximize the space and really make an impact on your resume at the top and the bottom of the page.3. Look the partTo swing things in your favor when meeting the hiring manager for the job, look like you fit the job.Numerous studies have proven the human mind and eye have a bias toward more attractive-looking individuals, and it would be smart to take advantage of that small glitch in the human psyche. Startups have earned the reputation of being much more laid back in attire choice than your traditional corporate workplace. However, many candidates have taken this to mean they don't need to try hard to look their best at a startup interview.No matter what the culture the organization favors, individuals that are more attractive will always be favored when it comes to offers, salaries and compensation. Candidates need to make an effort to look their best to subconsciously influence the hiring manager's decisions.Related: Do This and Get Hired: Weekly Tips RoundupAdiat DisuAdiat Disu is an international publicist.

/article/244914,Red Flags and Red Herrings in Job Applicants' Credit Reports,Is your applicant just down on his or her luck or irresponsible? Here's how to find out.,"Regardless of the size of your staff, a company is only as good as the people who work for it. When you're looking for new members of your team, it makes sense to find the most capable and reliable people possible.Related: Negotiating Secrets: How to Convince Creditors Not to Ruin Your Credit Score But how do you quantify responsibility? Since these traits are difficult to discern from resumes and cover letters, many hiring managers look to the applicant's credit history.If your knowledge of consumer credit is a bit fuzzy, don't worry -- a majority of Americans have a tenuous understanding of their credit. This article will show you how to find an applicant's credit report, what's in it and what you should be looking for during the hiring process.How to pull an applicant's credit reportFirst, you want to see an applicant's credit report, not his or her credit score. A credit score is a three-digit number derived from the information in someone's reports from the three major credit bureaus (TransUnion, Experian and Equifax), and is usually calculated through a proprietary algorithm.A credit score may tell you someone has bad credit, but it won't explain how it happened. This is an important distinction because a bad credit score is not always the result of irresponsible financial habits.When you're ready to pull the applicant's credit report, you'll need his or her written consent (as mandated by the Fair Credit Reporting Act).Next, simply notify one of the three major credit reporting bureaus that you're acquiring someone's credit report for business purposes. Experian, for example, has a page dedicated to pulling credit reports on other people. Or, you could contact third-party groups such as StarPoint or ADP to perform credit checks on employees.Related: How to Fix Mistakes on Your Credit ReportAlternatively, you could do a ""proxy order"" by having the applicant request his or her own credit report and hand it over to you. People can do this for free once a year for each bureau via www.annualcreditreport.com. What you'll see in a credit reportThe credit report will contain:Basic information about the applicant (name, address, etc.)Past and present lines of credit, such as mortgages, student loans, personal loans, credit cards and more. These sections will include the accounts' status, their history of payments, current balances and additional detailsA list of recent credit inquiries, including the date, the business involved and the reason for the credit inquiryPublic records, which typically include court judgments such as tax liens and civil actionsHistory of bankruptcy.To get an idea of what kind of credit report you'd receive, check out this example from Experian.Red flagsWhen you're trying to assess whether this potential new employee has reliability issues, it's best to examine his or her credit report from a long-term perspective. Some of the most telling details will be in the public records sections. If someone's personal finances have deteriorated to the point that a court had to get involved, that may be a sign of reoccuring fiscal irresponsibility.True, a consumer may file for bankruptcy after an unexpected event such as a medical emergency, but many times he or she will file after becoming trapped in cyclical debt or through excessive spending.Likewise, a series of missed payments may indicate that the applicant has had difficulty meeting deadlines. Tax liens and mortgage defaults are also things that tend not to happen overnight, meaning the applicant had ample time to try to correct the situation.Red herrings""Red herring,"" a literary term, means a detail or event that seems noteworthy at first glance but ultimately turns out to be unimportant. When it comes to credit reports, there are plenty of red herrings.Consumer-credit risk analysis is a notoriously fickle science. For example, a single missed payment on a credit card is enough to drop someone from an ""excellent"" credit score to ""fair"" or worse. Medical debts are also worth careful consideration, considering the fact that those debts frequently overpenalize consumers and contain errors.The message here is that a single missed payment in an otherwise flawless history of repayment shouldn't be cause for alarm, even if the individual's credit score took a significant hit for it. Frequent credit checks, too, are another cause for credit-score penalties. If the consumer has an otherwise healthy profile and keeps his or her debt utilization ratios at safe levels, it's entirely possible that what's happening is ""churning"" of credit cards just for the rewards. This may indicate that someone is a savvy consumer, as opposed to a spendthrift.Many millennials will likely have large installment loans on their credit reports, often upwards of five figures or more. In many cases, these are student loans, not reckless borrowing.In addition, many negative marks will stay on credit reports for a long time, often either seven or 10 years after the penalty first appeared on the report. It's entirely possible that, within that time, the applicant has learned from his or her mistakes.Additional considerationsIn the event you decide not to hire someone based on the contents of a credit report, you will need to send this person a pre-adverse action disclosure. This is how you, as an employer, will let the applicant know of the denial of employment due to the contents of a credit report. The pre-adverse action disclosure must include both a copy of the credit report you received and a Federal Trade Commission document titled ""A Summary of Your Rights Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act.""You should also ask the applicant whether he or she has reviewed the credit report recently for errors. According to the FTC, one in four consumers have errors on their credit reports.If the applicant seems otherwise perfect for the open position, ask for an explanation of the negative marks on the credit report. Not only will you learn more about this individual's financial history but gain valuable insight into how he or she addresses and recovers from setbacks.Related: 9 Strategies for Improving Your Credit RatingSteven RichmondSteven Richmond worked as a government and business journalist before becoming editor in chief of BadCredit.org, a leading website for consumer credit and debt news and advice, and CardRates.com, a comprehensive guide to cred...Read more",Inspiring Your Team,2015-04-16 18:45:00
/article/244954,Developing an Unlimited Paid Time-Off Policy That Works,Four tips for making the transition as seamless as possible.,"Unlimited paid time-off is becoming increasingly popular in the startup and tech industries -- for good reason. It lets your team members know that you value their overall wellness and autonomy. But unlimited PTO isn t just some shortcut to make your team think you re a great boss; it actually delivers real ROI.Employers who offer unlimited PTO report increased employee satisfaction, improved work-life balance and greater productivity. Plus, unlimited PTO can be a huge selling point when you re recruiting, and it will actually save your HR department an average of 52 hours per year.Related: Unlimited Paid-Time Off? Seriously? How to Make It Work.Some companies have seen success in implementing an  inbox zero  policy, in which vacations almost push employees to respond to all emails and complete outstanding to-do lists before leaving. Vacations also allow employees to free their minds, which encourages them to come back with new, creative ideas to contribute to the company s future.More than that, unlimited PTO shows your employees that you trust them and value their lives outside of the office. For example, one of my developers is a dedicated triathlete, and unlimited PTO allows him to pursue his passion of competing across the country and still be an integral part of our team.Not only do my employees enjoy unlimited PTO, but my company also benefits. To put it simply: Everyone wins.Once you shake off the chains of limited PTO, you can uncover a culture of self-policing, where your employees are able to reward and discipline one another by working as a team. This promotes creative planning for individuals and the team as a whole, so it s not hard to see how this spurs commitment and increases productivity.In their book, Gen Y Now, Herb Sendek and Buddy Hobart claim that teams will work together to maintain a sense of balance. For example, teams will reject members who aren t pulling their weight. On the other hand, they ll show dissatisfaction with members who refuse to take breaks. Recently, I had a chance to sit down with Hobart, and together, we formulated four things you can do to make the transition to unlimited PTO as seamless as possible:1. Establish a mandatory minimum PTO policy.Introducing unlimited PTO may cause confusion around what the  norm  is, and that confusion could deter employees from taking time off. Let them know that's okay! Utilize a minimum PTO policy to ensure that your employees get some R&R.For example, Evernote offers a $1,000 bonus to its employees for taking a week off. If an employee doesn t take that vacation, he or she doesn t get the bonus. It may seem counterintuitive to pay an employee not to work, but ultimately, this strategy boosts employee productivity and prevents burnout.2. Devise a method to track time off.You need to know how much time everyone is taking off so you can improve the system. This could be as simple as keeping track on Google Sheets, or you could use tracking programs such as Centreli or Zenefits. After all, encouraging your employees to take time off is difficult if you don t realize they haven t been doing so.Related: The Secret to Increased Productivity: Taking Time Off3. Use a process for those requesting time off.Unlimited PTO policies can t be a total free-for-all in which people can come and go as they please. You still need to have some processes in place for adequate preparation time and project handoffs. Create a system for your employees to follow. This may involve notifying a manager in advance, establishing a plan for delegating work to other teammates or creating an automated email response to let people know who should be contacted in the employee's absence.4. Trust that your employees won t abuse your unlimited PTO.If you can t trust them, why did you hire them? Give your employees the responsibility to make their own decisions in terms of how much vacation time they need. Let them take action and plan it. If they do abuse it, it s probably time to cut the cord anyway.Then, recognize that you made a hiring mistake. These things happen, but the overall message is still one of trust and empowerment.Part of building a successful company involves creating a culture of trust, and an unlimited PTO system achieves this on several levels. This concept might buck tradition, but isn t that the point of game-changing ideas?Related: Which Countries Get the Most Paid Time Off?

/article/245008,Avoid These 5 Small-Business HR Mistakes,"Not heeding these warnings can lead to costly mistakes, such as litigation and employee turnover.","To be a successful small-business owner, you must master the art of juggling. Owning and managing a small business means having to take on multiple roles, from accounting to marketing to human resources. Unfortunately, having to juggle the tasks of various roles increases the likelihood of making mistakes.It s easy for small-business owners to sometimes ignore the human resources side of business when things are running smoothly. However, doing so can lead to costly mistakes (think litigation and employee turnover) -- mistakes that could have serious consequences for small businesses.Related: In Praise of the Stealth Leader: The Oft-Unsung Hero of the OfficeHow can small-business owners keep from dropping the ball when it comes to HR? Here are five of the most common HR management pitfalls small businesses face today (and how to avoid them):1. The hiring process is overly hasty.When it comes to hiring workers for a small business, mistakes are all too common. From poor job descriptions that attract less-than-stellar candidates to a hurried interview process that results in hiring  warm bodies,  hiring mistakes can be detrimental to business. In fact, 27 percent of more than 6,000 HR professionals reported a single bad hire costing more than $50,000, according to a 2013 CareerBuilder survey.These hiring faux pas often stem from having an overly hasty hiring process. The solution? Create a consistent interview process and stick with it. Start with an accurate, clear job description that aims to attract quality talent. Including the right information (must-have/bonus qualifications, job duties, company info, etc.), in a conversational tone is the key to weeding out unqualified candidates from the get-go.One thing employers tend to overlook when hiring is interviewing for cultural fit. Ensuring a candidate will be a good addition to the company culture is just as important as having the right skills for the job -- especially for small businesses. Additionally, get more people involved in the interview process. The best hiring decisions are made as a team.2. Employees are misclassified.The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has been known to target small businesses in an effort to find employers who misclassify employees as  contractors.  To avoid the penalties that result from misclassifying employees for tax reasons, get familiar with what differentiates an employee from a contractor. In general, a person is only considered an independent contractor if they fit the following categories:Behavioral: The company does not have control or the right to control what the worker does or how they do their job.Financial: The company does not control the financial aspects of the worker s job, such as how the worker is paid, whether expenses are reimbursed, who provides work materials, etc.Relationship: The company doesn t have written contracts describing the business relationship between both parties, does not provide the worker with employee benefits, etc.Related: 5 Companies Tell Us How They Retain Their Best Talent3. Employee handbook is outdated (or nonexistent).To reduce employee violations, employers must have, update and communicate work-related policies. Businesses of all sizes need to have some form of an employee handbook. Not having company policies in writing is just asking for trouble.Having an employee handbook isn t enough, however. The policies outlined in the handbook need to be updated on a regular basis and communicated often. What s more, employees should sign an acknowledgment form stating that they have read and understand everything in the handbook.4. Employee training takes a backseat.When employers invest in their employees, they in turn invest in the company. This investment is most clearly demonstrated by providing various training opportunities for employees. These opportunities should begin with a thorough onboarding process for new hires and continue with professional development programs and events for current staff.By providing new hires with the tools they need to hit the ground running and current employees with opportunities to grow, employers can rest assured that employees at all stages are performing at peak performance.5. Performance issues aren t documented.Messy fires can lead to unwanted lawsuits. While no termination is a positive one, it can be easier when properly prepared for. That preparation starts by addressing and documenting performance-related issues. When performance problems arise, aim to nip them in the bud by addressing them during performance check-ins. This gives employees an opportunity to correct the issue.What happens when that feedback doesn t solve the problem? Sometimes terminations are unavoidable, but going about them the right way can avoid any unwanted issues. The key is to thoroughly document employee performance problems. It may seem time-consuming, but it can serve as valuable evidence should a termination be necessary.Related: Creating a Company Culture Where Employees Never LeaveAndre LavoieAndre Lavoie is the CEO of ClearCompany, the talent-management solution that helps companies identify, hire and retain more A players.

There s exceptional kids at the Cal state schools, at the University of New York system, and all these other places who have grit and determination and really fought to get there,  Bock told CNN.Another factor that Google doesn t weigh so heavily is college grades.  Your grades are somewhat predictive of your performance for your first two years of your career,  said Bock.  They re helpful as a signal, but after that it doesn t matter at all. Related: NFL Names 41-Year-Old Mother of Three Its First Full-Time Female RefereeAnd, as grads are clearly clamoring for a gig at Google -- which was named last year s best workplace in the world -- Bock says he s encountered his fair share of gimmicky applicants. One candidate tucked his resume inside a shoe  to get their foot in the door,  he says, and another mailed a robot that had completely shattered upon its arrival. Just put your best work on your resume,  Bock says.  We ll take a look at it. Bock, who just released a book entitled Work Rules! (Hachette, 2015), added that Google seeks four key qualities in new hires. These include: cognitive ability, or basic problem-solving skills; emergent leadership, meaning a willingness to step up and back as needed;  Googleyness  -- the company s term for a cultural fit; and intellectual humility. The least important thing,  Bock says,  is actually 'do you know how to do the job?'

/article/244326,Why You Need to Embrace the Big Data Trend in HR,"Big data is an increasingly available resource for recruiting and retaining the best talent, with substantial savings for employers.","Free Webinar | August 16thFind out how to optimize your website to give your customers experiences that will have the biggest ROI for your business.							Register Now  The big data trend has quickly made its way to the human resources industry, and HR professionals should embrace it with open arms.In fact, 6,400 organizations with 100 staff or more will have implemented big data analytics by 2018, according to a 2013 SAS study of more than 1,200 businesses. What s more, a Towers Watson survey of more than 1,000 organizations last year found HR data and analytics to be among the top three areas for HR technology spending.Related: Hire Better Talent With a Big-Data ScientistWhere HR is concerned, big data is a big deal. It empowers employers and human resources to make more informed business decisions. Here are four reasons to embrace this growing trend within the HR industry:1. Better insight. Big data  is a big buzzword reverberating throughout the business world, and for good reason. Big data serves as a window into employees  professional lives. By tracking, analyzing and sharing employee performance-related data, employers and HR not only gain more insight on employees, but boost individual motivation and overall engagement.Companies like The Container Store, for instance, are even using wearable tech, designed to improve communication within its stores, to track employees when they re at work. Using the Theatro Wearable Computer, store management can access performance data, including how employees communicate with coworkers and customers and where they spend the most of their time.  Applying big data analytics to employee performance can also help employers identify and acknowledge top performers, along with workers who may be struggling in their positions. Investing in talent management software can assist HR professionals in gathering and analyzing the data they need to evaluate individual performance levels.    2. Better retention.One big advantage of utilizing big data within the workplace is the opportunity to learn why employees leave -- and why they stay. With tools like employee satisfaction surveys, team assessments, social media, exit and stay interviews, etc. HR can essentially predict (and thus, prevent) employee attrition.Take Xerox, for example. With the use of big data analytics, it was able to cut its attrition rate at call centers by 20 percent. By analyzing various sources of employee information, HR can more accurately identify issues that lead to lower employee engagement, as well as opportunities to boost engagement.Related: Not Using Big Data for Hiring? You May Be Missing Out on the Best Candidates.3. Better training.Formal training programs, professional development events, lunch-and-learns with industry leaders -- employee training, while necessary, can be costly. In fact, The Association for Talent Development s (ATD) 2014 State of the Industry survey of 340 organizations found that, on average, these organizations spent $1,208 per employee on training and development.Measuring the potential and effectiveness of training initiatives, however, can ensure that employers are making wise investments concerning employee development. However, CEB s 2014 Global Assessment Trends Report revealed that only 45 percent of its 1,400 respondents use measures of potential to guide development and succession plans.  Employers should focus on obtaining data related to training program participation and outcome. Are employees taking advantage of the professional development opportunities being offered to them? Furthermore, are they applying what they learned through training programs, activities and events to their work?Conducting regular performance appraisals or incorporating 360-degree performance reviews can help employers and HR better understand the effectiveness of their professional development efforts.4. Better hires.With the use of big data, HR has an opportunity to become more analytical and strategic in acquiring candidates. Not to mention, this data can help employers avoid making bad hires. Twenty-seven percent of employers said a bad hire cost them more than $50,000, according to a 2013 CareerBuilder survey of more than 6,000 HR professionals. Big data prevents big mistakes.  Rather than relying heavily on repetitive resumes and  gut feeling  when it comes to hiring, take advantage of big data analytics. Learn more about potential hires through their various social media profiles, online resume databases, records of employment, applications, tests and even challenge-based games or contests, like Google s Code Jam, a global, online software-writing contest that attracts over 7,500 people each year.  This wealth of data can help employers and hiring managers identify great talent by sorting information into trends and narrowing down the talent pool.The bottom line? Big data can help employers and HR professionals gain more insight on existing talent to better retain and train. Plus, turn to data to land the best quality talent in the future.Related: Use Data as Your Secret Weapon to Find the Best Talent and Ensure Their SuccessMatt StrazMatt Straz is the founder and CEO of Namely, the HR and payroll platform for the world's most exciting companies.Read more",Inspiring Your Team,2015-04-06 16:30:00
/article/244126,4 Ways to Cater to the Mobile Job Seeker,Applicants are increasing turning to smartphones and tablets to find positions. Don't let your company miss our on these candidates.,"Today s job search no longer consists of skimming through the local newspaper or sitting at home mulling over one job board after another -- the job search has gone mobile. In fact, a 2014 Glassdoor survey of 1,000 employees and job seekers revealed that nine in 10 (89 percent) job seekers report they use a mobile device during their job search.What s more, that same survey found that nearly half (45 percent) of job seekers say they use their mobile device specifically to search for jobs at least once per day. With so many job seekers using their mobile devices in their job search, it s critical for employers to adopt this preferred method of communication to create an ideal candidate experience.Related: 4 Data-Backed Reasons to Use Mobile in the WorkplaceIn an effort to better cater to today s mobile job seeker, here are four ways to mobilize the candidate experience:1. Don t just be mobile-friendlyHaving a company career site that is mobile friendly simply means that it s viewable on mobile devices. Typically, that equates to hard-to-read text that forces visitors to pinch and zoom, pages that stretch beyond the width of the phone screen, requiring extensive scrolling, and links that are too small for anyone s finger -- overall, an unpleasant experience for job seekers.Rather than settling for a career site that is mobile friendly, optimize the site for mobile. Having an attractive and efficient mobile career site isn t just aesthetically pleasing, it s necessary. According to CareerBuilder s 2013 Candidate Behavior Study of 5,518 workers, two in five candidates say their perception of a company is negatively impacted if a company career site is not mobile optimized.2. Simplify the application processOnce the company career site has been mobile optimized, take it a step further by enabling job seekers to view and apply for jobs via their smartphones or tablets. With 27 percent of job seekers expecting to be able to apply for a job from their mobile device, according to Jobvite s 2014 Job Seeker Nation Study of 2,135 adults, it s becoming increasingly imperative to simplify the application process.Simply allowing job seekers to apply for jobs via their devices isn t enough, however. Just as career sites should be mobile optimized, so should job applications. A lengthy application form that is complicated to complete on a mobile device will only deter candidates.Instead, create a simplified application process that job seekers can easily complete without having to sit in front of a computer.Related: Millennials Would Like to Work for You, If They Can Apply on Their Smartphones3. Embrace the video interviewTo truly provide job candidates with a mobile experience, consider offering them the option to participate in a video interview. Platforms designed specifically for video interviewing make it easy for job seekers, who are constantly on the go or don t have a webcam, to take part in the interview process via mobile applications.While this shouldn t necessarily replace the in-person interview, video interviews can serve as an ideal method for screening job candidates. One-way video interviews, in particular, provide job seekers with a convenient way to showcase their personality and skill set early in the hiring process.4. Take mobile recruiting up a notchFor a lot of us, mobile devices have essentially become extensions of our hands. That s not hard to believe, considering that people between the ages of 18 and 36 check their phone an average of 43 times per day, according to a survey of 1,800 millennials conducted by SDL.Aside from having a mobile-optimized career site that enables job seekers to apply for open positions via their devices, take recruiting up a notch by sending job opening notifications via text messages. Occasionally sending a short and concise text message to subscribers, previous applicants, etc. regarding an open position ensures that the job opening is being seen.What do you think?

/article/243876,When Is it Time to Cut the Cord With New Hires?,"Here are four simple metrics to help determine if a new employee is up to speed and if not, how to help move along the process.","We ve all had them -- the new hire who takes a little too long to get adjusted, has a bad habit of leeching off of more seasoned employees and can t stop asking questions. While these things are to be expected from new hires, there comes a time when employers have to cut the cord with new (or not-so-new) employees.According to the 2012 Allied Workforce Mobility Survey of 500 human resource professionals nationwide, that time is eight months. However, the same survey found that nearly 30 percent of companies reported that it takes a year or more for new hires to reach full productivity.Related: Be the Change You Want to See in Your WorkforceNo two employees are alike. And they shouldn t be expected to reach the same level of productivity within the same timeframe. Rather, employers should measure employees as individuals and provide the tools new hires need to succeed early on in their career.Is it time to cut the cord with a new hire? Here are four simple metrics to help determine if a new employee is up to speed and if not, how to help move along the process:1. Think quality over quantitySpeed doesn t necessarily correspond with quality. Instead of focusing on how much an employee gets done in a day, focus on the quality of work they produce. A new hire who has grown comfortable in his or her position will have no trouble meeting expectations and producing top quality work.For new employees who might still be struggling to reach the productivity level of existing employees, make sure they clearly understand the job expectations. Regularly communicate expectations during their first couple of weeks on the job. Additionally, try providing them with reference materials or work examples that clearly outline or demonstrate what s expected.2. Keep an eye on deadlinesSure, quality beats quantity, but that doesn t make meeting deadlines any less important. While it s understandable for new hires to take a little longer on tasks than their more seasoned counterparts, missing deadlines can affect more than just individual success.To help new hires meet their deadlines, start them off with a task or two on their first day and slowly build up their workload as the week progresses. Giving new hires a few small, manageable tasks from day one will help them to get their feet wet and better prepare them for a typical workload later on.Related: 'Yes Men' No More: 5 Tips to Grow Engaged and Empowered Employees3. Get your priorities in orderOne surefire way to tell a new hire can stand on their own two feet is their ability to prioritize tasks. A new employee who is truly self-sufficient doesn t need to be told what to work on at the start of each day -- they know.Assist new hires in prioritizing their daily tasks by regularly meeting with them in an informal, one-on-one setting. Discuss their workload, expectations and quarterly goals. Having a clear understanding of what s expected of them and how their work contributes to the overall success of the organization can help them better manage their schedules.4. Remember: communication is keyTeam assessments and one-on-one employee evaluations can tell employers a lot about how an employee is adjusting to a new job. Speaking to a new hire s team members can give employers honest feedback on how the employee is performing and assimilating. Checking in with the individual employee can also give employers valuable insight on the onboarding process.Keep up regular communication with new hires during the first few months on the job. Regularly meeting with them can help both parties identify areas that may still need some work. Additionally, remind current staff about their roles in welcoming new hires and helping them live the cultural values and vision.What do you think?

/article/243632,10 Questions to Ask When Firing an Employee,"From how and when to break the news to how to avoid getting sued, here are the pro-tips you need to know when letting an underperformer go.","It s a sticky situation: An employee is underperforming and poisoning the well. You ve exhausted every attempt to help him save his job, but it s too late. Time to issue a pink slip.Before you drop the ax, there are several crucial considerations you should carefully think over. If you don t proceed with the utmost caution, you could land up in court, potentially caught up in a long, expensive and stressful wrongful termination battle.Related: The Critical Lesson of Letting Bad Employees GoAs a smart, responsible entrepreneur, you should have access to a business attorney, and you ll want to consult with him or her before terminating anyone s employment with your company. We spoke with Chas Rampenthal, general counsel for online legal resource solutions site LegalZoom, and came up with the following 10 questions to help guide you through the process of firing an employee:1. Am I abiding by company policy? If your company has a policy for dismissing employees, be sure to follow it meticulously, Rampenthal advises.  If you don t, then you better come up with one and follow it. Most separation of employment policies list specific steps to follow throughout the process. They should cover everything from running the decision to fire an employee up the proper chain of command, down to how to settle on a date of separation. Several helpful sample employment termination policies are available for free online from sites like The HR Specialist and The Society For Human Resource Management.Related: 2 Ways to Positively Identify and Fire Your Worst Employee2. Am I being fair?Rampenthal suggests that you seriously consider who supplied the incriminating information about an employee that led to the decision to fire him or her.  If a supervisor or co-worker supplied the reason for termination, be absolutely certain that it s good info,  Rampenthal cautions. Also, if someone is  getting fired for being late two times, even if your policy allows it, make sure that others who were late two times were also fired,  he says.  Basically, have a valid reason. If you re not fair across all employees, it can backfire and lead to legal trouble. 3. Am I following state and federal employment law? To be sure you don t violate state and federal law when terminating someone, Rampenthal advises that you consult with your company s human resources personnel or employment attorney ahead of the termination, or that you research applicable employment laws yourself, if needed. The U.S. Department of Labor thoroughly details federal rules and regulations regarding termination here. To find your state s labor laws, you can search here.  Related: How to Let Go of Employees With Love and DignityAs you likely know by now, federal law prohibits discrimination in employment based on certain protected classifications. Among them are race, ethnicity, gender, nationality, religion, age, veteran status, sexual orientation and disability.If you re firing someone on medical leave or an employee who recently revealed that she s pregnant, you might be at an increased risk of being sued, says Rampenthal. You could also be at a higher risk for legal ramifications if you re firing an employee who recently blew the whistle on a co-worker or a superior, or if you re dealing with an employee who has made claims of harassment or discrimination.4. What documentation of the cause of termination is needed? Rampenthal says there s technically no paperwork that s required to let someone go. However, documenting consistent underperformance is key when firing someone for not fulfilling his or her job duties. Keep a thorough written record of warnings you ve given the employee and of any improvement or probation plans provided. With consistent, written evidence of unsatisfactory performance in hand (or other offenses like absenteeism, misconduct or tardiness) you ll increase your chances of mounting a winning defense should a suit be filed.  Related: How to Respectfully Terminate Employees The more paperwork you have, the better paper trail you have, the more evidence you re going to have to show that you didn t fire them for an improper purpose,  says Rampenthal.  A failure to document makes it easier for someone to say,  Well, it obviously wasn t due to my performance. They fired me because I m over 40 or because I m an Asian-American or because I m a female or because I m a Protestant.  If an employee can find another reason for termination and that reason is protected, then the lack of a paper trail is going to really look poorly on the employer. 5. Where and when should I fire the employee? Whatever you do, don t fire the employee over the phone. Afford him or her the respect of a face-to-face exit interview.If you re concerned for your personal safety when letting someone go, Rampenthal suggests that you have another person -- preferably a fellow manager -- present during the firing.In terms of which day is best to let someone go, Rampenthal says he s heard it all.  Some say always do it on a Friday, never on a Monday,  he says.  Others say never on a Friday, always on a Monday, and don t do it after Thanksgiving or before the New Year. Truth is, there is no right day and time. It s going to be uncomfortable no matter when you do it.   6. What should I say to the employee when I fire him?  Be prepared to face a range of emotions, from sadness to anger,  Rampenthal says,  No matter what, stick to your plan, your script, and be professional -- which isn t easy when someone cries or slams the table or threatens you with violence. Related: Should That Employee Be Fired? Ask These 5 Questions First. Most importantly, remember that everything you say can be held against you in a court of law. Be brief, calmly state that you re dismissing the employee  for cause,  but don t go into specifics because they could be misconstrued, he says. Many employers find it best to simply state that the company is  going in a different direction.   7. What loose ends do I need to tie up? From providing the terminated employee s final paycheck to furnishing an explanation of COBRA health benefits, there are quite a few  final ducks  that Rampenthal says employers should prep before breaking the news.For example, you should pay any unused paid vacation and/or sick leave in the person s last paycheck. If you plan to grant the employee severance pay, include that in the final payout as well. You ll also want to arrange for the employee to promptly sign any necessary exit paperwork and return all company property, including laptops, I.D. cards, keys, phones, uniforms, etc. It s critical to contact your IT department to disable the person s company email and any other electronic access to company databases and other information systems.8. Should I break the news to my other employees?Do yourself and your organization a favor and stop the rumor mill of speculation before it starts. Consider calling a quick meeting to inform your team that you ve let an employee go. You don t have to tell them why he or she was fired, only that the individual is no longer with the company.Related: 4 Secrets to Firing Your First Employee9. What should I do if I hear from the terminated employee again? The best course of action is to be cordial and quick to refer the employee to your company s attorney or human resources representatives.  Most of the time it s sour grapes and doesn t amount to much,  Rampenthal says,  but you can t afford to buy a lawsuit because you failed to follow up on a claim of harassment or discrimination. 10. What should I do if a potential future employer of the fired employee calls me for a reference check?The only information you should provide are the dates the employee worked for you and the position he or she held -- nothing more in the interest of limiting liability. Any additional information you provide is purely voluntary,  but, remember, it can come back to haunt you if it gets back to your former employee,  Rampenthal warns.

Register Now  A business plan competition is aptly named, but business plans can t implement themselves. The hopeful entrepreneur behind the business plan is responsible for making sure it gets off the ground.When it comes to pitching business plans on a reality show, contestants often fail to win for a few reasons:Their idea doesn t resonate with the judgesThey can t pitch or write wellThey stumble over the assumptions behind their financial projectionsRelated: 5 Things Only Entrepreneurs Can Truly UnderstandThose reasons, however, are irrelevant to what matters. What matters is the person behind the pitch. Unfortunately, contestants and judges focus too much on the product. They get enamored with technology and dollars. Both are sexy and addictive, and both are some of the strongest subconscious motivators known to humans. But people have to come first.So how can we make pitch competitions more human? Judges should base their decision on whether the hopeful entrepreneur understands how to invest in understanding people -- customers and staff -- and in building authentic relationships with them. Taking the focus off of people means that the business won t be able to meet the needs of their customers and staff, or worse, they ll be treated like numbers. This may work in the short run, but in the long run this can result in loyalty issues.To show prospective backers that they re willing to invest in understanding people, hopeful entrepreneurs competing in business plan competitions should be able to demonstrate the following:1. They feel and understand the pain and frustration customers are experiencing. Furthermore, they demonstrate that the features of the solution they are proposing resonate with not only potential customers (those who will pay for the product that emerges from the proposed solution), but also potential user and potential channel members.Related: Success Will Never Come to Entrepreneurs Who Do These 10 Things2.

/article/243045,Companies That Are 'Best Places to Work' Share These 3 Things,How can employers be sure their organization is deemed a great place to work by employees -- even if they've yet to be officially recognized for it?,"Being featured on a  best places to work  list is an achievement many companies strive to earn. Many companies don t realize that they may already possess the qualities that make those featured companies worthy of praise.How can employers be sure their organization is deemed a great place to work by employees -- even if they ve yet to be officially recognized for it? Here are three signs a company deserves a highly coveted spot on a  best places to work  list:1. The company has a strong, positive culture.While everyone loves to take an occasional break to play a game of ping-pong or enjoy lunch on the company s dime, these fun work perks don t define a company s culture. A great culture starts with a clear vision. Regularly communicating this vision to the organization helps employees better align their work goals, in pursuit of the company s mission.Related: The Top 10 Companies to Work For in 2015A company s values are equally important. They determine the behaviors and mindsets needed to achieve company-wide goals. For instance, Nestle Purina PetCare, featured as one of Glassdoor s Best Places to Work 2015, moves its vision closer to becoming a reality with  Five Talls,  (stand tall with integrity, stand tall with passion) which references the values needed to reach its goals.Most important, a strong company culture comes down to its people. Employees should share a company s core values and adopt the overall mission as their own. This makes the need for hiring for cultural fit even more necessary.2. Employers invest in their employees.The people that make up an organization are a company s most important asset, so employers should invest in them as much as possible. This can easily be done by giving employees what they want most: opportunities to grow professionally.A 2013 CareerBuilder survey of more than 3,900 U.S. employees, found that 35 percent of workers agree increasing on-the-job training and development opportunities entices them to stay with a company. Opportunities for individual growth can range from mentorship programs to professional development events or webinars.At Bain & Company, another company awarded the title of  Best Place to Work  in 2015 by Glassdoor, invests in its people by providing ongoing world-class global training. These training sessions are held in various locations from San Francisco to Shanghai. It focuses on training and developing a global network of peers.Related: What's the No. 1 Thing Employees Would Change If They Were the Boss?In addition to helping employees grow in their respective positions, employers should also focus on team-building exercises. Focusing on team-building activities can help to build trust, ease conflicts, increase daily collaboration and encourage camaraderie among coworkers.3. Performance reviews are valued.Great places to work put more emphasis on certain aspects of the review process -- aspects such as ongoing feedback, recognition and goal alignment and achievement.Performance reviews give employers and their employees an opportunity to discuss past performance, in an effort to improve future performance for both parties. Employers that value input engage employees, while gaining helpful insight on how to better themselves as leaders. Additionally, holding regular, informal reviews can help employees maintain relevant work goals.In an effort to create a company culture that breeds happy, engaged employees, employers should also focus on recognizing individual employee accomplishments as often as possible. F5 Networks, Inc., also determined a  Best Place to Work,  recognizes outstanding employees every quarter. Paying attention to employee recognition and appreciation not only boosts morale, but it can also highlight what employers are looking for in their employees.What other ways can employers (and employees) tell their company is truly a great place to work?

/article/242877,Ask These 24 Interview Questions to Find a Marketing Rock Star,"Hiring can be an expensive process, so make sure you do it right the first time around.","When it s time to expand your startup s growing team, you can t go wrong with hiring a marketing strategist. Sure, accountants, customer service reps and other specialists are all important, but it s your marketing team that puts money directly back into your pocket.But, of course, you don t want just any marketer. You want a true rock star -- somebody who s going to move the needle for your business. Why is this important?Let s look at the Creative Group s most recent salary guide, which reports an average salary for content strategists of $72,500 to $100,000 per year. Now, let s add benefits to that. Joe Hadzima of the MIT Sloan School of Management puts these at an average of 25 to 40 percent of an employee s base salary. Even if you hire on the bottom end of the pay scale for this position and offer minimal benefits, you re still looking at total costs of $90,625 a year.That s huge, but it s not even the entire picture. Training magazine estimates that the average cost to train a single employee is $1,200 a year, while the National Association of Colleges and Employers puts average recruitment costs for companies with one to 500 employees at $7,645 per employee. Add that all together and we re now at $99,470 -- nearly six figures -- before we even take into consideration the average 1 to 2.5 percent of total profits the Mellon Financial Corp. estimates are lost due to diminished productivity while onboarding new hires.Related: 7 Interview Questions To Help You Hire SuperstarsThink about it for a second. As huge as that number may seem, what happens if you make a bad hiring decision?Picking the wrong employees results in wasted time and lost money. To help you avoid this expensive scenario, I ve put together a list of 25 of the questions I use when filling marketing positions. They ve helped me recruit some of the top talent in my industry, and I m sure they ll help you find your own marketing rock star.Fact-based questionsMost interviewers start with fact-based questions, and there s nothing wrong with that. Fact-based questions let you confirm whether the candidate has the skills you re looking for, in addition to providing you with information that can be cross-checked against his or her reference to verify accuracy.Believe me, if you do your due diligence and determine that a candidate lied to you on the following questions, that s a huge red flag not to go forward!1. How long did you work at your last job?2. How long have you worked in the industry?3. Where did you go to school?4. What was your favorite subject of study?5. Have you ever managed employees before?6. Have you ever been fired from a previous position?7. What has been your most successful campaign in the past?8. What marketing strategies do you prefer to use?Situational questionsOf course, fact-based questions should only be a part of the puzzle. While they might give you valuable information, they don t provide any insight into how the candidate will handle the unique situations that may arise at your company. For that, you ll need to ask situational questions such as the following:1. You ve just picked up a call from a customer who claims to have not received his shipment, even though UPS confirms it was delivered. What do you do?2. A customer has just posted a negative review to the company s Facebook page and you re in charge of responding. How do you handle it?Related: 5 Pitfalls Employers Should Avoid During the Hiring Process3. An SEO technique you ve used successfully in the past has just been devalued by Google.

You ve been put in charge of planning the company s nationwide conference. Where do you begin?6. One of your employees has just accidentally posted a personal tweet to the company s account. How will you handle her?7. What do you do to stay up to date with new marketing techniques?8. What recently-developed marketing strategy, technique or tool interests you the most right now?Behavioral questionsFinally, be sure the round out your interviews with behavioral questions, as candidates  past behavior tends to be a pretty good predictor of how they ll act in the future. Any of the following question prompts should get you started:1. Tell me about how you handled a situation where you had to work with a difficult colleague.2. Describe a time where you made a major mistake and had to think on your feet to come up with a solution.3. Tell me about a past situation where you had to juggle multiple projects with competing deadlines.4. Tell me about a time where you had to put in significant effort up front and then wait a long time for success.5. Describe a situation at a past job where you had to take initiative.6. Tell me about a time when you received criticism and how you reacted to it.7. Share with me a past situation where you had to work with colleagues or team members who were very different from you.8. Tell me about the project you re most proud of from your past work history.Obviously, this isn t a comprehensive list, and you ll want to modify or exclude some of the questions above based on your company s needs.If you have other interview questions that you ve used in the past to hire rock star marketers, share them in the comments section below.Related: Here's the Right Way to Screen Potential Job CandidatesEric SiuEric Siu is the CEO of digital marketing agency Single Grain, which has helped venture-backed startups and Fortune 500 companies grow their revenues.

/article/242961,4 Ways to Use Technology In the Workplace to Motivate Employees,"Technology can streamline work, enhance performance monitoring and lead to more engaged workers.","Finding creative strategies to motivate employees isn t easy. Sure, employers can keep their employees engaged and motivated with benefits like free lunches, unlimited PTO and company-hosted social events, but for employers looking for something a little less conventional, try embracing more tech in the workplace.Here are four ways technology can help managers boost engagement and create a motivated workforce:1. Increase sharing and collaboration.Cloud-based file sharing tools like Google Drive and Dropbox are gaining traction within businesses both small and large. They can be helpful in motivating employees to get things done by eliminating basic frustrations in the workplace (i.e. spending entirely too much time searching for files in a disorganized shared drive).In addition to making it easier to find and share documents with team members, cloud-based sharing tools can keep track of who s working on what and encourage collaboration among coworkers. Something these sharing tools have that traditional onsite file servers lack is the ability to access files remotely on mobile devices, which makes doing business while on the go easier than ever.Related: 3 Productivity Apps for Boosting Teamwork and Employee Collaboration2. Gain a better view of individual performance. We all want 360-degree performance management, but few us have it. Talent management software is the answer to obtaining a 360-degree view of individual performance. Its primary purpose is to help managers gain a broader perspective on employees, since they can only see so much firsthand.Seeing more means being able to do more for employees. Not only does it facilitate ongoing feedback and solicit peer feedback, but it can help managers and employees identify personal strengths and weaknesses to create a competency framework for individual development and succession planning. It also makes the performance review process a whole lot easier for both parties.Related: 5 Ways HR Technology Can Improve Performance Reviews3. Provide and receive real-time feedback.The performance review tends to come around on an annual or quarterly basis, but feedback should be ongoing. Unfortunately, according to a 2013 survey of 6,000 HR professionals by the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM), a mere 2 percent of employers provide ongoing feedback to their employees.Rather than waiting for performance review season to dish out criticism and offer praise, automating the performance review process with HR software can make giving and receiving real-time feedback a cinch. Instant feedback mechanisms can significantly improve engagement and motivation by consistently guiding employees in the right direction. It can also give employees the ability to offer suggestions directly to management and valuing employee input is yet another motivational tool.        4. Facilitate learning on the go. No one really wants to bring work home with them, but sometimes it s necessary to get ahold of certain work-related items outside of the office. Cue the mobile app. Mobile applications give employees the flexibility they need and want when it comes to file accessibility.Using tech in the workplace that is mobile-optimized is important when it comes to accessing important company information or documents when not at the office. In fact, a 2013 Mobile Helix survey of 300 IT decision makers estimated that their organizations would see nearly a 40 percent boost in productivity if key enterprise applications were mobilized.There s no denying that the mobile revolution has forever changed the way we work, learn and play. When it comes to motivating employees, mobile apps are essential.Related: How Learning-as-You-Go Is Part of the Entrepreneur's JourneyMatt StrazMatt Straz is the founder and CEO of Namely, the HR and payroll platform for the world's most exciting companies.Read more",Workplace Technology,2015-02-23 19:30:00
/article/242381,What's the No. 1 Thing Employees Would Change If They Were the Boss?,"According to study participants, culture and organization fit are a top concern. It should be yours, too.","Many managers face the same question every year: What changes should be made to improve our workplaces and our overall levels of employee engagement? One potential source of ideas comes from a recent report by TINYhr s. Titled, The New Year Employee Report, this survey clearly spells out what employees would change -- if only they had the power.Related: Biz Stone: Good Works Can Shape Your Company's Mission and MarketAccording to the survey, which asked participants what one thing they d like to change about their managers, the top five answers are:15 percent would improve communication11 percent would want their boss to quit or retire10 percent would seek to improve empathy and people skills8 percent would increase wages7 percent would wish for better team leadersCertainly, it shouldn t be a surprise that communication concerns top the list. Further research by Clear Company HRM says that  86 percent of employees and executives cite lack of collaboration or ineffective communication for workplace failures.  When communication fails, extra work is required, whether because employees must rework projects that were initially completed incorrectly due to miscommunications or because multiple employees mistakenly work on the same tasks as the result of unclear instructions.That said, the story gets even more interesting when TINYhr s team turned the tables and asked employees what the first thing they d change if they were the boss. The top five responses, in addition to the percentage of respondents prioritizing each response, are below:16 percent would fire, demote or make other changes to improve employee caliber11 percent would seek to establish standards for behaviors and company policies11 percent would want to improve communication10 percent would improve wages and benefits9 percent would modify working hoursWhat does it say about an organization when employees want to fire their colleagues?""It goes back to an organization s culture and the impact colleagues have on culture and workplace satisfaction,"" says David Niu, founder and CEO of TINYhr. ""Our data has shown that peers are the biggest influence on colleagues going the extra mile, and this further supports that point. Is your organizational culture up to snuff? Or would your own employees report the concerns listed above? Even if you believe that your employees are satisfied with your workplace communication, consider the following tips to further enhance your company s culture.Related: 6 Steps to Strengthening Company Culture (Infographic)Culture as a competitive advantageWhen I was compiling research for my  It Really Pays to Have a Rich Company Culture  infographic, I was shocked by how important organizational culture can be to a business s bottom line. Take, for example, the Columbia University study that found that job turnover at companies with a rich internal culture averages about 13.9 percent, while those that don t focus on employee fit experience turnover rates as high as 48.4 percent.When you consider how costly turnover can be, that s a pretty major loss!  But that isn t the only way company culture affects profitability. According to statistics provided by the New Century Financial Corporation, happy, actively-engaged employees produce better results than their unhappy peers. In an example cited in their research, banking account managers who were disengaged from their work produced 28 percent less revenue than their happier coworkers.There s a reason happier employees yield better business results. Employees that are satisfied with their work environment are more likely to complete their projects on time, to a higher degree of satisfaction, than those who don t care about their work. They re less likely to procrastinate and more likely to go out of their way to solve difficult problems -- traits that all managers want to see in their employees.Make  fit  part of the hiring processClearly, there are legitimate business reasons to improve organizational culture. But while there are changes you can make to improve the relationships between your existing managers and employees, a far better approach is to take culture into consideration from the beginning. By making  fit  a part of the hiring process, you ll minimize your chances of encountering profit-diminishing conflicts down the road.And when it comes to considering job candidate fit, the easiest way to incorporate this technique is to get representatives from all levels of your staff involved in the hiring process. Once you ve identified a few top choices for your open positions, invite candidates out for lunch with a team of your current employees or invite them all to some other social activity where guards will be let down.You don t need to make your decisions on your staff s feedback exclusively, as job skills and other characteristics are just as important, but you should take their opinions into consideration. After all, they re the ones that will be working closest with your new hires, and it s their productivity that will suffer if candidates are a poor fit for your organizational culture.Every organization has its issues, and fixing them isn t going to happen overnight. If you re a business owner or manager, think about different ways to strengthen your organization s culture and then put your ideas into action. By creating guidelines and setting expectations from the hiring process on, you ll cultivate the kind of atmosphere that attracts, retains and delights top-performing employees.Related: Hiring for Your Startup: 3 Tips to Find the Right PeopleEric SiuEric Siu is the CEO of digital marketing agency Single Grain, which has helped venture-backed startups and Fortune 500 companies grow their revenues.

/article/242425,5 Ways to Help Employees Help Themselves,Encouraging workers to be independent and confident from the get-go will have many benefits for the company's bottom line.,"With 90 percent of companies believing that their employees make the decision to stay at or leave a company within the first year, as found in a 2013 Aberdeen study of 230 organizations, making a great first impression to new hires is crucial.The first step to making an immediate positive impression is having an effective onboarding process in place. A successful onboarding process is designed to develop and retain employees.Luckily, the process can be simplified for managers and employees alike, by creating an onboarding system that helps employees essentially help themselves during their beginning stages at the company. Here are five ways employers can aid employees in being independent and confident from the get-go:1. Assign new hires a mentor.In an effort to expedite new employee training, consider assigning new hires a mentor for at least their first few weeks on the job. Mentorship programs give employees an opportunity to learn from more seasoned employees, as well as build connections within the workplace early on.Related: Are Your Employees in Danger of Suffering Heartbreak?How does this help employees help themselves? It provides them with a go-to person. Having a go-to person for questions, comments and concerns is comforting to new employees and helps combat nerves associated with starting a new job. New employees will likely feel more comfortable asking mentors questions than they would be asking a supervisor, which ensures that new hire concerns are being addressed. Mentorship programs bring new hires up to speed in less time, and serve as a much-needed reference.2. Offer (and encourage) opportunities for development.Only 15 percent of organizations extend onboarding beyond six months, and that number drops drastically to 2 percent for year-long onboarding, according to the aforementioned Aberdeen study. Traditional onboarding programs don t last very long, but in order to help employees be more self-sufficient, extending the onboarding process to provide continued development is a must. After the initial onboarding is complete, continue to offer new hires relevant training and development opportunities.The responsibility of training doesn t just fall on employers, however. Many employees take it upon themselves to develop their skills professionally. Encourage employees to search for opportunities to sharpen their skills -- professional development events, relevant webinars, lectures -- on their own time. Recognize employees for their efforts to learn and develop work-related skills outside of the workplace. Better yet, have them present what they learned during team meetings so that everyone can benefit.3. Automate the process.This is a big one. Automating the administrative side of the onboarding process makes onboarding simpler for both employers and employees, by making it easy to assign, track and store new hire paperwork and tasks. Long gone are the days of costly paper packets and repetitive data entry. In its place, companies are adopting a paperless system for bringing new hires on board. Doing so will help employers and employees stay organized throughout employee onboarding.Related: 5 Keys to Successfully Manage Creative EmployeesImplementing technology into the onboarding process helps get that pesky paperwork out of the way sooner, so more time can be spent on other aspects of the process. Not only does automating the onboarding process make things easier for employers, but having everything all in one place enables employees to easily refer back to necessary info when needed.4. Welcome new hire feedback.Invite new hires to participate in creating an onboarding process, that benefits them, by welcoming their feedback -- both constructive and positive. They ll appreciate being able to give their two cents. Encourage new hires to provide feedback on the onboarding process by asking them questions pertaining to their personal experience. What did they find most helpful from the process? What would they have liked to see that they didn t?There s no better way to create a successful onboarding program than by asking those who experienced it what they thought. Asking for feedback will help employers better tailor their onboarding programs to suit the needs to new hires.5. Be MIA (sometimes).Sometimes the best way to create self-sufficient employees is by being unavailable, as it forces employees to figure things out on their own once in awhile. Although an open-door policy is widely encouraged, occasionally it s necessary to close the door for a bit and hang that  Do Not Disturb  sign. Doing so will promote employee independence by making it so that employees have to get by without an manager s assistance.This is another case where having a mentor assigned to an employee can be helpful. It provides new hires with someone to refer to and frees up some time for employers. Not to mention, encouraging independence in the workplace helps build trust between employers, employees and co-workers alike.Do you know of some other ways employers can help their employees help themselves during the onboarding process?

/article/242382,"The Industry With the Happiest Employees, and How You Can Follow Its Lead",There are lessons you can take to your business to boost satisfaction among your team members.,"Are some industries destined to have a happy workforce, while others will be left with sullen workers who are unhappy with their career prospects? One possible answer to the question comes from research conducted by TINYpulse, whose 2015 Best Industry Ranking Report reveals some interesting insights into the happiest (and unhappiest) industries around.The TINYpulse report surveyed more than 30,000 employees from more than 500 companies on their overall job satisfaction, coming up with the following results:Related: A CEO's New Year's Resolutions to Improve Employee SatisfactionAre you surprised to see construction and facilities Services at the top of that list? Further questions by TINYpulse uncovered the following reasons these workers care so much for their jobs:According to this report, there are two major factors driving workplace happiness among this group:Satisfaction with peers and colleaguesSatisfaction with the nature of one s individual projects.Sure, other variables such as work environment and quality of management teams appear to play a role as well. But according to David Niu, founder and CEO of TINYpulse:These findings are remarkable because they show me that any leader -- no matter the industry that they re in -- has the power to make workplace changes to materially impact job satisfaction.Does this mean you should trade in your job for a hard hat or shutdown your company to launch a construction or facilities services firm? Of course not. Doing so won t automatically make you happy, but you can learn some lessons from these happy workers that can be used to boost satisfaction among your own employees.Think about culture fitWhen you re interviewing candidates, do you focus only on their skill sets? When promoting internally, do you focus exclusively on the candidate s professional accomplishments? If you said  yes  to either of those, there s a good chance you re failing both your culture and bottom line.Related: Today's Most Satisfied Employees Demand These 4 ThingsAs you screen candidates for new positions -- either internally or externally -- keep your company s values at the front of your mind. Ask candidates interview questions based around these standards to determine whether they ll be a good fit for the kind of culture you re trying to create. For example, any of the following questions could be used to evaluate this important aspect: Here at ABC Company, we value creativity. Can you tell me about a situation where you found a creative solution to a problem? One of our top values here at ABC Company is integrity. Tell me about a situation where you were asked to compromise your ethics and how you responded. Our top priority is the satisfaction of our customers. Share with me an example of a time you went above and beyond to make a customer happy. What do you like to do for fun? That last question doesn t revolve around any particular corporate values, but it s still a useful addition to this list. Say, for example, that your office is full of adventure-seekers who pack up each weekend to go rock climbing, kayaking or hiking. If you re confronted with a promising candidate who prefers to spend the weekends curled up alone with a good book, you could be looking at a future culture clash.As you listen to a candidate s responses, try to determine how they prefer to work with others, as well as how they manage and deal with workplace pressures. Listen for them to elicit their expectations for communication methods, as well as how they ve embodied your company s core values in the past. You don t need to find a perfect culture fit in every new employee, but if you want to create a positive, supportive and collaborative environment, then you must hire and promote only those who reflect your company s values.Working with employee-job fitNow, imagine that -- using the questions above -- you found and hired a great new employee. He s smart, ambitious, collaborative and innovative -- but he hates his day-to-day responsibilities. What do you do? Sit around and wait for him to quit?This scenario highlights a challenge that many companies face. Even if an employee s personal fit with the company culture is ideal, it s still possible that on-the-job issues can lead to dissatisfaction. This is a major issue, as the Harvard Business Review has found that low-level employee engagement within companies can result in a 33 percent drop in operating income and an average decrease in earnings growth of 11 percent.If this scenario scares you, and it should, your best solution is to work with unhappy team members, instead of letting their dissatisfaction linger. Figure out which of their responsibilities they love and which are bringing them down. Then, either make changes to their assignments or wait for a better job to open up in the company. Your employees will get the professional growth they re seeking, and you get to keep your rock-star colleagues. It s a win-win.Data gathered by TINYpulse suggests that managers in the construction and facilities services sector have taken these recommendations to heart, resulting in the happiest employees across all industries surveyed. But hiring the right people and focusing on employee-job fit are changes any leader can make. By paying attention to culture fit and making sure employees are satisfied with their assignments, you too can help keep your workers both happy and productive.Have you taken similar steps to help keep your employees happy?

/article/242427,"Yes, There Is a Disconnect Between Employers and Employees on Work-Life Balance",Employers will need to be more flexible with employees as their demands increase.,"The lack of personal time is a major concern by employees who are struggling, trying to live a more balanced life. In a new study between my company and CareerArc, we found that 67 percent of HR professionals think their employees have a work-life balance, yet almost half (45 percent) of employees feel that they don't have enough time each week to do personal activities.Some employees (20 percent) are even spending more than 20 hours each week working outside the office on their personal time. They simply can't balance their work time and personal time because management expects them to be on call more hours during the day. New technologies and globalization have expanded the typical 9-to-5 workday into a 24/7 ""always on"" business environment that's almost inescapable.While technology -- including smartphones, gamification and social networking -- has helped employees develop stronger networks, learn faster and become more valuable to employers, it's also broken the boundaries we all used to have between our personal and professional lives.Related: Gen Z Employees: The 5 Attributes You Need to KnowIn the survey, we found that 65 percent of employees say that their manager expects them to be reachable outside of the office by either email or phone. Sixty-four percent of HR professionals said they have those same expectations. While HR suffers from the same work-life imbalance as all employees do, they typically don't have the hours of IT, customer service professionals and sales people, who have to base their time on the customer's needs -- some of whom might be in other countries where time zones are different.A growing need for flexibility These growing concerns from employees have forced HR to start prioritizing workplace flexibility programs. More than half (53 percent) of companies surveyed plan to invest more in their programs this year because they are receiving tangible benefits, including improved employee satisfaction (87 percent) and increased productivity (71 percent). Employers are also seeing their retention rate increasing and their recruiting strategy becoming more effective as a result.In order to get a better handle on how to construct the right program for your organization, HR should survey them to see what benefits are most important, and employees should speak up to HR or their managers about their work-life issues. For instance, companies can experiment by having their employees work from home one day a week or by giving them business phones that they can shut off after a certain hour each day.Related: Why 'Gen Z' May Be More Entrepreneurial Than 'Gen Y'Some companies are leading the way with successful programs, including Aetna and MITRE. At Aetna, nearly half of their workforce can work from home full-time, which many companies were concerned about in our study. We found that HR feels that the biggest concern of establishing a program is employees abusing the system (42 percent). This was not an issue at Aetna, which has built a culture of trust, lowered its turnover and improved employee productivity. In the process, Aetna says it saves about $80 million annually.At MITRE, 90 percent of the company s workforce engages in some form of flexibility, whether it's a shortened workweek or some form of telecommuting. After surveying their workforce on the top reasons why they work at the company, their flexibility program has consistently surfaced as one of the top reasons.Workplace flexibility programs will continue to be in high demand because of advances in technology, globalization, companies wanting to cut down on real estate costs, and more millennials having children. Based on the preferences of employees, and their numerous employment choices, I believe that all companies in the future will offer at least a basis program for employees. This new standard will be good, not just for employees of all ages and positions, but for HR professionals who will seek the same support.Related: Why College Students Need to Be Entrepreneurial With Their CareersDan SchawbelDan Schawbel is a career and workplace expert, the founder of Millennial Branding and author of the New York Times bestselling book, Promote Yourself: The New Rules For Career Success (St. Martin's Press, 2013).

/article/242332,How to Deliver Constructive Feedback With a 'You Suck Sandwich',"Providing criticism to a team member can be a real challenge, especially if done wrong. Here is a simple and easy to remember strategy that will help you avoid uncomfortable confrontations.","Early in my career, I was tasked with providing annual performance reviews to a group of highly trained and experienced consultants, each of whom were much older than me. I was young and fresh out of graduate school, and because I was originally hired to develop new consulting tools and provide support for the team, I was nervous about now being asked to critique them.It did not go well. And by ""not well,"" I mean that I narrowly avoided a violent uprising.Related: Make Performance Reviews Less Dreadful With These 5 TipsIn addition to being ill-equipped to critique anyone, my attempt to over-confidently demonstrate knowledge and establish authority made me look pompous and arrogant. Seeing the trouble, a close colleague and mentor pulled me aside and gave me a simple piece of advice.""You need to give them the 'You Suck Sandwich.'""As funny as it sounded, it turned out to be brilliant advice. Here is how he described the process.Lay down a bottom slice of soft bread.The first piece of the sandwich is a soft layer of bread, which will serve as the cushion for the crushing criticism you are about to provide. This piece of the conversation is a structured, thoughtful and sincere discussion of what the team member has done well to this point, how he or she has contributed value, and why you are happy they have continued to serve an integral part of the organization.Remember that this must be sincere, so do not overdo your gushing enthusiasm and have specific examples of how they have contributed.Give them the meat.The meat of your discussion (a nicely served up pun) is the actual critique of his or her performance, during which time you will identify problem areas in need of improvement. It is very important to prepare proposed solutions in advance, because identifying problems without solutions will simply come across as complaining. A great way to start this conversation is with a question. What areas of your job do you feel you can improve upon? Related: How to Turn an Underperformer Into an Ideal EmployeeBy first offering the team member the opportunity to honestly critique their own performance, you can then more comfortably lead into the discussion about how they can improve. If the employee misses the issues you have identified in advance, try to tie them together or simple address each individually. As you discuss the challenges, be prepared to quickly offer solutions, but allow the employee to contribute to this part of the discussion by asking them for feedback. How do you believe we can work together to resolve this? By empowering your team members and allowing them to take an active role in identifying areas of improvement and goals for resolving them, you will greatly improve your chances of sticking to the actions and getting results.Lay down the top slice of bread.The last slice of bread that you layer will be the inspiration. You have covered the uncomfortable part of the conversation, and now it is time to wrap it up with optimism for the future. Conclude with another honest and sincere discussion of the future direction of the business and how the team member fits in. Leave him or her with the understanding that future success is dependent on the entire team, which why it is important that you all aim high.It has been a while since I have delivered an actual annual performance review, because my personal belief is that constructive feedback should be delivered on a much more regular basis. Regardless of when you deliver your feedback, just remember to serve it up as a ""You Suck Sandwich,"" and you will avoid uncomfortable situations that could ultimately lead to violent uprisings.It worked for me.What do you think?

/article/242134,Make Performance Reviews Less Dreadful With These 5 Tips,"If your process has lost its way, employees will be on edge and your company will see barely any benefits from reviews.","Performance reviews have earned a bad rap. Employers and employees alike frequently criticize the performance-appraisal process for being a waste of time and negatively affecting workplace morale. In fact, according to the 2013 Employee Recognition Programs survey by the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM), 49 percent of human-resource professionals believe their performance-review process needs to be re-evaluated.Related: 6 Must-Dos for the Next Performance ReviewThe key to conducting successful (less dreadful) performance reviews is to focus them on the development of employees, rather than just evaluating an employee to determine if a raise in pay is deserved. It s time to review the performance review. Here are five ways to tell an organization s performance reviews have lost their way:1. Employee anxiety is at an all-time highLittle in the workplace is quite as anxiety inducing as the employee-performance review. Most of us have been there and know it to be true. If employee anxiety is tangible, however, it may be time to re-evaluate the performance-review process. In an effort to reduce anxiety levels associated with performance appraisals, be transparent throughout the year about employee performance.Employees who are better prepared for performance reviews will spend less time fearing them. Providing regular feedback, rather than reserving it for formal reviews, will help prepare employees for what will be discussed. Additionally, employees that understand the review process is intended to benefit them will likely be more receptive to corrective feedback.2. Lack of growth between performance reviewsOne of the best methods for determining whether performance reviews are successfully developing good employees into great employees is measuring the growth between past and current reviews. If individual employee goals are not being met and performance has not improved, employers should start by taking a close look at their performance-review process.How are employees benefiting from employer reviews? Is corrective feedback being given? Are goals being effectively communicated and evaluated? The primary purpose of the performance review should be employee development. Offering plenty of helpful feedback and helping employees set achievable goals for the quarter should be the main focus of the process.Related: Ask the Right Questions About Your Data to Build Business Value3. Confrontation vs. conversationPerformance reviews should be a dialogue between employer and employee -- not a one-way discussion. This process is not only designed to develop employees, but also to evaluate a company s leadership. Encourage employees to supply feedback by asking questions such as,  How can I help to make your job easier?  or  What don t you like about my management style?  It s a win-win. Employees will appreciate being asked for their opinions, and employers will gain valuable insight into their own performance.4. Performance reviews come around once a yearWhy companies still insist on having only annual performance appraisals is beyond me. The holiday season is busy enough without the time consuming administration and feelings of unease that can accompany reviews. Rather than waiting until the end of the year to review a year s worth of performance data, try conducting performance reviews on a quarterly basis.Regular one-on-one meetings simplify the process of setting relevant goals and monitoring progress. Not to mention, it reduces the amount of employee apprehension associated with more formal, annual performance reviews.5. Technology plays no role in the processEmployers should strive to keep up with the times -- as far as performance reviews are concerned. That means adopting the latest HR technology, and incorporating it into the review process. For starters, HR tech fosters collaboration between managers and employees during reviews.It can also improve real-time feedback, which is vital to ongoing employee development. Most importantly, automating portions of the performance-review process can help keep employers and employees organized by allowing users to store and monitor performance data in a single place.What signs helped you determine a review of the performance review was needed?

/article/241697,5 Tips for More Easily Managing Your Human Capital,Simplifying the challenge of managing a growing workforce is better for the company and appreciated by employees.,"Successful companies regard employees as their most valuable asset and biggest investment. As the workforce grows, however, managing people within an organization becomes much more of a hassle for employers. In fact, according to a 2013 survey of 1,293 HR leaders conducted by Lumesse, 52 percent of respondents strongly agreed that their role has required them to manage increasing levels of complexity.Managing human capital doesn t have to be such a challenge. Here are five ways to simplify human capital management (HCM) in an effort to develop and retain employees and make employers  jobs a little bit easier:1. Create employee profiles.Successfully managing employees in a workforce that is continuously growing is no easy feat, especially when employers can't connect a name to a face. Getting to know employees is easier with individual employee profiles. Regardless of the platform used, these profiles are a helpful tool for managing human capital. They allow managers to collect and store important employee information in one place while also encouraging sociability and comradery among coworkers.Related: How Big Data Will Change Everything About Managing Employees2. Streamline employee onboarding.The onboarding process serves as a new hire s first impression of a company, which stresses the importance of having a smooth onboarding system in place. Technology plays a key role in simplifying HCM. It helps employers store, track and manage new hire paperwork, create new hire tasks and monitor progress, as well as foster socialization through online portals.Unlike traditional onboarding methods, automated onboarding procedures can be used and referred to as often as needed -- saving companies both time and money on new hire training.      3. Revive the performance review.While the annual performance review isn t dead, for many companies, it s on its last legs. Luckily, there is a lot that can be done to save performance appraisals in an effort to better manage employees.For starters, employers should aim to keep the review process as simple as possible. This can easily be done by asking employees only key questions and focusing on core competencies.Employers should also strive to build a regular feedback culture by incorporating self-ratings, peer reviews and manager assessments into the HCM system. Encouraging feedback from employees and their peers can give managers a perspective on performance they might not otherwise get.Finally, automate portions of the performance review process with software. This way, more time can be spent on other aspects of HCM.  4. Offer unlimited PTOOffering unlimited paid time-off is still new in the corporate world. In fact, only 1 percent of U.S. companies currently offer unlimited PTO, according to the Society for Human Resource Management s 2014 report on employee benefits.Flexible paid time-off policies simplify HCM by eliminating the tedious process of calculating vacation accrual and tracking employee absences. It s also an attractive benefit to job seekers and boosts employee performance and morale.Related: Unlimited Paid-Time Off? Seriously? How to Make It Work.5. Embrace mobility in the workplace  With 1.75 billion smartphone users worldwide last year, as found in a 2014 report by eMarketer, it s no wonder mobile applications are on the rise in the workplace. Using mobile in the workplace has helped spur the improvement and management of the employee experience.Mobility provides employers and employees alike the flexibility to work from anywhere, at any time (even while on the run). Let s not forget that it also simplifies communication within the workplace by encouraging feedback and removing time zone and location barriers. With mobile tools, employers and employees can integrate their personal and professional lives as needed.Related: The Wisdom Behind Making Workplace Apps Easy to Use Matt StrazMatt Straz is the founder and CEO of Namely, the HR and payroll platform for the world's most exciting companies.Read more",Human Resources,2015-01-26 16:30:00
/article/241924,A Proactive Approach to Addressing Unethical Behavior in the Workplace,Smaller companies migh not have formal procedures for accountablity. Here's why maintaining high standards is a good long-term practice.,"While it may not rise to the level of being illegal, unethical behavior in the workplace can have serious consequences if unaddressed. And it can create a toxic work environment in which your employees and business ultimately suffer.When the authors of Crucial Accountability gave an online survey to more than 900 working people in 2013, the three most common unethical workplace behaviors cited were taking credit for someone else s work, indulging in extra long breaks and calling in sick when actually well. One-third of the respondents reported having witnessed at least one of these violations the week prior to participating the survey.Moreover, with the 63 percent of the survey respondents who witnessed unethical behavior, only half of the time was the misdeed reported. When asked why this was the case, four main reasons were cited by survey participants: It might have damaged their career. It would have made the offender harder to work with. They didn t think they would be taken seriously. Or they weren t sure how to bring up their concerns.At large businesses, a human resources department or manager can provide a way for employees to voice their concerns about unethical behavior of colleagues and provide policies, procedures and training. At smaller businesses with few resources and little or no HR support, creating an avenue for reporting or disclosing unethical behavior is challenging, as is putting in place the proper guidance for addressing such behavior.If your business lacks robust HR support, it's critical for employees to have an easy way to report their concerns and for your company to put in place policies, protocol and training related to unethical behavior. Entrepreneurs can take the following steps to proactively address unethical behavior at work:1 Create a code of ethics.Set the tone for behavior in your workplace by creating a code of ethics. A code of ethics establishes the values that are important to a business and creates a common framework for understanding the boundaries within the organization.Codes of ethics should be written in broad, idealistic terms to communicate the company s ethical vision, yet be succinct enough to be contained in a values statement. If it makes sense, include ethical expectations in the company's mission statement and employee handbooks.Be sure to involve key employees in the process of drafting and formalizing the code of ethics. This will ensure that leaders are on board with and committed to the values.Related: J.D. Power: How I Stayed True to My Values Over 50 Years2. Establish a protocol.Include in your code of ethics instructions about how to report unethical behavior. For example, set up an anonymous ethics hotline as well as a clear protocol for reporting, such as requesting a private meeting with the appropriate manager or supervisor.Additionally, if a concern or violation is reported and the company lacks internal HR resources, ensure that the person tasked with responding is the furthest removed from the concern.Delegating someone as far removed as possible sets a tone that the concern will be taken seriously and creates trust in your company's ability to address the matter fairly. If retaining an appropriate internal person isn t an option, consider investing in an external HR partner who can bring impartiality to the process.Related: 5 Ways to Help Build Your Integrity3. Empower employees.Grant staff the know-how to appropriately identify and handle ethics violations. Accomplish this by implementing ethics-training programs for all new and existing employees to increase the effectiveness of the code.Ethics courses are available through books and other written materials as well as through online, private or live instruction trainings. You might even choose to tie to ethical behavior some compensation incentives, such as an end-of-the-year bonus or additional paid time off, to further increase the code's relevance to employees.4. Continuously review the code.Keeping the code updated is an important step in keeping a company s ethics top of mind. Each year, share copies of the code of ethics with every employee or communicate it through a brown bag lunch and learn or workshop.Ensure that your employees confirm their understanding of the code by requiring them to sign a form of acknowledgement afterward. In doing so, you ll proactively set up an atmosphere, reinforced by both formal and informal measures, that promotes the values you ve set forth. If you disregard the importance of developing an ethical culture, lawsuits, high turnover, low morale and even the demise of your business could result. A smart business leader should champion a written code of ethics from the outset, establish protocol and continuously review and promote these guidelines.This will show staff that you're serious about creating a positive and ethical workplace. At the same time, you ll also set clear, specific expectations that everyone can understand. Ultimately, the outcome will result in better business processes, as well as happier and more secure employees and therefore a more successful business.Related: American Apparel Tries On Something New: Ethics.

/article/241886,"Why Whole Foods, Dollar General, and Panera Have All Been Sued Over a Tiny Hiring Technicality","Employers are getting tripped up by a little-known law related to background checks, and it's costing some of them serious time and money.","When it comes to background checks dare we say it the devil is in the details.Last week, Michaels Stores was slapped with a class action lawsuit in Missouri federal court that accused the craft store chain of violating the Fair Credit Reporting Act. Michaels is accused of breaking the law because it failed to properly disclose that a candidate s consumer report might be obtained during the hiring process.Don t worry if you re unaware of the FCRA, a little-known federal law that regulates how consumer reports creditworthiness, criminal background reports, prior traffic reports can be used. It comes into play when employers want to check the backgrounds of prospective employees. (Michaels did not return a request for comment.)While the general public likely knows little about the FCRA, employers like Whole Foods, Dollar General, and Publix Super Markets are becoming intimately familiar with the law because like Michaels they are getting sued over it.The FCRA was originally enacted in 1970 to protect the privacy of individuals  personal information, as the credit reporting industry began assembling and disseminating reports to credit card companies, banks, employers, and landlords. It s only recently that employers have been hit with a wave of lawsuits for allegedly violating the act.So, what are employers being sued for?Technicalities, mostly. Before running a background check on an applicant, according to the FCRA, an employer has to give notice and ask for authorization in a way that s  clean and conspicuous  so it stands out from the rest of a job application, says Denise Trani-Morris, an employment lawyer at the Sedgwick firm in San Fracisco. Employers keep fumbling over that step.  They think,  Oh by the way, we re an at-will employer, so we ll just include that alongside the consent form. Aren t we being good?  No, actually, you just violated the law,  she says.  Or their application is online and it s one big steady stream of information.  That too, she says, is illegal.The nitty-gritty particulars don t stop there. An employer must notify candidates if it plans to not hire them because of the results of a background check before actually doing so. That lag, in theory, should let applicants fix any errors in their consumer report before their candidacy is crippled completely.These guidelines, while intricate, are nothing new, and that makes the recent slew of lawsuits all the more puzzling. Trani-Morris, who represents employers, attributes the trend to increasingly sophisticated plaintiffs lawyers who have identified the FCRA as a particularly vulnerable area that s  ripe for class actions  and where  penalties are significant,  she says.Retailers and restaurants seem to be favorite targets since their frequent hiring increases the potential pool of job applicants subjected to potentially illegal background checks. And the more people affected by an illegal practice, the more money s at stake. Plus, Trani-Morris says, state and city laws pertaining to background checks complicate matters, especially for employers that outsource the job application process to third-party vendors.In March, a class action lawsuit demanding $10 million filed in California accused Whole Foods of failing to provide applicants with a standalone disclosure form. (The court dismissed the case in October 2014.) Chuck E. Cheese was hit with a similar lawsuit in California in March (the case is ongoing). Panera was accused of the same violation in Florida in July, though the case has since been dismissed. That same month, current employees and job applicants sued Century 21 Department Stores in an ongoing case for running background checks without first obtaining their permission.While retailers seem particularly susceptible they re not the only ones getting sued. Last week, Paramount Pictures was slapped with a lawsuit for procuring a consumer report during the job search process without issuing a separate disclosure.These lawsuits may come across as minor hairsplitting, but they re costing companies real money.In October, Dollar General agreed to pay $4 million to settle claims that it didn t properly notify more than 200,000 job applicants of background checks. (The settlement is still subject to a February 25 fairness hearing.) Earlier last year, grocery chain Publix agreed to pay $6.8 million to settle claims that it violated the FCRA. In Publix s case, the company was sued for burying the disclosure form alongside other application materials. In these cases, legal nitpicking paid off.More from Fortune MagazineChina s Baidu Partners With Paypal to Tap Chinese TouristsChallenging Alibaba, Amazon Launches Prime Now Delivery in SingaporeUnited Airlines Is Being Sued By the Owners of a Giant Rabbit Found Dead After a FlightClaire ZillmanClaire Zillman is a writer at Fortune.comRead more",Inspiring Your Team,2015-01-16 15:15:00
/article/241601,3 Keys to Examining One of the Most Overlooked Business Costs: Workforce Management,For midsize businesses getting their arms around the total cost of ownership in human resources can be easily overlooked.,"For midsize businesses (those with more than 50 employees and less than 1,000) getting their arms around their total cost of ownership (TCO) in human resources -- what they are actually spending on employees and the cost of managing them -- can be easily overlooked.In fact, more than half of midsize-business owners (54 percent) say managing their company's employees is a daily concern, second only to overhead costs (64 percent), according to a recent ADP Research Institute study. So, it would follow that executives keep close tabs on TCO and know the ""big number"" of all direct and indirect costs for managing their employees. But do they really?According to the 2014 Total Cost of Ownership Study, on average, only one in three leaders have done a formal cost analysis of at least one of the five human capital management (HCM) pillars: payroll, employee benefits administration, talent management, human resources administration and time and labor management.Related: The Basics of Employee BenefitsBelow are three points to follow in order to understand that ""Big Number"" and find the true TCO of your workforce.Follow the five pillar rule.The best way to find the TCO of a workforce is to look into the five aspects of HCM listed above. Why not just four or three? It's the one way to find the true cost of your workforce. It's imperative that a business has an accurate assessment of its workforce cost control, and the best way to do that is to evaluate every pillar to see the full picture.Conduct a formal cost analysis.Within the last year, only about four in 10 mid-market companies have conducted a formal cost analysis on payroll, time and attendance and employee benefits administration alone, according to the 2014 TCO study. Very few have analyzed costs across all five pillars. This frustrates HCM professionals like me. We all go to the doctor to see how our body is functioning and we speak with retirement professionals to see what life after work will look like, so why not give your business that same kind of assessment for your most important asset -- your people?Related: Drive Success by Converging Employee's Goals With the Overall OrganizationWhile most business leaders believe they are keeping TCO costs in check, most senior executives note in the study that cost analysis is too complicated, or that TCO is a cost that's very hard to track. In short, business owners do not have the insight they need to determine their TCO.Take the leap from awareness to hard measurement. It's no secret that visibility into your business helps everyone make better and faster decisions. Shifting from TCO awareness to understanding and measurement is critical for midsize business owners to gain insight into the dollars they're putting behind employees and their impact on the bottom line. By measuring these costs, executives gain a layer of intelligence on spending that can put them on the road to understanding their true TCO of HCM, allowing them to better lead their business.Related: Letting Your Employees Review You Can Lead to Personal and Professional GrowthAnish RajpariaAnish Rajparia is ADP s president of major account services, which focuses on businesses with 50 to 1,000 clients, and ADP Canada.

/article/241497,A CEO's New Year's Resolutions to Improve Employee Satisfaction,A boost in morale can help propel a company forward in the new year.,"The success of a startup is determined by the people who make up its team. When looking to make improvements to their businesses in the new year, CEOs should focus their attention on the satisfaction of their employees.Improving career growth opportunities, team collaboration and communication can help propel a company forward in the new year. Here are 10 resolutions for CEOs to improve workflow and job satisfaction among team members:1. Realign around vision and mission.Without a clear understanding of a company s vision, mission and culture, employees can get lost in the dark with little direction or motivation. Remind team members what the company stands for and the grand vision being brought to life. The New Year is the perfect time to refocus everyone around the company s mission to ensure that employees are excited and inspired by their work.Related: Set a Plan in Place for New Employees That Will Keep Them Around2. Clarify roles.Not only should team members have a feel for the organization as a whole, but they should know where and how they, and others, fit into the team. Without set responsibilities and expectations, work gets muddled, employees take on extra work, and teams become burdened and frustrated. Clearly define and communicate the roles and responsibilities of team members and leaders across the company to keep everyone on task and improve productivity.3. Monitor success.Constantly measure success, assess what s working and what s not, and make adjustments to improve the product or organization. Everyone should have key performance indicators to focus on with measurable objectives attached to them. Set up a streamlined review process to measure, encourage and reward progress.4. Empower employees.Autonomous workplaces are happy ones. Step back and give employees the room they need to complete the job they were hired for. A survey of 2,000 office workers conducted by AtTask and Harris interactive found that 35 percent of those surveyed said they lose valuable working time to excessive oversight. Check that employees have the tools and the freedom to do their job and to have challenging and fulfilling careers.5. Invest in middle management.Although the third layer of management, usually directors who report to vice presidents or those who are two to three levels below the CEO, are extremely important to the success of an organization -- they are often too removed to regularly connect with the CEO. Invest heavily in these managers, hold forums specifically for all middle managers, and check in with them to ensure effective team management.Related: 3 Tips to Help You Build the Best Team in 20156. Train and educate team members.Improve and advance the skills of employees by launching an internal  university,"" essentially a professional development and training program, in which team members can earn certifications. Rewarding excellence in the program will help to sharpen the skills of top talent while improving job satisfaction and fostering career growth.7. Improve communication.Relying on email as the sole means of communication is ineffective and does little to build working relationships. Among professionals surveyed by AtTask, 43 percent felt that email takes away from their productivity. Instead, encourage face-to-face interaction when possible and invest in other communication tools such as a social video portal, internal webcasts, enterprise social networking tools and an internal blog.8. Settle HR issues immediately.It shouldn t take months or even weeks to address personal HR requests and issues. Define a rigid timeline to settle these problems and the turnaround for other items such as updated offer and merit letters, and stick to it.9. Streamline onboarding.Evaluate the current onboarding process and look for areas of improvement. Ask new employees for their feedback within their first six months and take their considerations seriously. A more effective onboarding process will mean smoother transitions, a more productive team and less employee turnover.10. Hold regular meetings.Employees should have regular interaction with top leadership, key executives and the CEO. Set aside specific times for team members to meet with senior leadership to gain a wide perspective on company-wide goals and progress, and to voice their concerns, discuss problems and give their feedback and input.Related: 5 Ways to Set Your Employees Up for Success in 2015Ron YekutielRon Yekutiel is the co-founder, chairman and CEO of Kaltura, Inc., a widely-used online-video platform.Read more",Inspiring Your Team,2015-01-07 22:30:00
/article/241355,How to Work With a Narcissist,Tips and tricks for managing relationships with a less-than-ideal personality type.,"For better or for worse, people often possess  less than ideal  character qualities or behaviors that make working with or for them intensely challenging. We all have them: impatience, chronic tardiness, aloofness, poor listening skills, the list goes on.A couple of years ago, I wrote an article entitled Psychological Clientology: 5 Types of Clients to Avoid. Not only did the post end up getting syndicated by multiple outlets, but it also sparked many subsequent online conversations about how to deal with difficult personalities in the workplace, particularly clients or customers who are vital to the stability of your business.One standout personality type, the narcissist, is particularly difficult because he or she often lacks the ability to see things any other way than their own, needs constant attention and admiration, and generally lacks empathy. And somehow, amidst all of it, they can make you feel like the biggest loser on the planet. It s much like dealing with the antics a spoiled child, which is confusing because you re looking at this person, this grown human being, thinking This has to be a joke, right? Related: 5 Steps to Boost the Skills That Will Help You Better Connect With PeopleHowever, working with a narcissist can also be extremely rewarding and inspiring because of their nearly superhuman skills for getting things done -- when they want it and how they want it.To gain insight into the best strategies for working with and for a narcissist, I tapped my dear friend Robert Weiss, the senior vice president for clinical development at Elements Behavioral Health, an accomplished author and world-renowned speaker on sex and intimacy in the digital age. Needless to say, he s seen thousands of narcissists.According to Weiss, the most important thing to know about narcissists is that their behavior and world view is grounded in deep shame and enduring low self-esteem. No matter how successful these individuals become, they feel deep down inside themselves as if they are not good enough,"" Weiss says. ""Every small human error -- even the little errors we all tend to make -- become reminders of their shortcomings. While there are most certainly genetic aspects to personality development, these individuals have typically experienced profound childhood trauma. Typically their trauma experience has been layered, building up over time and creating their negative self-perception.So how does one identify a narcissist, and what are some useful things to know about this particular personality type in terms of a working relationship?The  key negative traits  of a narcissist in a work setting, according to Weiss:They demonstrate a clear lack of empathy for how others feel or what they need.They often have an overly excessive focus on getting others to consistently validate them (even small accomplishments).They tend toward impulsivity and making decisions  from the hip. They may rage, pout, gossip, devalue and otherwise act out when they don t get their way.They are not great team players. They tend to get into power struggles and  I m right, you re wrong  discussions. They need to be right.They tend to see people as being either on their side or against them, with few gray areas.They will use gossip, manipulation, charm and even seduction to get their way.They will use other people and their thoughts and ideas to get ahead.They are not (consciously) malicious, and they will feel ashamed (even self-hating) for their bad behavior when it's pointed out, but then they will turn around and do the same thing without a second thought.They are often highly demanding of themselves and others, which can lead to them being perfectionists and controlling, holding unreasonable expectations for others and their performance.They struggle with close relationships and lack trust.They are easily frustrated (and can rage) if their projects, goals and needs aren t getting equal or more focus than the projects, goals and needs of others.They have limited leadership skills due to their excessive self-focus. It is incumbent on those in a close relationship with a narcissist to be warm, genuine and empathetic,"" Weiss says, ""and to be able to tolerate some of their pouting and anger -- knowing that any negative thing said to them will be amplified internally, often to an extreme degree. Similarly, every positive thing they hear will be seen as obviously deserved or not positive enough. Relationships need to feel consistent, real and non-shaming to the narcissistically wounded person. Related: Dealing With Feelings: How to Be an Emotionally-Aware LeaderThe narcissist does have a variety of positive attributes, which can make working alongside them inspiring and rewarding, assuming you are aware of how to handle the negative aspects:They tend to speak out about a problem, whereas others will be more polite and say nothing.They tend to be creative and passionate about any projects they take on as  theirs. They tend to think and work outside the box, often offering unexpected new and fresh ideas and concepts.Their perfectionism and control (when tempered) can produce profoundly positive results within their organizations.Their need for attention and validation can shine on their workplace, bringing more attention and useful notice to an organization.They can be great leaders, provided that they have people around them to provide the interpersonal functions they don t have (essentially, they need someone in power to contain and confront them, and they also need someone to provide a buffer between them and those who might react negatively to them).They work extremely well on their own, tending to be highly self-motivated.If they embrace an organization as their own, they will work tirelessly to help it succeed (as it has become a reflection of them).They are often good at working with the media in PR, outreach, social media, etc.Their charm, extroversion and seduction makes them great sales and marketing people.They are great at creating superficial relationships (see sales/marketing above), though not so great at personal follow-through.They can use their powerful persona to shape and mold a company or work environment.Is it really possible to work with a narcissist? Working with narcissists can be very difficult, as their sense of self-worth is rooted in trauma and shame,  Weiss says.  As such, they typically feel unsafe in any sort of emotionally connective relationship. They seek control and power because they think it will keep them safe from being  exposed  as the unworthy frauds that they believe themselves to be. Problems typically arise if and when those working with and around the narcissist are non-empathetic, critical, slow to praise and impatient with the narcissist s struggle to hold onto his/her self-esteem.But Weiss is quick to point out: ""Narcissistic people can be incredibly warm, bright, engaging, thoughtful (when they are thinking about doing that) and creative, and, as such, they may offer a great deal to any work or personal situation.""While at face value the narcissist may seem like an impossible colleague, customer or manager, a little understanding about this particular personality type will likely go a long way in a work setting. After all, no one is perfect, and we could all benefit from applying more empathy, compassion and listening skills to those with whom we spend a great majority of our time.Related: 3 Personality Types That Can Harm Your BusinessRebekah IliffRebekah Iliff is the chief strategy officer for AirPR, a technology platform to increase public-relations performance that serves Fortune 500 and fast growing technology companies.

/article/240700,Set a Plan in Place for New Employees That Will Keep Them Around,There are four steps to take that will better prepare new hires and reduce the stress of coming aboard.,"A company doesn t get a second chance to make a good first impression -- not with consumers, key stakeholders and especially not with employees. Developing an effective employee work plan is one of the most important steps an employer can take when bringing on a new hire.Ninety percent of organizations believe that employees make their decision to stay within the first year, according to research conducted by the Aberdeen Group. That makes having an employee work plan all the more crucial.Related: 6 Recruitment Trends You Can't Ignore in 2015In an effort to avoid the frustration and confusion that often accompanies a new job, companies are implementing employee work plans to easily maintain employee job descriptions, plans and goals. Doing so greatly improves new hire readiness, as well as reduces the amount of stress associated with the onboarding process.Not sure where to start in developing a new employee work plan? Here are a few essential steps to take:1. Establish job expectations.This first step may seem like an obvious one, but it is necessary nonetheless. Go over the job description with employees, particularly what is expected of them and how they re expected to do it. This step gives employers the opportunity to provide information on how their work fits into the big picture, further motivating employees.Discussing job specifics that may have been only slightly touched upon during the hiring process will eliminate grievances later on.2. Identify individual work objectives.Allow new employees to set personal work objectives. What do they hope to accomplish while holding this position? What are their short-term and long-term career aspirations? What are they looking to learn?Make sure employee objectives are specific and timely so it is easier to measure their progress later down the line. Having an idea of an employee s ideal career path can help determine what role the business plays in their plan, as well as what opportunities can be offered to them.Related: How to Hire the Best Talent and Avoid the Most Common Pitfalls3. Align employee and company goals.Aligning an employee s personal career goals with the overall mission of the organization will help foster a mutually beneficial relationship. Understanding how their goals positively affect the goals of the company will keep employees engaged and motivated.Discuss the organization's vision and goals with employees and how their goals play a part in the company s success.4. Perform regular reviews.An employee work plan is of little use if it isn t consistently under review. One of the primary reasons for having a work plan in place is to track an employee s performance. It gives employers an opportunity to discuss progress with and provide constructive feedback to employees.Optimize the employee work plan by using it during annual performance reviews, as it can serve as a key resource for reviewing past performance.Have you implemented employee work plans at your organization?

/article/241179,Quell Employees' Fears of Performance Reviews With These 6 Tips,"For many workers, there is little to look forward to when the annual performance review comes around.","It s that time of year again -- time for the year-end performance review. For a lot of employees, there is little to look forward to when the annual performance review comes around. Despite its negative connotation, the annual performance review can play an important role, and shouldn t be disregarded.Instead, here are six ways to revamp performance reviews to create a more favorable experience for employees and managers alike:1. Simplify the performance review process.There is no need to have a lengthy review with an endless amount of questions and far too many competencies to achieve.Related: Why That Yearly Performance Review Isn't WorkingInstead, focus on questions that truly matter to the development of employees, such as,  In what area(s) would you like to improve, and how can I help you?  Additionally, narrow down competencies to set more realistic goals and avoid overwhelming employees. Finally, when possible, automate the process with technology. Doing so will aid in easily tracking and continuously measuring employee performance year over year.2. Deliver negative feedback in a constructive way.In a 2014 study of employees by Harvard Business Review, a significantly larger number of respondents, 57 percent, preferred corrective feedback, while only 43 percent preferred praise or recognition.Employees want constructive feedback, but it should be approached with care. The last thing managers want is for employees  performance and morale to take a hit because of a largely negative review. When providing corrective feedback, do so in a way that employees will not take offense to and offer ways to help them improve.3. Don t neglect positive feedback.While it s a good idea to give positive feedback on a regular basis, the performance review provides a perfect opportunity to talk not only about what an employee can do to improve but what they ve been successful at.In a study of 65,672 employees, Gallup found that workers who received feedback on their strengths had turnover rates that were 14.9 percent lower than for employees who received no feedback. Consider asking employees what they re most proud of at work or what their recent accomplishments have been. Recognizing their achievements and contributions to company success will motivate them and other employees to perform well.Related: How to Turn an Underperformer Into an Ideal Employee4. Encourage feedback from employees.The performance review shouldn t focus solely on the employee being reviewed, but on the organization, as well. Employers can learn a lot from employees during these reviews by asking questions related to organizational development.For example, asking employees what they thought of their onboarding process, and whether it was sufficient, can help employers tailor onboarding to the needs and wants of employees.The performance review should be a two-way street.5. Solicit peer feedback.Peer feedback helps managers gain a different perspective on employees  performance. By soliciting feedback among coworkers, employees will no longer see the performance review process as just the manager s opinion. Outside praise and criticism can only help employee development.6. Make performance reviews about development.The primary goal of performance appraisals should not be evaluating employees, but rather developing employees. One of the reasons employees fear performance review season is because they know that they re being evaluated and that that evaluation can affect their pay, job title, etc. Performance reviews should aim to develop people into the best workers they can be. Knowing that the review is for their benefit will take some of the fear out of the process.  In what ways do you make your performance appraisals a more positive experience for employees?

/article/241092,"In Europe, Obesity Can Be Deemed a Disability at Work",This means that they can be covered by an EU law barring discrimination at work.,"Europe's top court ruled on Thursday that obese people can be considered as disabled, meaning that they can be covered by an EU law barring discrimination at work.The decision followed a question from a Danish court, which was reviewing a complaint of unfair dismissal brought by Karsten Kaltoft, a child-minder, against a Danish local authority.Kaltoft, who never weighed less than 160 kilograms (352 pounds) during his employment, argued that his obesity was one of the reasons he lost his job and that this amounted to unlawful discrimination, an allegation the council denied.The Court of Justice of the European Union was asked to rule on whether EU law forbids discrimination on the grounds of obesity or whether obesity could be considered a disability.The Luxembourg-based court ruled that EU employment law did not specifically prohibit discrimination on the grounds of obesity, and that the law should not be extended to cover it.However, the court said that if an employee's obesity hindered ""full and effective participation of that person in professional life on an equal basis with other workers"" then it could be considered a disability.This, in turn, is covered by anti-discrimination legislation.According to statistics from the World Health Organization, based on 2008 estimates, roughly 23 percent of European women and 20 percent of European men were obese.(Reporting by Julia Fioretti; editing by Philip Blenkinsop and Crispian Balmer)Latest News and Headlines from Reuters window.addEventListener(""load"", function(e) { var playerH = new reutersTV({ adTag:"" https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz=610x365&iu=/6280/Entrepreneur/video/rTV&impl=s&gdfp_req=1&env=vp&output=xml_vast3&unviewed_position_start=1&correlator=[timestamp]"", fontElClass:"""", playerClass:""player"", publisherId:""www.entrepreneur.com"" }); });  Amazon plows ahead with high sales and spending; profit plungesAsian shares pull back after U.S. techs knocked off highsWisconsin governor defends $3 billion deal for Foxconn plant",Health,2014-12-18 14:20:00

Connecting goals in the workplace, in support of a well-defined company strategy, is essential to driving business success.Related: 5 Steps to Align Your Reward Process and Reach Your Company GoalsHow do you prime employees to meet goals with a level of enthusiasm and motivation that produces results and contributes to the organizational mission? The following steps are designed to help connect employee work goals to the overall organization:1. Publicize the company mission.This first step is essential to aligning individual employee work goals to the company strategy. It might seem obvious, but employees must have a clear understanding of the organization s mission in order to properly set relevant work goals.Unfortunately, research by Gallup revealed that only four out of 10 (41 percent) employees know what their company stands for and what makes its brand different from its competitors.Employees who understand how their work drives company success are more likely to feel motivated to pursue work goals. In addition to actively communicating company-wide goals to employees, sharing the company s vision and asking goal-related questions during the interview process are great ways to recruit candidates who can help the company in achieving those goals. 2. Boost employee confidence.The fact of the matter is people want to be noticed for a job well done. While constructive feedback is necessary to employee growth and improvement, don t underestimate the power of positive feedback.In fact, a study by Harvard Business Review found that 72 percent of employees rank recognition given for high performers as having a significant impact on employee engagement. It might be time to consider being a little more gracious with the compliments.Unlike constructive criticism, positive feedback lets employees know they re on the right track and motivates them to continue doing what they re doing well.

Set employees up for success.Individual employee goals can contribute greatly to the overall success of an organization, so be sure those goals are attainable.

These tools could range from creating an achievement plan to providing specific training or mentoring opportunities throughout the year.4. Monitor progress on a regular basis.According to survey results collected by the Society for Human Resource Management, only 2 percent of organizations conduct ongoing reviews.Rather than waiting until the annual performance review to reflect on employee performance and goal achievement, consider monitoring employee progress on a semi-regular basis. Doing so will give employees an opportunity to identify and solve any challenges that might be hindering their performance, thus eliminating any issues further down the line.What methods does your organization have in place to ensure the alignment of employee and company goals?

/article/240500,Avoid These 3 Employment Compliance Mistakes or Risk Fines,"With the multitude of federal and state employment laws and regulations that exist, it is easy to make costly errors.","One of the biggest mistakes employers can make is underestimating the importance of employment law and compliance. Companies both small and large are subject to federal and state laws regarding employment, especially when it comes to paperwork.Related: The Changes to Tax Laws You Need to KnowWith the multitude of federal and state employment laws and regulations that exist, it is easy to make costly errors. Avoid non-compliance woes by avoiding these three common mistakes:1. Missing or incomplete I-9 forms.Failure to keep valid I-9 forms on file can result in a number of fines. Before filing, be sure all forms are completed and include the proper dates and signatures. The I-9 form has a strict deadline of three days after the new employee s start date -- missing this deadline will result in fines.  In an effort to avoid deadline-related fines, have employees complete the I-9 during their initial onboarding or consider implementing a paperless system to save time associated with the printing and scanning of documents.  Additional fines come from missing the proper supporting documentation that is required with the completed I-9 form. Employers cannot specify which document(s) to accept, so allow new hires to review the list of acceptable documents that comes with the I-9 and make their own selection.Following an employee s termination, employers must destroy the I-9 form three years after the person began work or one year after the former employee s termination, whichever comes later.  2. Outdated W-4 forms.An employee must complete a W-4 tax form immediately after being hired and before receiving their first paycheck.Related: These 3 Legal Traps Can Stop a New Business in its TracksIt is crucial to keep this form current with the employee s situation. While employees can change the amounts on their W-4 at any time, it is a good idea to have all employees submit a new W-4 tax form each year to maintain compliance.The W-4 tax form can seem intimidating to new hires, but employers should not give employees tax advice. Is an employee having difficulty with the W-4? This IRS article will help them easily calculate their withholding allowance.3. Absent job-application form.Each potential employee should complete a job application form that is compliant with country and state regulations. Certain states require particular questions and notices to be included on the application form, such as criminal-background check questions and notices of at-will employment. Make sure your team stays up to date on these regulations. Application forms that don t meet legal requirements put employers at risk for liability claims and non-compliance penalties.Finally, the job application form serves as the employer s primary source of information about a prospective employee.The process of bringing on a new employee is not a simple task and requires some time and effort on both the employer and employee s part. Above all, understand the employment laws and regulations in the country and state in which the organization is located.

/article/239779,7 Ways to Make the First Day Perfect for New Hires,"Starting a new job can be overwhelming, so put you and your best company's best foot forward to ease your latest team member into things.","The first day of any new job can be overwhelming. Trying to navigate a new company, meet everyone in the office and learn the ropes of a new role is a lot for new hires.First impressions are important. New hires know just how important it is to make a good first impression early in their tenure, but it s also important for companies to put their best foot forward for their newest team members. The candidate wowed the organization at the interview. Now, it s time for the organization to wow them with a perfect first day of work.Related: Ensure Your New Employee's Success With These 5 StepsHere are seven ways to make the first day of work perfect for new hires:1. Have everything ready.Companies must be prepared. When a new hire arrives to find no one is expecting them, or their workspace is not ready, they may feel unappreciated and unwelcome. An organization doesn t need to pull out all the stops, but the new hire should have a workspace prepared with all the relevant tools (computer, phone, etc.) ready to go.2. Give an office tour.On the first day, new hires should be shown the facilities and introduced to co-workers. Nothing is worse than needing to use the bathroom on the first day and not knowing where to go.It may seem like this goes without saying, but a company tour is vital for a new employee s first day of work, even if your office space is small. More than anything, it helps the new employee feel comfortable with their new surroundings and get to know company culture.3. On-the-job training.While it s obvious that a new hire will be trained, make sure to start that training day one. That way they will feel confident about their role and contribution to the organization. It is fine to start small. Training could include anything from how to use equipment to what is required for specific assignments. In addition, if the company involves clients, be sure to explain who they are and how the employee will be interacting with them.4. Give them small and manageable assignments.The one thing new employees don t want to be on their first day is bored. It will have them questioning why they are there. However, companies shouldn t overwhelm them with work the first day, either.Giving new hires a few small, manageable tasks (and be sure to provide plenty of details about what they entail) their first day will help them to get their feet wet and see the kind of work they ll be doing, without feeling overwhelmed. It will also give them a sense of purpose on their first day. Meeting all the other employees and getting to know a new office can be overwhelming, and having a small assignment to focus on can be a nice break.Related: 4 Ways to Get New Employees Off on the Right Foot5. Assign a mentor.Many new hires may be unsure of the specifics of their tasks or how to get started. It s virtually guaranteed they will have questions during their first few weeks or months at work. Assigning a specific mentor (rather than leaving it up to chance) can help them to feel more comfortable and confident. Instead of an overwhelming corporation full of strangers, they have one person assigned to help them. Additionally, it can give an up-and-coming manager a chance to stretch their legs.6. Get paperwork out of the way early.Paperwork is a necessary part of the onboarding process, and to help new hires be more productive more quickly, organizations should get it out of the way early. Try to keep the process quick and efficient to help avoid making a new employee spend the entire morning of their first day filling out forms.Consider using a paperless solution not only to to draw efficiencies, but also to stay green and support the environment. This could be done by providing electronic forms employees could fill out on a company computer, or even have emailed to them before their first day.7. Ask for feedback.Once the day is drawing to a close, give the new a hire a chance to give feedback on their day. Ask how everything went and if they have any questions. Is there anything they are worried about? Any concerns they have for the future?Then see what they require for the next day. Asking for feedback will give new employees a chance to tell their employers what they need for success, making the transition to a new job easier. It will also help you inform your process, making sure you are improving your processes wherever you can.Starting a new job is never easy. Many new hires feel overwhelmed, but by utilizing these tips organizations can make the first day of work a seamless transition and help new employees feel comfortable and welcome.Have you had a great (or not so great) first day at a new job?

/article/239778,Letting Your Employees Review You Can Lead to Personal and Professional Growth,Here are five reasons that you should seek feedback the next time performance reviews come up.,"As a leader, inviting feedback can be difficult. It can also be intimidating for employees to review their bosses. However, receiving that evaluation is crucial to becoming a better leader and boss, and being able to provide feedback is important for employees.Furthermore, receiving feedback shows employees that leaders are committed to the success of the company and willing to make changes in order to see that success. So as a leader, the next time performance reviews come up, make sure to ask for feedback from employees. Here s why:1. Learn what makes employees happy.While the Society for Human Resource Management's 2014 Employee Job Satisfaction and Engagement Survey found 81 percent of employees are satisfied with their jobs, there s always room for improvement.Related: Does Your Staff Dislike You?By asking questions such as  What is your least favorite part of your day and why?  and  Describe your ideal workplace?  leaders can learn what makes employees happy. Once managemtn understands what people are looking for, steps can be taken to create an environment that keeps people happy and turnover low.2. Foster a culture of open communication.The days of employees being afraid of their managers are over. At least, they should be. Companies should strive for a culture of open communication, and having 360-degree reviews can help with that.Asking for feedback shows employees that leaders are approachable and willing to listen to constructive criticism. It also shows they take what employees think seriously and are willing to make changes, which makes for a more open work environment.  Additionally, it ensures that everyone is getting appropriate feedback. Being a manager is no small task. It is important to check in with direct reports to see how things are going from their perspective and help managers continuously improve their management skills.Related: 5 Steps to Better Performance Reviews3. Learn what areas they need personal growth in.Nobody is perfect, and while leaders are used to offering growth strategies to those around them, they can be blind to areas in which they need improvement.There are lots of skills required to be a good leader, including organizational skills, listening skills, management skills, negotiation, problem solving, etc. Nobody will be perfect in all of them, and asking employees for feedback, while hard to hear, can be instrumental for the growth of leadership.4. Learn what they re doing right.Sure, a review may include some points that are difficult to hear. But it s also a chance for employees to let management know how they are successful. A review is the time for employees to discuss both positive and negative aspects of the company and leadership.5. Ideas for the company may emerge.Employees are a great untapped resource for ideas for the company. A 360-degree review is a great time for ideas to surface, as it s an open discussion between employer and employee.Ask if the employee has any ideas about how meetings, processes or protocols could be conducted differently. Leaders may be surprised what they come up with.Related: A Rigid Mind Blocks Success.

/article/240073,"To Boost Productivity, Encourage Employees to Encourage Each Other","How team members interact, and the settings in which interactions occur, dramatically impact the workplace. ","When we talk about productivity, we often think about things management can do to improve morale and inspire more innovative thinking. But, here s something else to consider: employee interactions.According to new findings from Sociometric Solutions s study on employee behavioral analytics, the number of lunchtime interactions affect employee productivity. Employees who sat at larger lunch tables were 36 percent more productive throughout the week and had 30 percent lower stress levels than those who sat at smaller tables.Knowing how interactions can affect workflow begs the question: How does peer feedback affect employees? Should employees solicit feedback from one another?Peer feedback can be helpful, as long as it is constructive rather than destructive. Here are a few ways employees can give feedback to one another constructively:1. Give complimentsFeedback often feels like it has a negative connotation. In many situations, it means something is wrong. Something needs to be changed. But the word is actually neutral. Feedback is a response that could be positive or negative. Negative says what not to do, but without anything to replace the not, the person receiving feedback may not know what to do.Encourage employees to compliment one another frequently so team members can learn their strengths. The more employees are aware of their talents, the more they will be inclined to use them.Related: Time for a Company Culture Audit2. Provide suggestionsSometimes receiving feedback can feel limiting.  Don t do this, but you do this well  isn t always enough from which to infer what actions should be taken in specific situations.Set a rule that states when employees see a change that needs to be made, either for how a team member or the company does things, they must provide a suggestion. Stating a dislike or a preference isn t enough without a reason to support why a new method would work better.3. Step into one another s shoesA while back, Sam Richards gave a TED Talk called A Radical Experiment in Empathy. The discussion centered on different perspectives on the Iraq War, but the takeaway was, in order to truly understand others, people need to feel what actions have caused them to feel. Not everyone has the same experience with actions, because they look at situations from different perspectives.Consider creating a department swap day where employees actually change rolls for a day to see things from the other side of the fence. This might work better as a proactive strategy, but can be used as a reactive one, too. When an employee understands what challenges others encounter throughout the day, they may develop more patience with others. Team members work better together when they understand what the other needs most at different points within projects.Related: The Pros and Cons of Peer Review4. Validate opinionsDr. Karyn Hall defines validation as the recognition and acceptance of another person's thoughts, feelings, sensations, and behaviors as understandable.Validation doesn t necessarily mean agreement. It s a method supporting a relationship while maintaining a different opinion. Within a dynamic workplace team, opinions and thoughts differ often, which is why validation is essential in giving constructive feedback. Explain to employees the difference between agreeing with and validating another s opinion. Using this method should empower employees to handle conflict more diplomatically.5. Explain why or howExplanations for why the human mind seeks meaning in everything run deep. A new thesis by Dr. Paul T. P. Wong cites most psychological disorders result from failing to meet our need for meaning due to pursuing success based on misguided values. Understanding why and how is essential to our healing and well-being, the thesis explains.In the context of receiving feedback on performance at work, knowing why and how could make a difference in the trajectory of an employee s growth rate and, ultimately, career path. If an employee doesn t understand why a change needs to be made, or how a method affects other employees, they may be reluctant to make the change or adjust inaccurately. Whenever employees provide feedback to one another, ensure they explain and understand the big picture of how their roles affect the company.Related: For a Productive Workplace Let Your Office Go to the DogsMatt StrazMatt Straz is the founder and CEO of Namely, the HR and payroll platform for the world's most exciting companies.Read more",Employee Feedback,2014-11-24 15:00:00
/article/239777,5 Technology Roadblocks Costing You Great Talent,"You want to be able to hire the best employees, but these shortfalls could cause the best candidates to not look your way.","Companies put a lot into recruiting great talent -- nearly $110 billion a year, according to a 2013 study by Deloitte. In addition to the money, companies are also investing time and patience into finding and hiring great talent.However, when it comes to technology and recruiting, how many of us are shooting ourselves in the proverbial foot without realizing it? In my opinion, there are five major technology-related roadblocks killing candidates' experience and causing companies to miss out on great talent:1. Companies fail to re-engage candidates.One of the biggest mistakes companies make is failing to re-engage candidates, an October 2014 CareerBuilder study found. A candidate who isn t hired for a certain position may turn out to be a perfect fit for one that opens up later, but organizations that don t maintain relationships with viable candidates lose them.Related: 5 Reasons Why Your Social-Recruiting Strategy Isn't WorkingThese candidates have already expressed interest in the organization, so companies could save time and effort by reaching out to them for future positions. However, only 38 percent of human-resource professionals re-engage candidates every six months or more, while more than a third report they have moved on to more current candidates.2. Companies lose interested, but passive, candidates.Just because a candidate may not apply immediately upon reading your posting doesn t mean they aren t interested in applying later. However, 57 percent of HR professionals don t use any tools to capture candidates who didn t apply to their jobs. In fact, 39 percent of job seekers feel the ability to leave their contact information with an employer and apply later is extremely or very important, according to CareerBuilder.In addition, two in five job seekers would like to receive emails about new opportunities opening up at companies. By getting interested candidates  information, companies can build a talent pipeline for future openings.3. The application isn t accessible on mobile devices.Nine out of 10 job seekers say they will use their mobile device during a job search sometime in the next 12 months, a 2014 Glassdoor survey reports. That means if you don t have an application that s accessible on mobile devices, or if it doesn t line up well with the interface, you re missing out on a lot of potential talent.Companies can combat this by offering an application that s accessible on mobile devices, or through the use of mobile apps. In addition to job searching, 44 percent of job seekers expect to be able to apply for jobs from their mobile device, so not offering mobile applications costs a lot of companies great talent.Related: The Art of Courting Candidates: Creating a Stellar Startup Interview Experience4. Using automated responses.When companies are flooded with applications and resumes, it can be difficult to get back to each individual candidate. It s easy to use an automated email response or generalized application service, but 39 percent of job seekers don t feel that s enough. They re looking for personalization, the CareerBuilder study reports.Sixty-two percent of job seekers are expecting more personalized communications, which could be anything from a personalized email to a phone call from a recruiter after an application has been submitted (which, in fact, 67 percent of job seekers expect!). Companies that don t respond to each applicant may find themselves losing great talent to organizations that do.5. The application process is too complicated.According to CareerBuilder, 53 percent of human resources professionals think having a long application is good because it filters out candidates who aren t truly interested.While this may be true, making the application process too complicated also filters out potential candidates who may not have the patience for a long application. A shocking 60 percent of job seekers reported not finishing an application because it was too long.So how long is too long? While the CareerBuilder survey found 37 percent of recruiters ask 15 or more questions on an application, job seekers say an application should have 10 questions at the most. In addition, 29 percent of job seekers believe the application process should take 10 minutes or less, with 62 percent saying it should take 20 minutes at the most.It can be hard enough to recruit great talent without hidden roadblocks. By avoiding these technology-related mistakes, companies can widen their talent pool and find and hire the best talent for their organization.Related: The Law of Attraction: Finding the Perfect Hire for Your CompanyAndre LavoieAndre Lavoie is the CEO of ClearCompany, the talent-management solution that helps companies identify, hire and retain more A players.

/article/238980,"Pay People for Commitment, Not for Time or Results","With flexible work schedules and performance metrics, a business network CEO suggests a different approach to gauging employees.","Sixty hours per week. That's how much I work, on average, which seems like a lot to some people. However, my job is my greatest hobby and my projects are like my children. Therefore, 60 hours per week is perfectly fine for me. Besides, my number of work hours doesn't matter because I am self-employed. It is mostly irrelevant when or where I work, as long as I get things done.Because my work contributes to my self-actualization, I think work-life balance is an outdated paradigm. I prefer to live when I work, thank you very much!Related: Setting Up the Perfect Compensation Plan for Your Sales TeamA similar attitude toward work and life is emerging among many other creative knowledge workers. Work-life integration is all the rage these days. Results-only work environments are steadily replacing old-fashioned flextime policies. Unlimited vacation days are granted to professionals who are treated more like entrepreneurs than employees. And remote work is so fast becoming the norm that we should consider using the term office work as its antonym, for any type of job that still chains a person to a desk in an office building.These trends have led me to believe that we should bury the concept of the 40-hour work week.Don't pay for results.The question is, does time really matter? When Jack can do in 24 hours what Jill does in 40 hours, should Jack still be considered ""part time"" and Jill ""full time""? Is it fair to pay Jack less than Jill, only because his contract refers to 24 imaginary hours instead of 40? When people can work anytime and anywhere, shouldn't we be paying them for results instead of time? Shouldn't we be treating them like entrepreneurs or freelancers, who only get paid for actual value delivered?I think not.Indeed, some organizations pay employees for ""performance,"" which seems to make sense in a results-only work environment. However, history shows that pay for performance opens up a whole new dimension of dysfunctional behaviors. When pay depends on measured outcomes, it is virtually guaranteed that people will game the system, aiming for the shortest path to the optimal results.As social researcher Alfie Kohn once said, ""Of course rewards motivate people. They motivate people to get the rewards!""The fact that pay-for-performance schemes have led to company-destroying bonuses among CEOs, and service-destroying competition among sales people, isn't the only problem. Even worse, when people only get paid for outcomes, they usually avoid experimental learning because experiments can lead to failure, and failure means no income. Such behaviors are the opposite of what businesses need in the 21st century. After all, learning and innovation can only happen through experiments.Related: 7 Payroll Items to Check Off Your List Before the Year EndsPay for commitment.I believe there is a better way. Instead of using meaningless 40-hour or 36-hour time constraints, and instead of using dangerous performance metrics, in the 21st century we should simply agree on commitment levels. This is how I have defined it for my virtual team:Commitment level 5 (or 100 percent): The money we pay you is your only source of income. You're not financially supported by anyone else (for example, your spouse or another employer) and you're not trying to develop any other business on the side. What we expect from you is total commitment to our organization.Commitment level 4 (or 80 percent): The money we pay you is most of your income. You either have some minor support from someone else (but not more than 20 percent of your income), or you intentionally reserve some time and effort to develop your own business on the side. What we expect from you is high commitment to our organization.Commitment level 3 (or 60 percent): What we pay you is more than half of your income. You either have support from someone else (but less than 40 percent of your income), or you run your own business on the side which generates some minor income. What we expect from you is that you usually give priority to our organization in your commitment.Commitment level 2 (or 40 percent): What we pay you is less than half of your income. You either have significant support from someone else (60 percent or more), or you run your own business on the side that generates a good income. What we expect from you is that you usually give priority to your other employer or your other commitments.Commitment level 1 (or 20 percent): What we pay you is a minor part of your income. You either have almost full support from someone else (80 percent or more), or you run your own successful business that generates a significant income. What we expect from you is that you always give priority to your other employer or your other commitments.So, how does this work? Easy! Instead of defining hours per week in contracts with employees, freelancers or virtual workers, you define a commitment level. You don't care how many hours they work, when and where, or how they mix their private and professional lives. The only thing you care about is how much you can count on the contributions, effort and collaboration of your workers, in the projects to which they have been assigned.This is easier to observe than you might think. How fast do they reply to their emails? How often do they show up in Hangouts? How active are they on the organization's social channels? How often are they credited or complimented by their peers? How often are they asked for help? How fast do they offer it? How many ideas for improvement have they generated? And how committed are they to attend company events and gatherings?There's no need to actually measure any of this. Among co-workers it should be easy enough to identify what commitment level someone behaves at.Commitment levels can be part of a salary formula, or they can be considered during traditional negotiations over monthly fees or wages. Either way, what you agree on with your professional workers is a level of dependency and collaboration. You should get what you pay for. In the 21st century, with people working anytime and anywhere, continuously mixing professional and private activities, what you should pay for is neither time (which means nothing anymore) nor results (which can be dangerous). What you should pay for is people's commitment to your business.So yes, I work 60 hours per week, and I feel proud of my results. But in our business I can only commit to level 4, because in between my Skype calls and cappuccinos I'm writing a new book.Related: Why We Replaced (In)Human Resources with 'Employee Experience'Jurgen AppeloJurgen Appelo is CEO of the business network Happy Melly.

/article/239507,Consider These 10 Strategies When Preparing to Grow Your Company,There are concrete steps you can take as your progress your startup to the next level.,"Startups go through three distinct phases early in their lifecycle: building the product, selling the product and growing into a sustainable company.Preparing a company for growth requires taking concrete actions in evolving product and service offerings, modifying the pre- and post-sales organization, addressing human resource challenges, streamlining operations and more.Here are 10 suggestions for companies preparing to cross the growth chasm:1. Reconsider product offeringsNow that the product is no longer in beta, questions to ask include: How profitable is each product line? Can products that don t ""move the needle"" be eliminated to double down on the successful ones? How can the product s addressable market be increased? How can the average revenue per unit be grown? How can the product sales cycle be shortened to reduce the overall cost of sales? How can post-sales maintenance costs be reduced?Related: Before You Decide to Scale Your Business, Answer These 4 QuestionsChallenge conventions and consider new blue-ocean opportunities, including ones that would require a mergers and acquisitions to fulfill.2. Invest in product marketingAs sales ramp up, there will be a diminishing productivity rate, largely because the salesforce is no longer only comprised of the passionate founder. Counteract this by making sales easier.Consider verticalizing sales and marketing teams based on industry, use cases and/or products. Establish a product-marketing team in charge of writing marketing requirement documents (MRDs) for products, evangelizing products with customers, developing customer advisory boards, creating sales collateral, and simplifying product packaging, messaging, and pricing.3. Adopt a channel strategyChannels fuel much needed non-linear growth, but they also introduce risk. While a channel strategy isn t for everyone, most companies opt for a combined direct and channel approach.Determine if the channel s sales team has the DNA and required knowledge to sell the product. Make sure they are adequately motivated to sell the product through a sales performance incentive fund (SPIF), but consider compensating them in other ways, too. Allocate enough pre- and post-sales support. Most importantly, be patient but also very critical of progress.4. Establish a customer-success teamUpon entering the growth phase, significant attention needs to shift from securing new customers to retaining and upselling to current customers.If it hasn t been done already, establish a customer-success team with the goal of maintaining customers for life. Measure and incentivize this team by gross churn and upsell level, or by ""net churn,"" which is the net effect of both.5. Open channels of communicationCompanies entering the growth phase are typically large enough to switch from having two levels of management (for example, vice presidents and directors) to three levels of management (chief officers, VPs and directors), and the staff is increasingly spread out.Related: How Much -- and How Fast -- Should You Invest in Growth Opportunities?Establish a culture of transparency, including quarterly company-wide video calls for reviewing updated plans, opportunities and challenges. Schedule periodic meetings for all groups with all company executives. Each senior executive should spend a significant portion of time on the ""frontlines"" to obtain an in-person assessment and encourage contact with all employees.6. Strive for cohesionAs the company grows, individual offices and teams become less aware of what others are doing. However, company-wide unity and cohesion are critical for success.Verbalize the company s philosophy, culture and motto, and seek concrete ways to embody them so people can relate, connect and gradually make it their own. Encourage meetings between teams, trips across offices, company-wide events, and whenever possible, relocate people across countries and groups.7. Empower middle managementExecutives in growth-phase companies need to be less focused on leading by themselves and more focused on empowering others to lead with them.Put in place a strong middle-management team, delegate responsibilities to them and empower them with rights and freedoms. Encourage middle management to be entrepreneurial and take initiative, assume risk and not fear failure.8. Put goals and key performance indicators in placeInitial startup decisions are often made by intuition, but as the company grows, they must be backed by data collected and monitored regularly across the entire company.Leaders at every level should define and track key yearly and quarterly goals. Key performance indicator (KPI) attainment should be shared transparently across the organization, and compensation should be tied to them directly.9. Instill tighter controlsAs the company grows, so too does the risk of losing control of approval processes and spending. Allocate resources to document-required procedures and regulations. Instill processes and systems that ensure compliance.10. Establish a strong human resources teamRecruiting, training, empowering and retaining talent requires lots of thought, effort and attention, and is key for the company s success. The HR team should be led by an executive who reports directly to the CEO because HR issues are of strategic importance and need to be addressed by a senior person.Related: Persistence and Planning Is Needed to Reach That 5-Year MilestoneRon YekutielRon Yekutiel is the co-founder, chairman and CEO of Kaltura, Inc., a widely-used online-video platform.Read more",Growth Strategies,2014-11-11 19:15:00
/article/239560,Never Hire a Honey Badger,"The last thing you want to do is hire someone and wind up regretting it later. Like, really regret it. Here are some tips for steering clear of trouble employees.","A couple of years back, there was a phenomenal (and by phenomenal, I mean completely offensive, juvenile and NSFW) video about an animal called the honey badger, who just doesn t care about anything (or in the words of the video, doesn t give a s#!t).While honey badgers are incredibly amusing to watch on video, you don t want one near your business. So, whether you are hiring employees, working with service providers or partnering with competitors, here are seven steps on how to avoid working with a  honey badger. 1. Ask thoughtful questions.Before you jump in, ask questions that hone in on issues that are critical to you and your work style. Ask applicants to describe their nightmare employer or client. Ask them how many weekends they have worked in the past three years or what time they usually leave the office. Test them on the key skills that they say they have.For example, whenever someone says he or she is proficient in Microsoft Excel, I ask the person to tell me how he or she would use certain basic formulas, which often leads to finding out that the individual has exaggerated his or her proficiency. You can even give them a take-home case study and see what kind of effort they put into it as a gauge of how much they care about their work.Related: Your Ideas Have No Value2. Try before you buy. Try one or several people simultaneously on a contractor or trial basis and have them compete for the full-time job or for you as a client. If the individual isn t willing to put out a killer effort to land the opportunity, the chances are that he or she isn t going to be on any better behavior once the person starts working with you full-time. 3. Do a background check on social media. How does the person handle him or herself on social media? Does the person overshare? Does he or she ever speak negatively about a client, customer or their employer? Doing a Google search and peeking into Twitter, Facebook and their blog is a quick way to get a sense of how someone conducts themselves and whether they care about those that they work with.4. Pay attention to their communication style.The way a prospective employee, service provider or partner communicates with you in an email or phone call is likely the way they communicate with everyone. If the way that they communicate or handle themselves is not how you want your brand handled, use that as a litmus test for honey-badgerdom.I have made the mistake of overlooking emails and calls that were too gruff or more like a stream-of-consciousness only to find out that that s the way that person behaved when representing my business.Related: The Best Type of Social Network Is a Phone Call Away5. Do detailed reference checks.Great resumes, testimonials or friendships shouldn t supplant the need to do a few reference checks. Make sure to ask questions that get the person providing the reference talking and read between the lines on answers. Focus on the traits that are important to you. Ask questions about the style of the person s communication, if they are more of an attention to detail or visionary worker, or other questions that don t require the person providing the reference to throw anyone under the bus, but will still key you in to their style.6. Hire for values, not just skills.You can teach someone how to use a certain software program or train them on the best way to answer an email. You cannot teach someone to care. Be willing to look at great people with outstanding work ethics and who share your core values, even if they don t have the perfect resume in terms of skills.7. Listen to your gut. One of the most underrated mechanisms we have for avoiding issues is to listen to our own guts. If something seems off or if any red flag is raised, don t brush it aside. If it doesn t feel right to you, then wait for something -- or someone -- better to come along.With some effort you can avoid working with individuals with poor, cavalier attitudes. While nobody may care about your business as much as you do, you still want to find people with a strong work ethic and desire to excel, instead of the common honey badger.Related: Simple Yet Powerful Business Lessons From a Broke Entrepreneur Turned Multi-MillionaireCarol RothCarol Roth is the creator of the Future File  legacy planning system, a  recovering  investment banker, business advisor, entrepreneur and best-selling author.

/article/239400,"Millennials Would Like to Work for You, If They Can Apply on Their Smartphones",Young workers expect to be able to search for jobs on mobile devices and draw negative conclusions about companies that don't accommodate that.,"Free Webinar | August 16thFind out how to optimize your website to give your customers experiences that will have the biggest ROI for your business.							Register Now  The millennial generation is a mobile generation, period. If this wasn t an already known fact hammered home by the proliferation of mobile devices, it certainly has been reinforced by the impact this generation is having on the evolution of today s businesses.It then stands to reason that corporate talent acquisition teams, who rely on this generation to carry the company torch into the next several decades, should be making great strides in adopting and deploying mobile recruiting solutions. The results of the recent 2014 Jibe Talent Acquisition Survey tell another story: companies are struggling to keep up with mobile generation, and risk becoming virtually obsolete to the new generation of millennial job seekers if they don t move faster.Related: Why Millennials Are Immature, Entitled and the Best HireThe survey, conducted by independent research firm Kelton Global polling more than 1,000 job seekers and more than 300 HR professionals, highlights the disconnect between expectations and reality when searching and applying for jobs. Unsurprisingly, results showed that a clear majority of job seekers use, or at least expect to use, mobile in parts of their job search. Eighty percent of job seekers expect to be able to do at least part of their job search easily on a smartphone, and more than half (54 percent) reported that they have used a mobile device in numerous ways to aid in their job search. Many noted that if they couldn t, they d move on to other opportunities.Furthermore, of the in-house recruiting and HR professionals surveyed, 36 percent said that if they were in a candidate s shoes, they would not say their application process was optimized for mobile. Another 27 percent of respondents at companies of 500 or more employees reported that they ve done absolutely nothing to optimize for mobile.Related: The Problem With Hiring Millennials Is Their Age, Not Their GenerationIt is abundantly clear that today s, and most certainly tomorrow s, workforce is ready for a mobile search and apply process. As more and more millennial job candidates enter the workforce, companies that ignore mobile and rely on the desktop application as the sole means for attracting talent, run the risk of alienating themselves to the best candidates. The impact, however, is not just limited to candidates. It could also affect the company s product side as well: one quarter of talent acquisition practitioners think that providing a poor (or non-existent) mobile application experience might even prevent these candidates from buying products or services from that company. Now we re not just talking about applicants, we re talking about potential customers and a company s bottom line.The good news: the need for mobile optimization is deemed a priority amongst HR and recruitment professionals, with a full 76 percent acknowledging it s an important problem to solve. The bad news: many companies are still struggling to push this as a priority within their organizations. So where is the resistance? Well, 43 percent of professionals said that IT issues are the most common roadblocks, with budget constraints (35 percent) and internal resistance (32 percent) following closely behind. It is a broken process, but fixing it isn t as difficult as you might think.New technologies and solutions are available, right now, that allow companies to implement a mobile apply process outside of the constraints of their legacy recruitment systems. This next-wave of solutions was built with the mobile job seeker in mind, front and center. Adopting optimized mobile application solutions can significantly improve the conversion rate of potential candidates who use a mobile device for applying for a job.Investing in mobile solutions will impact and enhance all of the investments that talent acquisition and recruiting professionals make, including sourcing and recruiting spend, branding and marketing efforts and targeted outreach programs.The proverbial  line in the sand  has been drawn. Old recruiting methods are no longer good enough. Companies that adopt recruitment marketing tools designed with mobile in mind, and not cobbled together to address it after the fact, can significantly improve both the recruiter and the candidate experience. This includes ensuring consistency in a prospect s application experience, strengthening an employer s brand and capturing top talent everywhere (smartphone, tablet, laptop or desktop included).It s time to go  all-in  for mobile. Let s not keep the mobile generation waiting any longer.Related: Want to Nab Top, Young Talent? Millennial-Proof Your Office.Joe EssenfeldJoe Essenfeld is the founder and CEO of Jibe.

/article/239392,Employee Wellness Programs Need to Get Personal to Succeed,The traditional carrot-and-stick approach is not very effective at getting people to take their health seriously.,"While 50 percent of companies with more than 50 employees have wellness programs, they are not achieving the desired employee health improvements, the New York Times recently reported. Wellness programs can work, if properly conceived and implemented -- the problem is they rarely are.Typically, workplace-wellness programs employ a  carrot-and-stick  approach where the employee is financially rewarded for participation through lower health-care premiums and penalized with higher premiums if they do not participate. This approach is not only failing to improve the health of our workforce, but actually alienating workers by making them feel coerced into addressing lifestyle issues, and disciplined if they do not.Wellness-program success begins with management.Healthy employees make for engaged, happy and productive team members. As employers, this is what we want! However, motivation to make personal wellness a priority is a personal decision, and the  carrot-and-stick  approach is simply not a positive method to encourage employees to better themselves.Related: Inspire Wellness in Your Workplace, and Watch Productivity SoarInstead of rewarding or penalizing employees financially, as CEO and founder of Grokker, I  walk the talk  to ensure the company s culture actively supports each employee s personal wellness without being preachy or condescending.I do this by displaying my own commitment to wellness, sharing my Eat 3, Move 3, Sleep 8 mantra and regularly practicing my morning yoga in our offices or joining the team in grueling HIIT workouts.Financially punishing one employee for walking fewer steps than another or for eating too many chocolate chip cookies during lunch only creates hostility within a team. Rather, offer everyone a supportive environment focused on the whole self.Focus on overall well-being, not just physical health.While smoking cessation and weight loss are important health goals, overall well-being goes beyond the physical to include stress management, resilience and mindfulness.Employees  self-esteem and positive feelings towards work have a direct effect on eating habits, sleep and exercise, and in turn those habits directly correlate to stress levels.After all, an overweight colleague who successfully manages work-life balance may be infinitely more productive than their thinner counterpart who pulls all-nighters and seems constantly frazzled.A thoughtful wellness program advances health in all aspects -- physically, emotionally and psychologically -- because holistically caring for ourselves is the only path to true total wellness. For employees, this translates into increased productivity, creative thinking, comradery and in turn, greater success for the company as a whole.Related: Prioritizing Health Can Help You and Your BusinessListen to what employees want out of a wellness program.Johnson & Johnson is a great example of a company that has adapted its wellness program based on employee feedback. Seeing low participation in certain financial-incentive programs, the company switched its focus to campaigns without monetary rewards, such as a walking program that honors employees taking over a million steps per year.To facilitate the most participation in wellness activities, ask what your employees desire. In metropolitan cities, where gym memberships and packages at boutique studios can soar beyond a typical monthly budget, team members may simply want to be reimbursed for these fitness  luxuries.  Perhaps your team is interested in competing in local club sports as a company or a quarterly 5K race together. If healthier eating is a priority, you might consider offering a subscription to a service such as Fresh Direct for your office instead of a vending machine.When given the choice to define their wellness priorities, employees are much more likely to participate and these incentives will help form lifelong healthy habits.Make it personal. It s personal  is a core value at Grokker, and our company s culture encourages each team member to take care of themselves, however it best suits them. We cater in lunch every day to encourage the team to take a true break and eat together, family style. We talk about family, dating, current events and health issues. Above all else, we laugh and relax.Establishing personal  joy  goals are part of our quarterly performance management. These comprise actionable work-life balance goals or fitness/physical health goals ranging from,  I want to coach my daughter s soccer team,   I want to cook more than three meals at home each week,   I want to lose 10 pounds before my reunion  or  I want to practice yoga and meditate three times a week. Through focusing on the personal-wellness goals of each team member, without punitive financial policies, you can also build a powerful culture of healthy individuals who take their well-being seriously.Related: Putting a Price Tag on Employee FitnessLorna BorensteinLorna Borenstein is founder and CEO of Grokker, the  be a better you  community-driven content network offering high-quality, expert-led videos in three key wellness areas: yoga, fitness and cooking.

/article/238811,Reward Your Employees With Time Off for Volunteer Work,"Sure, giving back will help your team feel good, but it can also help your bottom line.","I m not just being a Scrooge. With recent hot IPOs such as Alibaba and the inevitable discussion of the Silicon Valley  perks arms race  that always seems to accompany this kind of news, it got me thinking about the perks that really matter.At Charitybuzz, we have periodic volunteer days where we get out of the office to paint an elementary school or pack groceries for New York s homeless. Our staff loves having the time off to give back, but it s also become an incredible source of bonding that brings us closer as a team. Given our mission, volunteering makes sense. We raise money for non-profits, so we attract employees who are passionate about giving back.Related: Getting Employees to Volunteer and GiveBut I think a volunteerism perk can be just as important, if not more important, for a company whose day-to-day business is less philanthropic. Companies such as SAP, Patagonia, Microsoft and PWC are already doing this. Timberland employees get up to 40 paid hours per year (an entire work week!) to devote to volunteer work. If your company isn t offering paid time off for volunteering, here are some reasons why you should consider it.1. Passionate people are passionate people In other words, employees who are passionate about something outside of work (their favorite cause or volunteer side gig) are more likely to be passionate at work. A volunteerism perk will help you attract passionate people who will bring that same passion to your company s mission.2. Happy employees = happy bottom lineCountless studies over the past decade have shown that people derive more happiness from experiences than from material things. When this experience involves giving back or helping others, the happiness quotient is upped even further, hence the well-documented  Helper s High. Related: 6 Ways to Do Well by Doing GoodBetween this happiness effect and the general refreshment that comes from a few days out of the office, the infusion of positive energy you get from a volunteerism perk far outweighs a few days of absenteeism from work.3. It's the ultimate millennial perkMaybe you ve heard of them. One day, we re espousing their virtues and the next, we re griping about their quirks. The fact is, they re here to stay and as the rate of baby boomer retirements increases, we need them more than ever.What we re learning about millennials says a lot about the best ways to attract and retain them. Study after study shows that they want to buy from and work for companies whose missions and values they believe in. Other research shows that, compared with previous generations, millennials value experiences over material possessions.Combine the happiness derived from an inspiring volunteer experience and the appeal of working for a company that gives back, and paid volunteer days look like the ultimate millennial perk -- not to mention a social-media recruiting tool that runs itself. Imagine the social currency of an Instagram post about a cool volunteer gig with paid time off generously provided by #yourcompany.So while I m not advocating you ditch the traditional holiday bonus (in all my years in business, no one s ever given one back), this piece of advice is my gift to you: reward your employees with time off for volunteer work, and they ll reward you with better work all around.Related: Richard Branson on the Value of VolunteeringCoppy HolzmanCoppy Holzman is the founder and CEO of Charitybuzz, which has harnessed the power of cause marketing to help brands and nonprofits raise more than $100 million through online charity auctions.

/article/239117,Measure These 5 Talent Metrics for Greater Success in Hiring and Managing Employees,Human-resource teams worldwide are still failing to use data to make decisions as well as evaluate business performance.,"An organization is only as good as its talent, so finding and hiring the best is vital for success.However, the 2014 Global Assessment Trends Report from The Corporate Executive Board (CEB) found only half of respondents use talent metrics to prove return on investment of talent or help inform business decisions, and only 45 percent currently use objective measures of potential to guide development and succession plans.This means human-resource teams worldwide are still failing to make the connection between measuring talent metrics and using that data to make hiring decisions, as well as evaluate business performance.Related: 7 Payroll Items to Check Off Your List Before the Year EndsHere are five talent metrics that need to be measured:1. High-potential talent (HiPo)HiPo talent are employees who have the potential, ability and aspiration to be successful leaders within an organization. Generally speaking, HiPo talent earn the trust and respect of others, demonstrate flexibility and have proven to be reliable.As HiPo talent are often the future leaders of an organization, it s important to determine which employees qualify and how their talent can best be developed. Is it through mentorship? Leadership opportunities? Measuring and developing high-potential talent is crucial to the future of an organization.2. Candidate reactionsMore than 80 percent of organizations see a positive candidate reaction to their hiring process as important, but less than half actually measure reactions, according to the CEB report. The report also found that 20 percent of candidates who have a negative experience use social media to publicly share about it, making it increasingly important for organizations to measure candidate reactions.Organizations can measure candidate reactions throughout the hiring process, as well as after it has been completed. Using surveys to measure what worked and what didn t, as well as to collect candidate thoughts and opinions, can help organizations streamline their hiring process and ensure candidates have positive reactions.3. Employee engagement and retentionThe CEB study found 56 percent of human-resource professionals listed engagement and retention as a top priority. However only 19 percent had a formal engagement and retention process, risking the loss of key talent.Related: The Art of Courting Candidates: Creating a Stellar Startup Interview ExperienceEmployees who are not engaged will not feel connected to a company and may seek out opportunities elsewhere. In addition, they may not be as productive. Developing a process to measure employee engagement can help an organization increase engagement and by association, retention. This can be done through surveys and focus groups designed to find out what motivates employees and makes them feel engaged in the workplace.4. External hiring versus internalMeasuring the success of external hiring versus internal can help a company determine where to look for talent. Objectivity, or the gap in hiring vs. internal promotions, should be considered, as well.For example, if all hiring is external, the company may need to work on improving its current leadership programs. Only 30 percent of organizations have a formal leadership-development process, according to the CEB study, and lack of leadership programs can inhibit internal promotions and cause the objectivity gap to widen.5. High-performer turnover rateNot only is turnover costly to the company, but it can also have a negative impact on an organization s success, especially when the turnover involves top performers. If an organization is continuously losing top talent, it may need to take a look at its policies and make some changes.How long does top talent stay with an organization? What motivates them to leave? Measuring these things can help an organization understand the needs of top talent and adapt to fit those needs.One final thought: While it s good to measure talent metrics and collect data from them, remember that this data can't exist in a vacuum. It should be used to help the organization see success. Metrics on HiPos, as well as external vs. internal hiring and high-performance turnover rate, can all be used to inform talent acquisition.

/article/239293,5 Things You Need to Know Before Hiring Your First Employee,"To prevent costly mistakes and wasted time, run through all of the following considerations before you even think about recruiting.","Making the decision to expand your business is a big deal. Whether you re a single professional whose practice has outgrown your available time or an entrepreneur with dreams of growing the next Fortune 500 company, adding a new employee into the mix isn t a process that should be taken lightly.To prevent costly mistakes and wasted time, run through all of the following considerations before you even think about hitting  Publish  on that job-board listing:1. Check your finances.Hiring employees involves more than just paying a salary. Depending on your state, you may be responsible for employment taxes, worker s compensation fees, additional insurance requirements and more. If you re feeling generous, your compensation package may include benefits, vacation/personal time and 401k contributions above and beyond your employee s salary.Related: 6 Tips to Keep in Mind When Hiring Your First EmployeesGiven the potential financial commitment involved, it s imperative that you check your current financial situation and project your current income. You might be able to make payroll for the next month, but if you have any concerns about falling short in the next year, consider working with a contract agency or freelancer until your situation is more stable.2. Assess your needs.If you re confident that your finances support bringing on a new employee, the next big question you ll have to answer is what type of worker to hire. There are a few different ways to approach this question:Ask where you need help: Think about where the biggest needs in your company exist and fill them with a new employee. In my case with Growth Everywhere, I was getting so busy with administrative tasks that I didn t have enough time available to focus on growth activities. The clear choice was to hire an administrative assistant who could free up my time for higher value activities.Base it on your bottom line: Alternatively, you could look at hiring the person or position that s most likely to have an impact on your bottom line. If a high churn rate is killing your revenue, an account manager or customer-service representative could make a big difference. Or if your funnel is pretty well established, a good salesperson could help send as many leads to it as possible.Compliment your skills: Say you re a great salesperson, but you lack the strategic knowledge on how to grow a business to the size you desire. If you re in this position, hiring a manager, business director or chief financial officer could help fill the gaps.There s no clear-cut answer for every business, so put some thought into what your company needs now and what it will take to meet your growth goals before bringing on a new employee.3. Look for candidates with startup experience.You ve listed your job and the resumes are flying in -- now how do you pick the candidate that s right for your business?Related: How to Communicate With Your First EmployeeThere s a lot that goes into choosing the right person, and you ll want to look at everything from stated skills, personality to references when making your selection. But if I could offer you one piece of advice, it would be to look for people that have worked for startups before.Working for a small company requires that employees work autonomously, and it rewards those who are able to wear many hats and work beyond their stated job descriptions. Candidates coming from large firms might look good on paper, but they re generally used to the structure, hierarchy and processes found at established businesses. That doesn t mean they won t work out, but the unique company culture of a growing business can make it a challenging adjustment.4. Ask for recommendations.Another great strategy for finding good employees is to ask around. Talk to your friends, your business contacts and anyone else you can think of that might be able to send a qualified candidate your way. Since recommending somebody who turns out to be a bad employee reflects poorly on your contacts, you ll find that these people are likely to only send you the candidates that they re truly willing to stand behind.5. Cover your   business.Finally, keep in mind that hiring an employee isn t as simple as offering somebody money and expecting them to do the work you describe. Depending on your state and your industry, there are a number of different laws and restrictions that govern the employee-employer relationship -- and you definitely don t want to find out about these when you re being taken to court for a mistake you ve made!Save yourself the time, money and legal headaches employee disputes can cause by consulting a lawyer from the start. Paying for a few hours of consultation and document review is a great way to invest in your small company s long-term growth.What tips would you add?

/article/238608,"Employers Are Demanding Hard Skills Over Soft Skills, and How Millennials Can Help","In order to fill their job openings, HR managers are prioritizing hard skills, a new study says. Here's how millennials can fill the gap.","One of the biggest challenges companies are facing is the skills gap. While the job market still hasn't fully recovered, there are millions of jobs that aren't being filled. The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that there are 4.8 million job openings in America -- the highest level since January 2001.The skills gap is bad for employers, but it's especially bad for millennials, who are graduating college without jobs. Those who focused on non-technical majors and courses are struggling to find work while companies looking to hire technical talent are under pressure to deliver value with fewer resources. In addition, the lucky few who have jobs are actually doing multiple jobs at once because of our country s skills gap.The good news is that the millennial generation -- as it becomes the largest generation in the workforce in 2015 -- has the power to help close this gap.Related: Gen Z Employees: The 5 Attributes You Need to KnowSince employers are so keen on hiring subject-matter experts, it's no surprise that hard skills are important in their selection criteria for jobs. In a new study commissioned by my company, in partnership with Elance-oDesk.com, we found that in order to fill their job openings, HR managers are prioritizing hard skills. Fifty-five percent of HR managers said they focus more on hard skills when hiring, versus only 21 percent who focus more on personality. Forty-five percent of the HR managers said they expect to become even more skills-focused in 10 years (versus only 11 percent who expect to become more personality-focused).While soft skills like building relationships and handling workplace conflict are important, companies are much more results-driven now, as they attempt to close the skills gap and keep up with the pace of technological innovation. In addition, in the aftermath of the economic collapse, companies were paying more attention to head count costs.Hard skills can be developed in several ways. First, you can take various types of classes in order to learn them. For instance, take a class at a local college, a free class online at Coursera.com, or a class taught by an expert at Skillshare.com. Choose a class based on how you learn the best. If you're better in a small classroom than a virtual environment without a teacher, then choose that.Related: Why College Students Need to Be Entrepreneurial With Their CareersAnother way to gain hard skills is by doing an apprenticeship under someone who you respect in your field. Instead of asking for money, help the person in everything that he or she needs to be more successful, without incurring any expenses, while you learn from the best. This hands-on experience works well for many people and that connection can open doors to new opportunities later.Another way to get hard skills is by teaching yourself. One way to do this is by taking on freelance projects in order to practice your skills and have tangible results that you can leverage into new opportunities. There are also hundreds of free tutorial websites online which can teach you coding and other hard skills that employers are looking to hire for. You might have a friend that can tutor you as well, which is another free alternative to paying for courses.A lot of millennials don't have money to spend on courses so if you already have a job, your employers might be willing to pay for them so that you are more effective in your job. If not, then it's on you and only you can make that type of investment in yourself -- and it's worth it because you will become more valuable and relevant in your industry as a result.Related: Why 'Gen Z' May Be More Entrepreneurial Than 'Gen Y'Dan SchawbelDan Schawbel is a career and workplace expert, the founder of Millennial Branding and author of the New York Times bestselling book, Promote Yourself: The New Rules For Career Success (St. Martin's Press, 2013).

/article/238662,The Seesaw of Social and Analytical Skills -- 5 Ways to Build Both,Having strong social and analytical skills is crucial for both leaders and their employees. They promote problem-solving ability and the ability to work together as a group.,"A lack of social or analytical skills can negatively impact the atmosphere of a workplace and cause problems with both productivity and office cohesiveness. Furthermore, a July 2014 study by researchers at the University of California-Santa Barbara found there is a huge market demand for individuals who have both social and analytical skills.Related: 5 Skills Every Successful Entrepreneur Must MasterSo, what are social and analytical skills?Social skills are exactly what they sound like: how much or little an individual relates to those around them, as well as society as a whole. Analytical skills are more problem focused, specifically how well a person can solve them and complete tasks. Both are learned at a young age and develop over time.Having strong social and analytical skills is crucial for both leaders and their employees. They promote problem-solving ability and the ability to work together as a group.Our brains are built so both the social and analytical networks function like a seesaw -- as one is used less, the other is used more. For example, someone who is very analytical and good at solving complex problems may be lacking in people skills, or vice versa.Luckily, there are ways to build and strengthen both skills:1. Rate each employee on their social and analytical tendencies and group people together accordingly.This doesn t necessarily mean put like with like. Think about it: a group of all analytical people will be great at problem solving but won t develop any further social skills. Instead, group people in mixed groups so they have the ability to learn from each other.Consider having a team-building day with group activities so employees can build their skills in a fun, non-stressful way.2. Give greater weight to social skills in hiring and evaluations.It s easy to be swayed by an alluring resume or a candidate with lots of technical skills. However, how well does this person relate to people?During the hiring process, give greater weight to social skills and try to find a candidate who has a solid combination of both social and analytical skills. After they are hired, work on developing their existing skills further.Related: Get Angry! Be Passionate! Your Emotions Are Vital to Success.This applies to any candidate, from entry to high level.3. Evaluate and reward based on both social and analytical successes.Evaluations are one of the best ways to assess performance, but in the past have been used mainly for analytical purposes. Updating evaluations to include social as well as analytical success can help motivate all members of a company to hone both skills.Using rewards can help provide further motivation. This could be anything from a company dinner to a small bonus.4. Find ways to develop social thinking and capabilities over time.Your brain and the skills and abilities it has are like any other muscle: it takes time to make it stronger. Developing social skills is not an overnight process. Find ways to develop social thinking and capabilities and stay committed. Over time, results will show, both personally and throughout the company.5. Learn from each other.Don t let the barriers of title impede the progress of growth. Co-workers are one of the best resources for learning. Not only can employees learn from leaders, but also leaders can learn from employees. Follow the example of the individual with the strongest social skills. Figure out what makes them so strong and imitate it.Social and analytical skills are two sides of the same coin, and both are crucial for success for company leaders and their employees. Like any other skill, these can be developed over time with some dedication.The old saying practice makes perfect fits in well here -- the more an individual uses and develops their social and analytical skills, the stronger they become.Do you know of other ways to develop social and analytical skills?

/article/238392,7 Ways to Nail Your Next Startup Job Interview,"Skills can be learned, but you either have ambition, drive and a willingness or you don't.","I ve interviewed hundreds of job candidates. Occasionally, I m blown away but, more often than not, I immediately regret that we re going to spend the next 30 minutes wasting each other s time.Below are seven lessons every person should keep in mind before his or her next job interview at a startup.1. Punch above your weight classSerial entrepreneur turned VC Mark Suster wrote a solid post a few years ago about why startups should only hire people who want to punch above their weight class. This is true for the startup world, and beyond. Superstars don t become superstars because they re naturally gifted. Superstars are exceptionally ambitious. They are confident they can learn or do almost anything. This means that you should absolutely apply for jobs that you don t technically qualify for on paper. Once you get the interview, prove why you re going to kill it anyway.Related: These 5 Interview Blunders Will Probably Kill Your Job Prospects2. Openly discuss your weaknessesWorld-class people are acutely self aware. They can acknowledge that they re terrible at many things. Employers want to hear from your mouth, with zero hesitation, what your biggest flaws are, and how you plan to offset those weaknesses, so that your presence is a net positive to the company.3. Demonstrate why you re world classYou will be hired for the one thing that you can do better than anyone in the company, despite your many flaws. Find a way to demonstrate this skill in the first interview.4. Be prepared to have a deep discussionResearch the backgrounds of the company s core staff, especially those who will be interviewing you. Devour every major article ever written about the company. Digest every detail. Most importantly, obsessively study the company s market and develop original thoughts on what s next. Be ready to talk in-depth on a variety of subjects. The interviewer should learn something from you in the process.Related: The One Reason Why Job Interviews and Sales Calls Fail5. Request a projectIt s hard to prove what you can do in a first discussion. If you can competently turn around a difficult project in an insanely short period of time, you ll prove you re either a domain expert or that you have the appetite and capacity to learn quickly. Either way, this alone will likely get you a job.6. Say why you can t imagine yourself anywhere else. And mean itWhen you take a job at a startup, your employer expects you to do the best work of your life, the most work of your life and to help others accomplish the same. As such, if you re not obsessed with the company and the opportunity, save yourself the time and don t apply. Show up with a clear understanding of where this company fits within your overall goals. Demonstrate that you will do anything it takes to prove how hungry you are.7. Be honestIt sounds ridiculously obvious, but you d be amazed how many candidates lie in interviews. Be honest about your background. We ll pick up the phone and verify your credentials when you leave. Be honest about your skills, too. We ll find out the minute we give you a project if you have them or not.Related: Use Your Personal Brand to Score Big at Job InterviewsGabe LozanoGabe Lozano heads LockerDome, a social media platform built around what you like, as opposed to who you know.

/article/238355,The 3 Essential HR Technologies for Filling Your Talent Pool With the Right People,The market for qualified candidates is tightening. Technology similar to those used to find sales leads makes recruiting less expensive but more effective.,"Mark Weiser, a wise man who was chief technologist at Xerox PARC in the 1990s, once observed  the most profound technologies are those that disappear. They weave themselves into the fabric of everyday life until they are indistinguishable from it. Technology s higher calling is to act as a seamless extension of ourselves but sheer volume makes selecting it difficult. Pick a business process, any process. Now conduct an online search for technologies that help perform that function. Daunting, isn t it?Related: 5 Ways HR Technology Can Improve Performance ReviewsRecruiting and hiring solutions are no different. The marketplace for various types of data mining, search and hiring technologies is nearly overwhelming but the benefits of these tools outweigh the burden of sorting through them. They are becoming critical as the job market improves, .When a small or medium-sized business thinks  technology,  it often thinks  costly.  However, many of these solutions are scalable and affordable for businesses of any size. Unfortunately, you ll find that the Human Capital Management Software industry typically offers two extremes: one bulky solution to manage all pre-and post-hire HR technology needs, or niche products that only address one aspect of HR.There is a middle ground of integrated solutions focused specifically on talent acquisition that balances both stability and innovation to fulfill all business needs and help deliver results. With a full suite of talent acquisition solutions, businesses can ultimately have the right tools to attract, communicate with, engage and retain the best talent. Given that entrepreneurs often wear the hats of recruiter and hiring manager, a few best practices can help professionals navigate a cluttered technology space and focus on HR technologies that offer real business value.1. Video candidate screeningInterviews are resource intensive, requiring businesses to make relatively significant investments in pursuit of candidates who may not be best-fit talent. Enter video candidate screening, which allows employers to  test drive  job candidates and review their soft skills virtually before spending time and money associated with in-person interviews.In just a few simple steps, candidates can use their desktop webcam or a mobile device to upload a short video responding to a company s custom questions. This allows the candidate to showcase strengths while enabling busy hiring managers to more quickly decide if they want to progress to the interview phase.Related: 4 Signs It's Time for a Cloud-Based HR PlatformMobile-optimized career siteMillennials matter, as it s predicted that they will comprise nearly half of the workforce by 2020. It's important for businesses to have mobile-optimized career portals and online environments to meet the mobile engagement preferences of these candidates and the growing mobile preference of the entire candidate pool. Research shows that 86 percent of job seekers use mobile devices for job searches.A mobile-optimized career site can enable job seekers to receive alerts, apply for positions, track application status, share information via email, seek advice and references and share open jobs quickly and easily among their social networks.Recruitment marketing automationA core applicant tracking system (ATS) is similar to a sales organization s customer relationship management (CRM): it prevents recruiters from losing good candidates in a stack of files and ensures good notes and appointments are stored and searchable.Now think one step before CRM. Just as marketing professionals leverage marketing automation systems to help build a pipeline of qualified leads for sales reps, HR technologies now offer similar tools that can build a pipeline of candidates for recruiters to close. Social recruiting via these technologies can build a strong selection of passive candidates while gathering nuanced information about candidate behaviors, preferences and personality to better inform employment matches down the line.The HR technology marketplace is vast. Hundreds of solutions are vying for attention but not all deserve it. Video candidate screening, mobile-optimized sites and talent CRM tools are essential talent acquisition technologies that HR departments and recruiters, alike, must utilize to narrow the field and fill their pipeline with the ideal people.Rather than creating confusion, it s tech that actually simplifies the job of filling jobs.Related: What the Data Tells Us About the Contemporary HR DirectorColin DayColin Day is the CEO of iCIMS.Read more",Recruiting,2014-10-14 21:00:00
/article/236776,Ensure Your New Employee's Success With These 5 Steps,"If you're hired the right person, following these tips will help make sure your new hire performs to your expectations.","You believe your new employee will bring great value to your organization. You expect they will help to ease some of the workload and burden. Mostly, you hope they will deliver the results you reasonably want and need within the cultural norms of your organization.However, if your desires are to be met, you need to make sure that you are setting your employee up to succeed. To do this, follow these five steps:1. Make sure that your expectations are reasonable. Do you have or have you had other similarly experienced people who were able to meet or exceed your goals? If so, it is probably a safe bet that your expectations are reasonable. If not, you may need to adjust your expectations. Obviously, this is a judgment call that you will have to make.Related: Want Your Business to Grow? Help Your Employees Succeed.2. Ensure that the employee clearly understands your expectations.More than 50 percent of the disciplinary actions we ve dealt with in our careers have had at least some aspect of misunderstanding between the employee and the manager. First, explain your expectations in detail. Then, ask your employee to describe to you how they will fulfill the requirements. This will help to eliminate miscommunication.3. Remove all organizational roadblocks.You should remove all roadblocks that are internal to the organization. These speed bumps may include policies, procedures, internal politics or a lack of critical resources (such as the right equipment to do the job). Correct all of these issues. Of course, you can t be responsible for removing employee-generated roadblocks (such as personal problems).4. Train the employee and give him or her time to practice.While your employee professed experience, all organizations are unique. Different computer systems, policies, procedures and corporate culture can prevent good employees from being immediately successful. Make sure the employee is appropriately trained and has had sufficient time to practice the new skills.Related: Want Your Business to Be a Success? Set Your Employees Up to Succeed.5. Ensure that the employee is motivated to perform.Most employees need both rewards and consequences to perform well. An environment that is skewed heavily to either one or the other will result in dysfunction. Giving employees praise for a job well done often results in them repeating the behavior. Catch employees doing something right and tell them about it.Likewise, employees must understand that poor performance may result in discipline and/or termination. Avoiding negative feedback may make things easier for the manager in the short term, but it s unfair to the employee and will result in greater problems in the long term.If you have checked all of these boxes and your employee is still not delivering the results that you expect, want and need, you probably do not have the right person in the job. The only possibilities left are that your employee is unwilling or unable to meet your expectations. Either way, this person is probably not right for the position.Even if the employee is delivering results, but doing it in a way that is not compatible with your culture, he or she may not be a good fit. For example, a supervisor who delivers results by belittling and berating those under him may not work well in your supportive environment. On the other hand, when your employee is delivering the results you expect and behaving within your cultural norms, you have hired the right person.Related: Seven Steps to Coaching Your Employees to SuccessDoug and Polly WhiteDoug and Polly are small business experts, speakers and consultants who work with entrepreneurs through Whitestone Partners.

/article/238102,5 Ways to Turn Employee Turnover Into Opportunity,"Identify great talent, onboard, develop, lose talent, repeat. It doesn't always have to be a negative cycle.","In business, there s nothing worse than hiring a stellar employee, taking the time to mentor them and foster their growth, and then watching them leave after a short time. There s a word for this: churn.Churn is a measure of the number of individuals or items moving out of a collective group over a specific period of time. In other words, how often individuals move from one job to the next.The influx of job-hopping young professionals today is giving many companies a headache. In fact, according to a 2013 Millennial Branding and Beyond.com study, 30 percent of companies lost 15 percent or more of their millennial employees in 2013. However, this doesn t have to be a negative occurrence.Related: It's Inevitable That Good Employees Will Leave, So Plan for ItWith a little tweaking, you can take employee turnover and use it for company growth. Your talent management strategy can t be effective in a vacuum. The key is to develop a process with visibility between departments to be successful with a high turnover rate.Check out these five strategies for turning employee turnover into opportunity:1. Learn what makes a top performer.This is different for every company, and truthfully, every position. Find the qualities that make your best employees stand out and work to develop them across the company. Even when you lose employees, you ll have a stronger organization as a whole. Furthermore, once you find those qualities, you can look for them in future candidates.2. Continuously improve hiring and onboarding processes. If you find yourself consistently losing good employees, you might be hiring the wrong people. Qualifications aside, anyone who isn t a good cultural fit won t stay long. Would you really want them to?Work to change your hiring and onboarding processes to only hire candidates who truly fit in with your culture. This could mean anything from recruiting in new and different places to instituting group interviews.3. Evaluate appraisals and compensation.If you want the best, you have to give the best. For the most part, you get what you pay for when it comes to talent. Evaluate your appraisals and compensation strategy on a yearly basis to make sure you re attracting the best talent in the industry.Related: How to Stop Your Rock-Star Talent From Fleeing4. Check out the competition.Where are your employees going? What about the new organization tempted them to leave? The competitive landscape exists not only for your brand, but for your employees, as well.Finding out what motivated your employees to go to a new organization may be humbling but is also an incredible opportunity for growth. Was it money? The office environment? Learning from your competition and making adjustments can slow your turnover rate and help you hold on to employees.5. Value current employees. Employees who feel undervalued or underappreciated are more likely to seek employment elsewhere. A 2013 American Psychological Association study tells us just over half (51 percent) of employees feel valued at work. The solution to this is simple: Keep employees so happy they don t want to leave.Again, tailor this to your company. Don t break the bank, but do something that fits in with your culture. For example, at ClearCompany we have a monthly game night. Everything from poker to Cards Against Humanity is up for grabs, and it is a great way for everyone to unwind, socialize with other departments, and have some fun. Of course, a simple  Thank you. You re doing a great job,  goes a long way.The key to any successful business is recognizing challenges and learning from them. Employee turnover is one of these, and while frustrating, can be a great opportunity for growth. It s a process that takes time and research but is worthwhile in the end because, at the end of the day, a company is the sum of its employees and the work they produce. Make sure you re hiring the best and holding on to them.What other ways do you recommend for turning turnover into opportunity?

/article/238091,Prepare for Family Leave Laws and Avoid Litigation Later,Laws mandating extended paid leaves are increasingly common and already prompting a surge in employee lawsuits.,"Entrepreneurs have a lot to think about, from funding to adequate office space. When it comes to employees, the main focus is on finding the right people for the right positions, those with the skills and attitude to fuel innovation and growth.But the legal environment is rapidly changing, with more labor-related rules and regulatory requirements. This is especially the case in the area of employee leave. The federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) and state and even local laws have made leave the most pressing, complex  and possibly litigious arena of employee relations.In September, California Governor Jerry Brown signed a law that gives part-time and temporary workers up to three paid sick days a year. California is the second state to offer paid sick leave for part-time and temporary workers, after Connecticut passed a similar bill in 2011. The New Jersey Assembly will consider a paid sick leave bill this fall.Related: First FamilyOn top of these state laws are city laws.In 2006, San Francisco became the first city in the country to require employers to give their employees time off. In subsequent years, the District of Columbia, Seattle, Portland, Ore., New York City and Jersey City, N.J., among others, passed their own laws.The cost of complying with just the FMLA is already significant.  According to the Employment Policy Foundation, compliance with FMLA costs employers more than $21 billion in lost productivity, continued health benefits and labor replacement. But the real FMLA-related risk is that of litigation.Lawsuits filed under the statute jumped from 291 in 2012 to 877 in 2013, according to the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. The FMLA was the only employment law to generate a sharp increase in claims in that period. The statute requires a lower threshold of proof than most other employment laws. In a bias case, a worker typically has to show that his employer intended to discriminate. But in an FMLA case, he has to show only that the employer somehow deterred or interrupted a leave authorized under the act.Related: The Ins and Outs of Creating a Parental Leave PolicyHR.com reports the average verdict for FMLA cases related to wrongful termination is nearly $335,000, a devastating amount for a small business, especially a newer enterprise investing for growth rather than immediate profitability.  Almost as damaging as the direct costs of litigation are the indirect costs diverted management time, recruitment impacts and reputational risk.So what should employers do to deal with these laws, reduce leave absence costs and mitigate litigation risk?First, employers should invest the time to learn the basics of leave laws and regulations. There are numerous associations that understand the reality of running a business and assist employers to tailor their leave-related programs. The Society for Human Resource Management, the Disability Management Employer Coalition and others provide low or even no cost overviews of FMLA, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and related laws. Opportunities range from online PowerPoints to local seminars designed for, and often presented by, professional leave and disability experts.At the very least, such introductory training can outline the most important actions to avoid, and point companies to additional resources.Second, employers should regularly communicate to employees the importance of FMLA and ADA, and owners and managers should embrace the laws  goals and the need to comply with them. Communicating and documenting proper intent helps ensure compliance and has the added benefit of reducing fraudulent leave requests.Finally, companies -- especially those with locations in multiple jurisdictions -- should consider automating their entire absence management process. There are numerous reasonably-priced solutions that enable managers to track and manage absence in compliance with FMLA, ADA and other state and local laws and regulations. Industry groups like Spring Consulting estimate that comprehensive absence management solutions can reduce direct, indirect and return-to-work costs by 11 percent. Perhaps most important, today s absence management solutions nearly eliminate litigation risk.Start-up owners have a lot to worry about.  Lawsuits over leave need not be one of them. Easy and relatively low-costs steps can take the risk off the table.Related: In the Latest Move to Revamp Yahoo's Culture, Marissa Mayer Expands Parental LeaveLeo CorcoranLeo Corcoran is the CEO of ClaimVantage.

/article/238085,Apple Unveils New Perks to Attract Talent,The iPhone maker rolls out expanded benefits to retain and attract top-notch employees.,"Apple employees are getting a few new perks (and no, it s not free iPhone 6 s).On Thursday morning the company s head of HR, Denise Young Smith, sent an employee-wide memo outlining a handful of new and updated benefits, including longer parental leave, education reimbursements for all classes taken by employees, an expanded donation-matching program, subsidized student loan refinancing and full acceleration of stock in the event of an employee s death. I don t think these [benefits] would be immediately thought of,  Young Smith told Fortune.  But for the first time we ve probably got four generations in the workplace at the same time, and we need a plethora of programs. Young Smith, who was recently profiled in Fortune s Most Powerful Women issue, took over the top HR job in February. She has since made diversity and inclusion at the iPhone maker a top priority. In an effort to attract and retain talent, she s also canvassed Apple s 98,000 employees to find out what kind of benefits they care about most.A large portion of Apple s workforce two thirds, to be exact is comprised of hourly employees, and many of them work in the company s worldwide retail stores. But Young Smith says she has made it a goal to roll out new benefits to the broader employee base, both hourly and salaried, across as many geographic locations as possible.The company s new donation-matching program, for example, will be rolled out to all employees across the countries in which Apple operates. Since 2011, when the company launched its initial philanthropy program, it has matched an impressive $25 million in employee contributions. Now, Apple plans to match employees for their time spent on philanthropic endeavors, not just money. To that end, the company will match up to $25 per hour of non-profit work for a total cap of $10,000 per employee.Apple also addressed its parental leave policy. U.S. employees will now have a few more weeks of paid parental leave: Young Smith says expectant mothers can take up to four weeks before a delivery and upwards of 14 weeks after and expectant fathers (and other non-birth parents) can take six-week parental leaves. While the new policy is far from revolutionary, it shows that Apple gets that it needs to compete to recruit and retain talent. Most other large Silicon Valley firms have fairly similar rules for parental leave though some, like payments company Square, offer more time off to both birth and non-birth parents. (And ultimately, the U.S. pales in comparison to most other countries, which have mandated maternity leave; Apple already abides by local rules in other countries.)Another way Young Smith is trying to woo employees is with Apple s  wellness center,  a medical one-stop-shop located in a striking new building at Apple s Cupertino, Calif.-based headquarters. The head of HR says 43,000 employees have already visited the center, which opened about a year ago and employs seven doctors plus a large team of chiropractors, physical therapists and dieticians. In true Apple style, simplicity and sleek design reigns at the company s wellness center. Doctors work out of a central  pod  in the middle of the building, surrounded by a circle of examination rooms, which they enter through a different door than their patients. Inside, the paperless, minimalistic exam rooms hold a small table with an iPad and Mac (what else?). There is a coat closet for employees to hang their belonging as an added bonus, each closet comes equipped with an iPhone charger. No specimens or bulky equipment are to be seen, and the average wait time for an appointment is no more than five minutes (in fact, the  wait  room is actually just called  reception .) It s the experience that sets it apart,  says Young Smith, who plans to roll out similar wellness centers in places like Sacramento and Shanghai, wherever Apple has significant pockets of employees.Under CEO Tim Cook, to whom Young Smith reports, it s clear that Apple s approach to human resources is changing.  One of the reasons I am very appreciative of his leadership is that he s got such a profound care and understanding and empathy of the employee and the employee experience,  Young Smith said in an earlier interview with Fortune.  How does that change HR? It makes it preeminent. Our people are the essence and we can t really do anything without making sure we have a culture and environment that is constantly thinking about our people. That s one of the things that Tim [Cook] brought to this. Young Smith and her staff are on a mission to explore additional benefits and how to implement more employee experience changes. The longtime Apple exec, who previously headed HR for Apple s retail division, says that more comprehensive commute coverage or commute alternatives is high on her list. She is also toying with the idea of bringing back some sort of sabbatical program, though she prefers the term  renewal.  After the late Steve Jobs returned to Apple in 1996, he got rid of the company s sabbatical plan, which let long-time employees take several months off of work every few years. Now, Young Smith says she d like to find a way to bring back some form of lengthier vacation for certain employees. As a creative company, we would be remiss not to look into it.  she says. (Meanwhile, in order to congratulate his employee base on the successful iPhone 6 launch, CEO Cook recently announced that workers at least not the ones in retail will be getting a whole week off right before Thanksgiving.The new benefits are indicative of a larger trend at Apple to focus more on people, not just products. We ve led with products for a long time and we always will,  says Young Smith, who admits Apple still struggles with beating its human resources portal s clunkiness.  But we re at a point where people are really important and experience is really important and how people experience our products is really important.

/article/237982,For a Productive Workplace Let Your Office Go to the Dogs,"Research shows that allowing employees to bring pets to work might be your best, and cheapest, HR initiative.","Dogs have earned their designation as man s best friend. Besides being loving pets and fun playmates, dogs (actually, most pets) can actually give you a leg up on the corporate ladder. As long as you take them to work with you, that is.Your company will be in great companyAccording to research by the American Pet Products Manufacturers Association, about 20 percent of all companies in the United States allow employees to bring their furry friends along to the workplace. Expectedly, the most common pet guests at workplaces are dogs at 76 percent, followed by cats at 15 percent. The remainder are small pets like hamsters or fish.Related: Do Pets Make the Best Co-Workers?Some of the most successful companies in the world welcome pets at their premises. While these include the usual suspects like Google, Amazon and Ben & Jerry s that are renowned for their work culture and employee friendly policies, there are some companies that take their pets very, very seriously indeed.The Build-a-Bear Workshop has Milford the a Chief Executive Dog, while P&G Petcare has Euka the V.P. of Canine Communications. Tito s Handmade Vodka carries out pet rescues with employees acting as foster parents for rescued animals. Software company AnchorFree even has a domesticated wolf on its premises!Some pets are not just office regulars, they are also stars in their own right. Andrew Neil, a presenter with the BBC UK, actually has his golden retriever Miss Molly as a regular fixture on his talk show. It is not uncommon for Miss Molly to curl up on a guest s lap while Neil conducts the interview.Pets improve teamwork, job satisfaction and employee In an experiment carried out by Central Michigan University researcher Christopher Honts and his team, test subjects were divided into groups that had a dog around them throughout a group task and those that did not. The groups which had a dog during their tasks showed significantly higher mutual trust, team bonding and intimacy than those that worked without one.Related: What Dogs Can Teach Us About Working More EffectivelyAn oft-cited study by Virginia Commonwealth University tested the physiological and psychological effects of pets at the workplace on employees. Researchers found that employees who left their pets at home experienced much higher stress than those who brought their pets along to the workplace. Going by the numbers, employees who had their pets at their workplace showed an 11 percent drop in their stress levels by the end of the workday as compared to a 70 percent spike in stress levels of employees who left their pets at home.Spiking the stress levels of the second group is the owners  worries by the end of a long work day about getting home on time to restless pets who need to be fed, petted or  taken for a walk in time to prevent an  accident  at home.Lower stress equals lower blood pressure and fewer heart problems. How is that related to workplace productivity? Employees who are healthier take fewer sick days, need lower health insurance premiums and contribute better at the workplace than those who fall sick often or suffer chronic health issues.The study by the American Pet Products Manufacturers Association quoted earlier, shows that employees at pet friendly workplaces are happier (who would not like to pet a cute pooch every now and then!), less stressed, more creative, more co-operative with each other and more productive at work.Must haves for a pet-friendly workplace Though I cannot fathom how it s possible, I am told there exists a sub-species of humans that cannot stand pets! There could very well be some of them lurking in your workplace, too. Since we are such nice people (and we do not want to get sued), it is important to lay down the ground rules and prepare your workplace in advance before you open your doors to your canine and feline pals.Lay down clear ground rules for acceptable and unacceptable pet behavior at the workplace.Offer the basic necessities of life to your four legged co-workers   self-cleaning litter boxes, pet water fountains, pet treats and flexibility for employees to take their pets out on a walk for limited periods of time. A  pet-free  zone for employees who are allergic to pets or are uncomfortable around them.Any other legal regulations as applicable in your state or country.So, dither not on writing that email to Human Resources with your idea of a more pet-friendly workplace.

/article/237892,What to Do If an Employee Quits in an Epic Fashion,"Should a worker unexpectedly leave the company with a dramatic and outrageous stunt, take these five steps.","Last week KTVA reporter Charlo Greene left her job during a live TV broadcast and announced her resignation by saying,  F--k it. I quit. Greene isn t the only American worker to quit their job in a ridiculous fashion. According to a May 2014 study by Shoutly, 52 percent of Americans plan to outrageously quit their jobs. Workers across America have thought of epic ways to quit their jobs, including sending a pornographic tweet from an employer s Twitter account (5 percent), posting a publicly shared video (7 percent) or publishing an open letter online (3 percent).If an employee epically quits the company, managers should do these five things:Related: Why Do People Actually Quit Their Jobs? (Infographic) 1. Refrain from replying in a tit-for-tat manner.When an employee quits a job in an outlandish fashion, respond in a professional matter. This prevents more damage being made to the company s reputation.For example, if an employee creates a viral video, don t respond with another video. Marina Shifrin quit her job with a Taiwanese viral-video news company by publishing a YouTube video. After her video went viral, her boss published a video stating that the company was hiring a new employee.Instead of replying to the employee in a similar fashion, issue a public statement. Confirm in the statement that the employee is indeed no longer with the organization and that the human resources department is investigating the situation. If the employee made any defamatory statements during the epic resignation, the statement can also include rebuttals. Just be sure to stick to the facts rather than sounding emotional and defensive.2. Call an all-hands meeting to discuss the situation honestly.Employees are the most important internal stakeholders. They re also a company s largest group of brand advocates. This why their questions and concerns should be a top priority.Hold an all-staff meeting, preparing beforehand a full statement or important points to be addressed This will allow for honest and transparent conversation with employees. During the meeting, welcome and honestly answer all questions raised.Related: Worried About Managing a Company Crisis? Take These 4 Proactive Steps3. Don t bad-mouth the employee.Regardless of how outrageous the employee s resignation was, do not speak poorly of the individual. This will only add to the negative conversation about the employer.Instead of bad-mouthing the employee, follow protocol for a termination. Since the employee didn t give two weeks' notice for the resignation, take action to tie up loose ends such as removing login access. Then start the hiring process to find a new replacement.4. Identify legal issues and prepare to take action.When an employee publicizes a dramatic resignation, be aware of the legal issues involved. Angry employees who speak badly of their employer to the public can be guilty of libel and expose confidential company information.As soon as employees announce their resignation, monitor their social-media accounts, emails sent to other employees and videos published. This enables employers to obtain proof and use it as evidence of damage to the company s reputation in a lawsuit. Once evidence is collected, take it to a lawyer who specializes in employment litigation.5. Create a crisis-communications plan.Ideally, employers should have a crisis-communications plan in place when a situation arises. In case an employer isn t prepared for an epic employee resignation specifically, immediately create a plan.Pull together a crisis-communications team and designate a company spokesperson. Next, identify the best forms of communication for the company and identify key stakeholders.Finally create messaging (for communication with employees and for speaking with reporters at press conferences) that is consistent across all targeted publics and media channels.Have you had an employee dramatically quit a job?

Scope out her social media. How does she present herself online? Does she have many connections on LinkedIn? Does she have any endorsements, recommendations, or social proof of her skills? How does she use social media and communicate to others? If her Facebook is laden with obscene language and drunken selfies, consider looking at other candidates.2. Determine his level of motivation and engagement. Make sure he s not going to be another one of the 67 percent of millennials disengaged on the job. Check the candidate s work history for any promotions or opportunities for career advancement that may have led to accepting a new position. Ask about hobbies outside of work. Motivated candidates show a thirst for learning and self-development or community participation.3. Ask how she measures performance. First, make sure the way she plans to measure and track performance aligns with company needs. Performance is dynamic and sometimes hard to quantify. If she suggests a human capital management software, it s a good sign. Many of these programs integrate all functions of HR into one and allow managers to provide feedback as often as needed through documented reports.Related: Why We Replaced (In)Human Resources with 'Employee Experience'4. Access his leadership ability. Great leaders are inquisitive, forward-thinking people who aren t afraid to stand out. Is he bold enough to ask questions? Does he like to help others? Ask the candidate how his friends would describe him. If he mentions organizing events or initiating after-work hangouts, he s probably a natural leader which is a vital quality in an HR director.Here s how the modern HR director can help businesses grow:She speaks  millennial  and probably a little  Gen Z. A millennial herself, she  gets  the people she manages. She ll be able to relate to Gen Y and Z, and therefore communicate more effectively when hiring and managing talent. She ll handle the requests of Gen Z like,  Can I telecommute once a week?  without a blink, and may organize make-your-own sushi socials. Her people management tactics will go a long way in retaining talent, which means less money lost from labor turnover.He ll be an opinion leader. Sure, he ll be a member of multiple LinkedIn groups where he scrolls through updates and articles, keeping his eye out for great talent, but he ll also likely be an opinion leader, publishing articles on industry trends. His insights will gain a following of talented professionals who d jump at the chance to work for him.She ll be a modern networker. Networking is a continuous process, and she ll constantly be on a peripheral scan for talent in all her social networks both in person and online. When her company has an open position, she ll be ready to fill it with one of her Twitter followers she has in mind. No more struggling with prolonged job vacancies. She knows how to use all the right social media channels to recruit top talent.He has an entrepreneurial mindset. Growing up in the Millennial generation, at one time he may have thought like the 67 percent of millennials who want to start a business. Like 92 percent of millennials, he believes entrepreneurial education is important in the new job market. Equipped with the knowledge and motivation it would take to run a business, he will take ownership of the HR department and drive it to success.The modern HR director will influence all areas of employee engagement, recognition, performance management, hiring and more -- with a new tech-driven spin. She might be on her phone a lot, but she also might automate and integrate many of these HR functions, knowing how to harness the power of technology to achieve ultimate efficiency. Choose the right one, and watch business grow.Related: The Importance of an HR Policies & Practices StrategyMatt StrazMatt Straz is the founder and CEO of Namely, the HR and payroll platform for the world's most exciting companies.Read more",Human Resources,2014-09-29 21:30:00
/article/237482,Factor in These 7 Employee Costs Before You Start Bidding for That Star Hire,Employees see only the number on their paychecks but your bottom line is pinched much harder than just that.,"If you think you can squeeze in the higher salary your new employee is negotiating for, take a look at the numbers beyond the base salary rate your employee sees.There are many costs associated with paying your employees that you might not be aware of, especially if you are just starting out. When developing your hiring budget, be sure to factor in these hidden costs:1. FICA and Medicare. The Federal Insurance Contributions Act mandates that 12.4 percent of earned income must be paid to Social Security. However, the maximum dollar amount caps at $113,700.In addition, 2.9 percent must be paid to Medicare. Both of these taxes are split between the employer and employee, meaning, of each employee s salary, you pay 6.2 percent to Social Security and 1.45 percent to Medicare. The other half is automatically withheld from the employee s paycheck.Related: The Hidden Costs of Employee Turnover2. Federal and state unemployment. Unlike the taxes above, employers are the only ones who bear the burden of both federal and state unemployment taxes. For 2014, the Federal Unemployment (FUTA) tax rate is 6 percent, which applies to the first $7,000 you pay to each employee as wages during the year.The state unemployment tax rate varies by state.3. Workers Compensation Insurance. The Department of Labor s Office of Workers  Compensation Programs uses these taxes to fund major disability compensation programs. Worker s Compensation insurance rates are determined by risk classification in each industry. For example, rates in the utilities and communications industry range anywhere from $0.15 to $1.44 per employee per hour worked. At full-time, that could cost as much as per employee $2,995.20 annually.4. Health insurance. On average, health insurance costs are at 7.9 percent in the private industry, 9 percent for goods-producing industries and 12.6 percent for union workers. Annual family health coverage premiums have seen a 4 percent increase from last year, reaching $16,351. Employees paid $4,565 toward that cost, leaving employers with the remaining $11,786.Considering premiums have increased 80 percent since 2003 and more than doubled since 2002, expect rising health insurance costs to continue impacting employment costs.Related: 20 Low-Cost Employee Perks5. Fringe benefits. Fringe benefits are a form of pay for the performance of services, including bonuses and the use of company vehicles. Of course, these costs vary, but right now the national average is at 9.1 percent of the salary added on.6. Administrative costs. Administrative costs include HR functions and paperwork. Right now, the national average is 10 percent.7. Non-productive time. These hidden costs only impact salaried employees because there is no time clock to track the amount of hours spent out of work. Non-productive time includes paid time off such as holidays, sick days, vacation days and personal days. Again, this cost varies depending upon schedule and what is offered.To calculate this cost, multiply the amount of hours allotted for time away by the rate per hour. At the full-time rate of $12 per hour for 8 hours per day, an employee would still be paid $96 for each day, even though they are not in the office.Although these hidden costs vary, they make a big impact when it comes to payroll. Many companies use software to help them break down these costs and simplify wage attachments, ensuring all taxes and fees go to the appropriate agencies.Before you finalize your budget and make any major hiring decisions, consider what you re really paying your employees. Take note that a higher negotiated salary could cost you more than you bargained for.Related: How do you evaluate the cost of hiring a new employee?Matt StrazMatt Straz is the founder and CEO of Namely, the HR and payroll platform for the world's most exciting companies.Read more",Managing Employees,2014-09-25 20:30:00
/article/237649,How I Scout Superstar Employees,"As an entrepreneur, you're only as good as the talent you hire. Here's what you should keep in mind when hiring the best employees.","LinkedIn Influencer, Maynard Webb, published this post originally on LinkedIn. Throughout my career, from company man to entrepreneur and investor, the most important aspect of what I do has stayed the same. I realized early on that I m only as good as the talent that I hire. So finding the most talented individual for the spot has always been a top priority. Once I find that individual, I assess   as quickly as possible   that he or she is the right fit. The path to greatness, after all, starts with selecting great talent and not settling for mediocrity. Here are 10 steps that have never failed me when scouting and supporting superstars:1. Look right in front of you. Often, the absolute sweet spot for getting good recruits is from an  A  player whom I have had the pleasure to work with. This is why I always start by asking people I know for recommendations. I have often been pleasantly surprised when they suggest that they would actually like to be considered for an open spot. I also ask every great candidate   even those who aren t interested   for referrals to others.2. When considering a candidate, get lots of outside validation. How many times do you get unsolicited great feedback? That warrants bonus points. What about complaints that come from people you respect? Those must be considered heavily.Related: A Manifesto for Rebooting Management (LinkedIn)3. Source talent before you have an opening. Don t wait until a role needs to be filled before recruiting. Recruit always! Build relationships with the most talented people and stay in touch with them. I knew I wanted to work with Mike Bergelson for years, and then we finally found something that worked when we co-founded Everwise. Mike has proven to be one of the most talented individuals that I ve had the pleasure of working with, and Everwise is growing faster than we ever imagined.4. Don t oversell. The worst thing you can do is oversell someone on joining your team only to have them feel manipulated   and surprised with the role   once they sign on to the job. Be positive, but don t oversell the role. By being transparent about both opportunities and expectations, you ll also get a much better sense of whether or not the candidate knows what they re stepping into.5. Trust what your gut is saying. You are likely giving this person a lot of responsibility. How are you feeling about that? Would you want to give them your toughest task, or would you be worried? Measure your trust meter. It should be high, and if it s not, explore why. Doing so will illuminate the issues and concerns you have.How to onboard, assess and support superstars once they sign on1. Once you get an acceptance, include them immediately. Even before the official start date, they can be introduced to the team, commence background reading and work on objectives with you. It will ensure a smoother transition and also get the onboarding process off to the right start.2. Build a culture that ensures that they make things happen   or that they notify you when they won t. I am very clear with what I expect and by when. After that s known, I assume that we are on the same page and that the task will done. That s the best case scenario, but of course that s not always what happens. If I do hear about issues, the clock is often reset on the expectations, and while that's okay, it should not become a trend. If concerns aren t raised and then the expectation goes unmet, then I m not going to be happy. No one likes bad surprises.Related: Relax. It's Not a Race Against Time (LinkedIn)3. Determine whether the person is a  step on gas  or  step on the brake  person. Every time I have to tell someone to go faster   to step on the gas   is a big red flag. If it continues, they will likely not work out. There are also times when I ll need to slow someone down   saying, hit the brake   because we are not ready, not sure, or don t have needed resources. Even if that means I am sometimes saying no, I would always rather have a step on the brake person; someone who is creative and energetic, rather than someone I have to drag along. (One caveat here is that you have to have enough experience and judgment that your asks of a person are not unreasonable, otherwise you end up sounding like the Dilbert boss in asking people to go faster!)4. Don t be too influenced by a pedigree. Never to be too swept by what s on paper; some people use a pedigree as a hall pass, but just because they worked at the best places or attended the best college doesn t mean they are the best fit for the role. Only a few people can actually drive the bus, the rest are just on it. Results matter.5. Use a color code system to track progress. You ll need to measure how the new hire is advancing. Look at how they are doing now and consider how they will be doing in six months or a year. Will they be able to handle more responsibility, or will they struggle to keep up? I use a red, yellow, green tracking system to identify where they are today and help me track where they will be over time. Also, it s imperative to consider context: staying in the same job in a fast growth environment   one that is rapidly changing and requiring more demanding responsibilities   likely means that the individual is advancing, and is akin to a promotion. That person stays in the green!",Inspiring Your Team,2014-09-25 12:30:00
/article/237084,Are Candidates Who Job Hopped Worth Your Time?,"If you're reviewing a resume with multiple, short-term job stints, you may inclined to pass. But not so fast.","When a job applicant lists a number of jobs that only lasted for a brief period of time, it can be a red flag. It may indicate an employee who has difficulty working well with others, one who has issues with authority or a problem coming to work on time. Obviously, in most cases you would want to steer clear of such candidates.However, don't eliminate a person from the candidate pool based solely on a listing of limited-duration jobs. First, the world has changed. It used to be typical for people to spend 10, 15 or 20 years with an employer. That length of service is rare these days. Employment terms of two, three or four years have become more the norm.Related: Hiring Done Right in 3 Brutally Honest StepsEven if a resume lists several jobs of shorter duration, there may be legitimate reasons. Young people often have a series of short-term jobs while they are in school or even for their first job or two after school. More established workers might lose their jobs if the company they work for is acquired and their job eliminated. Perhaps the company hired them for a short-term assignment that ran its course or the company went out of business. There are many completely legitimate reasons for truncated work assignments.The fact that the candidate clearly disclosed limited-duration jobs is positive in at least one way. It s an indication of honesty. Most applicants know that multiple short-term jobs won t reflect well on them. The fact that a candidate is up front about their situation shows some character. What is more troubling than a candidate who has several short-duration jobs on his or her resume is one that tries to cover up this fact, perhaps by not putting dates on the resume.Related: 6 Ways to Adapt Hiring Practices to the Improving Job MarketIf the candidate is attractive except for the short job stays, find out the reasons for the brief employment stints. Begin by asking the candidate. Walk through each job on the resume and make sure that you understand the reason for each end to a job. If there are gaps in employment, ask what the candidate was doing during those periods. Some candidates will leave jobs that were of short duration off of their resume. Get a complete view of the candidate s job profile, but don t stop there.To quote Ronald Regan,  Trust, but verify.  Have the candidate provide references from colleagues at each of the companies where he or she held jobs. Contact each of the references and ask specifically why the person left. Ask if the person would be eligible for rehire.Don't stop there, though. Most candidates are clever enough to provide references who will say kind things about them. Ask the references for the names of others at the company who are familiar with the candidate's work. Alternatively, call people not listed as a reference by the candidate who you know works at the company. By pushing to get to the second level and beyond, you can assemble a very clear picture of why the jobs were of short duration.A number of short-duration jobs on a resume can be a red flag, but before eliminating a potentially strong candidate, make sure you understand why the jobs didn t last.Related: Beyond the Resume, 5 Alternatives for Recruiting CandidatesDoug and Polly WhiteDoug and Polly are small business experts, speakers and consultants who work with entrepreneurs through Whitestone Partners.

/article/237053,Find Your Next Great Hire on Twitter,"Use these five strategies to utilize chats on the social network for job candidates in your industry, or have them coming to you.","Social media is increasingly becoming a popular tool for recruiting talent. In fact, Twitter is one of the best social networks for recruiting bright and savvy professionals.Twitter is more than a network for talking about trending topics and interacting with high-profile brands, it s also a tool for recruiting candidates and hiring top talent. Last year, 55 percent of employers said Twitter was one of the top social networks for recruiting, according to Jobvite s 2013 Social Recruiting Survey.Related: How to Hire Without Spending a Fortune. (Hint: Use Social Media.)Employers can use Twitter chats to discover and connect with clued-in and passionate talent. They can also use chats to share job postings, promote their employer brand, and follow up with talent for video interviews.Employers hoping to connect with the brightest individuals in their industry can use Twitter chats to hire talent in these ways:1. Use the right hashtags and follow conversations. To target top talent, employers must learn how to use the right hashtags for their industry. It s also important to participate in the right chat community. Employers can discover these hashtags through the Twitter chat schedule and by making note of commonly used hashtags by other industry professionals.By using the right hashtags for their industry, employers can participate in ongoing industry conversations, discover talent and make Twitter communities excited about their company.2. Showcase an employer brand. Twitter chats serve as a great opportunity to illustrate a company s values, mission and culture. According to Jobvite, 47 percent of employers use Twitter to showcase their employment brand.  When showcasing an employer brand, companies don t need to overtly promote themselves. In fact, they can make an impression on job seekers simply by answering questions during Twitter chats and sharing content that relates to their employment brand.3. Share job opportunities. Twitter is also an excellent tool for informing professionals about job openings. In the Jobvite survey, 43 percent of employers post job opportunities to Twitter.Related: 6 Signs It's Time to Find a New Hiring StrategyWhen sharing job postings, be careful not to spam Twitter chats. Instead, share job opportunities at appropriate times during a chat and use the hashtag when the Twitter chat isn t taking place to attract the right people.4. Build relationships with candidates. According to Jobvite s 2014 Job Seeker Nation Survey, Twitter is the most popular network job seekers use to seek career advice and help.Twitter chats help recruiters discover prospects and establish relationships with them. Employers can position their recruiters and employees as resources for potential candidates. This way, job seekers who are interested in employment opportunities have a direct contact and can ask questions about the position without feeling intimidated.5. Create a Twitter chat to engage with talent. Not only can employers participate in Twitter chats, but they can also create their own. This is a great way to strengthen their employer brand and attract talent.For example, a company can launch a Twitter chat about a specific niche within their industry. This chat could target professionals who work in their industry and discuss important issues pertaining to that niche.Once employers establish a Twitter chat, they should also invite their current employees to participate in it. This is a great way for employers to illustrate what it s like to work for their company through the experiences of their employees. This establishes credibility and builds a positive reputation for the company as well.Do you use Twitter as a tactic for your recruitment strategy?

/article/236964,Today's Most Satisfied Employees Demand These 4 Things,"As a leader, it's critical to keep up with changes and start investing time into employee development.","The employee landscape is changing, and with it has come new needs, desires and areas of importance for employees. This means employee development is no longer just about career development, but also goal alignment, non-monetary offerings, and simply, opportunities to prove themselves.A quarter of employees would be more satisfied at work if they were given more opportunities to do what they do best, according to a 2013 study by BlessingWhite, and 5 percent directly said career development opportunities and training would increase their satisfaction.Related: How to Create a Personalized Motivational Manual to Boost ProductivityAs a leader, it s critical to keep up with these changes and start investing time into employee development. Here are some ways I ve been able to do it:1. Place more importance on non-monetary motivators. Beyond money, things such as career growth and even professional inter-office relationships are extremely big motivators of satisfaction and engagement. The BlessingWhite study found that 25 percent of employees believed they would be more satisfied with their job if they had a better relationship with their manager.Employees want to learn and grow with people they respect and who respect them in return. Maintain healthy office relationships by leading by example. If leaders within the organization get along well and openly work together, employees will do the same.Additionally, it s important to remember that, while professionalism is important, it is equally important to know your team on a personal level. Make an effort to have fun with your team and initiate conversations about things other than work.2. Let employees do -- and improve upon -- what they do best. No matter their role or level, everyone wants to feel like their strengths are appreciated, effectively utilized and built upon. Companies are getting smart about this: A 2014 Bersin by Deloitte study found that, in the last year alone, corporate budgets for training and development have risen by 15 percent.Related: 7 Ways to Keep Your Team HungryWhether you actually have one or not, don t get stuck in the  corner office  rut and forget what truly motivates employees to keep contributing. Give them tools and opportunities that will help them exceed at their specialties, as well as build new ones. Get them outside the office to learn from other people and pick up new ways of doing things.  3. Align employee goals and preferences for a clearer vision. Throughout the company, every employee needs to not only have a good understanding of their personal goals and work preferences, but also of their colleagues  roles and goals.When working closely together, employees will naturally learn the work preferences of their team. However, it s important that leadership learns those and respects them, as well.Additionally, openly communicate how each role plays into the bigger picture of organizational goals to motivate employees to work harder and more efficiently in their position. This will also encourage employees to help co-workers who may be struggling since they understand how it plays into the big picture.Constant open communication throughout the company and visual indicators, such as progressive steps to reach an ultimate goal, are great ways to keep everyone aligned in real time.4. Let serendipitous learning happen. Research has shown that nearly 70 percent of learning happens informally while on the job. Whether it s from watching others, utilizing various resources or trial by error, this type of serendipitous learning is crucial to employee development.Encourage this type of development by making employee schedules less rigid and more flexible. Allow time for them to learn their own way and observe the processes that will benefit them. It may be necessary to provide some amount of structure, but keep in mind that employees are more satisfied when they have flexibility in their job conditions.Related: The Simple Way to Find Out What Motivates Your EmployeesAndre LavoieAndre Lavoie is the CEO of ClearCompany, the talent-management solution that helps companies identify, hire and retain more A players.

/article/236962,Seeing the Future of Wearables in the Workplace," For HR, the promise of wearable technology offers huge possibilities, particularly for recruiting and hiring.","Free Webinar | August 16thFind out how to optimize your website to give your customers experiences that will have the biggest ROI for your business.							Register Now  Cynics can be tough on innovation and invention. History has shown us that time and time again, people have belittled huge advancements in math, science, medicine and technology. Given that so-called experts have doubted the usefulness of everything from atomic power to ecommerce, it s important to open a dialogue on wearable technology now to help frame the future of work.  Whether a person cares to admit it or not, wearable technology is here to stay. With this new technology having already conquered select markets, the consumer segment for wearables will reach about 10 million devices and $3 billion in revenue by the end of this year, a Deloitte study predicts. As wearables become a familiar part of daily life, Use of the technology may spill over into professional life as well. The interesting part of the journey is just about to begin: seeing how wearable technologies are adopted in everyday life and within the world at work.Related: What Is Keeping Wearable Tech From Being Fashionable?Research indicates that the enterprise wearables journey is just getting started, with this year marking the start of wearables 2.0, a new phase in the development of wearable tech that some expect will revolutionize business over the next decade. For organizations interested in adopting the technology and incorporating it in business processes, the time to explore the opportunities is now, starting with human resources, a critical component in businesses. For HR, the promise of wearable technology offers huge possibilities, particularly in recruiting and hiring.To date, the most recognizable wearable technologies are smartglasses, with some 4 million pairs expected to be sold this year. Smartglasses are similar to smartphones but worn instead of held. Freeing up the hands, smartglasses can enable recruiters, hiring managers and HR pros to take more of their work with them, including applications, cover letters, resumes and all the necessary forms.On the road and on the job, practitioners will be able to source, screen and select job candidates in just a few minutes by connecting with them over social media, accessing their company s applicant tracking system (ATS) and connecting with colleagues to collaborate on hiring decisions in real time. Enhanced mobility will lead to other advancements as well, promoting increased collaboration and engagement among stakeholders who will be able to package and send candidate files in the blink of an eye.Picture greater standardization, with key interview questions determined in advance, prompts guiding the interviewer throughout the meeting. Plus there's the ability to record a live interview to share with a manager who couldn t attend. Combined with the right software, the technology will foster greater collaboration, with the use of swipe and tap to provide feedback, during or after the interview.With this level of efficiency and the potential for real-time feedback, an organization could extend an offer letter to an exceptional candidate before he or she even leaves the building and help a company gain an edge over their competition. Because wearables can provide constant access to software and information, organizations can maximize technology investments from the get-go. This means big things for the hiring process and the candidate experience and says a lot about the companies that use wearables for business. Consumers and candidates alike will see them as innovative organizations.Related: Why Wearable Tech Isn't the Next Big Thing -- YetThen, there s the matter of onboarding. Once a candidate is engaged, interviewed and hired, HR can bring a new hire up to speed with a wearable. The new hire can become assimilated quickly with introductions, orientations and trainings preloaded onto a device and facial recognition software could make it that much easier for someone to remember everyone s name and where to show up on those typically overwhelming first days at a new job.The innovation and invention won t stop there. Smartwatches, smart clothing and virtual-reality headsets are all said to be under development.

/article/236863,8 Inappropriate Things You Might Be Doing at Work,The workplace can be a difficult space to operate from a social perspective. Here are some things you'll definitely want to avoid.,"The workplace can be a difficult space to operate from a social perspective. You always want to be friendly, but there are some topics that are simply inappropriate for the office.Sometimes without even knowing it, people say things to coworkers that could be considered inappropriate or discriminatory, even to the point of leaving their companies open to employment lawsuits.Below are eight discriminatory things you or your coworkers might be doing that you should avoid. Keep in mind that employment laws vary from state to state, so what might be illegal in one place could be merely rude and inappropriate in another.1. Asking someone when they plan to retire.This can be construed to mean that you think your coworker or employee is becoming too old to work, a sentiment that violates the Age Discrimination Act of 1967, a federal law that applies to workers over the age of 40. While discrimination based on race or sex is often more overt, age discrimination can be as subtle as referring to someone as ""past their prime"" or ""over the hill,"" or repeating the old maxim that ""you can't teach an old dog new tricks.""In general, it is best to avoid remarking on people's age, unless their age is demonstrably relevant to their ability to perform a certain job function.2. Making fun of someone's whiteness.While there might not be much actual harm in referring to your coworker's brunch habit as ""so white,"" the Civil Rights Act of 1964 protects Caucasians from discrimination the same as it does people of any other race. One such instance won't be enough to get you sued, but repeated harassment could lead to your office being deemed a ""hostile workplace environment"" for white employees. In 2012, the County of Kauai, Hawaii paid out $120,000 to settle a reverse racism case brought by a white county lawyer who said one of her bosses allegedly told her she needed to assimilate better with the local culture and dump her white boyfriend.3. Making positive generalized statements about an ethnic group or race.The phrase ""you people"" is never a good idea because it makes it clear that you are classifying an employee in a given group with a set of pre-defined traits. Even if those traits are positive (i.e. ""you guys are such hard workers""), it could lead others in your office to wonder whether your judgments about their race influence how you think about their work..4. Repeatedly asking about someone's family health history.Most people haven't heard of genetic discrimination, but the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 protects workers from being targeted for their family health history (i.e. a worker who is more likely to have breast cancer because it runs in their family). While off-handed remarks or light teasing are not actionable, repeated inquiry about an employee's susceptibility to various diseases could constitute harassment.In addition to directly hectoring employees about their genetic information, the Texas Workforce Commission advises against discussing an employee's health conditions with others in the office.5. Commenting on a coworker's appearance.In the age of email and instant messaging, it can be hard to interpret tone in online communications, making comments about a coworker's appearance even more risky.While you may mean it to be an innocuous compliment, a comment like, ""that new outfit looks great on you"" could be seen as having sexual intent if the person you're making it to can't read your body language as you say it.If nothing else, these kinds of remarks can make your coworkers uncomfortable, unhappy, and unproductive. At worse, it could be considered sexual harassment.6. Using gendered language.It can be commonplace to casually describe a whiny client as ""acting like a little girl"" or an unpleasant boss as ""being a total bitch,"" but these words carry a gendered connotation that could lead your coworkers to believe you think that only women are capable of being rude or whiny.Additionally, certain characteristics can be interpreted differently for men and women, such as how an assertive man can be seen as ""a leader,"" while an assertive woman is thought to be ""bossy.""Be careful to avoid these misunderstandings and hurt feelings by saying exactly what you mean in a clear, gender-neutral way.7. Asking someone to speak for the people of their race/ethnicity/gender/sexuality.Perhaps there's a hot-button social issue in the news and you'd like to know what your black/Latino/gay/female coworker thinks about it. This is fine, but don't make your query about their status as a minority. Whatever you do, don't start your sentence with the phrase: ""As a [black/Latino/gay] person ....""This can single out your coworker in an unpleasant way. Plus, no group is a monolith, so it's probably not helpful to get one person's opinion and extrapolate it across an entire ethnicity, gender, or sexual orientation.8. Asking people about their religious beliefs.While it's fine to ask people what they're doing over a holiday break, it's best not to seek specific details on people's religious beliefs and practices unless they bring it up first.Expressing too much interest can give the appearance that your opinion of a person (and potentially their job capabilities) hinges on their beliefs. Repeated comments about someone's religion can also be considered harassment, which can become a problem since religious discrimination is outlawed by the Civil Rights Act of 1964.More from Business InsiderThe Justice Department appears to be gearing up for a legal fight with the LGBTQ communityBillionaire investor Howard Marks says cryptocurrencies 'aren't real'One of Warren Buffett's favorite investors listed the ingredients for a bubble   and warned many are present todayAaron TaubeAaron Taube is a reporter at Business Insider.Read more",Office Etiquette,2014-08-27 17:15:00
/article/236688,"Bring Out the Best in Your Employees, Based on Their Brain Type",Understanding how your workers think and approach tasks will help you effectively adjust your management to deliver optimal results.,"When managing others, one size does not fit all. Tailoring your leadership style to complement different brain types and respecting the individual differences of those you re managing will bring out the best in them.Being able to identify someone s brain type will help you understand what motivates them, what fears drive them, how they process information, how they respond to stress and more. When you know this information, it s easy to adjust how you approach each type to ensure they can do their best work and deliver optimal results.Controllers + Managers are motivated by control, results and prestige. When managing this type, be sure to frame assignments in terms of achievement, competition or how their work will benefit the company. They fear losing control, so frame requests to keep them feeling in control.Related: 8 Ways to Effectively Lead Entrepreneurial EmployeesInstead of dictating exactly how you want something done, tell them the result you re looking for and a deadline, and then allow them to figure out how to efficiently achieve the results. This type easily prioritizes tasks based on the most important benefit or outcome, so allow them to prioritize their work themselves.Innovators + Influencers are motivated by flexibility and recognition. They crave freedom and are OK with breaking the rules a bit. As long as the rules aren t legal or ethical ones, give them space to operate as freely as possible. Frequent check-ins may feel overbearing, so check-in informally about once a week to ask their opinion on how things are progressing toward the results or deadline.You can expect this type to procrastinate and work on multiple projects at once. They prefer to work on what s new, unique, easy or fun, so be sure to prioritize work for them and give a hard deadline that includes review time. Minimize repetitive work, as this type gets bored with details (though they often obsess about certain details). These employees usually crave respect, so be sure to point out what they do well, how you appreciate their ideas and how they re making a difference for your business.Nurturers + Harmonizers want to be included and help others. They fear being excluded. Be sure to include them in meetings where decisions impact their work. To bring out their best, invite them to help instead of saying,  I need you to do this.  Avoid being pushy or aggressive, especially if you are a Manager + Controller type, because they resent being pushed around, even though they won t typically push back.Related: 9 Ways to Manage Underperforming EmployeesThis type likes routine, so be sure to map out current and future assignments, rather than peppering them with requests all the time. Be sure to let them know who each assignment is for, because  who  is their most important information need and that information will affect how they approach an assignment.Suggest collaborators for this type, as they often need interaction to feel satisfied. If you re not getting the best work from this type, be sure to spend some time repairing your own relationship with them -- they will do great work when they feel you value them and your relationship.Systemizers + Analyzers need structure to feel comfortable making progress on an assignment. They re motivated by preparation and accuracy and they fear being wrong. To bring out their best, front-load detailed project information and a timeline so they can feel safe and secure with what they have to work with.Check in on deadlines regularly because this type tends to avoid prioritization and may not tell you if they re running behind, but will always strive to do quality work. Give them assignments that allow them to mitigate or avoid risks. Be prepared for this type to caution you regarding your approach or process and evaluate their ideas on the quality of information they provide. Minimize emotions and allow them to make objective decisions and recommendations. This type hates surprises and new information can throw off their estimates, so give them plenty of time to re-evaluate any progress they ve made if you change strategy or direction.Bringing out people s best can be very easy when you know and adjust for how their brain types naturally work. Make sure you spend a little time reviewing each team member so you can effectively communicate on their terms when making requests or assigning tasks.Related: How to Deal with Employees Who Insist on Always Getting Their WayMichael CooperMichael O.

/article/236052,Ignoring Employee Morale Will Cost You. Here's the Solution.,"Stay on top of issues before dissatisfaction spirals out of control, leading to a drop in productivity and revenue and exits.","Most entrepreneurs start their company trying to serve the best steak in town, offer the best massage or build the best product they can. That s where their heart and passion is. But then they quickly realize that they have to recruit complementary talent to help turn that dream into reality.Not only do they have to learn how to motivate, inspire and retain their best employees, but they are also juggling accounting, marketing, sales, product development, etc. In this environment, focusing on culture -- ensuring high levels of employee satisfaction and engagement -- typically falls by the wayside.Related: 4 Ways to Diffuse a Toxic WorkplaceBut ignoring the cultivation of employee morale is one of the costliest mistakes an entrepreneur can make. Research reveals that:Letting employee engagement slide can result in 20 percent less revenue growth than your competitors with motivated employees.Disengaged employees are nearly 87 percent more likely to find a different place to work.You can expect to spend 21.4 percent of an employee s annual pay on replacing him or her.There s also the collateral damage inflicted when unhappy workers taint all the other good apples in the barrel.The solution is an improved information flow between employees and managers to stay on top of these issues before dissatisfaction spirals out of control. While the ""open-door"" policy is the generally accepted approach for this, the truth is few employees will be completely honest and forthcoming to someone who controls their livelihood.Searching for a better solution, I found that anonymous employee surveys work best to improve the feedback channel. These anonymous engagement surveys cut through the fear and give leaders the valuable, direct feedback they need to know when problems arise.A recently released guide by TINYpulse gives a solid overview of what your survey should include. They provide 20 best practices when conducting an employee survey, and I ve distilled it down to my favorite five:1. Anonymity. If you keep your surveys anonymous, employees will have the freedom they need to be completely honest. Having a portal to receive bad news is necessary to make organization improvements. Related: 5 Steps to Getting Better Employee Feedback (Even If You Hate It)2. Short, simple surveys take less time to complete. This makes them less burdensome to complete resulting in higher response rates.3. Feedback sharing. No one likes to air their dirty laundry, but sharing all survey results with your team signals that you are listening to employees and receptive to all types of feedback.4. Feedback action. One of the most notable pieces of research I ve seen is that one in three employees will become disengaged if survey feedback is not acted upon. If you plan to conduct an employee survey, be ready to act on whatever feedback is shared.5. Regular survey cadence. A one-time survey gives you a quick read on your culture. Repeating that survey over time lets you see how your feedback is trending and if your morale is improving or declining.If you re sold and want to focus on employee happiness, I would suggest two free services that many companies start with. One is the ever-popular SurveyMonkey. I m sure everyone has either administered one of these surveys or taken one. The second one is Google Forms, a more recent option that integrates seamlessly with Gmail and Google Docs, which is a bonus if your company is already using Google s Productivity Suite.Best of luck as you strive for employee satisfaction.

/article/236493,These 3 Legal Traps Can Stop a New Business in its Tracks,"When it comes to these issues, the best policy is to avoid the risks.","Once a new business is beyond the phase of executing the early idea and is getting off the ground, some of the biggest challenges revolve around risk.There are a number of risks, legal ones in particular, that magically appear in business and can stop you dead in your tracks. The difficult part is that you ll never see them coming.If you're a first-time entrepreneur, understanding legal risks is particularly troubling because you may not be experienced in thinking about the litany of issues that have the potential to strike in each and every situation.Here are just a few of the legal issues that you need to pay particular attention to, as well as how to best avoid getting sued early on. Note that I m only speaking from my personal business experience and am not an attorney, so please seek counsel for legal questions.1. Trusting verbal or handshake agreements. A prime example of this happens particularly early on in business and often starts with the first employee, independent contractor or friend that comes to help.Related: 10 Questions to Ask Before Making Your First HireYou need assistance but have no money to pay, so you agree that they ll get a defined percentage of the company or sales. You have a personal relationship so there s really no need to draft a whole agreement. It will work out and if it doesn t, you ll just talk about it. You trust each other.This is a nightmare of a situation because it rarely works out. When the time comes, it s going to be your word against theirs, which is unlikely to turn out well for you -- particularly if your business has become successful.Even if you don t have money to pay an attorney to draft an agreement, go to our friend  the Internet  and find a template agreement that you can alter to serve your purpose. Anything is better than nothing. I do want to be clear with respect to this point: You really should seek legal counsel, which will be well worth your investment in both the short and long term.2. Unknowingly using someone else's patents. Here s the story: You came up with an idea that was going to revolutionize an entire market -- no, the entire world. You re pumped, so you dig through pages of Google results and are confident that your new idea doesn t exist. You begin executing on your new ideas while making progress, so you invest your life savings -- or at least a large piece of it. This, of course, is going to be the greatest investment ever.Months later, when you re making serious traction in the market, you receive a letter in the mail with the ominous heading,  Cease and Desist. This letter serves as notice from another company -- which happens to be a lot bigger than yours -- that you re infringing on their patents. The next step will be legal action if you don t comply.The good news is you now have the opportunity to stop using their intellectual property before they sue you. The bad news is your business just went from growing to non-existent and they might sue you for damages nonetheless.Related: 3 Things Every Entrepreneur Should Know About Patent RiskTo help mitigate this risk, it s imperative that you have an attorney that specializes in patent law -- which is referred to as intellectual property -- perform a patentability search, the results of which will tell you who s in the market and what s been patented.3. Unfairly competing. You scored big time and landed an all-star employee from your biggest competitor. Now you re going to rule the world. As things get moving, your favorite new hire is out converting all of the business from their previous employer to their new one -- you -- while using their wealth of inside information they have on the competition to their advantage.This is great news, right? Nope, not unless you love lawsuits.There are  unfair competition  laws in every state, most of which -- if not all -- dictate that you can t hire an employee from a competitor, then have the new hire use confidential information to take all of the relationships with them. Want to avoid this legal trap? It s pretty simple, hire the all-star from the competitor but restrict them from using their confidential knowledge to solicit accounts. If they have the relationships, the accounts will come willingly.The business world is full of legal issues, many of which are difficult to learn about without having experienced them. With that said, I can t express enough the importance of investing in good counsel, as they will steer you away from these major legal traps and help keep you from being sued.Related: Save Time and Money, Tell Your Attorney EverythingAdam CallinanAdam Callinan is a founder at BottleKeeper, the fast-paced and sarcasm-infused solution to the warm beer and broken bottle epidemics that have plagued the world for centuries.

/article/236452,Why We Replaced (In)Human Resources with 'Employee Experience',HR departments have an uncanny knack for being disliked by both employees and leadership. One company dumped HR and shares their experience.,"Fairly or unfairly,  traditional  Human Resources conjures images of problems, paperwork, and processes with an unhealthy amount of bureaucracy and red tape.Just recently, BBC s former HR Head, Lucy Adams,  spoke out about how she and other senior managers had been  lawyered out  of any personality when it came to employee communications and handling employee issues.Adams and the HR function were perceived as  being part of a more sinister hidden agenda.  unsurprisingly, that sentiment hurt company culture and crippled the organization. There is a lot more at stake than just bruised egos when the HR function fails to be a positive beacon for both employee and company success.Thankfully, this is but a cautionary tale for Nitro. We don t have an HR department. We turned old-school HR on its head and instead created Employee Experience (EX), a global function whose sole responsibility is to help make Nitro the best possible place to work.Related: Outsource Your HRUnlike traditional HR, which was focused on protecting the company, Employee Experience is first and foremost about protecting and supporting employees. As a highly-strategic function within our business, EX helps take the headache out of necessary employee administration (new hire onboarding, payroll, etc.) and makes it easy to navigate the complexities of modern employment, such as healthcare benefits and employee pension fund programs.EX is here to drive the continuous development and overall job satisfaction of every Nitronaut. Your people are your business and, ultimately, your strongest asset. Therefore, EX is geared toward enabling, supporting and growing employees to be happy and successful. That ultimately boosts overall business success.EX is centered around three pillars that we call the three Fs   the fundamentals, the fringe and the fun. Not dissimilar to Maslow s classic Hierarchy of Needs, the three pillars are categorized in relation to employee wellbeing and satisfaction on a scale ranging from must-have (the fundamentals), to important (the fringe), to nice-to-have (the fun).The fundamentals. These are what we consider the basic must-haves for each Nitronaut   competitive compensation packages, excellent healthcare benefits, employee stock options, 401(k) and other retirement savings programs, life assurance, generous paid leave to support a strong work/life balance (including maternity coverage), a safe and comfortable work environment, and a strong core company vision and values.We believe that this is the stuff that matters most to people, so we work hard to ensure we re at the top of our game and a true employer of choice.The fringe. The fringe is just short of must-haves  but still very important to the ongoing personal and professional growth of each employee. That includes career path development, continuous learning (Nitro University), doing good and giving back (Nitro Gives) and meaningful perks (catered lunches, fully stocked kitchens, Body and Mind Program, gym, commuter and car hire discounts, volunteer time off,  You Rock!  Rewards, a day off on your birthday, the list goes on).Related: Is It Time to Outsource Human Resources?Employees with the right mindset are much more interested in career development and personal growth than dry cleaning or dog-walking services, so offer perks and benefits that truly add value. The further differentiates Nitro in competitive talent markets.The fun. Right at the top is where the fun sits and we have no shortage of it at Nitro. Regular events (Wine Club, trivia and movie nights, meet-ups), team outings, friends and family get-togethers, fully stocked office bars, happy hours, and so on.Fun isn t something you can prescribe but is important when we re asking people to work hard. The challenge for every company is striking the right balance. Too much fun and you re not achieving business goals or encouraging a high-performance culture. Too little fun and you wind up with burnout and unhappy employees. We foster an environment where people want to be, whether they re working or taking some time out to play.Great products and services create competitive advantage but happy, high-performing, in-it-for-the-long-haul people are the advantage that stands the test of time is people. In the words of author Amit Kalantri,  if you fulfill the wishes of your employees, employees will fulfill your visions. Create the right work environment, and you ll not only consistently attract the best talent, but you ll keep it, too.

/article/236122,College Career Recruitment \u2013 With a Fee ,"San Jose State University has outsourced headhunting to local staffing agencies, transforming traditional relationships with university placement offices.  ","Traditionally, college career centers were free or low-cost source for companies looking for the next fresh face. But what if that changed? It s already happening at San Jose State University. Last year, a busy small business owner too swamped to find a candidate himself asked the college,  Can t you just send me someone and I ll pay you?  That got Daniel Newell, a Program Manager of Workforce & Economic Development at the San Jose, Calif. institution thinking: the school should charge for headhunting.Employers are used to paying small fees to attend job fairs or space on campus for interviews Still, SJSU is one of the first to charge for headhunting services, according to Lisa Severy, president of the National Career Development Association in Broken Arrow, Okla. Severy, who is also the Director of Career Services at the University of Colorado in Boulder, says with funding for higher education decreasing, it makes sense for career centers to generate revenue beyond job fair fees, says Severy.Admittedly, not every college career office could get away with charging for access to its student body. SJSU is less than a 30-minute drive from bold-face names like Apple in Mountain View and Facebook in Menlo Park. While big tech firms love to hire from Stanford, MIT and Harvard, SJSU s location has helped it develop relationships with big employers that other state schools might not have. Meanwhile, every other local employer must compete with big Silicon Valley names for talent and can use the help rising above the din. They re in a very unique spot there,  Says Edwin Koc, Director of research, public policy and legislative affairs at the National Association of Colleges and Employers.  Their graduates are highly sought after in the tech space. Related: How to Recruit Top TalentManaging students  career needs has become increasingly difficult at SJSU.  Newell points out that an increasing number of students and alumni are participating in informational sessions to prepare for connecting with employers and job fairs, which means more event prep and coordination work for Career Center staff.  Student and alumni attendance at informational sessions increased 188 percent between the 2012-2013 and 2013-2014 school years, and job fair attendance rose 21 percent over the same period, he says.Of the 15 professionals in the university s Career Center, seven work directly with businesses, handling employers  phone calls, emails, and recruitment inquiries, Newell says. Through SJSU Spartan Staffing, the Career Center was able to bring on an additional four recruiters to serve as liaisons between SJSU s student and alumni populations and employers, explains Newell. The four recruiters are employed by two local staffing agencies, Slingshot Connections and Expandability, a local non-profit staffing service specializing in individuals with disabilities, but do business on behalf of the university, Newell says.SJSU Spartan Staffing is unique because it focuses on employment, says Newell, pointing out that that, as far as he knows, no other public university offers for-fee staffing services to employers. University career centers typically don t make candidate referrals and tend to focus on career counseling and professional development, he continues. SJSU  is doing both, counseling students in their career path while taking a very proactive approach to helping them get a job or internship,  explains Newell.Asked why an employer would pay SJSU Spartan Staffing to source an employee when an employer could get itself a Harvard or Stanford grad for free, Newell counters that no recruitment effort is free given the money invested to travel to far-off campuses to recruit and woo potential hires. Less well-known businesses will still have a tough time competing for talent   regardless of the school -- against Fortune 500 companies. He says services like SJSU Spartan Staffing can help level the playing field between small companies and those that have deeper recruitment resources.Related: Hire Better: Recruiting 2.0Before rolling out the services, Newell says he took the opportunity at an SJSU job fair to informally poll a handful of the 26,000 employers SJSU works with, who said they would have no problem paying for a university staffing service.  Newell maintains a more formal poll of employers wasn t necessary, citing  the constant phone and email inquiries we receive daily regarding candidate referrals  as proof enough that employers would pay the university to find them candidates. After selling SJSU administration on the idea, the Career Center launched Spartan Staffing in January 2014.Employers hiring for jobs or internships can access student and alumni networks and work with the agencies to identify candidates and set up interviews. Fees are paid once offers are made, typically a percentage of the hire s salary.  Slingshot and TransAccess receive 90 percent of the revenue generated, with Spartan Staffing taking the remaining 10 percent. In the highly competitive Silicon Valley, employers looking for top talent, especially in engineering, can pay an intern more than $30 an hour, Newell notes.  If SJSU Spartan Staffing can t fill a position with an SJSU student or alumni, it will open the job search up to the community through several local organizations.  We will do what we can to find [businesses] that talent, even if it s outside the university,  Newell says. Related: How to Hire the Best Recent Graduates for Your BusinessOf course, such a model isn t without its drawbacks. Newell points out that, when hiring interns, if an employer chooses to have SJSU serve as the employer of record, the university assumes all liability and workers  compensation risks. Severy adds that being the first to do anything always carries some risk, and some of those risks may not be known yet.As to whether this model might spark a trend that still remains to be seen. Koc says this model might be an option for some schools given that schools can t produce enough grads in certain disciplines. Still, he says the features the service offers as well as how it interacts with career services will be important factors to the model s traction. Right now, Koc says,  It s too early to tell. Currently, more than 20 employers are in the SJSU Spartan Staffing pipeline, employers like Ann Thomas, the owner and director of Singles Travel Co. in San Jose, Calif.  Because we re in the Valley, you d think it d be easy to find someone with IT experience, but it isn t.  Thomas says she worked with SJSU Spartan Staffing to hire a part-time web developer from SJSU after interviewing three qualified candidates. SJSU Spartan Staffing has been working with employers for several months and has made a variety of placements in government, education, healthcare, medical device, and technology sectors.  About 75 percent of the placements have been full-time positions and 25 percent internships, he notes.Newell says SJSU Spartan Staffing is on track to hit its goal of 38 placements by the end of the first year and its goal of 260 placements over five years. He anticipates the number of placements will increase significantly once the fall semester is underway.  Should the venture generate what s planned, $2.5 million over the next five years, the university could net $250,000.Samantha DrakeSamantha Drake is a freelance writer and editor in the Philadelphia area who specializes in business, legal, environmental, and general interest issues.Read more",Inspiring Your Team,2014-08-12 14:15:00
/article/236233,8 Leadership Mistakes That Others Made So You Don't Have To,Avoid these errors in your first 100 days in the top position to ensure the success of your venture.,"For every success, there is an epic failure. Those leaders who achieved greatness did so not because of their success stories, but because the lessons in failure that they learned and applied to create those success stories. In other words, leaders find  right  only after navigating through a storm cloud of  wrong. Before assuming the reins of your next venture, run through the following checklist of no-no s from mistakes made by others -- so you don't have to:1. Setting a tense tone. Stress and tension are no fun, and how a leader chooses to show up everyday is everything. Positive or negative, cordial or rude, your people will embrace and spread  you,  intentionally or not.Related: Corner Office Turnover: Why CEOs Succeed or Fail2. Getting buried in BS. The best missions we ever conducted in the SEAL Teams were not complex, but very simple and straightforward. Similarly, business execution requires as few processes and steps as possible to reach critical mass and be effective.In the book, Kill the Company: End the Status Quo, Start an Innovation Revolution, the authors cite the fact that  managers spend 40 percent of their time writing reports and 30 percent to 60 percent of it in coordination meetings.  If you want to be a more effective leader, spend your time where it counts -- on people and relationships.3. Trying to get too much done. Newly appointed leaders who recently left the bowls of senior management where their tasks were more executorial and moved into positions of leadership oftentimes share common problems: they didn t get the memo on how to lead. In other words, their vision of the organization doesn t expand as it should, and they try to use the same management techniques they ve always known in a new capacity.Believe it or not, there is a gap to bridge between being a senior manager and being ""the man,"" and that gap is where delegation -- rather than action -- lies.4. Becoming the  anti-successor. Some leaders like to leave their own marks on a company s history by erasing their former leader s initiatives and accomplishments. While wanting to create value is one thing, dishing away with a successor s routine just to do it entails selfishness and conceit, whereas strong leaders aim to embrace and build.5. Forgetting that  it s about the people, stupid!  (and not the product/service). A service exists because of the people behind it, the personalities that attract customers, the work ethic of the team, and the creativity that spurs a new day every day. If you substitute product for service, the same source of excellence exists: people. If you want your business to flourish, then you need to focus on how to attain, train and retain talent.Related: How Leaders Can Cut the BS at Work and Address Real Issues6. Not tolerating failure. It was Mark Twain who said,  Good judgment is the result of experience and experience the result of bad judgment.  I hate to say it, but failure can -- and should be -- welcomed. While accepting failure is not the aim here, understanding the difference between what happened and what was supposed to happen are integral to learning and improvement.In the SEALs, we conducted after-action reviews (AARs) following every major training evolution and mission (unless it was just boring) for two reasons: to learn as individuals and to learn as a team. Everyone shared their insights about how they could ve made their individual contribution better and in doing so they raised the bar for the next time around. Failure is an awesome learning tool -- as long as you don t accept it.7. Talking about the past. New leaders need to do just that -- lead -- because nobody wants to hear about yesterday. Yesterday is over. Instead, people want to know what their new fearless leader is going to do to create value for them. When was the last time that blame created any value for anybody other than themselves? Exactly.8. Keeping a lid on things. One of the worst mistakes a leader can make is to believe that he or she should have all the answers because they re the leader. Knowing everything is not your job, but setting the environment that enables information to be shared is.It s hard employing a self-critiquing lens to learn from personal success, but we can all try to flatten out the learning curve.Related: 5 Ways You Can Practice ImperfectionJeff BossJeff Boss is cofounder of Chaos Advantage, author of two books, founding team member of the SEAL Future Fund, cofounder of The Adaptability Metric, and former 13-year Navy SEAL where his top awards included four Bronze Stars with valor and...Read more",Take It From The Pros,2014-08-08 14:00:00
/article/235686,Should That Employee Be Fired? Ask These 5 Questions First.,"Terminating a worker is a big decision that should be done with care, so carefully evaluate these factors before taking any action.","Making the decision to terminate an employee for poor performance can be gut wrenching. Most business owners want to give their people every chance to succeed, but you can t continue to invest in poor performers indefinitely. Still, it s difficult to know exactly when it s time to call it quits.Related: How to Fire Employees With CompassionThe following five questions, based on the work of Rick Brocato and Marc De Simone, are invaluable when deciding between investing more time and effort in developing a poor performing employee or throwing in the proverbial towel:1. Does the employee clearly understand your expectations? More than 50 percent of the disciplinary actions we ve dealt with in our careers have had at least some aspect of misunderstanding between the employee and the manager. First, explain your expectations in detail. Next ask your employee to show how they will fulfill the requirements. This will help to eliminate miscommunication.2. Have you removed all organizational roadblocks? Organizational speed bumps may include policies, procedures, internal politics or a lack of critical resources. Removing hurdles helps employees to be more effective. However, don t let yourself get sucked into the employee s personal problems.Management only has the power to remove roadblocks that are internal to the organization. You can t be responsible for removing employee-generated roadblocks. Only the employee can deal with his or her own personal issues.3. Is the employee fully trained and has he or she had enough time to practice? While your employee professed experience during the hiring phase, all organizations are unique. Different computer systems, policies, procedures and corporate culture can prevent good employees from being immediately successful. Make sure the employee is appropriately trained and has had sufficient time to practice the new skills.Related: What Lessons You Should Learn When You Fire Someone4. Have you motivated the employee to perform? Most employees need both rewards and consequences to perform up to their full potential. An environment that is skewed heavily to either one or the other will result in dysfunction. Giving employees praise for a job well done often results in them repeating the behavior. Catch employees doing something right and tell them about it. Likewise, employees must understand that poor performance may result in discipline and/or termination. Avoiding negative feedback may make things easier for the manager in the short-term, but it s unfair to the employee and will result in greater problems in the long-term.If you can answer the first four questions with an unequivocal  Yes,  you are ready to consider number five:5. Is the employee capable and/or willing to do the work? An employee who is not  capable  is easier to understand. Some jobs aren t suited to certain individuals. Perhaps the physical requirements are too strenuous or the intellectual demands are above his or her cognitive capabilities. If this is the case, you might be tempted to move the employee to a new role. We urge pursuing this option with great caution. Termination is usually the best course. Under any circumstances, you need to examine your hiring process. How did an incapable employee get the job in the first place?Sometimes the person is fully capable, and for whatever reason, internal to them, is unwilling to perform. At this point, it s time to end their employment. You cannot continue to pay someone who is unwilling to do his/her job.It s tough to know when it s time to dismiss a poor-performing employee. Answering the five questions above will help you to avoid terminating an employee before you have taken reasonable steps to help him/her succeed. They will also keep you from throwing good money away by continuing to invest in a lost cause.Related: How to Fire Someone Without Getting Sued (Infographic)Doug and Polly WhiteDoug and Polly are small business experts, speakers and consultants who work with entrepreneurs through Whitestone Partners.

Try These 3 Fixes.It s time to make some real change to combat disengaged, unhappy employees with a low-cost and highly accessible solution: transparency.Here are some ways to infuse transparency into your organization to improve collaboration between managers and employees, and foster engagement within your organization:1. Make transparency a priority from the top down. Leaders must be engaged themselves and provide transparency into their roles and decisions. Doing so will promote the same values throughout the company. Be open about what is needed in management roles from the beginning. Let would-be leaders know what will help them succeed and cause them to fail.Seek and share feedback on the performance of both your managers and their direct reports. Openly communicating about the strengths and weaknesses on all levels of your team will ensure that everyone is performing to the best of their ability, and understands the contributions of other team members. At ClearCompany, we ve seen this level of understanding and collaboration foster a team of curious, engaged and team-oriented employees.Management must also take an active interest in the great work their employees are doing, and expand upon the strengths within their respective teams. Good leaders are tasked with cultivating a culture where their team is comfortable hearing about and addressing their weaknesses. Progress cannot happen in a vacuum. Employees should have a safe, confidential and timely forum for discussion.Related: 6 Ways to Improve Your Conversations2. Use different strategies to engage different types of employees. No two employees are the same, and all of your people should have the option to receive clear, transparent communication in a way that resonates with them. Doing this will increase engagement and the way in which each employee ultimately collaborates with the rest of the team.For example, if you have big organizational news to share, do so via email, in person, during team meetings and even via a letter from the CEO. It is not overkill and will ensure that all types of employee receive the information through a medium they are able to appreciate and engage with.Direct managers spend the most time with each team member and thus should have a solid understanding of how best to engage with their reports. Ensure that your managers are comfortable communicating with, and providing actionable feedback to, their teams.3. Stop office gossip before it spreads. The more transparent an office culture is, the less likely rumors will spread. When everyone clearly understands what s going on -- from direction of the company, to organizational structure for promotions, raises, etc. -- no one has the need to start saying something false. In this case, employees will likely stop gossip early on.Create a system in which open-door policies are not only championed, but actually utilized. Make it a goal for your managers to hold  office hours  to give employees an opportunity to drop by and ask questions about any topic.When employees feel up to date about company strategy and decisions, and comfortable asking questions if they are out of the loop, the rumor mill will stop churning.Related: Entrepreneurs, Have No Fear of Trusting Your EmployeesAndre LavoieAndre Lavoie is the CEO of ClearCompany, the talent-management solution that helps companies identify, hire and retain more A players.

/article/235597,"When Interviewing, Avoid Legal Landmines and Find Out What You Want to Know",Certain questions during interviews with prospective employees can land you in trouble. Here's what you should be doing.,"Asking questions of a prospective employee that are too personal, not job related or just plain inappropriate can set the wrong tone for your organization and can cost you a good candidate. Worse case, these questions might get you sued.Employers should steer clear of questions that would cause candidates to reveal their race, age, gender, marital or familial status and several other protected characteristics. Do some research to avoid these landmines.  Related: 13 Questions to Avoid During a Job InterviewWhy then do interviewers repeatedly ask inappropriate and sometimes illegal questions? In our experience, most employers are trying to gain reasonable information that is pertinent to the job. They just ask the wrong question. For example, we had a client who asked women of child-bearing age if they had children. The question is illegal. He should never have asked it, but his intent was reasonable. He was trying to figure out if the prospective employee would come to work reliably. That is a very appropriate thing for an employer to want to know.Here s the problem. Having children does not necessarily make an employee less reliable. Most parents have sufficient child-care arrangements. In our 50-plus years of business experience, we have known as many childless employees who had attendance issues as those with children.As we explained to our client, it would have been far better to have simply asked what he wanted to know. If you want to determine whether a person will come to work on time every day when scheduled, the first step is to ask that question.Begin by describing the job and the attendance requirements associated with the position. For instance,  The successful candidate for the receptionist position will need to be at the front desk at 8 a.m. ready to serve our clients and answer the phones. If the receptionist is absent, I have to move another employee to the front desk. This means that two employees are not at their usual jobs. Probably more than any other position in the firm, the receptionist role requires a person who will have near-perfect attendance. Related: The Interview Questions You Aren't Asking But Should BeYou have described the requirements of the job and explained why they are important. Now, ask what you really want to know,  Do you have commitments that would keep you from coming to work every day, ready to start at 8 a.m. or from staying until the close of business? When asked a direct question, most applicants will give a truthful answer. Those who have situations that would keep them from meeting your attendance requirements will most likely take this opportunity to disclose. If the candidate says that the attendance requirements are not a problem, you should dig a little deeper and ask them to describe a time when they worked under similar circumstances.Along with asking the applicants, call former employers to verify attendance histories. Include recent employers if possible. Even if the candidate doesn t want his/her current employer contacted, he/she should be able to provide a reference who is familiar with his/her attendance history. Don t skip this step.Finally, if you are going to ask candidates if they have committments that would keep them from meeting your attendance requirements, ask it of every interviewee. Remember, both men and women have outside obligations that can sometimes interfere with work performance. Keeping the focus on the job requirements, not on gender roles, will get you the information you need to make good employment decisions.Related: 9 Questions to Ask Candidates' ReferencesDoug and Polly WhiteDoug and Polly are small business experts, speakers and consultants who work with entrepreneurs through Whitestone Partners.

/article/234937,What Recruiters Look for in Hiring a Manager and How to Ace That Interview,Candidates can shine not just by presenting descriptive data like a resume of accomplishments but predictive data such as plan to solve problems for a prospective employer.,"Interviews for management roles are challenging not only for job candidates but also for the decision makers of the hiring company. Human resources managers and executives from the departments involved in the recruitment process need to carefully select the right candidate to be sure he or she will generate a high return on the investment that the company is about to make.To make that final decision, the company schedules in-person interviews with the top candidates -- perhaps the most important step of the whole recruiting process, as it puts candidates in the room with their future boss, the hiring manager. While hiring managers are not psychologists or behavioral experts and may not have training in interview skills, they do know better than anyone else in the organization what the key challenges of the open position are. They know the team, the market, and have a clear idea of what a good candidate should be like to ace the interview and get the job.Related: Looking to Hire a Manager? Read These 4 Tips First.Gaurav Rekhi, the head of product management at eBay, identifies the right candidates for his team and as a hiring manager he hones in on specific personality traits during an interview as indicators of leadership and high performance: I look for individuals who are problem solvers,"" people who ""can take on different roles,"" who are full of ""passion"" and who exude ""confidence."" In short, he looks for candidates who can ""influence others. One secret to acing an interview is providing examples and ideas or proposals of how to approach specific problems, such as a strategic plan, Rekhi says.What hiring managers are looking for is a proof, a demonstration that the candidate not only has the right background and experience to succeed in the job but that he or she can connect past experience to future performance.So candidates would be wise to research the company's industry, competition, potential partners and market trends, showcase their problem solving skills -- and most have a plan. Finalists for a management role are in some cases expected to provide a short description of what their strategic plan would be to overcome current business challenges.  Related: Managers Can Be True Leaders Not Just TaskmastersJoanna Weidenmiller, the CEO of human-resources technology firm 1-Page that gamifies the hiring process (and my employer), works closely with HR departments and hiring managers at large companies to identify challenges that candidates need to solve before landing a final interview with the hiring managers.  The right way to approach company s challenge and ace those interviews is to really understand the job responsibilities and requirements, do the homework and present a strategic plan on how to solve it,"" she says. ""Ultimately, hiring managers are looking for candidates who are prepared to answer how [their] experience will work in the position and at the company, not only how it worked in the past. Candidates should be ready to provide answers on how they will overcome specific market threats, trends they have identified that company should follow, how they are going to make or save money for the company and provide strategic direction -- something that managers won t find in the resume.Sydney Fleming, in charge of hiring for TrustPilot, a review-driven community that connects online consumers with companies, has similar advice. She looks for skilled candidates who can show
proactive approach and interview preparation that goes beyond reporting the results of a Google search. What Fleming really values during an interview is hearing from ""a candidate with a deep understanding of my business and of the market in which the company operates,"" someone who ""could potentially educate me on my own company"".There is no silver bullet that will work with every hiring manager or organization, but these steps should help. It s all about demonstrating that proof of an expected investment for the company because nobody wants the disaster effects of a bad hire: a loss in productivity, plus the waste of time and money involved in hiring that employee and the associated training costs. Descriptive data (resumes) won t land managers a job. Instead candidates should present predictive data instead, like a strategic plan and a demonstration of problem solving skills.Related: 5 Signs It's Time to Fire a Company ManagerRocco SannelliRocco Sannelli is director of marketing at 1-Page, a company that offers a human-resources platform that engages and assesses job candidates beyond resumes, including with gamification.

/article/235788,Want to Hire the Best Talent? Be Like Elon Musk and Set a Strong Vision.,"Setting an ambitious goal at your company can act as a magnet to the best employees, who will want to stick around to see it through.","Turnover is a problem for most companies in and around Silicon Valley, but not at companies with a strong vision.Case in point: Two of Elon Musk s businesses, SpaceX and Tesla Motors, according to a partner at Founder's Fund. Both companies have something in common: an incredible vision, which extends almost irrationally beyond the products they sell.Related: Scale or Fail? Don't Overlook These Keys to Exponential Growth.For the few entrepreneurs who do not already worship these businesses, Tesla is an electric car company, and SpaceX is a rocket company, but the people who work at them have something completely different in mind when they go to work everyday. At the car company, they believe they are saving the planet, and at the rocket company, they believe in giving the inhabitants of this world a second chance on another planet if this one gets messed up.This is leadership. This is vision that makes great companies. In practical terms, great vision is flypaper to the very best talent in the world. Once that talent is working, vision sustains them, reduces turnover and produces a disproportionate effort from every employee in the firm.Two weeks ago, when Musk released his patents to the world, he unveiled the rest of the vision equation: vision begets talent begets competitive advantage.He basically told every other competing car company: My vision allows me to hire and retain better people than you will ever be able to hire for any amount of money. They will be smarter, they will work harder and they will stay longer. Therefore, you can have my ideas because my people will always put me a step ahead.By releasing those patents, he released himself from all other false idols of competitive protection and doubled down on vision, betting that vision would continue to draw in better and better talent.  Related: 5 Keys for Maintaining Your Entrepreneurial VisionSo let s talk about how to establish a company vision and what it can do for each stage of a talent strategy to attract and retain the very best people.1. Develop the vision. Think 20 to 30 years out and really, really big. Think of the biggest possibility, then think bigger. Write it down and put it on the organization s website, not on the homepage, but the careers page.2. Incorporate the vision into recruiting. Make sure everyone hired understands what the organization stand for. Talk a lot less about what the role is and a lot more about the vision and goals that will make the company successful. Then make sure the candidate understands how those goals ladder up.3. Keep the vision in mind when evaluating performance. Every person at the company must understand how their goals are aligned to the vision. If they are getting reviewed on goals not aligned to that vision, that is the CEO s fault, not the employee s.4. Align learning with organizational goals. Ensure all learning programs are directed to aligned goals. Goals are properly aligned when visible throughout the organization so the entire workforce clearly understands them. If learning doesn t ladder up to the vision, get rid of it.Vision matters more than anything else that can be designed, produced, manufactured or invented. It is the essence of competitive advantage because it attracts talent, and talent is the only currency that matters in today s market. If the organization is not focused on vision to produce talent, everything must be rethought.Related: Richard Branson on Developing a Vision for Your CompanyAndre LavoieAndre Lavoie is the CEO of ClearCompany, the talent-management solution that helps companies identify, hire and retain more A players.

/article/235087,Should You Offer Time Off to Fathers of Newborns?,Here are four questions to consider as you debate instituting a paternity leave policy.,"Many small businesses offer some type of maternity leave. However, as gender and parenting roles continue to evolve in our society, more fathers are asking for time off to bond with their newborns. Large companies may include paternity leave in their benefit portfolio, but should small organizations follow suit? As with most questions like this, there are pros and cons.First, let s discuss  must  and then we ll consider  should. If an employer has 50 or more employees, the business may be subject to the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA). FMLA requires that parents of a newborn or those adopting or fostering a child receive up to 12 weeks of unpaid time-off to care for and bond with the child, if the parent has been with the company for at least one year and has worked at least 1,250 hours in the preceding 12 months. If your head is spinning, you are not alone. If you think your company may need to comply with the FMLA, we strongly suggest seeking the advice of counsel or a qualified HR professional.Related: The Ins and Outs of Creating a Parental Leave PolicyNow onto the  should.  The reason to offer any benefit not mandated by the government is to attract and retain the best people. Obviously, it is a judgment call, but we suggest considering the following questions:1. What can you afford? Paternity leave, whether it is paid or unpaid comes with a cost. Make sure that you understand how employee absences would affect your business. In doing your calculation, remember that there may be some degree of adverse selection. That is, those who expect to use the benefit will be attracted to your company. Those who don t expect to use it are more likely to be indifferent. Therefore, you may end up with more than your fair share of expectant fathers. Make sure that you understand the cost and that you can afford the expense.2. What do your employees value? Now that you understand the costs, consider the benefit side of the equation. Surveying employees is a useful way to get a sense of the things they value most. You only have so many dollars to spend on benefits, so make sure you are offering those benefits most appreciated by your employees.Related: How to Handle Multiple Employees Having Babies All At Once3. Does your company s culture and environment help you attract and retain the talent you need? One of the benefits, which will be difficult to quantify but should not be ignored, is the impact on your company s culture. We asked Rush Paul, a well-known and experienced HR consultant to comment. Employees are attracted to join and stay with companies whose values are consistent with their own and where the employee believes he or she can be successful,"" he says. ""If the values you seek to reflect in your employment brand include an effective work/life balance, don t forget the men in your company. If being identified as a diverse and inclusive organization is important, create policies that are as gender neutral as possible. In either case, including a paternity leave policy is part of the equation. As you create your paternity policy, be sure to plan for how you intend to address adoption, same-sex partners, leave before birth or adoption (not just after), and additional unpaid versus paid leave. 4. What do your competitors offer? If other organizations, with which you compete for employees, offer this benefit it may be something that employees expect. If you don t offer it, you will be at a competitive disadvantage when it comes to attracting and retaining employees.Unfortunately, there is no definitive answer to this question. It s a judgment call that, depending on your circumstances, could go either way. But, the four questions above will help to refine your thinking.Related: Modern Dad?

/article/235396,9 Steps to Building and Coaching a Killer Team,Building a great pool of talent is crucial to your success as an entrepreneur. Here's how to do it.,"Being self-employed doesn t mean that I don t work with other people. In fact, I ve had to create numerous teams throughout my career to help me achieve my goals.These days, my team gets together every morning on Skype because we all live in different places. I couldn t do what I do without them.Related: 10 Steps for Hiring Your Next Rock StarBuilding a killer team is crucial to your success as an entrepreneur. Here s how to do it.1. Look for real talent. Hire people who are smarter and have more experience than you. This may seem like a given, but I ve found that it s not. You may want to feel like the smartest and most experienced member of your team, but your team will be much better off if that's not the case.2. Seek out different skill sets. When you re building a small team, it s incredibly important that each member bring something different to the table. Make sure your team members know that you aren t simply looking for a  yes  person. You value their opinions -- especially when they differ from yours. What are your weaknesses? Find people who can fill them.3. Avoid the temptation to micromanage. Everyone needs direction and management, but no one likes to be micromanaged. Give your team a goal and let them achieve it. They might do things differently than you would, but that s perfectly fine -- maybe even better.Related: 9 Questions to Ask Candidates' References4. Hire people that believe in your product. You can t teach an employee to care. If they aren t thrilled by the opportunity to work with you, take a pass. People that truly believe in and support what you re doing will work the hardest for you.5. Recognize that different people have different goals. For some, it s money. For others, it s recognition. Make sure you understand what your team member s long-term goals are and how you can help them achieve them. They will be incredibly loyal to you if you do this. It shows you care!6. Set the bar high. Everyone should be on the same page in regards to what you expect and hope for. From the very onset, I make it clear that it s important to me that people own up to their mistakes immediately. If you acknowledge it, we ll move on, and it s over. No harm no foul. Great communication is essential for a killer team.7. Create a safe space. We all make mistakes -- it s better to be able to laugh at them than cry! We all have insecurities. A killer team doesn t prey on the insecurities of another member, it works to lift them up. Take the time and effort to create an open, welcoming environment. You need each other to fight the good fight.8. Never stop learning. Make educating your team a priority. When people feel like they re learning, they re much more engaged with their work. How can you challenge your team in a productive way?9. Don t forget to celebrate your achievements as a group. There will be lots of small successes along the way. Keep your team focused and excited by making the effort to celebrate these, too. Enjoy the journey you re on together.

Yet, the secret to success, he says, isn't just finding the right people, but figuring out how to keep them.","Free Webinar | August 16thFind out how to optimize your website to give your customers experiences that will have the biggest ROI for your business.							Register Now  As the founder and CEO of recruiting software platform Entelo, Jon Bischke has built a business aimed at helping companies cast a wide, but targeted, talent search. More than 130 clients   Facebook, Greylock Partners and Square, to name a few   now use Entelo to sift through thousands of websites and social networks to identify would-be job candidates. ""What we're seeing is what we refer to as the unbundling of professional identity, where people are putting their information on thousands of websites,"" says Bischke. ""If you're just searching one website you re only getting a small slice of that data.""Yet, recruiting is only half the battle. When it comes to his own company, Bischke focuses a good deal of his management efforts on retention, a metric he says in undervalued in the startup world. So far, so good. Since he founded the San Francisco-based company in 2011, Bischke says he s had zero voluntary attrition. ""We've hired a grand total of 22 people and 21 people work for the company today,"" he says. ""That's something very few startups can say.""Entrepreneur spoke with Bischke, 38, about how he finds, and keeps, top talent.Entrepreneur: You re equally focused on retention for your own company. What s your approach?Bischke: The majority of people who work for Entelo have done some sort of short-term stint or project with us before we ve made the offer. You're evaluating them, and they re evaluating you. We've had some people we've brought on board in that capacity, and in the first week or two learned they were not a good fit. We didn't make the offer. It's a lot easier than hiring someone and letting them go.We also have a strong focus on professional development of our team members. One thing I like to ask when I interview people is ""What do you plan to do after Entelo?"" It always throws people, but I think they appreciate that we re also concerned with what s in their best interest.  Entrepreneur: How do you promote employee growth while growing your own company?Bischke: We encourage everyone from senior executives to the entry-level person to create a personal board of directors, three to five people outside the company five years further along in their career, who they can meet with and learn from over time.Entrepreneur: Was there something in your previous work life that inspired this?Bischke: When I moved to California a decade ago and was impacted by a quote I heard that was something along the lines of: ""Your success is a reflection of the expectation of your peer group. If you re around people who expect you to achieve great things you ll be successful."" I didn t know anybody and decided I wanted to hang out with people who would make me better. That's where the idea of the personal board comes from. We want to help people surround themselves with people who could help them be successful.Entrepreneur: How do you facilitate that process?Bischke: One of the first things I'd do when I bring on new people is see who in my network would be a good person for them to connect with. That's where technology plays a role in helping continue to build and foster relationships.Entrepreneur: Can you tell us more about what that search might look like?
Bischke: We might use a general network like Facebook or LinkedIn or a more specific vertical network like Quora, Github, etc. And of course we also use Entelo for this. For example, if I want to connect my head of marketing to a chief marketing officer, I will do that search on Entelo or LinkedIn. I'll often use Facebook as well as it's the best connection graph. I'll often look up people on multiple networks because the more networks people are connected on, the more likely they are to be connected in real life.Entrepreneur: Who s on your personal board?
Bischke: I have hundreds. Over the years, especially the last decade I ve gotten to know hundreds of CEOs and senior business executives. One of my favorite things to do is send text messages because I feel like it s a little more intimate than an email. Plus, an email is just another thing people have to deal with, but most people are happy to get a text, even if it s the same message from the same person.Entrepreneur: What technology do you use for keeping tabs on these mentors?
Bischke: My personal toolkit is a combo of Asana, Entelo, Highrise (lightweight CRM) and Salesforce. Entrepreneur: How do you stay connected with employees?Bischke: I text them.

Is your hiring practice strategic, thorough and consistent?","If there is but one consistent business discipline that defines success, it would most certainly be the ability to hire great talent. The right person can help you launch your company to new heights, while the wrong person can almost single-handedly scuttle your hard work and effort.Is your hiring practice strategic, thorough and consistent? Consider these 10 steps to ensure you are bringing on only the best and the brightest. 1. Remember that you are hiring for a team. Bringing just one new person onto a team can dramatically change the culture of the entire organization, and the entire organization is counting on you to do it right. Remember: Your standards are not what you desire. Your standards are what you accept. Are you truly willing to accept this person into your culture?Related: Hire Better Talent With a Big-Data Scientist2. Start recruiting before you need to hire. The time to look for new talent is long before you have a gaping hole in your organization. Look for new recruits as a part of your regular routine, not as the rare exception to the norm. This simple habit helps you avoid the dreadfully painful experience of hiring substandard talent because you ran out of time to properly recruit a rock star.3. Cultivate referrals. Your team knows how to spot potential rock stars, so ask them for referrals -- regularly. But if a referral candidate isn t an upgrade to your current team, pass! Even if it means ruffling the feathers of the referring team member.4. Look for a history of success. Check potential employees  online presence for signs of success. Don t think of social media as a place to look for ""gotchas,"" but rather an opportunity to seek positive stories from a person s past. Search for signs of achievement, drive and job-related wins.5. Pre-screen candidates over the phone. How many times do you ruefully recognize within the first two minutes of an interview that you will never, ever hire this person? Avoid these painful interviews by spending five minutes on the phone before setting up a face-to-face meeting. If a simple phone conversation is a struggle, well...Related: When Hiring, Take a Cue From the NBA and Look for Performance and Character6. Plan for interviews in advance. Failure to spend adequate time reviewing a candidate s resum makes you look both unorganized and disrespectful. Don t miss out on hiring rock stars because they turn you down! Prepare for the interview the same way that you expect your candidates to prepare.7. Abandon the clich  questions. Candidates know the standard questions and are fully prepared to give you their standard answers. Don t waste valuable interview time asking the same stinking questions asked during every other stinking interview. Focus on behavior-based questions that relate to the actual job -- ""Tell me about a time when you had to ..."" -- and you will gain fantastic insight.8. Gain team consensus. The responses of your team members -- positive, negative or neutral -- can tell you a great deal about a candidate's potential fit. If you sense tension even before you hire someone, that might be all the information you need.9. Check references. This sounds obvious, but it is shocking how many people skip this step. The key is listening for the things you don't hear! If past employers and colleagues don't speak knowingly and glowingly about a candidate s work, then keep looking.10. Follow up with every candidate. Everyone you interview deserves a follow-up phone call or letter. You can safely assume that most candidates experience a fair amount of anxiety in the days after the interview. Show some respect, and protect your brand in the marketplace, by giving them a clear and timely answer.Related: 5 Attributes to Look for in High-Performing EmployeesJeff ShoreJeff Shore, of Shore Consulting, is a sought-after sales expert, speaker, author and consultant whose latest book, Be Bold and Win the Sale: Get Out of Your Comfort Zone and Boost Your Performance, was published by McGraw-Hil...Read more",Inspiring Your Team,2014-07-09 16:30:00

It takes a job seeker less time to determine that a position isn't a fit: a mere 50 seconds. But TheLadders, which offers job-matching services, was referring to text-based ads. What if there were a better way?Video-job posting platform Ongig's new sudy shows candidates spend on average 55 seconds viewing a text-only ads, whereas job seekers spend 5 minutes and 23 seconds watching a video advertisement (when they choose to play the ad).Companies such as Twitter, Starbucks, Pepsi and Yelp have posted video job ads to attract job seekers. These job ads not only advertise job postings but also give job seekers an exclusive look at the company s culture and workspace.Here are seven tips for creating engaging job ads on video to aid in hiring employees:Related: How Career Sushi Is Sprucing Up The Digital Job Hunt1. Spark interest through emotion. Job ads should should tell a story about the employer and inspire job seekers. After viewing a job ad, an individual should feel motivated to immediately apply for the job.According to a study by Karen Nelson-Field of the Ehrenberg-Bass Institute for Marketing Science in South Australia positive emotions that create high arousal of interest include inspiration, astonishment, hilarity and exhilaration.2. Illustrate core company values. Job seekers want to work for employers with values similar to their own. When creating a video job ad, outline the mission, vision and core values of the organization. This will help job seekers determine if the job would be a good fit for their needs and goals. For example, according to a 2014 white paper published by the Brookings Institution, 63 percent of millennials believe it s important for companies to have a positive social impact.Related: Does Your Company's Branding Really Matter in Recruiting?3. Provide a sneak peek of company culture.

Such footage will help prospective candidates determine if the employer provides an environment that matches their work style.4. Include interviews with current employees. Video segments featuring current employees are a great way for potential candidates to  meet"" the team. Existing employees can share their experience working for the organization, how they have grown professionally and personally and the opportunities they ve had.

Remember, this is an ad, so it s important to sell the company as much as possible.6. Provide contact information. Video job ads should make applying for a job accessible for job seekers.Make sure the video ad produced includes links to the employer s career webpage and social media. The video should also include the name and email of the individual responsible for hiring. This will speed up the application process for the candidate.7. Make sure the video is the proper length. The average length for an online video is 4.3 minutes, according to comScore statistics from March, which also noted that typical length of an online video ad (not specified by type) is almost half minute.When creating a video job ad, make it long long enough to explain the most important information, yet short enough so the job seeker won't lose interest.

/article/234573,The Magic Equation for Retaining Employees,Keeping your best and brightest around doesn't have to be complicated. Try one of these simple options.,"Hiring employees is expensive. Once you have good ones, you don t want to lose them.Related: 4 Smart Ways to Increase Employee RetentionHowever, if you truly have good people, others companies will want them. To keep your strong performers, you ll have to focus on retaining them.The first element of this magic equation is that people need to believe that they are a part of a winning team. They want to feel that the enterprise to which they have committed themselves is succeeding -- it s just no fun to play for a loser. Therefore, companies should take every opportunity to celebrate their successes.Disingenuous celebrations won t work and if a company is underperforming, management needs to acknowledge that reality. Even when a company is in trouble, if it begins to move in a positive direction, it can celebrate the progress. Celebrations communicate to employees that the company is succeeding, the first of the three things needed to motivate employees and retain them.Employees need to understand how they are contributing to that success. They need to see that the company s success is, at least in part, the result of their toil. How will employees know this? Their manager needs to tell them. If you can t come up with a way that an employee is contributing to the success of the company, then you should ask if you need that position or that employee.Finally, employees want their contributions to be recognized. Both monetary and non-monetary recognition are important.Related: How to Recruit and Retain an Impassioned Sales Staff (Infographic)Monetary recognition. Many companies choose to recognize employees for their contributions with monetary rewards. Used correctly, this works well. Used incorrectly, it can be a waste of money and actually demotivate employees. To make sure your monetary rewards pay dividends, follow these simple rules:Use bonuses rather than compensation increases to motivate employees. A salary increase, even a significant one, loses its power to motivate very quickly. High salaries don t motivate -- they are quickly taken for granted. The expectation of compensation motivates.Link compensation and performance very tightly. Pay for results, not activities. The good news is that when a properly structured compensation plan produces good results, you will have money, so you can afford the monetary recognition.Monetary rewards should be at least 10 percent of base pay for the period. Research shows that this is the threshold for successfully motivating employees.Non-monetary recognition. Simply saying thank you when an employee does a job well can be powerful. Instead of speaking to employees only to correct them, catch employees doing something right and praise them. When you praise an employee make sure that you are specific about what you liked and that you link their behavior to a company or professional goal.It doesn t have to be expensive, but a well-timed gift certificate, recognition at a company meeting, extra time off, investment in their development or even a sincere job well done  will go a long way towards motivating employees and helping you retain them.It s become clich  for companies to say that employees are their most valuable asset. Clich  or not, it s true. Make sure that your employees are recognized, contributing members of a winning team.Related: Richard Branson on Keeping Your Most Valued Employees HappyDoug and Polly WhiteDoug and Polly are small business experts, speakers and consultants who work with entrepreneurs through Whitestone Partners.

Maybe, but it's important to learn everything you can about a job candidate.","A friend of my college-age son recently applied for a summer internship at a large, well-known consumer products company. He made it through the first two rounds of interviews (yes, two rounds of interviews for an internship!) and was about to be hired when the recruiter told him that, as part of the company s normal procedures, they would soon be reviewing both his Twitter and Facebook pages.Now, I ve known this kid since he was 8 years old and rest assured -- he s a good kid. Good grades. Fun to be around. Popular. But once or twice I ve stumbled on an odd post he s made online and cringed. Most teenagers do stupid things online, and bullying aside, most of the time it s harmless. It s usually crude, filthy, stupid and dopey comments, with poor grammar and questionable judgment.Related: 3 Tips for Legally and Ethically Monitoring Employees OnlineSuffice it to say the kid sweated out a few days and a few bucks for a reputation-management app in a desperate attempt to erase his sordid online past. Whatever the case -- he got the internship.I don t blame the big consumer products company for wanting to see his online activities. I wholeheartedly I agree with them. In fact, I do the same. You want to work for me? Be my Facebook friend. Let me follow you on Twitter. If anything, just for a couple of weeks. No, I don t want your password. But I want to find out every single thing I can possible know about you.I want to know your friends, see who else you follow, what groups you belong to and your interests, hobbies, likes, hates, favorite celebrities and family. I want to know the language, grammar and slang you use when communicating. I want to look at your photos, where they were taken and under what circumstances. I want to see what kind of judgment you have. I want to know all of this.Am I violating your rights and invading your privacy? Not at all. If this information is out there and it s public, then I m within my rights to see it. And if this information is private only for your  friends,  then I want to be your  friend  if at least for a couple of weeks while I evaluate you. Why is this so important?It s important because it s not about you. It s about everyone else who will come in contact with you.Related: Sizing Up Candidates for Cultural Fit Throughout the Hiring ProcessIt s about my customers. No matter what capacity you re serving in my company you will likely have some customer interface. In a small business, it s nearly impossible to shield everyone from customers. Why should we? I want to know that my employees can not only work directly with customers or answer questions but I also want to feel confident that they will represent me and my company in a professional and courteous manner.More importantly, it s about my other employees -- your potential co-workers. These are the people you will be dealing with every day. They work hard and deserve respect just like our customers. I want to make sure the person I choose for the job will fit in with them and with my company s culture. I want to give them the best work environment possible. I don t want to subject them to someone whose hygiene, attitude, appearance, behavior or general demeanor is offensive or makes them uncomfortable. It s not fair on them. It s not profitable for me.So when I look at your Facebook or Twitter activities, I m looking at you as a person. Are you a hater? Are you offensive? Do you dress in a manner that would make my employees or customers uncomfortable? Do you use inappropriate language? Do you have political, religious or ethnic beliefs that are so far from the norm that your job performance would be affected because other people find it difficult working with you?I want the best people possible for my company. I want people that other people want to work with. It s my job to gather as much information as I can possibly get about a prospective employee from wherever I can get it and make a decision that I feel is best for my current employees, customers and company.So yes, college kid applying for an internship, or 35 year old interested in a job.

/article/234764,The IRS Has Put a Stop to this Obamacare Workaround ,Those planning to send staffers to individual health exchanges with pre-tax funds might face some unpleasant surprises come tax-time.  ,"When companies started exploring their options for complying with the Affordable Care Act a few years back, some likely considered not offering coverage at all, and instead sending their employees to the individual health exchanges with pre-tax money to help cover their premiums. Now that option is off the table. A rule the IRS issued last year and clarified in a Q&A posted online last month states that using pre-tax funds to subsidize individual plans purchased on or off a public exchange violates the ACA, commonly known as Obamacare. And companies that do so could face fines in the form of a $100-a-day excise tax for each employee they offload onto the health exchanges.Before explaining the ramifications of this rule, it s important to clarify which companies will be affected by it. It doesn t apply to companies that are already offering health coverage and providing pre-tax benefits related to it, such as health savings accounts that allow employees to put aside money tax-free that they can use to pay out-of-pocket expenses. Nor does it apply to companies that have fewer than 50 employees and choose to purchase plans on the federal or state small-business exchanges. That means the IRS rule primarily affects companies that are debating  pay vs. play not offering coverage and paying any fines associated with dumping employees onto the exchanges rather than offering an in-house health plan.One option for companies that want to send their employees out to get their own coverage is to simply give them raises that match the amount of the premiums they ll be paying. But that may end up being a short-term solution to a long-term problem, warns Paul Foery, manager of insurance services for Houston-based human resources provider Insperity.  What do you do next year, if they re on a plan that s $400 a month and all of a sudden it becomes $450?  Foery says.  Are you going to continue giving them raises every year to help with health insurance? And are you going to make employees give you receipts every month, so you can make sure they re buying health insurance? You need to think it through. Beyond those hassles, there could be additional tax burdens associated with giving employees raises to help subsidize individually purchased health plans. Say you increase a worker s salary by $6,000. Your company will get saddled with an additional annual federal employment tax of about $459, estimates Sheryl Southwick, director of compliance at TriNet, a professional employer organization based in San Leandro, Calif. And depending on where your company is located, you might also face higher state and local employment tax bills. And naturally, your employees  income taxes will go up, too.Michael Thompson, a New York-based principal in the global human resources group of PricewaterhouseCoopers says the most feasible option financially for most companies is to offer health coverage rather than sending employees out to buy their own plans. That s because when you factor in the potential penalties associated with not providing coverage fines of $2,000 to $3,000 per employee, depending on the circumstances the option of sending employees to the individual exchanges becomes much less realistic, he says.  It s hard to make the math work,  Thompson says. He adds that choosing such options such as high-deductible health plans or company plans offered through private exchanges can help employers hold down their healthcare costs.There are, however, some scenarios where sending employees to the individual market might be feasible.  Companies where the majority of employees are making under 400 percent of the poverty level might find it makes sense financially,  says Tim Finnell of Memphis-based Group Benefits. Companies with a lot of low-wage ex-employees who are covered by COBRA might also find that it s more economical to switch those people over to individual plans bought either on or off the exchanges, Finnell adds. But you need to act fast: From now until July 1, the U.S. department of Health and Human Services will allow you to switch your COBRA recipients to individual health plans. The next opportunity to make the transition won t be until the federal open enrollment period begins on November 14.Arlene WeintraubArlene Weintraub has over fifteen years of experience writing about health care, pharmaceuticals and biotechnology and the author of a book on the anti-aging industry, Selling the Fountain of Youth (Basic Books, 2010).She has been published...Read more",Obamacare,2014-06-19 13:15:00
/article/234717,"Startup Founders, Treat Yourselves Right From the Get-Go",New companies should provide an environment that the owners themselves would want to work at.,"Starting a new company is a thrilling but rocky experience not too many people have the stomach for. Fifty percent of small businesses shutter within the first year due to falling short in distinguishing themselves in the marketplace, faster competitors or plain old failure to profit.There's another often overlooked reason new companies falter, however: They aren't providing workplaces that the founders themselves would want to work at! When a new company gets started, all sorts of other normal-life things are put on hold, such as paychecks, benefits and regular work hours. While not having these things adds to the romantic notion of a company's being scrappy and lean, it shouldn't remain that way for too long.  Creating basic employer operations can bring a sense of legitimacy to a startup that increases its attractiveness to potential hires. It helps get founders out of bed in the morning when the going gets tough. When the buzz of quitting a job and diving headfirst into building a dream wears off, it's great to be welcomed each morning by arriving at a real-life place of employment.So what are the basic elements that startups should deal with early on?Related: How to Create Strategic Partnerships That Are a Win-WinPartnership agreements. These documents should cover who's doing what. Worrying about how partners perform and what everyone's job is shouldn't weigh down any single founding partner. Get paperwork in place early to ensure that each person knows his or her role, shares the mission and works hard. Vacation and decompression. Entrepreneurs run hard. Work and private lives blend together like sugar and water. That means they don't get away enough from email, calls and stress. It's really important to make sure that everyone steals away from work at least quarterly so formalizing time-off policies matters. It's also vital to track time off (a task accomplished by my company's HR management tool). Burnout syndrome strikes early and takes a heavy toll on startups. Related: 3 Online Tools for Supercharging a Company's CulturePayroll and company bank accounts. Companies that are bootstrapped have the owners pay themselves out of their own pocket. Formalize it by pooling that money into a real company bank account, then get a simple payroll service up and running. Health and retirement benefits. Not all founders are 22-year-old Stanford dropouts. Many have families and financial obligations, with responsibilities beyond covering rent in a shared apartment. With the the rollout of the Affordable Care Act, there's no reason to not carry health insurance. Small companies can even skip on the complexity and added costs of a group policy and go with individual policies.Founders should also keep contributing to their retirement plans. Yes, hopefully the business will succeed. But statistics indicate that it might be wise to keep a backup plan.  Bookkeeping. Track expenses. Know what's coming in (maybe it's nothing!) and going out. Keeping tabs on cash is critical for hiring, infrastructure and research and development.Hiring a bookkeeper isn't expensive. A person comes in for an hour or two a week and gets the job done. This professional can manage expenses, run the payroll and provide detailed reports to the founders each week on financial performance.  Related: A Company Really Clicks When Mission, Brand and Culture ConvergePersonal, professional and company objectives. Starting a company certainly marks the accomplishment of a huge goal. But this is only the start. What founders really seek is success in selling their product or service in the marketplace. Founders should ensure that the company has objectives and road maps that will lead to the company's ultimate goal.Plus, each employee (including founders!) should set their own personal and professional goals. Catching conflicting goals and aspirations among various partners early on can mean the difference between the company's life and death in 18 months.Be in the game for the long haul. The last thing eager, hungry entrepreneurs want to pay attention to is workplace operations. They have their product to worry about, in addition to customer acquisition and inventory. But one big factor in a company's ability to be resilient is to retain the talent not just of employees but also passion and energy of the founders themselves.Founders should take themselves seriously, and build a company that's well designed in its operations. They'll thank themselves later as the company starts growing and already has the tools in place to be a great place to work.Related: Building a Culture and Teams for the Long HaulCraig BryantCraig Bryant is the founder and product manager of KinHR.com, a company offering cloud-based HR management software.

Thinking it s the perfect time to try that  remote office  idea?The Indianapolis-based software-as-a-service company I lead became a remote team in May 2013. Currently, about 40 percent of our employees live outside of Indiana, and even more work remotely several times a week. Along the way, we discovered a few pros -- and cons -- to share with any workplace considering the switch to a remote workplace:A few reasons remote will be a win for your company:You need to hire for specialized positions. Our door is wide open to qualified candidates, regardless of their location. New hires don t have to leave their cities or uproot their families, which makes us a more attractive employer. As an added bonus, we don t have to bother with relocation packages.Related: Workers Without Borders: Managing the Remote RevolutionYou want to give your employees freedom. My wife, Dana, was offered the perfect job in another state. We were able to make the move because I could work remotely. Remote working is about finding the place where you work best. It s not always a different city (or country) -- sometimes you are most productive in your living room.Your employees want flexibility. Instead of taking time off to wait for the plumber or attend a school play, our team members can put in a full day s work from home. Workplace flexibility helps reduce stress, which often leads to happier and more productive employees.You want to improve employee retention. The ability to work remotely helps us retain great talent. Our employees can move if they want or need to. They can choose to explore another city without taking time off. Many people have opportunities they could pursue if their job wasn t keeping them in a certain place.Going remote might be a mistake if: You don t know how to set boundaries. One of the problems with remote working is that some people don t know when to stop. The New York Times recently reported that remote employees worked 9.5 percent longer than their in-office counterparts. That might seem great at first, but burnout is inevitable. Defining job expectations can help employees recharge without feeling guilty.Related: Building an All-Star Virtual TeamYou re just trying to save money.

You learn how to focus. You learn perseverance. You learn the fleeting nature of pain. Most of all, you learn how to summon the last iota of inspiration to carry you through the day.Effective leaders must choose the right tactic for the right mission, no matter if it s the boardroom or the battlefield. Inspiring others comes in myriad different forms. Here are nine leadership guidelines to inspire others:1. Focus on relationships. One of the first quotes I heard upon entering my current career was,  Nobody cares how much you know, until they know how much you care.  Looking back on my special operations career, the SEALs never performed a single mission without outside support of other governmental agencies or counterparts. Everything was networked, it was all  who you knew  (much like everything else in the world).Related: 12 Personality Traits That Make You a Rockstar Boss (Infographic)2. Leave ego behind. If you really want to influence people, let your actions speak for themselves. It s a timeless adage that still holds true today, but if you are that awesome at something then you don t need to tell anyone because they already know.3. Identify winning. When you know what winning (i.e. the end-state) looks like, all you have to do is zig and zag to get there. To realize the utmost potential and minimize wasted effort, identify exactly what you re going after and make sure your people do, too. Redundancies arise when communication falters.4. Use high-powered talent. Overseas, there were times when we only employed a handful of operators because that was all that the mission called for. Similarly, once you narrow down the desired end-state, work backwards to identify who best belongs where. If the same names arise again and again, it s time to consider succession planning.5. Set them free. Open the reigns and let the human need for autonomy and relevance flourish. People want to do well and succeed, but what often stifles opportunity is process. Daniel Pink, in his bestselling book Drive, calls this  the purpose motive.  Instead, give people a direction, a timeline and the authority to act.Related: 5 Keys to Inspiring Leadership, No Matter Your Style6. Listen actively. There are two types of listeners: those who seek to understand, and those who seek to be understood. The former ignore their own biases as they patiently wait to understand the other s viewpoint, whereas the latter nervously wait for you to stop talking so they can talk. 7. Curb your enthusiasm. Overly excited, positive, depressed or negative people tend to serve as social hand grenades, which is why emotional intelligence (EI) is so important. EI is one s ability to interpret emotions both in oneself and others, and consists of four parts: self-awareness, social awareness, self-management and relationship management. Curbing your enthusiasm falls smack in the middle of all four because nobody wants to be around any grenade when the pin is pulled.8. Build your resilience. Displaying just how much you can handle -- physically, mentally, emotionally -- can be awe-inspiring to others. Everybody likes hearing stories of the parent who lifted a car to save a child, or the uncommon rags-to-riches success story. When you do more, you become more.9. Speak up. People need to know two things: where you stand on a given topic, and where they stand with you. Animosity and jealousy form when people are uncertain as to how others value them. I m of the belief that most news is good news because there s always something to be learned no matter what. Always take something away that makes you a better you.You want to inspire others to focus on the one source you can manage best: you. Specifically, your actions. Aim to practice at least one of the above items every day and you ll be amazed at the inspiration that ensues.Related: Tough Choices and Juggling Priorities Takes CourageJeff BossJeff Boss is cofounder of Chaos Advantage, author of two books, founding team member of the SEAL Future Fund, cofounder of The Adaptability Metric, and former 13-year Navy SEAL where his top awards included four Bronze Stars with valor and...Read more",Take It From The Pros,2014-06-13 11:00:00

However, it is also one of the most difficult tasks an owner tackles. It s axiomatic that to build a strong business, you need good people. Unfortunately, when it comes to hiring, nothing will guarantee success.Entrepreneurs often struggle to sort the wheat from the chaff in the hiring process. That makes sense. They often get into business because they are passionate about the primary work of their enterprise. Because they are good at what they do, the business grows and they need to hire people to get the work done.Related: 10 Insights on Building, Motivating and Managing an Exceptional TeamUnfortunately, no one is born knowing how to make good hiring decisions. It s a learned skill. Therefore, entrepreneurs who have not been trained in good hiring practices are likely to struggle. The good news is that we have uncovered five ways to tip the odds in your favor.1. Know exactly what you need. While it may seem like remedial advice, identifying what you need in each of these four areas is the first step:Physical requirements: This category includes activities such as lifting, walking, bending or speaking. Limit what you specify to the actual requirements of the job.Experience: This includes work history, but also education, accreditation or licenses. Focus on the results you want delivered, not just prior work experience. Be careful about eliminating good candidates by over-specifying (e.g., requiring a college degree when one is not needed).Behaviors: These include honesty, the ability to work well with others, attitudes and work ethic. While employees can learn skills, it s more difficult to teach behaviors. Hire behaviors, train skills.Cognitive capability: Comedian Ron White observes,  You can t fix stupid!  It s funny, in part because it s true. An employee can learn new skills, but their cognitive capability is unlikely to improve significantly. If you want smart employees, hire smart people.2. Understand what you have to offer. As a small business, you may find it difficult to compete with the big dogs on compensation and benefits. However, you have other things of value: flexible schedules, broader job responsibilities, a family feel, an entrepreneurial culture or the chance to learn new skills as the company grows. Obviously, structuring a competitive compensation package is critical, but be creative to make your offer attractive.Related: Sizing Up Candidates for Cultural Fit Throughout the Hiring Process3.

Go beyond friends and family -- consider many candidates, but because you know exactly what you are looking for, quickly eliminate the bulk of the prospects and focus on the promising few.4. Leverage multiple methods and opinions. Including others in the hiring decision can offer enhanced insight. Others may catch something you missed or ask a key follow-up question. While the hiring manager should generally make the final decision, it s prudent to involve others. Consider multiple methods of assessing a candidate s fit. Depending on the job, there are three useful methods of evaluation: interviews, assessments and simulations or trial employment.5. Trust, but verify. Unfortunately, prospective employees often claim education and work accomplishments that simply aren t true. Once they are inside your organization, dishonest employees can be devastating. The Small Business Administration states that employee theft is the cause of 30 percent of all business failures. Perform the necessary checks to prevent dishonest people from infiltrating your organization.Ensuring that you get the right people in the right jobs is critical. While it s not easy, it s doable. Bad hires can destroy the business that you have labored to build.

/article/234721,Modern Marketers Need to Speak 'Engineer',"Creativity is still necessary, but the skills to access data and track campaigns are now a must.","Free Webinar | August 16thFind out how to optimize your website to give your customers experiences that will have the biggest ROI for your business.							Register Now  Many successful companies today are software companies under the hood. This massive transformation is felt most profoundly in the changing nature of relationships between companies and their customers, and the marketing department is an integral cog in these relationships.Related: Marketing, Meet Tech. 4 Tips for Hiring a Data-Obsessed Team.Industry by industry, the decimation of traditional business models by technology-driven competitors gathers momentum. Consider Netflix and Blockbuster, iTunes and Tower Records, or Amazon and Barnes & Noble. It's why AOL paid $315 million for Huffington Post -- essentially a publishing platform for citizen journalists -- whereas Jeff Bezos paid $250 million for the venerable Washington Post and all its Pulitzer Prize-winning journalists and foreign correspondents.The modern digital marketer can no longer run business by instinct alone, but must use technology to test, measure and optimize their campaigns, often in real time and at massive scale. To remain relevant and effective in this world, they not only need to be experts in the evaluation of software and express high-levels of technical literacy, but also understand how technology enables a new mode of marketing strategy.So how do find and hire this modern marketer? For one, look for those with a technical background, whether academically or professionally. For example, marketers with an engineering degree may be a better fit than those with liberal arts degrees. People who have had product management experience also tend to have the right technical aptitude.Related: 7 Stats Show Mobile Marketing is Crucial for Your BusinessGiven that access to data at scale and in real time is an enabling attribute of a modern marketing strategy, it naturally follows that data scientists and analysts become critical to the successful implementation of a data-driven marketing strategy. These individuals will be drawn to progressive marketing organizations, where data analysis sits at the intersection of corporate strategy and customer relationships. These are highly desirable places to apply their skills -- the front line of the corporate world.Once you attract a tech-literate marketer, let them do their thing. Tell them what you want to accomplish and give them the freedom to solve for that using data. Provide them with the budget to explore software and analytics platforms, and let them be the experts in selecting the most effective tools.Another retention tool beyond a fair salary is revenue accountability. It used to be the marketer s job to set up leads for the sale organization to close, but with more transactions happening online with little or no human input, marketing s accountability for revenue is growing. In some cases, they now own the revenue number, and this is a trend that will likely continue to gain traction.Despite all this (justified) talk about marketing becoming a data-driven science, a marketing campaign still begins with a creative idea. In fact, the need for a creative idea is as important today as it ever has been. Hiring and retaining a good data marketer to help measure the success of that idea and suggest how it can be improved, will take you even farther.Related: The 80/20 Rule and How to Supercharge Your Sales and MarketingKevin BuckbyKevin Buckby has more than a decade of experience orchestrating executive searches for high-profile venture-capital-funded technology companies.

/article/234475,"10 Insights on Building, Motivating and Managing an Exceptional Team","Is team building an art or a science? Fortunately, academic research on group dynamics sheds some much needed light on creating and motivating the perfect staff.","Is team building an art or a science?When it comes to assembling, motivating and keeping a great team happy so that they can flourish in your business, the truth is that it s a bit of both.It cannot be understated how important a great team is to a business  success. The quality of the work you do will never exceed the quality of the team behind it. To many entrepreneur s and manager s dismay, team building often seems as complicated as watchmaking there are a lot of moving parts, and things have to be just right in order to create something magical.
Fortunately, academic research on team culture and group dynamics sheds some much needed light on creating and motivating the perfect team.Today we will look at 10 of the best studies available, and break down what s important to look out for and what practical things you can do to ensure your team is set up for success.1. Team-Building Exercises Can WorkBuilding a great team and actual ""team building"" exercises are often viewed in very different lights.Team building is one of those business topics that will evoke a few eye rolls. The first thing that comes to mind for many are those superficial activities that force people together into some sort of awkward scenario, with all of the participants hating the process and wishing it would end.Related: The Shocking Truth: Customers Don't Want to Engage With Your CompanyTeam building shouldn t have this sort of reputation.The Small Group Research journal paper ""Does Team Building Work?"" analyzed data from 103 studies conducted between 1950 and 2007. This cumulative research provides the strongest scientific evidence to date that team building can have measurable, positive effects on team performance.As you ll soon see, the ""secret"" in making team building work is to keep things normal, and to avoid situations that feel invasive, awkward, or forced. Do NOT assemble your team and ask everyone to share their greatest fear a huge majority of the people involved won t appreciate this forced mix of their work life and personal feelings.What far more practical things should you do instead?Read on 2. The 5 Best Team-Building ActivitiesIn light of the lackluster reputation of team building, you probably aren't surprised to read that research from Citrix has shown that 31 percent of office workers say that they can t stand team-building activities.This negative association is a shame, because, as discussed in this Harvard Business School publication, a connected team is a motivated team. Further supporting research from the American Psychological Association (APA) finds that team building activities can help employees feel valued, and those that do are the most motivated to do great work.Almost all employees (93 percent) who reported feeling valued said that they are motivated to do their best at work.""There are ways to circumvent this mentality and fulfill the goal of providing great bonding experiences for co-workers. David W. Ballard, head of APA s Psychologically Healthy Workplace Program, discussed in a U.S. News & World Report interview five simple team-building activities that have shown to be successful time and time again. They are:Volunteering. The best activities are those that the entire team feels proud to participate in. Research even suggests that helping others makes you feel like you have more time on your hands! The Help Scout team recently assisted the Cradles to Crayons project to help support a great cause in our community, and all of us found it to be an incredibly rewarding experience that encouraged conversation outside of the workspace.Physical activities. Sports make for superb outings that allow employees to work together and get physical exercise. However, Ballard warns that always playing the sport that the CEO likes may make the activity feel like an obligation. Also, pick your sport carefully: Activities that could result in injury (e.g., football) aren t as effective as milder, non-contact options (e.g., bowling, ice skating).Field trips. Simple, casual trips such visiting a park or museum or going to a baseball game can work wonders for your team. Companies like Green Mountain Coffee Roasters offer a more extreme example here: They sent employees to Guatemala to learn more about the coffee-making process!Professional development activities. Quality workshops give teams the opportunity to stay up to date with education and develop professional relationships in new settings all without the stigma of going it alone or the awkwardness of trying to network solo.Shared meals. Eating regularly with your team allows for casual conversation in a comfortable environment, letting team members get to know each other outside of work. As a remote worker, I don t get to see the Help Scout team every day, but when I m in Boston we spend lunchtime together and I regularly dine out with individual team members.3. Great Teams Need Non-work CommunicationA study from MIT s Human Dynamics Laboratory shows that when it comes to predicting the success of a great team, the most important element is how well the team communicates during informal meetings:With remarkable consistency, the data confirmed that communication indeed plays a critical role in building successful teams. In fact, we ve found patterns of communication to be the most important predictor of a team s success.""This doesn t mean team members have to be best friends outside of work, but managers should recognize that non-work discussions are critical to creating a team that looks out for each other. Otherwise, co-workers may begin to view one another as just cogs in the machine.How can informal conversations be regularly prompted within teams?We advised the center s manager to revise the employees  coffee break schedule so that everyone on a team took a break at the same time.""In short, a simple nudge works far better than awkward, forced team-building exercises that mandate casual conversations.4. Star Performers are Often Dependent on Their TeamYour rockstar employee that seems to thrive off of natural talent may be more dependent on their team than you think.A Harvard study published in 2006 revealed that the overall performance of heart surgeons improved over time (patient mortality was the outcome measured) when they were able to consistently work with their usual team at the primary hospital they performed in.Related: The Psychology of Color in Marketing and BrandingWhen the surgeons would cover for other doctors, the researchers found that this measured improvement didn t translate to other familiar hospitals with unfamiliar personnel.So even though these surgeons were well acquainted with the other hospitals (thereby sidelining worries about feeling confused or ""out of place""), they didn t have the same tacit understanding of their team members. As a result, they did not perform at the same level as they did at their primary hospital with their primary team.This finding is very important for both employees and employers to consider when evaluating how a particular team is contributing to their rockstar s consistency.5. Remote Teams Can Outperform Local TeamsYahoo s recent announcement that they would be ending their remote working program kicked the argument over remote working into a frenzy. But the research shows that not every company should write off the practice just yet.A 2009 study from MIT s Sloan School of Management found that virtual teams working for software companies were regularly outperforming on-location teams, as long as they had the proper systems in place.What systems are required? According to the MIT study:Those processes can be classified in two categories: task-related including those that help ensure each team member is contributing fully; and socio-emotional including those that increase the cohesion of the group.""The group s findings show these elements to be critical for remote-team success:6. In-Person Brainstorming is Not the Best Option for TeamsGreat teams are often denoted by their ability to unite to come up with stellar solutions to brain-busting problems.The problem is that study after study has shown that brainstorming in groups is generally a bust when it comes to generating the best, most novel ideas.Here are a few reasons group brainstorming can fall flat:Social loafing: Studies on the concept of ""social loafing"" show that in brainstorming groups, creatives often won t fully exert themselves because they feel that others are likely to pick up the slack (bystander effect, anyone?).Production blocking: In a group brainstorming session, the rest of the group has to wait while a peer shares an idea. This has been shown to cause some folks to actively dissuade themselves from sharing when they feel they are being talked over.Evaluation apprehension: Unsurprisingly, contributors to brainstorming groups know that their ideas will be judged. Researchers have found that this often prevents people from sharing, since they don t have the time to fully flesh out an idea the way they would if they were brainstorming alone.But brainstorming is important for teams research shows it gets employees invested in the projects they are working on. When people feel like they ve contributed, they tend to be more invested in making the project a success.So what s the solution?According to this research, the answer may be a new form of online brainstorming known as electronic brainwriting. This practice consists of brainstorming through a chat program, which circumvents many of the face-to-face problems. The following rules are also recommended:Don t criticize.Focus on quantity.Combine and improve ideas produced by others.The Help Scout team prefers HipChat for this sort of quick communication, and the app is also perfect for setting up the electronic brainwriting sessions mentioned above.7. Great Teams Benefit from Having an Analytical ThinkerWhen it comes to assembling a great team, this study from Carnegie Mellon University suggests that having an analytical thinker on the team is a must to balance out big-picture strategists. How is an analytical thinker defined? The study described this person as someone who pays close attention to ""process focus,"" which is the art of identifying and focusing on the sub-tasks needed to achieve the goal.In other words, this detailed-oriented person sweats the small stuff; they re a great complement to the broad thinkers who concentrate on executing overall strategy.They key is to educate team members on appreciating the process of creation, which can help negate potential disputes. When the entire team understands the often difficult nature of the details, this analytical thinker can thrive without being at odds with those planning out strategy.Related: Lessons in Customer Service From the World's Most Beloved CompaniesAs a software company, we can offer a candid example adding ""this one button"" or ""that one little feature"" is almost never as easy as it sounds. Very rarely are these small changes actually small, and big picture people need to be in tune with this side of an analytical thinker s work, so that misunderstanding s and disputes can be avoided.8. Forming ""Micro-Cultures"" Can Be Bad for TeamsVarying degrees of friendship are bound to form within teams. Research shows that it s common for closer bonds to be formed among team members who share similarities based on their social identity and by the department they work in (e.g., marketing, support, product, etc.).In a psychological study on getting the most out of multidisciplinary teams, lead researcher Doris Fay found that multidisciplinary teams produced better quality innovations than more uniform teams, but that this boost in performance was only consistent if there wasn t a problem of teams fracturing into smaller subgroups.Team leaders need to ensure that each member feels committed to the unified cause and that everyone on the team has a voice.While private friendships are obviously fine, office cliques and inter-departmental rivalries aren t ideal for a positive, goal-minded environment.9. Teams Need ""Social Sensitivity""For a team to perform well across a range of challenges, it s essential for its members to have the character trait of social sensitivity.Recent research on this topic shows that the ability to read co-workers  emotional states is pivotal in determining a team s success. Detecting when co-workers may be frustrated, busy, confused or embarrassed has proven helpful to a team s cohesion.Seemingly small things such as being able to take turns while speaking can go a long way toward increasing social sensitivity among teams.You may not be surprised to hear that women are often more attuned with this trait than men. This may be why additional research suggests that teams that lead (company boards) with at least one woman represented will regularly outperform all male boards.Either way, this is an important trait to establish in your company culture. Check out how the Buffer team promotes these values by encouraging employees to  default to transparency  and to be a ""no ego doer"" when working with others.10. The Best Teams Have Extroverts and IntrovertsIf you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it ll spend its whole life believing that it is stupid.""   Albert EinsteinMany companies actively encourage their employees to open up and be more extroverted. But be careful of this mentality; even though introverts don t tend to make as strong of a first impression as extroverts, they have proven to be key members of teams.Research shows that although introverts ""start off with the lowest status"" (i.e., their peers didn t evaluate them as having much influence), as time progressed their status climbed whereas the extraverts  status fell.These underrated quiet types offer a unique way to balance a team, so be sure that any  wallflowers  on your team are given a chance; their reserved nature may just mean that they are shy, not that they have nothing to contribute.Gregory CiottiWilmington, Del.,-based Gregory Ciotti is the marketing strategist at Help Scout, the invisible email support software for small businesses.

/article/234439,The 6 Rules to Hiring Unpaid Interns,"A closer look at the Department of Labor's rules, which otherwise can be as clear as mud.","Extra help at no extra cost sounds like a dream scenario for any small-business owner   but unpaid interns can land a business in a lot of trouble, according to employment attorney Rebecca Aragon.Aragon, a shareholder at Littler Mendelson, says the Department of Labor s rules make unpaid internships time-consuming and challenging for businesses.   The Department of Labor has six factors for unpaid internships,  says Aragon,  and some of them are clear as mud. Related: Best Resume Tips for College GradsIf you want to bring on unpaid interns, here are the rules to follow, according to the DOL:1. The internship, even though it includes actual operation of the facilities of the employer, is similar to training which would be given in an educational environment;
2. The internship experience is for the benefit of the intern;
3. The intern does not displace regular employees, but works under close supervision of existing staff;
4. The employer that provides the training derives no immediate advantage from the activities of the intern; and on occasion its operations may actually be impeded;
5. The intern is not necessarily entitled to a job at the conclusion of the internship; and
6. The employer and the intern understand that the intern is not entitled to wages for the time spent in the internship.Because creating an internship program that provides an educational experience takes time and effort, and businesses are not necessarily allowed to benefit from unpaid interns  work, Aragon says unpaid internships are generally not worth it for most small businesses or startups. [Unpaid interns] really are a detriment to the employer,  says Aragon.  If you re a for-profit company and you have unpaid interns, the question really is why. Related: 5 Do's and Don'ts for Hiring Summer InternsAragon uses a restaurant as an example: If you have an unpaid intern from a culinary school, you d be responsible for giving them ingredients, teaching them how to prepare a dish and overseeing the preparation   all in the name of providing an educational experience. But at the end of the day, if they do it right, you can t sell it,  says Aragon.These rules, however, don t apply to non-profit organizations or the government. Aragon says the White House, for example, has an unpaid internship program in which interns are expected to do real work.  The government can get free labor, but businesses can t,  says Aragon.As a result, Aragon says if you are actually looking for real help at your business, you ll have to pay at least the minimum wage and comply with state and federal laws regarding minimum-wage workers.In Aragon s opinion, the only real reason to hire unpaid interns in light of the current law is if you want to build goodwill among students who may want to return after graduation as employees. However, what s in it for Wolfgang Puck, say, is if an intern a year later graduates at the top of [his or her] class and wants to be an assistant chef,  says Aragon.Related: Is College Adequately Preparing Students for the Workforce?More from FOX BUSINESSN.

/article/233866,How to Get a Workplace Wellness Program for Your Office,"With prevention a key focus of the new healthcare law, employers are promoting health. Here's how.","						This story appears in the June 2014 issue of Entrepreneur. Subscribe  Workplace wellness programs -- which are incentivized under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act -- are varied in nature and may include everything from blood pressure and cholesterol screenings to participatory groups designed to get employees to maintain a healthy weight or to quit smoking. A recent report by the RAND Corporation found that such programs offer returns of $1.50 for every $1 invested.Getting a wellness program off the ground needn't be pricey or cumbersome, says Quan Campbell, president and founder of the Lifewellness Institute in San Diego. Here are her tips for getting started.Check with your insurer. Increasingly, insurance companies are offering resources and incentives for companies to launch wellness programs, so Campbell recommends asking your broker or company representative for information. Insurers may have program and activity suggestions, promotional materials or other resources to help you get your program off the ground.Team up with others. Host a wellness day, during which employees from various departments or nearby companies can get a flu shot, blood pressure screening or wellness training. Consider incorporating some friendly competition, Campbell says, with contests for ""most miles walked"" or healthiest lunch.Get management involved. When the business owner is leading the walking program, it sends a message to employees that wellness is taken seriously. Encourage senior managers to participate.Most important: Keep it safe and legally sound. Weight-loss competitions or extreme exercise challenges can be medically risky and may leave you open to liability, Campbell cautions. Familiarize yourself with the rules surrounding participatory programs to ensure that they're not discriminating against people who are physically unable to take part. Finally, keep in mind that the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act mandates strict confidentiality with regard to any individual's medical information.""Be sure to get the guidance you need for your program, whether it's from your attorney, human resources person or an outside consultant,"" Campbell says.

/article/234431,Knock That Startup Interview Out of the Park,"Unlike big companies, hiring the wrong person can be very damaging to a startup, so make sure you're a good fit.","Are you yearning to get your foot in the door at a fledgling startup but lack the technical expertise because you didn't start writing code at the age of five? Well, there s no need to fret. Startups need to grow their businesses through sales, which just might be the right place for you.The question becomes, how do you make yourself attractive to that shiny new startup? What are they looking for in a new hire that might be different than a larger company? Let s dig a bit deeper.Related: Are You Cut Out for a Sales Gig at a Startup?We know that startup founders have an incredibly high risk tolerance, hence the decision to leave their day jobs, cushy salaries and car allowances to start a company, work around the clock and nearly starve for at least two years. This ideal, however, isn t consistent when it comes to hiring personnel, because they can t afford to take a serious risk.The difficulty is that the startup isn t generating any substantial revenue and is more than likely scraping by on the cash they have left, putting the money that is spent on new hires at extreme risk. The startup founder mitigates this risk by being extremely diligent in ensuring that a potential hire is as good a fit as possible.A larger company that is generating more substantial revenues can afford to make a mistake with a new hire. If they end up being the wrong fit, it s not nearly as big of a deal from a financial standpoint.The interview. When interviewing for a larger company, you ll tend to get questions that more revolve around your resume, experience and personality test-like questions that force you to compare yourself to an off-the-wall mythical figure. The startup interview will be much more personal -- it has to be. The founder needs to know who you are as a person and will be much less interested in your college GPA or how many awards you received at your previous corporate gig.Related: Want to Succeed at a Startup? Focus on These 5 Qualities.You can expect to get asked about your upbringing and family life, as these play an enormous role in whom you are now as an adult, as well as your work history -- although not necessarily about where you ve worked but about how long have you been working.If you ve been working since you were legally allowed, great, but if you didn t get your first job until you were 22 years old and have lived off of an allowance from your parents, you d better come up with a pretty good explanation as to how you appreciate the difficulty that comes with hard work and making money.Your presentation counts. If you really want the job at the startup, you ll need to show that you are a self-starter that is motivated and capable of solving your own problems. Both small and large problems occur seemingly by the minute in a startup, and there s nothing worse than someone who is only capable of identifying problems and relies on someone else to fix them.It s also important to illustrate your dedication to the company and it s long-term vision. As I mentioned before, it s extremely risky for the company to hire you at such an early stage in its growth. The founder needs to be absolutely certain that you have what it takes to stick it out through what is not always going to be easy times.You also need to be sure that you re the right fit.

/article/234138,Think You Should Hire an Intern? Think Again. ,"Admit it: Your company might not have the time, interest or temperament to handle an intern. ","If they haven t already, ambitious college students have likely reached out to your company for a summer internship. On the surface, it sounds enticing to get an extra hand for the summer and possibly train a future hire. But bringing a college intern on board for a semester is not for every employer since not every company has the resources or temperament to provide a successful training experience for students.  There are definitely employers that should not have interns,  says Andrew Maguire, chief executive officer of InternMatch in San Francisco, an online clearinghouse of college internship resources and opportunities.An internship is first and foremost a training program   not just low-cost help. We talked with Maguire and university internship coordinators about the most common reasons your business should steer clear of internship season this summer. 1. You just don t have the time. Training and mentoring a college intern requires significant time and effort, more so than for usual hires. You might need to create new processes and fill out regular paperwork with a school. Additionally, some students have never worked in real-world environments before and you might need to help them develop skills that you take for granted, such as writing professional emails. Interns  industry skills are just developing too, and you ll need to anticipate questions and even plan for revisions of work that you wouldn t always need to do with a new hire. One of the biggest mistakes employers make is underestimating the time commitment involved, says Daniel Newell, Job Development/Marketing Specialist at San Jose State University in San Jose, Calif.The best internships provide a structured training and evaluation program overseen by a supervisor, says Newell. He recommends that employers also design a special project with defined goals and measurable outcomes for interns to complete. These are managerial tasks that shouldn t be pawned off on a junior staffer, notes Sue Pye, Assistant Director for Experiential Education at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, N.J.  A younger employee might be an effective mentor but doesn t have enough management experience to coordinate a successful internship, she says.2. You ll never hire that intern. Internships assume a certain type of hiring pipeline into a company. Businesses that aren t competing for junior staffers who will work their way up the ranks might not need internships. In fact, for these companies, the cost of training a short-term worker who might not ever be hired, is not a good return on investment. Netflix, for example, makes no secret of the fact that it has no internship program. In fact, one staffer writing on discussion site Quora explained,  Netflix is able to compete for senior level developers against other valley companies so there's no need to create awareness among early-career engineers, to create a career pipeline for training engineers/managers, or create a more positive image among college students entering the market. 3. You really just need a part-time staffer. Don t seek out an intern just because you could use help a couple of days a week. An internship is a professional development opportunity for the student, not free or cheap labor for the employer, says Pye. She vets employers to ensure internships are relevant to the students  career interests and that supervisors and mentors will provide regular feedback and evaluation, she says. In addition, Rutgers requires that interns spend no more than a quarter of their time doing clerical work, says Pye.  4. Your managers aren t mentors. Companies might not want to admit this, but successful interns need to be supervised by someone who has the management and communication skills, as well as the interest, to train, guide and mentor them, says Newell. A manager who doesn t make the intern a priority won t be able to provide a meaningful experience, he adds. Not every company is suited to help college interns develop professionally, Maguire points out. Employers need to be honest about their interest level in helping someone start his or her career, he adds.If you ve had an unsuccessful internship experience, use it as a chance for some soul searching. A  lazy  intern might not have been given enough to do. Those who seem  entitled  or  not up to par  were still hired by someone on your team, which might be a good excuse to review how you suss out any hire at your company. Students you say aren t  self-starters  might just not be mind readers and could use some more step-by-step direction from their higher-ups.Samantha DrakeSamantha Drake is a freelance writer and editor in the Philadelphia area who specializes in business, legal, environmental, and general interest issues.Read more",Human Resources,2014-05-28 15:00:00

Here are five different ways to sustain productivity.,"Remember that sense of freedom on the last day of school before summer vacation? It was finally time to ride bikes, go swimming, eat watermelon and stay out until the streetlights came on. The sense of fun that comes with summertime never leaves a person. But for adults, the daily office schedule doesn t change and looking at a blue sky from inside a stuffy cubicle can be depressing.That s perhaps one reason a Captivate Network study found that workplace productivity drops 20 percent during the summer months.

Ask employees for ways the company can create opportunities and plan family events. Related: Unlimited Paid-Time Off? Seriously? How to Make It Work.2. Encourage vacations. When employees feel overworked and underappreciated, their work suffers. It s important for leaders to encourage workers to take vacations. Employees need to clear their minds, relieve stress and regain energy. Team members who know they re taken care of will take care of you and your business in return.Besides, vacations are great for overall productivity. More than 50 percent of employees feel more  rested, rejuvenated and reconnected to their personal life,  and nearly 40 percent of workers  feel more productive and better about their job  after returning from vacation.Additionally, consider implementing casual or half-day Fridays. Work contests or raffles that offer a vacation day or family trip that's paid for can also greatly motivate your team.

Bring the fun of summer into the workplace so people can enjoy it even when they re not on vacation. Summer barbecues are a must. Get employees and their families together to enjoy the beautiful weather. Include activities for kids and adults and provide food and games if possible. My company has brought the fun indoors by offering bowling or laser tag. Plan for a photo-album contest at the end of the summer: Ask employees to share photos or posts of summer activities. The contest winner could receive a special prize, such as a paid vacation day or even airfare for a next vacation. Produce a summer photo album for team members to showcase their experiences.Related: 7 Ways to Craft a Great Company Culture on a Budget4. Use your resources. If the company has a tight budget, don t worry. There are several affordable ways to have fun with the team. Potlucks are a great way to come together without spending a dime. Employees provide the food, and the meeting place can be the office. Schedule a yoga class with an instructor and turn any extra space into a team yoga office for the summer. Summer is a great time to get the team together for a warehouse decorating party, with every wall is decorated by a different team. Use the newly decorated space to host the next family event or office party.5. Talk with members of the team. Communication is key. If an employee event happens on a weekday and a manager is concerned that staffer will be less focused that day, share that concern. That s the backbone of building a team: trusting one another.I want to enjoy my life, and I want my employees to enjoy theirs. This summer, instead of making employees choose between having fun or working, help them do both. They ll work harder when if they arecfree to go bike riding with their kids and eat some watermelon every once in a while. Take a slice as well!

/article/234045,6 Things I Wish Someone Had Told Me Before I Built a Marketing Department,Save yourself time and stress. Read this before jumping head-first into building a marketing team.,"Free Webinar | August 16thFind out how to optimize your website to give your customers experiences that will have the biggest ROI for your business.							Register Now  A couple of years ago I was given an incredible opportunity to build a marketing department from the ground up. The truth is that I had no idea what I was doing.Previously, I had dabbled in email marketing and web design before doing a bit of communications and branding for a nonprofit, and then I took a job as a social media marketing consultant. So I did have some marketing experience, but definitely not enough to seamlessly design and execute a complex marketing strategy while managing a team of marketers.But those are always the most fun and exciting moments of your career, right? When someone believes in you and gives you once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to do something you might not be qualified to do on paper (even though deep-down you know you are perfect for it).So I decided to jump head-first into my new role, give it hell and learn as fast as possible.And overall it went pretty well. Sure, I made some mistakes, did a few stupid things and spent a lot of time figuring out stuff that now seems totally rudimentary, but I was also able to build a brand that is now well-known in our local market, create content that people look forward to downloading and set up a full-blown marketing automation system.I often think about how much time I could have saved and stress I could have avoided had someone sat me down at the beginning and taught me the big lessons I muddled through along the way.So in an effort to lend a hand to rookie marketers and new heads of marketing, here are the six big lessons I wish I knew before I built a marketing department from the ground up the ones that will save you a lot of time, frustration and money.Lesson No. 1: Marketing Does Not Exist Within a BubbleFor most companies, a truly good marketing strategy is one that integrates marketing into other key departments like sales, product development and human resources. But if you re new to marketing or if you re building a marketing department for the first time, it s easy to adopt a bubble mentality and simply focus on the things that we traditionally think of as marketing: your blog, the website, content marketing, events, Google Analytics, etc. things that don t require much collaboration with other departments.This is understandable given that most new marketing departments are short on resources, both in terms of money and people. Moreover, within technology companies marketing is often viewed as the bells and whistles you add to a product once it s ready to launch, or even after it s gone to market, when in factmarketing should be an integral part of the product development process from the get-go.Treating marketing as something that operates completely outside other departments can lead to several problems: sales messaging that is out of line with the company mission and value proposition; a product that does not speak your customer s language or address their pain points; a product development plan that does not prioritize the features that are most important to your users.But there s good news: the rise in popularity of the term  growth hacking  has made people in leadership, engineering and sales aware of just how crucial it is tointegrate marketing into product development processes from the very beginning (and it s given marketing a much cooler name).Since good marketing is interdisciplinary, marketers need to become expert relationship-builders. They need to make friends across other departments and learn how to influence people so that their colleagues enjoy working with them and are eager to make things happen in order to please them. Marketers need to be able to talk effectively to salespeople, engineers and graphic designers (which at times can feel like switching between Spanish, German and French).Lesson No. 2: Keep It Simple, Especially In the BeginningA common rookie marketer mistake is to think that a good marketing strategy is one that includes all the popular marketing tactics, like SEM; display; social media; a beautiful, responsive website; a blog; a full-blown content marketing strategy; and so on. Everyone is always talking about this stuff, so we should be doing all of it, right?One of the smartest decisions you can make when building a new marketing department is to keep things as lean as possible. This way you can focus on quality over quantity, and you can put energy into the channels and tactics that will give you disproportionate results.How do you avoid wasting money and time on things that won t work? How do you know where to market before you even start? By talking to your target audience.Actually, this should be the very first thing you do design a survey for people who represent your target customer with the goal of understanding the following:Where do they get their industry news? What blogs, websites, newsletters and magazines do they read? Who do they follow on Twitter? Which brands and personalities do they follow on Facebook?What kind of information are they looking for regarding your industry?What are their major pain points? What keeps them up at night?You can complement your survey results with online research about your target customers. Follow people who represent your target audience on Twitter, see what they re asking about on sites like Quora or take a look at what they re saying about competing products in reviews and write-ups.You can do two key things with this information:Understand how to market to your audience (what kind of language to use, what keywords to put in your copy, where to advertise, where to guest blog, which influencers you need to convert into product ambassadors, and so on)Determine what features and benefits will make your product most attractive to your customer.The book Nail It then Scale It: The Entrepreneur s Guide to Creating and Managing Breakthrough Innovation has a great section on how to utilize a deep understanding of your customer to create a killer marketing plan. Read it!Once you ve identified the channels and tactics that are most likely to get your product in front of your customers  eyes and designed a lean marketing strategy based on this information, you re off to a great start. But starting simple is just half the battle; the other half is keeping your strategy lean over time. After all, opportunities to make things more complicated always come up.What culprits are most likely to throw you off course?Your boss  If you run a marketing department it s quite possible that you report to the CEO or COO (i.e. someone who is not a marketer, and who is doing a million other things besides managing you). In this case, it s likely that your boss will ask you,  Why aren t we doing PPC?!   Why don t we have a blog?!   Why don t we have a fancy team page on our website with everyone s name, job title and life story?! 
It s your job to explain to them why the company is present in some channels and not others, and why certain things are higher priority. Use the data from your marketing research to back up your position, and be adamant about keeping things lean.Perfectionism  Whether it s your own or your boss s, perfectionism is your enemy. Why? Because it is the opposite of lean. Instead of proofreading everything a million times and obsessing over the color scheme of your new ebook, pick one or two things that you are going to do exceptionally well, and be happy with about 80% perfect for the rest.Lesson No. 3: Customer Research Is Not a One-Time ThingOnce you ve designed and executed an in-depth survey to get inside your customer s head, don t simply stop there; find ways to continue to learn about your customer and use this knowledge to improve your marketing strategy.No matter how diligently you researched your customers in the beginning, there will be things you missed. Moreover, they ll be things you will only be able to know by tapping your existing customer base or loyal mailing list down the line.If people download content from your website, use progressive profiling in your forms in order to ask them new questions about what they do, who they are and what they want to learn about. Design periodic surveys for existing customers in order to understand how you can make your product better, and talk to leads who didn t end up buying from you in order to understand why. You can also ask webinar attendees what they thought of your content.Constant feedback and new information about your audience are key to tweaking your strategy in the right direction.Lesson No. 4: Get A Solid Analytics and Testing Strategy In Place as Soon as PossibleIn a field like marketing where new social media platforms make their debut on a daily basis and algorithm updates constantly change how you should do SEO or what makes people see your social content it can be a challenge to prioritize which areas of marketing you want to learn deeply, which you simply want to be proficient in and in what order you re going to learn it all.If I could go back in time I would make understanding how to do analytics well a top priority from the very beginning. Why? Because in order to create an effective marketing strategy you need to determine which channels work, and which don t, as quickly as possible something you do by culling insights from key metrics.Otherwise, you ll waste a lot of time and money on tactics that aren t doing your business any good.Analytics is an extremely complex topic, and you definitely can t learn it overnight. Each channel has its own quirks when it comes to measuring, and there are many different tools for collecting data and ways to set up your digital marketing infrastructure.Here are a few resources to get you started:Technical MKTWeb Analytics: An Hour a DayDigital Marketing and Measurement ModelThe Beginner s Guide to Startup AnalyticsMarketing Analytics 101: How to Measure the Effectiveness of Your WebsiteLesson No. 5: Document Systems to Withstand TurnoverEven if you have an amazing company culture or are a wonderful manager, at some point a key employee is going to leave. It s inevitable. Unfortunately, when someone leaves you ll have to teach a new employee how your marketing department works, which can be incredibly time consuming.If you re managing a marketing team or even just a few freelancers that you work with regularly, you ll want to invest time in documenting the key systems that keep your marketing machine running smoothly. This way, when a new hire comes on board you ll have in-depth explanations of how things work that she can review and learn before coming to you with questions.What does documenting a system look like? It can be anything from a detailed social media marketing plan laid out in a PDF to a flowchart explaining your lead nurturing strategy or a Google Doc outlining each step required to produce your monthly webinar.Not only do these documented systems help you transition between employees; they also mean you don t have to memorize every detail of your marketing strategy.Lesson No. 6: Setting Up a Marketing Automation System Is a Ton (A TON!) of WorkOne of the most laborious parts of building a new marketing department is getting the lead capturing and marketing automation system in place.This was probably more complicated for us than it is for most companies since much of our material is in two languages (English and Spanish). Regardless, if you re doing this for the first time you are in for a ride.Designing a system for sorting and following up with new leads based on where they came from and what they are looking for is complex, especially when you re integrating multiple tools, like a customer relationship management tool and marketing automation software.If I could do it again I would have simply hired an expert in marketing automation to help us set this up and train the marketing team. It s a little extra money, but it is well worth the time you ll save trying to figure it all out on your own.Building a new marketing department is both incredibly fun and incredibly overwhelming. Truth be told there s no magic bullet that will make you get it 100% right the first time around, but if you keep these lessons in mind you ll be well on your way to creating something amazing.Now we d love to hear from you: what s one thing you wish someone had told you before you built your marketing department (or before you started out as a marketer)?Chloe GrayChloe Gray specializes in digital marketing strategies for startups.

/article/234079,Are You Cut Out for a Sales Gig at a Startup?,"If you want to get a job selling, would you be a better fit at a smaller or a larger company?","So, you really think you have what it takes to withstand the seemingly never-ending ""no's,"" yet have the desire to earn excessive piles of money? If your answer to both questions is yes, then sales just might be the place for you. The question quickly becomes: Are you the right person for a startup or should you be looking for a more structured, corporate gig?If you ve ever been in sales this won t come as much of a shock, but there is quite a difference between selling for a startup or small company versus a larger one. Actually, there are huge differences, so let s have a gander at a few, and yes, there are exceptions to every rule.Related: Eager to Join a Startup? 3 Tips to Engineer a Mutual Match.It starts with the interview. When you are looking to join a smaller company, which we ll lump startups into, you can expect to get questions about your past, upbringing, work experience and success -- all of which will have very little to do with some award you received at your last job and a lot more to do with how your experiences have sculpted you into who you are as a person. To put it plainly -- startups hire people, not college degrees and resumes. It s much more important for a small company, which has limited assets, to hire the right person the first time, as opposed to a much larger one that has considerably deeper pockets and can afford to make a few mistakes.A larger company is going to be interested in talking through your resume, point by point, your college degree and grade point average as well as which Disney character you would be and why -- all of which are pretty worthless to a startup.Related: 5 Inside Sales Hiring Tips for Growing CompaniesDefining the opportunity. If you are the kind of person that is comfortable making $70,000 per year for the rest of your life and/or are opposed to risk, you will flounder in a startup, so you must go for a big company. I want to be very clear that there is nothing wrong with either of the above, $70,000 is a lot of money, but if you re the type of person that doesn t need regular direction, is totally comfortable taking risks in life and wants to make a heck of a lot more, a smaller company will likely be your cup of tea.In a large company your income will be limited by sales quotas and year-over-year expectations that self-correct, combined with the fact that you ll never be allowed to make more than your boss. The way you progress is you do your time and get by or even shine, and at some point your boss will get promoted and you will too -- which can take years or even decades in some cases. You will also be incredibly structured and have extremely limited control over decision-making, which is why you re making less money.Working with a startup or smaller company will often provide you with autonomy, and actually demand it. You will have to be able to manage yourself and your time. If you re productive with your time, are capable of solving your own problems as opposed to just pointing them out and relying on someone else to fix them, the sky can be the limit -- think stock options -- but if you re not, you ll be gone faster than a donut at the police station.Related: Want to Hire Killer Salespeople?

/article/233962,Welcoming New Team Players (After Their Startup Joined Yours),"During the transition following an acquisition, employee nerves can become frayed. Here's how to stave off the jealousy, resentfulness and disenchantment of existing staff.","How do veteran players feel about new draft pick? Along with the initial excitement there may be a considerable amount of upset. Much the same thing happens when a new rock-star employee or a coveted hire joins a company and is celebrated as the second coming, leaving everyone else feeling like a second-class citizen. This dynamic is especially true when a company has been acquired and the new talent is being treated very well. The whole situation leaves the veteran employees -- the ones who didn t receive a pay day but who are doing some heavy lifting to accomplish the integration -- feeling ruffled and resentful.In any case, this kowtowing to new talent sets off a lot of complicated dynamics and staff morale can suffer. Jealousy, resentfulness and disenchantment can overwhelm existing employees. They become more competitive than collaborative.CEOs and managers must recognize this complicated situation and prepare for it, much as as a parent preps an older sibling for a new arrival in the family. Related: How to Acquire a Small Business (and Keep Employees Happy)The shiny new thing scenario. In 2011 while I served as the chairman, LiveOps, a startup based in Palo Alto, Calif., acquired Datasquirt, a startup based in New Zealand. I was initially concerned about how the two teams could communicate and coordinate considering the time difference and geographic distance. But the CEO suggested that if we planned properly it would not be an issue.The company brought Datasquirt's founders to corporate headquarters to meet everyone during the deal negotiations and after the acquisition. More important, several LiveOps top engineers went to visit the New Zealand team and the company put in place projects to show the power of the integration. The company assigned a team of engineers from both locations to a mission critical project -- a relaunch of the entire product line to bring the social elements of Datasquirt into the LiveOps product line. The company sent U.S. engineers to New Zealand. New Zealand engineers traveled to the States. There was an aggressive timeline and the rollout proved to be a huge success.We did everything we could to help make the original Datasquirt players feel welcomed and essential. Although I was initially skeptical, the CEO ended up being right: With the proper preparation, it was possible to successfully combine these teams and talents.Related: Three Questions to Ask Potential AcquirersTransition smoothers. Here's what to do to ensure things go smoothly when onboarding new team members -- especially after an acquisition:1. Start planning right away. Learn about the previous corporate culture of the new team members. Ask them what they will do and what their new company can do to make this a successful transition. Designate a  sponsor  on the new team who can provide feedback during the onboarding process.2. Talk to members of the existing team about the changes afoot. Help make them feel excited and inspired by the change. Stay in touch throughout the transition and see how they are faring.3. Watch out for bad behavior and respond appropriately. Don t allow people to say,  That s not how we do things here  or try to intimidate new employees so they won't bring news ideas to the organization. Watch for eye-rolling while rewarding collaboration.4. Embrace the new talent. Make the newly enlarged company a place they want to stay. Include them and listen to their ideas, but don t show them more love than employees who've already been on staff.

/article/233146,Recruiting at a Hackathon? 5 Tips for Success ,"Relationships, not resumes, will nab you the perfect candidate at hackathons.","Looking for a first peek at the new tech talent? Don t wait for a job fair. Get thee to a hackathon.These 24- to 36-hour marathon programming sessions are competitions for cash prizes and bragging rights. They re also a great way to look at how new minds solve problems. That alone can teach you more about a candidate than a traditional job interview, says Dave Fontenot, the co-founder of the University of Michigan s MHacks student hackathon who today runs HackMatch, a service that matches talent and startups. Hackers are  displaying their skills right in front of you, showing you on the fly what they can do,  he says.Hackathons can also offer a better return-on-investment than working with a recruiter, Fontenot says. Attending a hackathon is usually free. If you choose to sponsor, low-cost packages at some college campuses to provide snacks and food might cost as little as $1,000. While walking the event floor requires a little more elbow-grease on your part, the competitions might be more inexpensive than a recruiter who will take a percentage of the new hire s salary.Still, don t go to a hackathon just to collect resumes. That approach will backfire, warn some veterans, since there s a certain etiquette attendees will be expecting. To build relationships and get the most out of these events, consider the following tips. 1. Choose carefully. Not all hackathons are the same. They can be sponsored by a range of groups, including large corporations, non-profits and universities. Some competitions focus on mobile apps while others create games or other online tools. Hackathons can also vary quite a bit in theme and target demographic, says Fontenot. Talk to the organizers or people who have attended a particular hackathon previously to ensure that you ll meet the type of people who might be of use to your organization, he advises.  2. Don t come on too strong.  Overt attempts to recruit will turn hackers off, advises Ishaan Gulrajani, co-founder of Watchsend, a San Francisco-based developer of analytic software that helps iPhone app developers understand how people use their apps.  A hackathon is not a career fair,  says Gulrajani, who s hired three people he met at hackathons. Consider bringing along one of your own tech people, who may feel more comfortable interacting with hackers on an informal level, Gulrajani adds.Take it slow and give off a  We re here, we re smart, and we re cool,  vibe suggests Brendan McCorkle, chief executive officer at CloudMine (cloudmine.me) in San Francisco, who met one employee and two interns at hackathons.3. Focus on making connections.  Talk to hackers on various teams about their projects to build a rapport, says Angel Rivera, senior architect and evangelist at Point.io in Wayne, Pa, the developer of an integrated document-sharing platform. Ask questions, offer advice, and then circle back later in the day to get updates, he adds. Try to talk to as many hackers as possible because you never know who you might encounter, says Rivera. At the same time, be upfront about who you are and why you re there.  Transparency is good,  he adds.4. Don t overlook organizers. Get on the radar of the folks who put on the hackathon, from local tech groups to university faculty. They re usually the most plugged in and can point out the most interesting talents, even if they re not  hacking at that particular event, says Gulrajani. Connecting with these tech leaders can result in valuable relationships that last beyond the competition, says Gulrajani5. Farm, don t hunt.  Not everyone you meet is looking for a job. Some hackers might even be students who aren t graduating for a few years. Others might have their sights set on starting their own companies, notes McCorkle. But needs change, so make note of the best talents with which you ll want to reconnect. The hacker community is a close-knit group and social media is a good way to maintain contact and get to know student hackers as people, notes Gulrajani.

/article/233873,When is a Leave of Absence an Appropriate ADA Accommodation?,"As part of the law, you may have to let employees take some time off. Here are three questions to ask when making your decision.","The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requires employers to provide an employee who has a physical or mental disability, or a record of such a disability, with a workplace modification or adjustment -- an accommodation -- that will enable the employee to perform the essential functions of his or her position.Most employers today are familiar with the interactive process they must engage in when an employee requests an accommodation due to a disability. In recent years, it has become clear that employers must consider a leave of absence as a reasonable accommodation even when the employee has exhausted or does not qualify for other leaves of absence.Leave can allow the employee to obtain medical treatment, therapy, or rehabilitation; obtain or train on assistive equipment or a service animal; or simply recuperate from an injury or illness. Leave as an accommodation only has to plausibly enable the employee to perform his or her job upon return -- certainty is not required.Related: Hiring Employees With DisabilitiesIf an employee s disability and the need for leave as an accommodation are not obvious, the employer can obtain medical information to help understand how a leave will enable the employee to continue performing his or her job.An employer can also deny a leave request and offer an effective alternative accommodation that would allow the employee to remain on the job and eliminate the need for leave. However, if the employee s leave request also qualifies under the federal Family and Medical leave Act, then the employee has a right to take a leave of absence of up to 12 workweeks in a 12-month period, even if another accommodation would enable the employee to continue working.Yes, it s complicated. Yes, employers often get it wrong.So when is leave an appropriate accommodation? Here are three questions to ask:1. Is the leave of absence a reasonable accommodation? Details such as the length of a continuous leave, the unpredictability and frequency of intermittent absences, the degree or lack of certainty of the employee s return to work date, etc., require a case-by-case analysis.Although an employer may have to modify time and attendance policies as a reasonable accommodation, the following are generally not reasonable leave accommodations: an indefinite leave, complete exemption from time and attendance requirements, or irregular, unreliable attendance.Related: 4 Factors in Crafting Your Company's Leave Policy2. Will the leave be an effective accommodation? Whether leave is effective as an accommodation is a fact-specific inquiry weighing many factors, such as:Nature of the employee s disability and limitationsThe essential and marginal functions of the employee s positionWhat purpose the leave will serve to enable the employee to perform the essential functions3. Will the leave impose an undue hardship on the employer s business? If a requested leave of absence is reasonable and effective, the employer s only ground for denying the leave as an accommodation is that it will impose an undue hardship. Undue hardship is a  significant difficulty or expense  in relation to the size of the employer, the resources available and the nature of the operation. A moderate inconvenience or expense is not an undue hardship. There are no set rules on how long of a leave constitutes an undue hardship. The employer must support its claim of undue hardship with specific facts and evidence.An employer does not have to grant an endless number of leave extensions. However, once a leave request has been granted and survived by the employer and its workforce, it becomes problematic for the employer to argue that an extension of a few more days or weeks turns the leave into an undue hardship.Employers should request updated medical information to support each extension request and have the medical provider explain the basis for the opinion that this extra time will indeed, this time, enable the employee to return to work. After more than one extension request, it may be that the leave has become  indefinite  with no prediction of a return to work date -- in other words, an unreasonable accommodation.Related: What Should I Know About Terminating An Employee Due To Medical Problems?Marti CardiMarti Cardi is chief compliance officer for Reed Group, a leading provider of absence-management software and services.

/article/233748,6 Signs It's Time to Find a New Hiring Strategy,"New technology can significantly decrease the duration of the entire interview process, at every stage.","Ever wonder why employers have a difficult time hiring talented employees?Not many employers have adopted modern hiring strategies, which costs them the best talent, money and stress in the long run.Here are some signs it might be time to find a new hiring strategy:Related: How to Hire the Absolute Best Talent for Tech Jobs1. The company's recruitment strategy is treated as a  one-size-fits-all  game plan. No single method can serve an employer in the competitive search for talent in today's evolving marketplace. To create a winning hiring strategy, employers need to closely examine their goals, such as the type of talent they're trying to recruit for a position.Once an employer creates goals for the hiring strategy, the right HR technologies can be deployed. Every employer has different needs, so not every HR technology will be effective in each situation.2. The hiring process is too slow. CareerBuilder reported in 2009 the average time to recruit a new full-time hire ranged from 4.5 to 14 weeks. By last spring Labor Department data showed vacancies remained open on average 23 days instead of 15 in 2009. And a Glassdoor assessment last summer of  25 companies with a grueling interview process, according to candidates, found its duration on average had climbed from 12 days in 2010 to 23 days.  Currently from application to hire, Jobvite finds, the average time is 25 days for applicants sourced from employee referrals, 35 days from job boards and 40 days from a company's own career site.Although employers often equate time with quality during the hiring process, they should realize that slow hiring can put a damper on the experience.HR technology can significantly decrease the time it takes to hire a new employee at every stage of the hiring process.To speed up the sourcing process, for example, employers can use a tool like Kivvik, which matches candidates with employers that are a good fit for their skills and personality. This also lets employers take the guess work out of the recruitment process when hiring employees who might make a good fit.To speed up the interview process, employers can perform one-way video interviews with candidates. According to Aberdeen Group, 10 video interviews can be done in the time it takes to perform one screening by the phone.  Related: Go on Facebook for Your Next Hire? (Infographic) 3. The recruitment process doesn t tap mobile devices. Employers who don t incorporate mobile communications in their hiring process are missing out on a huge opportunity to reach talent.According to Jobvite s 2014 Job Seeker Nation Study, 27 percent of job seekers want to apply for jobs directly from their phones. This means employers need to optimize their company s career website for the mobile web and perhaps even design a mobile app.4. Big data is overlooked. Thanks to social media and Google, almost any person can be found at a click of a button. With the vast amount of information online, identifying the best hires can be difficult, however. Employers' use of big data during the hiring process allows for screening of candidates, measuring their skills and even figuring out how long a candidate might stay with the company.5. The company s applicant-tracking system isn t used properly. Or maybe it's not a good fit for the organization. Many employers think the sole purpose of an applicant-tracking system is to store resumes and search for candidates. It can be so much more, however.Having the right tracking system lets employers save time and money and help recruiters find better talent and receive resumes better suited for the post.Picking the right system can involve a great deal of research and time. Be sure to consider factors such as the tracking system's performance, integration and ease of use. Test the system before purchasing it.Related: How to Hire Without Spending a Fortune. (Hint: Use Social Media.)6. Social recruiting is ignored. According to Jobvite s 2013 Social Recruiting Survey, 78 percent of recruiters have made a hire through using social media.Social media lets hiring managers and recruiters establish a relationship with potential hires and learn more about the behaviors of candidates.HR technology can definitely help employers cut costs and save time during hiring.

/article/233166,What's a PEO and How Can It Help My Business?,Hint: It'll help out with all your business's HR needs.,"						This story appears in the May 2014 issue of Entrepreneur. Subscribe  Q: What's a PEO, and why should I use one?A: Here's all you need to know: A Professional Employer Organization (PEO) is one of the best-kept secrets of many successful small businesses. Essentially, these bodies handle all your HR needs, including payroll and administration, employee health and retirement benefits, workers' compensation insurance, state and federal compliance issues and even worker training.All you're left to do is hire, supervise and promote (or fire) your employees as needed. Of course there is a cost for contracting out your HR department, but consider this list of positives.PEOs manage thousands of employees and can therefore purchase insurance and benefit plans at a significant savings or allow you to offer higher-quality plans to attract and retain skilled employees.
	 Experienced professionals in HR, benefits, payroll, risk management and other aspects of employee administration are on the job. Want to institute a 401(k) plan or flexible spending account? The PEO will do it. No need for you to figure it out yourself.
	 The PEO will provide HR manuals for your employees, and the policies and procedures will be maintained in compliance with ever-changing state and federal laws and regulations.
	 A PEO will help with employment-related regulatory compliance (ADA, payroll, OSHA, EEOC, etc.), a huge advantage that can be worth more to your business than the money saved on benefits costs.
	 The PEO can provide effective management and access to payroll records, benefits, personnel data, vacation and sick-time accruals and specialized reports.
	 If you have an HR-related employee claim, such as a discrimination allegation, a PEO will know what to do and will take the lead on managing the claim process.Ordinarily the savings on group health and benefit plans alone will more or less outweigh the cost of hiring a PEO to tackle these duties. But don't forget the peace of mind that a PEO offers. Take one of my fast-growing clients: When this team opened a new office in a distant state, they had no clue how to administer payroll there. When I came onboard, we hired a national PEO that was able to make the process of opening offices and hiring employees in other states painless and risk-free.The most important bit of advice when it comes to hiring a PEO: Do your due diligence. You want your PEO to be financially responsible and stable. The best are accredited by the Employer Services Assurance Corporation and have a current Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements No. 16 audit (formerly known as an SAS 70). Make sure they have a deep presence in your industry, and get references.As to knowing when your business could use a PEO, I believe it's the moment your accounting department asks for a dedicated HR person (even a part-time one) to handle all the paperwork. The sooner they can offload that work to someone who really knows what they're doing and return to managing your balance sheet, the better.Joe WorthJoe Worth, a partner at B2B CFO, has been a CFO for several public and privately held companies.Read more",Human Resources,2014-05-09 16:00:00
/article/233056,The Strategy Behind Weird Interview Questions ,Understanding why interviewers choose non-traditional questions can help you understand when to use them in your own hiring process. ,"There s no shortage of unorthodox or off-beat interview questions to ask job candidates. But what s the point?For some managers, quirky questions go beyond catching someone off guard. Non-traditional questions help managers such as Patrick Brandt, chief executive officer of Zimbra Inc. Frisco, Texas decide if a candidate will fit in with the team.  My style isn t to compromise on culture,  he explains.  For us, it s really attitude over aptitude. Brandt says he relies on open-ended questions that create a dialogue and move the candidate away from rehearsed answers. He says his strategy is more than just a way to humanize the hiring process. Brandt believes his unpredictable questions help uncover issues that others may have been missed or excused. Sometimes people get desperate to fill a position and overlook red flags, he notes, and he says he s prepared to pass on an otherwise-qualified candidate if he or she isn t a good fit for the sociable atmosphere at the software development company.We talked to hiring managers about which non-traditional questions they use   and why   to help you land your next all-star hire.Question: Define  brimborion. Why ask it: When you ask for a definition to an off-beat vocabulary word, you re not really asking for the real meaning (in this case,  something without value or use ). You re seeing how someone reacts to the unexpected, says Jeff Zwelling, chief executive officer and co-founder of Convertro, a Santa Monica, Calif.-based company that tracks the impact of advertising to help clients improve their return on investment. Zwelling, who sometimes uses less obscure words, like  subterfuge,  says employees at a start-up have to do a little bit of everything and know how to think on their feet, he says.What you should know: You re not necessarily looking for hires with a big vocabularly, but for how they handle uncertainty and if this sparks their creativity. The only wrong answer is  I have no idea,  says Zwelling.Question: A hammer and a nail cost $1.10. The hammer costs $1 more than the nail. What is the price of the nail?Why ask it: Zwelling says he likes to see if a candidate will give some thought to this math problem, instead of immediately blurting out the obvious answer of 10 cents. Zwelling says he would actually prefer candidates who admitted they were bad at math. The correct answer is that the nail costs 5 cents, he adds.What you should know: Wacky questions, like doing math on the fly, can rattle people. Zwelling suggests putting candidates at ease before breaking out tricky questions.Question: If you could have any superpower what would it be?Why ask it:  A disarming, non-job-related question helps uncover traits that might not otherwise come to light, says Anthony Smith, chief executive officer and founder of Insightly, a San Francisco-based provider of cloud-based customer relationship management software.  How a candidate answers the question is more important than the content of the response, he says.  Smith prefers those who respond enthusiastically and don t shrug the question off, because he says they will be a better cultural fit for his company.What you should know: Smith says he s the last person to interview a job candidate and keeps his interviews light and conversational. It s awkward to transition from a job-related question to an off-beat query, he explains.Samantha DrakeSamantha Drake is a freelance writer and editor in the Philadelphia area who specializes in business, legal, environmental, and general interest issues.Read more",Inspiring Your Team,2014-05-08 14:00:00
/article/233611,Unlimited Paid-Time Off? Seriously? How to Make It Work.,We know what you're thinking: Employees would abuse such a system. But it can work with three critical factors.,"If you give someone an inch, will they always take a mile? Many employers might be surprised to hear about a business that would provide unlimited paid-time off to full-time employees. However, this policy can be successful if a company's culture is founded on trust and mutual respect.The first step toward creating a culture that can withstand a trust-based policy is for leaders to look outside of the workplace. Leaders must recognize that employees are not only workers, but also parents, spouses, sons and daughters who may have an obligation or emergency to tend to on occasion. When employees are given flexibility, in most cases, it is proven that they respond by being more loyal to and passionate about the company. According to Expedia's 2013 Vacation Deprivation Study, American employees on average use only 10 out of every 14 vacation days each year. Related: You Need a Real Vacation (And So Do Your Employees)As the president of Kriser s, I was not always convinced that this policy was the right fit, especially in a retail setting. But as the business continued to expand from nine stores to 24, I found that it was necessary to build strong company values that could be translated across all of Kriser s markets.In my experience over the last few years, providing unlimited paid-time off to full-time employees -- managers and assistant managers in our stores and headquarters management team members -- has fostered a much stronger sense of mutual trust and respect between all individuals of the company. Each store must work with its own team, along with other local teams, to support each other when in need, which has brought the company closer as a whole.We have seen that unlimited vacation has enormous potential and benefits. However, just like any new policy, organizations should implement it carefully and make sure they look at any potential risks that might impact their particular company. To set a solid foundation for granting employees this flexibility, I recommend companies consider these three factors before employing an unlimited policy:1. Cultivate trust. Trust is absolutely imperative. While the term unlimited could insinuate a free-for-all, when deploying autonomous policies that empower your staff, there has to be a level of trust involved. Ways to foster trust include promoting open communication, creating transparency between managers and staff and listening to your employees. All of these efforts will help to earn employee respect, and in turn, trust.Related: Which Countries Get the Most Paid Time Off? (Infographic)2. Set goals. At Kriser s, we hold our employees accountable by setting goals. If there is a direct correlation between an employee s vacation time and not meeting sales goals, he or she will be held accountable. Creating an unmatched customer experience through education, engagement and a passionate staff is the key to our success. If the staff is unable to uphold the company s customer-service goals due to missed work, we make an effort to communicate with them transparently to resolve the issue.3. Plan ahead. While this system could potentially lead to employees taking excessive time off, the employees at Kriser s on average request less than two weeks of vacation each year. We have found that many staff members appreciate the option and don t want to abuse a program that benefits their work-life balance. If a company has limited staff, it can be challenging when multiple individuals leave for a vacation. At Kriser s, the staff work to support each other, so occasionally employees are temporarily transferred or given shifts at store locations in close proximity to cover team members who are out. However, this is why guidelines are inherent when requesting time off, to ensure everyone has fair notice.One percent of companies offer unlimited paid-time off, according to the Society for Human Resource Management, but the number is predicted to grow. Some big-name companies following this growing trend are Netflix, Best Buy and Evernote.Keeping full-time employees engaged and passionate is the key to running a successful business. These individuals are the direct link to the consumers and the quality of service the company delivers. As a leader, it is wise to implement programs that empower employees and build mutual trust and respect.Related: 4 Factors in Crafting Your Company's Leave PolicyKen GroufKen Grouf is the president and COO of Kriser s, a multi-unit pet retailer specializing in all-natural pet food, supplies and grooming, where he oversees the strategy and day-to-day operations of the company.

/article/233568,What's More Important to Give Employees: A Gift Card or a Pat on the Back?,"For employee success to ensue, businesses need to motivate and encourage their team. But how should the go about it: recognition or compensation?","While many companies use financial compensation to reward employees, there are times when these rewards lose their effectiveness. Here is when to consider ditching the bonus for a simple pat on the back.While companies are comfortable with giving financial rewards to employees, they often get stuck when it comes to giving meaningful, genuine recognition. Yet recognition is often the more powerful reward, since it speaks to the employee in the language of meaning and personal context, rather than generic gift cards.What speaks even more volume is creating reward programs with a social component. This approach brings the department or larger organization into the celebration of an employee s accomplishments, resulting in the most powerful path to building a culture of recognition tied to accomplishments and employee growth.Related: 6 Ways to Get the Best From Your TeamRewards vs. recognition   when each makes senseFor the purpose of this discussion, rewards can be thought of broadly as some form of compensation. Compensation may include salary, bonuses, stock, options or even deferred compensation. The point is there s a formal agreement between the manager and the employee that some level of effort is required, some work product is expected, certain behavior is appropriate and results are desired.This system works pretty well for most of us, most of the time, but there are times when financial rewards lose their effectiveness. Say your business isn t growing due to economic or competitive pressures and you don t have the resources to periodically review and up-level the rewards system. Many employees will find this a disincentive to keep performing at the same level. They may leave for greener pastures, they may develop bad attitudes, become resentful or cynical, even sabotage the workplace with ill-timed comments to customers.While rewards are a necessary part of the world of work, they are not sufficient. It s important to get them right and keep up with the market, or you ll see retention fall and employees disengage. But it s not the whole ball game.Related: Effective Employee Management? Look to the Golden Rule.This is where recognition comes in. In many cases it s more powerful (assuming your rewards programs are in reasonable shape) to give an employee recognition when he or she excels. Recognition can be as simple as a shout out in a group email or as subtle as a heartfelt handshake. The difference here is it takes an emotional action on the part of the manager to recognize the actions of the employee.Here are a few times when recognition makes sense:When the person is well-compensated but has done something above and beyond the call of the jobWhen the person makes an effort to set a fine example, say by mentoring a struggling employeeWhen the employee invests him or herself at an emotional level to the success of the organization.Building a culture of recognitionIt s difficult to build a culture of recognition but it can be done. Christine M. Riordan, writing in the Harvard Business Review, talks about how companies can  foster a culture of gratitude."" Certainly gratitude is a component of recognition: If someone helps you reach your sales goal, you ll feel not only that you hired the right person but also grateful for their contribution to your company. Recognition is, I d argue, bigger than gratitude alone. Recognition is a celebration of shared values and a shared sense of purpose, clearly communicated and widely understood. If you don't convey the purpose, mission or how to achieve the goals correctly, many things can go wrong in the organization. (McKinsey Quarterly goes into this more in depth.)Employee recognition has (at least) five attributes: it s in the moment, in context, appropriate, authentic, and it s aligned with the employee s notion of value.Related: Diversity Defines Our Global Economy. Do You Speak the Language?When financial rewards backfire   and what to do to remedy the situationWe ve all seen rewards systems based purely on financial rewards backfire. It happens with dismaying frequency when your culture lacks a recognition component. Remember the last time you gave Jim a bonus for hitting a goal, only to find out later that Jim s team did 90 percent of the work? Remember when you instituted raises after a two year freeze, citing everyone s hard work? You lost 30 percent of staff within six months. Bet you didn t see that coming.Money isn t everything. To fix a situation where monetary rewards have created friction, you ll first need to check in with all your managers to get the lay of the land. Find out who s unhappy, then go to them and ask open questions about what s bugging them. Then acknowledge the error and fix it. It might mean giving Jim s team bonuses (after having a few words with Jim about how he handled it), but in other instances you may be able to bring the ship aright with recognition: stand up in front of the group, admit you made an error, and recognize each player for his or her contribution.Financial rewards put a price on doing the right thing; recognition gives the same action value. I ll take value every day. In a healthy work culture, value should be the yardstick used to measure accomplishment and determine appropriate recognition.Related: One Excuse You Should Never Give Your EmployeesMeghan M.

/article/233073,5 Ways to Get More Respect at Work,Consider these tips if you want to be better respected at your job.," Respect your efforts, respect yourself.  Self-respect leads to self-discipline. When you have both firmly under your belt, that s real power.  Clint Eastwood.  Seemingly this formula worked well for Clint Eastwood in his career and if you want to be better respected at your job, it can work for you too.Take a moment to conjure up what work would be like if your colleagues, bosses, subordinates and clients treated you more respectfully.  Do you envision more money?  Do you envision more fulfilling relationships with these individuals?1. Define your values.
People follow strength and competency.  Think about what makes you a better, stronger person.  Write down those aspects you would like to move towards and a few things you would like to move away from.  Simply listing these items can provide tremendous momentum toward or away from each value.2. Discover your passion. 
It helps a great deal to get where you want to be if the you have passion for the actual journey it takes to reach your end goal. Passionate employees tend to deepen their involvement around the office and, thus gain a significant amount of respect and friendship from others.Related: Respect, Power, Family Pride: How Do You Define Success?3. Know your purpose. 
Corporate America is a tough place. It will lead you through twists, turns and disappointments.  If your purpose is, say, to service your clients better than any other firm, then keep your eye on the ball.  The resiliency and positive attitude will quickly be realized by those around you.4. Envision what the future is going to be like. 
Start to take some time and envision what it is going to be like when you do hit the pinnacle of getting more respect, friendship and success around the office.  Practice makes perfect.  To best achieve this, take a few deep breaths, get the negative thoughts out of your mind and begin to make it a mental reality.5. Stop monologuing and start taking interest. 
You ever notice that when you look at a picture with multiple people in it, you always look at yourself first? Human beings (inside the office, outside the office   wherever) are highly self-involved. They are flattered and respond better to you as a leader and an individual when you stop focusing on yourself and begin to take a genuine interest in them.Taking these steps isn t easy, but think of it as training yourself for a better life. There is a pertinent story I read a few weeks ago about a Navy Seal who, when he jumped out of an airplane, found that his parachute wouldn t open.He described what saved him and eventually got it opened was his extensive training, which allowed him to remain focused. It won t happen tomorrow or a week from now and maybe not even in a month, but with extensive training on yourself and your interaction with others, you will become better respected both professionally and personally.Related: How to Earn Your Employees' RespectKen SundheimKen Sundheim is the CEO of KAS Placement Sales and Marketing Recruiters, a sales and marketing recruiting firm specializing in staffing business development and marketing professionals around the U.S. Ken has been published in For...Read more",Take It From The Pros,2014-05-02 15:00:00

Here is the recipe for his dream lineup:No. 1: The prima donna genius I think it s commonly accepted in a tech startup that you better have someone with technical knowledge,  says Schoner.  You want to have someone be able to lead the technical agenda of the team. No. 2: The leaderTypically the CEO, Schoner says it s important to have one person calling the shots. For larger founder teams   It can get very tricky if there are five opinions and all have equal weight. Democracy is great, but not in a startup,  says Choner.  The leader or CEO doesn t always need to be right, but if [he or she] is a leader figure that others can look up to, then that s a good thing. No. 3: Industry veteranSchoner says this person is often missing in younger startup teams, but he stresses the importance of having someone on staff who has been around the block. Someone who really knows the industry can be of extreme value. They re not just going for what s cool or new. They really have the experience to understand what s needed in a particular industry,  says Schoner.Related: The next big thing in techNo. 4: The sales animal The sales animal is the person who knows not just the technology, but also knows how to sell it to a customer,  says Schoner, who says young technologists often miss the value of having a sales expert on-board.  When we are trying to have someone pay money, it s not about the technology   it s about the value we can provide to the customer. No. 5: The superstarThe superstar may also be the tech genius or the CEO, says Schoner, but he or she is the person who can rally people around the company. That s the guy to build your marketing strategy around. He s the guy you want to send to conferences and industry meetings,  says Schoner.No. 6: The financial guruEspecially when you haven t yet brought a product to market, it s important to keep track of costs. Having the financial personality is important. You want someone who has enough ability to handle numbers,  says Schoner. However, if you re not yet at the stage where you can support a staff of six, Schoner says you can leave this person off the list   as long as someone else on the team has a good sense of money management.Related: A frothy view on tech venture capitalMore from FOX BUSINESSEurope orders France, Belgium to end port tax breaksUS weekly requests for jobless aid up 10K, to 244,000US applications for unemployment benefits rose by 10,000 to 244,000 last weekGabrielle KarolGabrielle Karol is Web reporter @FOXBusiness covering technology, startups and more.Read more",Inspiring Your Team,2014-04-28 16:00:00

Recall that 79 percent of startups fail to see their 10-year anniversaries, according to StatisticBrain.com. If you want people to immerse themselves in the business, to take it home with them and work on and improve for the next day, then you should be the first one in the office and the last one to leave.Analyze, but be ready to adapt. Due diligence is important, but all the data in the world can t protect your business from the unknown unknowns that Murphy likes to spring on us. Smart leaders understand that not all the facts are present come decision time, which is why ad-hoc solutions are sometimes better than no solutions (which is sometimes a solution in itself).Adopt an attitude of service. In the SEAL Teams, one s reputation is partially determined by the order of priorities to which he adheres. Namely, if he is one of those people who places himself first ahead of others, then a quick attitude adjustment is needed -- and typically made by other teammates. The order of priority in the teams -- and in business, for that matter -- should work from the outside in, large to small: mission, team, me. Placing others before self has a contagious effect that spreads outward.Culture fit is everything, and good leaders build a following because of who they are and what they stand for.

After a 54-28 season last year, Woodson s Knicks finished this season at 37-45.Gone are the days of the five-year plan, it's more like the five-minute plan now. Sports are a microcosm of society and today you are seeing less visionary leadership and more reactionary management.

The average apple tree will usually yield a harvest that can fill about 20 bushels, weighing about 42 pounds each. Yet the interesting thing is that apple trees often take up to four or five years to produce their first harvest. Those same trees, once they become productive, will produce fruit for 30 to 40 years and can live more than 80 years.""Not everything that can be counted counts and not everything that counts can be counted."" -- Albert EinsteinAs a leader, you're a lot like a farmer. You can count the number of employees in your business but you cannot immediately count the amount of business that will come from one employee. Over time one employee can mature into a leader, a sales pro or an ambassador for your brand who will impact hundreds of thousands or perhaps even millions of people over their career. Like an apple seed, their harvest is often immeasurable. The average tenure of an employee at a company is just 4.6 years, according to bureau of labor statistics.In his six-year tenure as head coach of the Atlanta Hawks, Woodson took the team from 13 wins in 2004-05 to 53 wins and a conference semifinal appearance in 2009-10.

Once he won his first, he proceeded to win nine out of the next 11 NCAA titles.We live in a society where for many leaders, if the results aren't instant they give up on the process.

/article/233022,4 Secrets to Firing Your First Employee,"Know the rules, provide evidence and conduct the termination in a thoughtful and caring manner.","It's never easy to fire an employee, especially the first time.The process can play out as a quick version of the five stages of grief. At first the employee might be in complete denial. This fairly quickly turns to anger -- directed at the messenger. Then comes the pleading: The employee promises to do whatever is needed to keep the job. This may be followed by sadness, often manifested in crying. And finally, the conversation ends with some level of acceptance, hopefully.Related: 10 Questions to Ask Yourself Before Letting an Employee GoThe first time I fired someone, the employee was simply not meeting deadlines. She was extremely talented, which caused me to ignore the problem at first.I decided to speak with her to try to find a solution. I really wanted to help her because of her talents. Then we had another chat -- and another. Nothing worked.When a client complained about the missed deadlines and other inefficiencies, I knew the woman had to be fired. I had given her more than enough time to improve and plenty of suggestions.My decision was difficult because I tend to become very emotionally invested in my employees. I deeply care about their success and do my best so they feel like a part of my team.Firing people never gets any easier, but the first time can be the worst, especially if someone is one of a startup s initial employees. Here are some ways to the process go a little smoother:Related: How to Let Go of Employees With Love and Dignity1. When is it appropriate to fire an employee? Be aware of fireable offenses. Illegal activities, such as theft, lying, fraud or assault, can serve as grounds for firing. When accusing an employee of such an offense, be sure you have evidence to back it up.Performance-related offenses can also be cause for termination. If an employee has consistently failed to meet deadlines and follow through with projects, this is a reason to let him or her go. Just remember to first provide the employee sufficient amount of time for possible improvement and action-based steps to do so.Sometimes interpersonal reasons, such as failing to communicate effectively, having an inability to connect and get along with peers or refusing to cooperate with management, can trigger a termination.  Related: Should You Fire an Employee Who Lies?2. Understand the legal rules. Avoid a lawsuit at all costs. Although lawsuits are sometimes inevitable, follow all the rules to ensure you've used good judgment when firing someone.Understand your state's ""at-will"" employment policy. According to the U.S. Small Business Administration, every state (except Montana) can adopt an ""at-will"" employment policy, enabling an employer to fire a worker anytime for any reason. The employee's contract, though, might contradict a state's employment policy. So check the language.  Understand when it's illegal to fire someone to avoid a wrongful termination lawsuit. Employees can't be terminated because of factors like age, gender, sexual orientation and religion, whistle-blowing or taking off time for a medical or military leave. Related: Stop Delaying: 3 Surefire Ways to Do Employee Reviews Properly3. Make sure you have all the bases covered. The firing process should be thoughtful and respectful of the employee and transparent. It should never come as a surprise.  To ensure that a firing is justified, have it take place only after a series of performance reviews and meetings with the employee. Prepare documents to explain the termination decision to the employee. These should be culled from written records kept from every performance review and meeting with the employee. If the worker failed to improve, then the firing has come as the final step of the process. Figure out the logistics. The employee will have questions about the termination date, compensation, unemployment benefits such as unemployment insurance and the firing itself. Set exact dates for the termination and gather information from the human resources department that could be useful for the employee.  Related: Make the Firing Process Easier4. Break the news. Informing the employee of a firing is never easy. But never sugarcoat a termination. Although it s a difficult conversation to have, be 100 percent transparent. Tell the employee exactly why he or she needs to leave and provide the information he or she needs about the termination. Be sure to provide evidence of why the firing is happening. From a presentation of examples of a poor performance or failure to meet goals, the employee will learn why the termination was necessary. Give an employee the option to leave immediately. After the meeting, the employee probably won't want to stick around to pack up his or her belongings. Let the person come back in a few days for that purpose. Or offer to pack up the items and send them directly to the home.Losing a job is a traumatic experience. Listen intently and answer the employee's questions empathetically and thoughtfully. This conversation should clarify any issues before he or she leaves the company permanently. At the meeting's close, provide the option of talking with a human resources staffer about any further questions.Be prepared for repercussions. Don t expect the employee to like you after a termination. You are now the enemy, even if the firing occurred because of the employee's actions. Do your best to not react to the situation and remain calm.

/article/233281,4 Qualities of People With Autism That Could Benefit Your Business,"If you're seeking employees with intense focus and attention to detail, consider a candidate with autism.","The Israeli Defense Force s Satellite Intelligence Unit 9900 assigns autistic soldiers to monitor electronic combat maps for even the minutest changes. Their rare ability to focus for hours on end provides better results than non-autistic soldiers.Software powerhouse SAP is actively searching for people with autism for jobs that require high attention to detail such as software testing. It hopes to have people with autism make up one percent of their workforce by 2020.Related: For Autism Researcher, Yankee Stadium is Field of DreamsWhile one in 68 children in America is somewhere on the autism spectrum, only 53 percent of young adults with autism are gainfully employed. Those with autism have skills, creativity and unique ideas to contribute to the workforce. It s not about giving them simple jobs because you feel sorry for them or to meet diversity goals, it s about hiring them because they truly meet a business need in your company and possess the right skills to excel in their job.Here are the specific qualities that people with autism have that can benefit your business and productivity:1. Intense focus comes naturally to them. Autistic people s intensity can be an asset that helps them focus on the task at hand. For example, autistic employee Trevor s extreme focusing ability allows him to wash huge piles of dishes quickly without stopping or complaining. His supervisor remarked that Trevor was  like a machine  and couldn t believe how hard and fast he worked. Trevor said the repetition was comforting to him and he just  plowed right through it. 2. They work when nobody is watching. When Trevor worked in maintenance, his coworkers commented that they always saw him doing heavy landscape work outside in the heat. Trevor didn t know anyone saw him, but he worked hard when alone, never slacking or resting. It was that focus and commitment to do whatever he was asked that made him a model employee.Related: Doing Good One T-Shirt at a Time3. Autistic individuals can bring enormous creativity. Autistic people s minds are wired differently, and their imaginations can be extreme. Managers should take advantage of this when looking for creative ideas or new ways to solve problems. If they give autistic team members opportunities to share their ideas, those ideas can lead to brilliant new concepts.4. Autistic employees  passions lead to productivity. Because autistic individuals usually have intense, specific interests, the best jobs are those that allow them to be involved with those interests. An employee who is perfectly suited to a position because of a passion results in a win-win situation. He will love working in his area of extensive knowledge and be hyper-focused and productive.
Not only should employers be aware of autistic employees  strengths, they should also learn about some of their challenges, and how to accommodate them for better productivity.People with autism need clear instructions so they know exactly what is expected of them, along with detailed job descriptions they can refer to often. They are literal thinkers, so language like  Be ready to start working at 9  works better than  Don t be late.  They are not less intelligent, but they process differently and are usually visual learners, so the clearer the instructions, the better.As leaders, creating an environment where high-functioning autistic employees can thrive is more than demonstrating social responsibility and diversity. It also yields the business results that entrepreneurs need to not just survive, but thrive.Excerpted from the book, Six-Word Lessons for Autism Friendly Workplaces, by Patty Pacelli.

/article/232901,3 Tips for Managing Crowdsourced Workers,Providing incentives and learning to listen can help managers maximize a crowdsourced workforce. ,"Crowdsourcing hiring is a cutting-edge way to scale a business but one that still presents certain traditional human resource challenges. Managing crowdsourced workers is an  operationally intensive  effort, says Ryan Frankel, chief executive officer and co-founder of VerbalizeIt in New York, a live, phone-based foreign-language translation service that relies on a community of 18,000 crowdsourced translators in 75 different countries. Frankel admits VerbalizeIt made some early missteps in managing its crowdsourced workforce, but learned valuable lessons about recruitment and retention along the way.Rethink recruitment. First off, VerbalizeIt over-recruited to meet the initial demand for its services after the company s February 2012 launch, says Frankel. VerbalizeIt found itself with too many translators who didn t have enough assignments to keep them busy. As a result, the idle translators were not as invested in the business as their busy counterparts and didn t bother to stay current on the company s policies and procedures, he explains.Frankel also realized that only about 20 to 30 percent of the candidates recruited actually passed the company s language and business knowledge proficiency tests. Recruiting and testing a large number of individuals who didn t pass the vetting process cost VerbalizeIt time and money, he notes.VerbalizeIt adjusted its recruiting strategy and now focuses on referrals from existing translators. The referring translator receives a small percentage, about 1 to 3 percent, of the new hire s income, Frankel explains. The rewards add up for translators who keep referring high-quality candidates, he says. The candidate pool quickly improved and now 90 percent of those recruited pass the proficiency tests, says Frankel.Value workers  time. Because crowdsourced workers have the freedom to come and go as they like, providing added value helps retain talented workers, says Daniel Qu, chief executive officer and founder of Launchsite, a website design platform in San Diego launched last May.Launchsite, which maintains a pool of approximately 300 vetted website designers, offers clients three designers who compete to build a client s website by creating a sample page. The client chooses a designer with whom to work and Launchsite takes a percentage of the payment, Qu says.Importantly, the two designers who aren t chosen by the client get paid $50 for their effort, as long as it s rated highly enough by the client,  so the designers don t walk away with nothing,  Qu explains. Other crowdsourced web design sites don t limit the number of proposals submitted and don t pay the runners-up for their time, he points out.Tap into worker wisdom. Engaging service providers in the business is a fundamental part of managing a crowdsourced workforce, says Garrick Pohl, chief executive officer and founder of Zipments in New York, a delivery service that primarily relies on several hundred crowdsourced bicycle couriers. Zipments gets its couriers  input on everything from how to do their jobs more efficiently to what they wear to work.  If it doesn t work for the couriers, they just won t do it,  Pohl says.Zipments, which launched in 2012 and recently expanded to Chicago, broke into the well-established bicycle courier community in Manhattan by laying the groundwork for its recruitment efforts a year in advance, says Pohl. Zipments used social media to identify the influencers in the courier community and assembled a courier  think tank,  he explains.During lunch meetings, Pohl says he learned about what the couriers needed and wanted, and who would be most receptive to the company s collaborative delivery model. Pohl also makes sure he s always available for feedback by giving couriers his personal phone number and email address.  If you re not listening to the service providers, you re building your business on sand,  he says.Samantha DrakeSamantha Drake is a freelance writer and editor in the Philadelphia area who specializes in business, legal, environmental, and general interest issues.Read more",Human Resources,2014-04-23 14:00:00

/article/232851,The 3 Attributes to Look for in Top Talent,"When you find a candidate where these traits intersect, hire them, even if a position for them doesn't exist yet.","One of the things that great companies do is they hire the best people. These successful companies aren t afraid to recruit the best candidates from other organizations or pull talented people from other industries. There are three attributes that are most important to an organization when hiring: attitude, competency and mindset.Attitude. An employee has a passion for the organization and what it is trying to accomplish and is excited about being a part of the organization.Competency. An employee has the right skills and capabilities to do his or her job, or has the ability to learn the right skills.Mindset. An employee understands the value of collaborating with peers and comes to work every day looking for ways to improve the performance of the company and increasing the impact he or she can have.Related: Want to Avoid a Hiring Crisis? Follow These 4 Steps.See the visual below of my ACM Model that shows the perfect intersection of those three attributes:Here are the issues if your candidate doesn't fall into the sweet spot in the center:1. Good attitude and strong level of competence, but the wrong mindset. The candidate will be focused on his or her own goals and accomplishments and will not be willing to collaborate to improve the performance of the company unless it benefits them personally.2. Right competency and mindset, but the wrong attitude. The talent will leave because they have no loyalty for the organization or connection to what it is trying to accomplish.3. Preferred attitude and mindset, but a low level of competency. You will suffer productivity loss. Even though the employee might be a great person and have great energy and passion for the organization, they don t add any value because they don t have, and can t learn, the required skills.Related: 5 Attributes to Look for in High-Performing Employees4. The right mix of attitude, competency and mindset. With this mix, you achieve profit maximization. This happens because every employee you hire is adding value to the organization on a consistent basis.You ll notice that I didn t mention experience, and that is for good reason. When you find a great talent who is passionate about what your organization is doing, experience doesn t matter. Great people can decipher what they need to learn in order to be successful. Twenty five years in the same industry or with the same company is not necessarily a good thing. It s much harder to unlearn what you know then learn what you need to know.Even if you don t have a specific role in mind, when you find someone who has all three attributes, hire them. Find a role for them. You can create a new role if you need to because they will contribute tremendous value for your organization.However, if any one of the three attributes is missing, employees will not last very long with your organization. You will be hiring the wrong people for the wrong reasons. Integrate the search for these three attributes into your hiring process and you will attract better people and make better hiring decisions.If you want to know if your hiring efforts are yielding the right results, ask yourself this question,  Are we the company that people line up to work for or rush out the door to leave?

/article/233249,5 Inside Sales Hiring Tips for Growing Companies,Competition for all-star sales reps has never been fiercer. Adopt a winning strategy to build your team.,"If your company has recently tried to recruit inside sales talent, then you re probably already keenly aware that competition for all-star reps has never been fiercer.This is the result of a veritable explosion in inside sales hiring over recent years, motivated by data showing that inside (or remote) sales teams offer exponential returns compared with traditional outside sales teams. Great inside sales reps are therefore in high demand, and I ve seen many companies struggle to expand sales teams quickly while recruiting reps with the acumen necessary to hit quotas.If you find yourself in a situation where you need to quickly hire inside sales reps, it s important to adopt the right recruitment strategy. To that end, here's a collection of best practices.Related: 5 Things You Should Not Do When Hiring for Your Organization1. Don t hire a vice president of sales too soon. A lot of companies  first hire for the sales team is a vice president of sales, but this person rarely lasts 12 months. It s expected that this sales VP will single handedly expand the pipeline exponentially. But  a great sales vice president has to be much more than a good salesperson. He or she has to be a great manager who needs to know how to recruit the right talent, roll out the right strategies and coach reps to attain success. Recruiting the perfect vice president of sales for your company can be a long process; I ve seen it take more than a year.While a company is looking for the right sales vice president, it often makes sense for founders to lead initial sales efforts. Founders can simultaneously hone their pitch while acquiring valuable information from customers that helps them swiftly achieve a product-market fit. Then recruit account executives with a bit less experience, as well as dedicated prospectors and lead response reps to create opportunities for your closers.Related: How to Really Listen to Your Customers2. Hire great listeners. Being able to pitch well doesn t necessarily make a sales rep great. The best inside sales reps are terrific at listening to prospects  pain points and understanding them before launching into a sales pitch. That means that often the best sales reps are the ones who talk the least. As a litmus test, see if reps just talk about themselves during an interview or if they ask questions and listen intently to your answers.3. Find reps who thrive on competition. One of the most important things to look for when hiring new reps is the will to win. According to Jeremy Turpen, a top recruiter at Wavestaff,  It's important to identify what's really motivating your candidate. It's not always money. Successful inside salespeople often have a strong desire to be a top performer, have a large impact at their company or realize the potential for career growth. In other words -- to win.  Given this, it s no surprise that some of the best sales reps are former athletes.Related: Is Competition a Catalyst for Innovation?4. Hire reps with industry-specific experience. The common logic is that a great salesperson can sell anything. With enough time, that may very well be true. But time is not a luxury that most companies have when setting up a new inside-sales rep team. If you want to ramp up reps quickly, recruit salespeople who have already sold products or services similar to those you offer. A rep might sell cars better than anyone on Earth, but that doesn t mean she can walk into a business-to-business software company and start closing deals right away. Find someone who really understands your industry.5. Build a working sales process before scaling up the size of the team. I always caution clients to try to build a working sales process prior to increasing the staff. In Predictable Revenue, Aaron Ross describes how at Salesforce, he built and perfected a new process prior to adding to his team. The results were $100 million in recurring revenue, a figure that might not have been attained if he had scaled up too soon. If you can, start small and try to find sales processes that work. Understand the composition of your customer base and how to effectively address consumers  pain points. When you know what works, then you can step on the gas.

/article/233223,The 3 Qualities of First-Wave Employees,The first hires for any startup are the most important. Here's what to look for.,"There s a lot of emphasis, rightfully so, on the significance of a startup s first round of hires; these employees are often referred to as  first wavers,  but I prefer to think of them as the company s  Navy SEALs.  These are the people whom you re going to want around for a long time, whom you re going to trust with significant assignments, and whom you ll need to call upon and rely on in times of great need.In order to understand what entrepreneurs should look for in their first wave of hires, I think it s important to first define what I mean by a  startup,  and then to try to understand the psychology of individuals who are attracted to this kind of entity. The term  startup  is a very general one, so let s refine it a bit: I m using the term to mean a business that is literally just getting started. There is no or little revenue. There is the founder and maybe one other co-founder or employee. Often, there is no physical location for the business yet.In my experience, I have found that the people who are willing to join these types of ventures are not  business people  in the typical sense of the word. (Side note: It s important to keep in mind that these are general impressions and they don t always apply.) They tend to be dreamers or idealists; they have almost artistic inclinations. I imagine they are the same types of people who would join a political revolt or new church or new club.Related: 3 Lessons Learned in Hiring the Wrong PersonIn my businesses, these people have often been college students or people waiting for graduate school admission, but they could also be scientists, engineers, or artists. Since they are not paid well, by necessity, the vision and mission of the company is much more important to them than compensation. This is not to say that they are na ve, but they are driven by things other than money. They tend to mirror, in a lot of ways, the entrepreneurial mindset. To borrow from Tolkien, they are a Took, not a Baggins; they are looking for an adventure. For this reason, the best entrepreneurs truly do have a strong vision and mission that they can communicate to their first employees.Below I ve listed what have been a few common  cuts  for my Navy SEALs over the years, the qualities I look for in first wavers; please keep in mind that these are personal preferences:1. I have found that the best Navy Seals are people who are strong multi-taskers and less aware of what they cannot do. I prefer liberal arts majors because, in general, I believe they re taught to think in non-linear ways. You need your Navy SEALs to be, in many ways, unreasonable in their expectations of themselves and those around them. In order to succeed in the early stages of entrepreneurship, you need people on your team who aren t afraid to do exceptional things; you need people who are not aware of their own supposed limitations (or at least as unaware as possible).2. I look for people who have worked very hard at one thing in their life. Maybe they have excelled at it, maybe they have not; that s not particularly important to me. But, I look for something that they were really passionate about for an extended period of time. Passion is a learned attribute, in my opinion. When I played football as a young person, I was very passionate about it for an extended period of time (although, I missed the fine print that the University of Alabama wasn t looking for receivers who ran a 40 yard dash in 4.9 seconds). I think you learn a lot from a singular commitment and vision, and these lessons are very valuable when working at a company that is trying to get off the ground.Related: The 3 Hires I Wish I Made Sooner3. I look for people who are very real, practical, and clear. This is a very difficult one to quantify, and it s difficult to gauge this one by looking at a resume or past experience. I look for people who don t rely on canned phrases, and who aren t afraid to voice their opinion. Your Navy SEALs are going to play a crucial role, again by necessity, in virtually all aspects of your company, whether it s operations or overall strategy. You need them to be not only smart and driven, but also vocal and unafraid to disagree with you. In this way,  yes  men and women are not the best first-wavers.Interestingly enough, my ideal Navy SEAL might be someone who many  normal  people might view as a misfit. Trained business people often try to apply a fixed construct to the analysis of prospective employees; by doing this, I believe you might miss the kinds of people I m describing, who are the necessary jewels to the development of the company. Over the past twenty years, as entrepreneurship has become more of a mainstream phenomenon, it seems as if more MBAs are starting businesses. I wonder how effective it would be to apply hiring principles learned through an MBA curriculum to the hiring process for a start-up. As someone who received an MBA, I doubt these tactics would be particularly effective. Now this isn t to say that you should list  misfit  as a criterion for a first wave hire. However, I would definitely look for idealistic, passionate individuals as my Navy Seals, and I d place this passion and non-linear way of thinking at a higher premium than some of the more traditional qualities one might look for in a hire.Related: The Hardest Jobs to Fill For Entrepreneurs Are the Most ImportantBrian HamiltonBrian Hamilton is the chairman and co-founder of Sageworks.

/article/233212,Hiring Advice for Startups: What You Need to Know ,"For entrepreneurs, hiring is an essential function for their startup. A bad hire can lead to major headaches, while an amazing addition can help propel a company to the next level. ","Most business owners don t do a good job hiring new employees the first time. They often wait too long or hire somebody without the necessary skills to help their business move forward. Both situations can end up being a costly mistake and could potentially lead to failure. Thus, learning how to create a strategic and sustainable hiring system is imperative to the growth (and longevity) of your business.To make sure you avoid the common pitfalls of the hiring process, be sure to keep the following pieces of advice in mind.You really do need a team. Don t try to do it all. Many entrepreneurs take on a  do-it-all  mentality that can be detrimental to business. You may think you can save money by doing everything yourself but that s rarely the case. Instead, this will often result in poor quality of work because you spread yourself too thin.Hiring people to maintain your business is necessary so that you can concentrate on the bigger picture and continue to do a quality job. Don t let your work suffer by trying to take on too much responsibility or an unrealistic amount of tasks to accomplish.Related: 3 Lessons Learned From Hiring the Wrong PersonKnow your weak spots.  Figuring out where you need help is one of the first steps in hiring a new employee. Decide what her job will be and assign her tasks that aren t your strong suits. For instance, if bookkeeping isn t your forte, find someone who is good at bookkeeping and have them do it for you.But keep in mind, matching an employee s skills with her job is crucial. One survey by Robert Half showed that out of 1,400 executives, 36 percent said the main reason for failed hires was a poor skills match.Be aware of local employment laws and regulations. As an entrepreneur, you should know the legal requirements of hiring a new employee. Laws vary by country or state, so it s important to understand the laws where your business is based.For example, in the U.S., employers have to consider federal laws such as The Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 and the Family Medical Leave Act of 1993. To be sure you re following employment laws in your jurisdiction, consult with a lawyer before making your first hire.Related: The 3 Hires I Wish I'd Made SoonerTake time to check candidates. Hiring people can take a lot off of your mind and allow you to focus on growing your business. But before delegating work to new hires, be sure to double check the information on their application. Indeed, 34 percent of application forms have been found to contain lies ranging from amount of experience to education and the ability to do certain job functions, according to Profiles International.Keep your company culture in mind. Before hiring a new employee, consider whether or not they ll be a good fit for your company and if they ll work well with other employees. The last thing you want is to have an unproductive group of people who don t work well together.Keep 'em' happy. Many entrepreneurs will say their number-one asset is their team. So make sure they are content with their job. Keep them engaged, involved and don't overwork your employees. Sixty-nine percent of employees say work is a significant source of stress, according to the American Psychological Association. When there are too many jobs to do, things might start falling through the cracks and the quality of work will be undermined.  Or worse, they might leave. Keep in mind, 75 percent of the demand for new workers is to replace workers that resigned from their jobs, according to TK.Use independent contractors for infrequent work. If you don t have the resources to hire a full-time employee, then hiring an independent contractor is a great alternative. And then are so many options.  According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, there are more than 10 million independent contractors, which is about 7.4 percent of the whole workforce.Although hiring independent contractors is not a universal remedy, it can be beneficial for certain jobs, especially temporary work.

/article/232739,What Avon and Tough Mudder Can Teach You About the New Economy,Three traits that social entrepreneurs and purpose-driven organizations need to thrive. ,"Shifts in public desire are changing what we buy, how we buy it, from whom and why. These shifts are giving rise to new breeds of organizations, products, relationships and services that discover innovative approaches to prioritize purpose in people s lives while often addressing the most intractable social and environmental problems.Organizations that are thriving in the new purpose-driven economy integrate at least one of three methods into their enterprise. Companies that master these traits, such as the three below, will be better able to navigate changes in labor market needs and consumer priorities.The Purpose Economy (April 2014)1) Delivering purpose to customers, consumers, or participants
Harvard MBA Will Dean founded Tough Mudder and has built a rapidly growing business out of extreme obstacle courses  designed to test your all-around strength, stamina, mental grit, and camaraderie.  These courses push people to face their fears as they make their way through mud, fire, ice water, and 10,000 volts of electricity. Over a million people around the globe have participated in these obstacle courses and have found the experience of training and participating to be one of powerful personal growth.Tough Mudder was intentionally designed not as a race, but as a team challenge. People typically sign up with friends and support each other throughout the training and the actual event. It is part of the Tough Mudder pledge to  put teamwork and camaraderie before course time.  This makes the process social, and in making the success of their peers part of their goal, the participants, or  Mudders,  gain a sense of service. In so doing, Tough Mudder provides Mudders with personal and social purpose. Purpose is their service and their value proposition to customers.2) Providing purpose to employeesMore than a century ago, Avon was founded to create  a means for women to earn their own money at a time when not many women worked outside the home,  connecting women who would otherwise be isolated. Avon was critical to building female independence in the economy and giving women a source of purpose. It has come a long way since then but has retained its core vision of empowering women through work.3) Building purpose throughout the supply chain.

/article/233074,Stop Delaying: 3 Surefire Ways to Do Employee Reviews Properly,Performance evaluations are critical. They can engage employees deeply to deliver their best effort to a company.,"The delivery of employee performance reviews is one of the most common objects of procrastination among managers. Even in organizations that promote clear timelines and expectations for  leaders, delayed feedback is not only frequent but it often creates collateral damage that is hard to see but that nonetheless affects future employee engagement and contribution.This is because performance reviews are tied in to  critical moments  in an employee s experience. These interactions have the potential to shift the trajectory of individuals' working lives. A successful review can set the tone for a positive outlook on work whereby employees -- validated for the quality of their ongoing performance and contribution -- can engage deeply with the organization and deliver their best effort. Reviews that go sideways can leave employees feeling wounded, resentful and willing to do only the minimum until something better comes along.If you have delayed or postponed an employee review, it's not too late to get things back on track and make the most of this critical moment. To avoid compounding issues that may already be accumulating, here are three strategies for you to tackle overdue performance reviews and do them well.Related: 5 Keys to Engaging Performance Reviews1. Simplify your game plan. Managers often delay feedback because they are unclear about how to start. To get moving, simplify your game plan and stick with that course of action. Every game plan begins with an overall objective and the goal of a performance review is to understand an employee's challenges in completing good work. Remove obstacles and support the staffer's efforts to achieve the identified performance outcome and confirm that his or her skills and contributions are aligned with the team s highest priorities.With this core objective in mind, your game plan should also address the following:a. Establish a supportive, trust-based relationship that reinforces  the mutual agenda  whereby an individual's focus and skill are aligned with the organization's goals.b. Provide clear, specific feedback to the employee about the things he or she is doing well and areas requiring further improvement;c. Communicate directly and honestly about what's expected, as well as the consequences of failure to deliver on expectations.d. Document relevant expectations and areas of accountability in objective, clear writing.Related: How Well Are Managers Really Evaluating Their Employees? (Infographic)2. Just make the time. The excuse of  not having enough time  is a worn-out defense that says more about a manager s priorities than the volume of his or her workload. What managers fail to realize is that employees quietly interpret unspoken reasons and draw their own conclusions about the possible implications. Right or wrong, certain comments might prompt employees to make assumptions.For example,  I just don t have the time to do your review; remind me when things settle down"" could lead to this translation: ""You just don t matter that much and now it is your responsibility to follow up."" Why don t you go ahead and write it up, then we ll sit down and discuss it could be translated as: ""I m not engaged enough to know what you're really doing and I won t take the time to figure it out.""These translations are not extreme. When an employee is aware of an overdue performance review, there is often heightened sensitivity and tension as the staffer intensifies a search for clues about his or her status. When managers delay or avoid the topic, the unrest escalates as the employee is left to rely on his or her perceptive filters to interpret what the manager may be thinking.Related: 10 Reasons to Scrap Year-End Performance Reviews3. Pull no punches. With a solid game plan and firm time commitment, the final step is to establish a level of candor and truth telling so an honest and productive exchange can result via the performance review process. In many cases, managers pull their punches because they don t want to deliver something that would lead to undesirable scenarios.This is understandable because some feedback can be really hard to deliver. Speaking the truth, however, does not require a manager to deliver a jab. And while glossing over the tough stuff may seem like the easier path in the short term, it creates a barrier to sharing the honest feedback that employees need (and usually want) to hear. To initiate a higher level of transparent communication, managers can take the following steps:a. Refer directly to concrete behaviors and outcomes, without personalized judgment.b. Give equal weight to moments of positive performance that occurred early in the year, as well as recently.c. Balance highs and lows by delivering feedback on subtler aspects of performance, not just the glaring topics.d. Acknowledge accomplishments by describing the importance and impact they have.e. Provide challenge areas for an employee to improve upon and give context about why they matter.f. Make the feedback go both ways by seeking the employee s perspective on his or her performance.Following these three strategies will produce an open exchange of feedback that can immediately end the cycle of frustration and negative assumptions about why the review was delayed. By returning the employee to the center of attention and recognizing performance successes and gaps, managers can leverage a vital platform for accelerating individual, team and organizational performance.Related: Avoid Costly Churn.

/article/233026,Hourly Job Seekers Bypass Logging Into Social Network on Applications,"Despite the time saving promise, job seekers may avoid linking their personal accounts due to privacy concerns.","Dated technologies, manual processes, socioeconomic realities of workers and the surge of the mobile web have created a recruitment crisis that costs corporate America and the overall U.S. economy at least $340 billion.The crisis is especially pronounced in the hourly jobs market, which represents nearly two-thirds of the U.S. workforce, with 75 million workers and more than 100 million hired a year.Companies using manual processes and dated technologies devote over 1 billion hours, at a cost of more than $30 billion, to handle an excess of 1 billion job applications for hourly jobs. This tally does not include the total costs for recruiting, onboarding and retaining hourly workers.One might think that social networks could be part of the solution. But that's not the case.Related: How to Hire Without Spending a Fortune. (Hint: Use Social Media.)Reluctance to use social network profiles. Over the last nine months my company, Jobaline.com, processed thousands of employment applications in the hourly jobs marketplace and also conducted extensive research of the applicants. Given the opportunity, 90 percent of the applicants chose to not associate their social-network profile or log-in credentials with any job-seeking activity. Even when social-network authentication saves them two or three steps, 90 percent of the applicants opted out and selected the longer process.We also surveyed a random and balanced sample of more than 250 applicants in three different states who had applied for jobs in the hospitality, retail, transportation manufacturing and construction industries. The overwhelming majority didn't want to associate their social-network account with anything related to employment, due to a fear or invasion of privacy. Regardless of how well we explained that social-network log-ins are used as a mechanism for authentication and to simplify the application process, participants still refused.Our findings resembled those of a thought-provoking North Carolina State University study published last year,  Examining Applicant Reactions to the Use of Social Networking Websites in Pre-Employment,  which studied the practice of using information from social networks, in a clandestine or open way, to prescreen applicants. The resesarch showed that applicants felt their privacy was violated, resulting in decreased attraction to employers and increased intention to litigate, regardless of the employer's decision to hire the applicant or not.Wish for privacy. The North Carolina State researchers offered the possible explanation that the results could be related to applicants' view of social networks as a personal space separate from the work environment.My company's research suggested that 9 of every 10 job applicants surveyed don't know most of their  friends  well enough to be confident using their social network when job seeking. The overwhelming majority of job seekers surveyed felt that judging them based on their social-network profile is like assessing them based on a group of people with the same movie preferences.Beyond the potential negative impact on the employer's brand, the effectiveness of social recruiting in the hourly-jobs space is very low.Related: Not Using Big Data for Hiring?

Jobaline.com conducts thousands of multichannel comparisons a day, and job ads on social networks have the lowest click-through rates as compared to other channels, such job boards, TV or employers' career websites.Plus, the conversion rates for social networks are 25 times lower than those of other online and offline channels in the hourly-jobs space. As a result, companies are spending unnecessary money to generate job awareness, which results in high applicant-acquisition costs. In this segment, people love their social-network engagement, but it is a separate personal space.Applicant prescreening is a valid activity. It's a way to be sure an individual is a good fit for an organization. But looking at an applicant's social-network activity in a clandestine or open way or using social networks as sourcing tools clearly aren't the best options.

/article/232980,The 3 Hires I Wish I'd Made Sooner,Here are the commonly overlooked positions that will help you smooth out operations at and help grow your company.,"When you are starting a business, you want to build a team of highly motivated, creative people who work well together. But there are also questions about which functions to fill positions for -- and when.Much of the initial hiring effort goes into the product team -- in our case, early on that meant engineers and designers. You are, after all, moving from an idea to bringing a product or service to market, and the faster your team perfects and launches a product, the sooner you can start generating revenue, attracting new investors and growing your business.Related: Not Using Big Data for Hiring? You May Be Missing Out on the Best Candidates.In my years in private equity investing and as the founder and CEO of an equity crowdfunding site, I have seen many young, fast-growing companies go through the phase of rapid hiring with mixed results. Often overlooked in the rush to market are several key roles. Here are three hires any entrepreneur should make early and wisely:1. Product manager. Founders almost always have a product in mind, and they typically designed it or are at least intimately involved in the design and development. This makes perfect sense in the early days and months of a business when it is evolving from just an idea on a napkin to an actual product -- whether that product is an online marketplace dependent on code or an organic ice cream dependent on cacao.Steve Jobs, Larry Ellison, Mark Zuckerberg -- many of the great CEOs and founders have been consummate product people. But at some point early in a company s development the founder/CEO has to fire himself/herself as product manager. The founder who remains deeply enmeshed in product management is probably not devoting the necessary time and energy to the many other critical tasks required to build a successful company, such as sales and marketing, regulatory issues, production and distribution and investor relations.Find a product manager early on who can be the bridge between the CEO s vision and objectives and the development of the products to reach those goals.When it comes to the nuts and bolts of recruiting a great product manager, one of the best pieces I ve seen was from former Google Product Manager and current Google Ventures Partner Ken Norton: How to hire a product manager. (disclosure: Ken is a mentor of mine and GV is an investor in CircleUp). The first step towards hiring a product manager? Firing yourself.2. Office manager. Many young entrepreneurs underestimate the value of an office manager. They see the role narrowly -- focused on taking phone messages, greeting visitors and ordering lunches. Nothing could be further from the truth.Related: Create a Culture of Engagement With These 7 MeasuresMore than almost anyone else, this employee can set the tone for the office, and create a vibe that cultivates talent and joy. Starting a business involves strategy, product development, hiring, marketing and investor relations on one hand, and on the other executing on the day-to-day tasks required to keep your growing team happy and motivated. What your office manager cannot do will typically fall to you as the founder.A great office manager makes your company better and more valuable. To put it simply, after reaching 10 to 15 employees, I don t think you can have a great company without a great office manager.3. Regulatory lead. Also important, but for very different reasons, is someone to steer your business through the myriad regulatory matters that will invariably crop up. This role is frequently an attorney, either on staff or at an outside firm. A young company may not have the resources for a full-time manager of regulatory affairs, but you should have access to the firepower you need. Browse recent headlines and you quickly realize that regulatory matters can range from federal laws to state regulatory roadblocks, such as Tesla s battles over laws protecting auto dealerships, to local ordinances, such as cities imposing limits on Uber, Lyft and Sidecar.Disruptive business models, such as online marketplaces, are prone to attract the attention of politicians and regulators, frequently stirred up by entrenched competitors.Just as a startup should have a business continuity plan to account for potential disruptions or crises, you should do a genuine evaluation of real and potential regulatory risks that your business could face. From that assessment, you should invest sooner rather than later in the appropriate regulatory resources. If you don t fill the role of regulatory lead, you could find these matters sucking up internal resources at points when you least expect it.Every startup is unique, and every growth story has a different trajectory, but from my experience, I would say these roles are three of the most commonly overlooked in the process of building out an effective team. Fill them early and with superstars, and you ll smooth the day-to-day operations of your business, avoid disruptions in the future and be able to focus more effectively on growing your company.Related: 5 Attributes to Look for in High-Performing EmployeesRyan CaldbeckRyan Caldbeck is the founder of San Francisco-based CircleUp, which provides an online investing marketplace that supports direct equity investments from individual investors into privately held consumer and retail companies.

","As is the way of the internet, no sooner had David Letterman announced his retirement last week, then did lists of his possible replacements (Top 10 lists, naturally) start appearing online.It came as somewhat of a surprise today when CBS ended the conjecture with a swift announcement of his successor.

/article/232780,Not Using Big Data for Hiring? You May Be Missing Out on the Best Candidates.,"Small employers can use computers and software to objectively evaluate job seekers based on skills, experience and knowledge before an interview -- and remove bias from the process.","According to a survey by Silicon Valley Bank, 90 percent of startups believe finding talent is their biggest challenge. Yet, a solution to this problem could lie with Big Data -- massive amounts of structured and unstructured data that's difficult to process using traditional techniques.Over the last decade, human resources departments and hiring managers around the world have analyzed Big Data for insights related to their recruiting. Huge corporations such as Xerox and Google have done this to cut employee turnover in half and hire the best talent.Related: How to Hire Someone Aligned With the Company's MissionAlthough thus far larger companies with big hiring budgets are using Big Data, startups and smaller companies can too.What s the big deal with Big Data? Previously employers have relied on assessments such as IQ tests, skills aptitude tests and even physical exams to answer questions like ""Should Sarah be promoted?"" or ""Is it time to fire Bill?"" But in recent years, Big Data has become the new approach for scientific hiring, allowing recruiters to ask questions like ""Will Joe be the best fit for this position?""Companies like Xerox have used Big Data to measure how long candidates stay at their jobs. The tech firm screened candidates on criteria unrelated to productivity or retention. When Xerox asked job seekers questions about the distance between home and work, it found a strong association with employee retention and engagement.Many HR departments and C-suite managers wrongly assume that Big Data's role is to determine if an employee should be let go or could perform better in another position. But employers can use computers and software to objectively evaluate a candidate based on skills, experience and knowledge before an interview -- and remove bias from the process.Consider a candidate whose resume displays a history of job hopping. A recruiter's initial thinking might be that this person lacks loyalty to employers. Yet research tapping Big Data has found that frequent job changers did not perform any better or worse than those with long-term employment. Fine-tuning the right approach. Employers must select the right tools to be able to ask better questions when hiring. Choosing the right data tool is like choosing the right social media platform; employers need to know what works best for accomplishing their specific goals.One approach might be mining statistical data and predicting results based on the analysis. Job boards collect huge amounts of data, such as the best day of the week to post a marketing position in Chicago. If an analysis of current efforts revealed that a posting wasn t resulting in enough qualified applicants, the employer could adjust the hiring strategy accordingly, using insights provided by a job board such as choosing a better day to post or different keywords. Additionally most job boards allow employers to tag parts of a job listing providing important information. This, in turn, allows human resources professionals to target sources (websites and social media) that could bring increased traffic to the job listing.Related: Gamification Tapped by Some Employers to Recruit CandidatesHere are some tips for small companies considering tapping Big Data when they recruit candidates:1. Create a consistent rubric for the hiring process. While Big Data has been used to gamify the application process, forcing candidates to play games so their abilities can be assessed, this focus can overlook talent.Fashion a consistent rubric for the hiring process by focusing on the goals you hope to achieve. Determine a position's description, the qualifications desired, the company's culture and how a candidate might fit in.Next, design a consistent strategy for every job interview: Guarantee that every candidate is asked the same questions, performs the same tests and is given an equal opportunity to excel.2. Tweak the candidate-screening criteria. Most employers use variables such as grade-point averages, work history and degrees to determine whether a candidate's fit. Although attention to such criteria can help winnow a pile of applications, they might not be the best measures. When screening a candidate consider the happiness level and how well a person interacts with others. Studies show that happy employees are more likely to be engaged at work.Because the happiness quotient and how well a person interacts with others are not measured during the typical hiring process,employers are unlikely to have a database already containing this information; it's certainly not a field in any applicant tracking system I've ever come across. But by tweaking a candidate-screening process to measure this type of data, employers can build a database of information based on desirable personality traits rather than skills and experience alone. Related: How to Hire Without Spending a Fortune. (Hint: Use Social Media.)3. Combine social media with Big Data. Today's job seeker is typically connected to social networks, which provides a wealth of data. Companies are using platforms such as TalentBin to sift through social data collected from Facebook, Google+, LinkedIn and Twitter. These platforms scrape data (like the keywords candidates are using in their social media posts) and turn it into usable information.These tools can help employers find talented candidates online, making their recruiting processes more efficient.Social media is also valuable for employers because job seekers generate information about their hunt every day. But the information is voluminous and difficult to analyze without help. Employers can understand applicants  behavior by monitoring click-throughs from social sites like Facebook and LinkedIn and analyzing when people share articles, apply for jobs and interact online to discern patterns over time.This can help employers discover where the most talented job seekers hang out online and a company can redirect its hiring strategy as needed.A company s online presence is critical to attracting new hires, so produce content such as company news, blog posts and videos to drive traffic to job postings. Managers can monitor how many job seekers visit  the company's website and determine the recruitment strategy's effectiveness.4. Don't overlook online forums. Check out industry-specific forums such as Stack Overflow, where professionals and experts gather to discuss a given industry.and share ideas. By monitoring online forums, employers can collect data for talent management purposes -- such as the number of votes that forum users have received for their contributions -- to spot confident and skilled talent. Recruiters will be able to assess potential candidates in real time and locate people who spark intelligent conversations about issues relevant to a company's  industry. Overall, online forums can provide a pool of data to refer to when recruiters are seeking candidate at the top of their game.

Didn't think so.,"OK, business owners, let's have a show of hands. How many of you pay the women who work for you less than the men for doing the same job?Anyone? Anyone? Of course not. For one thing, it's illegal. The Equal Pay Act in 1963 prohibited employers from paying less based on gender. More importantly, though, it is simply bad business sense. In a free market, companies rely on the quality of their workers to thrive. They need the best engineers, the best marketers, the best salespeople, the best managers and the best thinkers around them. Most are willing to pay top dollar for top talent. Gender plays no role in how much that paycheck is.Related: The Myth of the Have-NotsAnd yet we continue to hear the business community criticized for the so-called gender pay gap. Women, we are told, make 77 cents for every dollar earned by a man. That gap is unfair and must be eradicated. To do that, we must punish businesses that pay someone less simply because of which restroom they use.The trouble is, that statistic isn't true and doesn't even take into account the realities of the workforce. You come up with that gap figure through the simplest of math. Take all the wages earned by men, then subtract all the wages earned by women, and -- voila! -- we have a gap.But there are plenty of reasons why that gap exists. There are differences in career paths, particularly when you see gender differences in college majors. Many women choose college majors that lead to professions that naturally pay less. Then there are life choices. Women have children and often take time off from their careers -- and earning ability -- to raise them. That doesn't mean that they lose out completely financially, either. There are ways to manage that process to ensure they don't lose ground in pay, but it is natural that people out of the workforce for a period of time, or who are working part-time, would make less.Related: Women, Are We to Blame for the Glass Ceiling?What we don't see, however, are businesses wilfully paying one gender less than another. Yet, the policy response is to punish business, not explore and accept the sociological underpinnings of any mythical gap. Take the political theater this week over the Paycheck Fairness Act, the Democrat-sponsored bill that would increase penalties for violations of the Equal Pay Act. Right now, employers can battle claims of unfair pay by citing factors other than gender for paying someone less money. The Paycheck Fairness Act, which was blocked by Republicans, would have required that employers use ""bona fide"" factors, like experience, to make their case. What is considered ""bona fide"" is narrowed, and takes away a lot of the hiring flexibility employers now have.Worse, the bill raises the financial stakes for the businesses, by allowing more damages in lawsuits and opening up these cases to class-action status. It is a boon for lawyers, and a cost nightmare for American companies of all sizes.The academic research into the pay gap is not turning up reams of evidence that the business community is intentionally paying women less, so why is there a need for more law and regulation targeting them? And, if there are real, sociological reasons for pay differences, is this even a gap worth minding?Of course not, but the debate is brought to you by the same people who say that businesses don't pay anyone enough, so we need to shame companies into raising wages, or, G-d help us, pass laws that require higher pay. All the while, we lose sight of the decisions the employees themselves, who are making choices in their lives and in the way they work that affect how they are compensated.Worst of all, we know that, despite historically high joblessness, many independent businesses are stuggling to find qualified candidates to fill their open positions. Entrepreneurs have problems building their teams. In many cases, pay is the least of their worries.Yet, these entrepreneurs and business managers are the ones getting the blame and facing the legal and regulatory risk.It's time to face facts. Most successful businesses pay fairly and pay people what they are worth. They are gender-blind, color-blind, religion-blind -- in fact, blind to everything but performance. When you work hard and work successfully, the pay follows. That is how the true free market regulates commerce. That's something men and women can surely agree upon.Related: How the New Obama Overtime Rules Will Squelch OpportunityRay HennesseyRay Hennessey, the former editorial director of Entrepreneur, is Chief Innovation Officer at JConnelly, an integrated communications firm in New York, and a senior advisor to Alley, a coworking community in Manhattan.

/article/232911,Create a Culture of Engagement With These 7 Measures,"To get your team's best work, you have to engage them. Here are steps you can take to get to that goal.","The most important thing for success is having a great and talented team. But it s not enough to hire your team and leave them to their job -- if you want their best work, you have to continuously engage.Figuring out how to do that sometimes feels more like art than science. One thing I find incredibly useful is to apply best practices and ideas from other industries to my own company. Here are some examples from the tech world on how to foster engagement, including some from my current company, MongoDB:1. Engagement starts with recruiting. Your company won t go anywhere unless you recruit and retain the right team. This should be your top priority, so interview someone every day. While a person s experience is important, having the right cultural fit is more valuable -- finding an intelligent candidate who understands the vision, has a ""roll-up-your-sleeves, let-me-at-it"" mentality and hits it off with the entire team is key.Related: How to Increase Productivity, Motivation and Engagement From Your Top Employees2. Less admin can mean more engagement. Netflix has pioneered some interesting ideas in the HR space over the years. Most of them have to do with eliminating administration -- basically, if you trust your employees enough to hire them, you should treat them like adults. Of course, this also works best if your team is excited to go to work! At MongoDB, we don't have set office hours, a set vacation maximum and or a set number of sick days they are allowed.We also make things simpler with expense reports using Expensify. Expense reporting shouldn't take employees away from their core responsibilities. Employees are provided with a flat stipend per diem for food when traveling, instead of asking them for itemization.3. Engagement is interactive. Get your people talking to each other -- often. This is one reason I am a big fan of  open-plan  office environments. They encourage interaction. I sit right in the middle of the team, and I enjoy the direct access it gives me to multiple spontaneous interactions that happen every day.Another tactic is to cater lunch. It doesn t have to be elaborate or daily. But once in a while, do it.  When the food shows up, everyone from different teams and departments will converge.4. A collaborative environment is an engaged one. Invest in your space -- but not just with money. Your space is crucial to creating a culture unique to your company, and it can be an attractive tool for your recruiters. We ve spent a lot of time evaluating what makes for a good office environment, and while it might be nice to play ping pong at the office, we asked: what would make the office a great place to get work done? In addition to the  open-plan  style I mentioned before, we wanted our space to be quiet so our engineers could concentrate.Because of this, we hired an acoustical engineer to consult during our buildout. We also looked into ergonomics and installed adjustable-height desks to allow people to sit or stand. The frequency that people stand or adjust them has been interesting, and we ve received great feedback.Related: Stopping Employees From Jumping Ship is Easier Than You Think (Infographic)Put a whiteboard in every conference room, and make it big. While whiteboards are nothing new, this is something that can be useful in any business to encourage innovation.5. Make engagement easy and use technology that is already available. There are a lot of new cloud-based ( software-as-a-service ) technologies that are helpful without any need to set up software or servers.Consider email. At MongoDB, we use Google Apps for email, making appointments and saving files. We also use videoconferencing or webinar software (Vidyo, Citrix or WebEx), so we can have regular  town hall  meetings with our offices around the world. There may be more elaborate technologies, with richer feature sets, but we find that when technology is easy, most people are happy to use it.6. Engagement through education. We re seeing significant interest from our employees in online education -- what is often referred to as  massive online open courses  (MOOCs). We ve built MongoDB University using the edX platform to not only help our community learn how to use our database, but to also onboard our staff internally. When people feel they are growing and learning in the job, they stay engaged.7. Transparency fosters engagement. Finally, communicate and be transparent with your team. If things are bad, tell them what s going wrong and how the challenge will be addressed. Try hard to over-communicate. For example, within a day or two after a board meeting, we have an all-company meeting to share key highlights that were shared with the board.These are just a few ideas that we have used to create a culture of engagement. It may seem like a daunting task to engage your employees while also working to ensure the success of your business, but it is absolutely crucial to spend significant time on both. What we see is the more engaged people are, the more dynamic, creative and productive they are. Try some of these in your organization -- you ll probably be surprised to see what a more engaged team is capable of achieving.Related: 7 Ways to Pump Up Employee Engagement In Your OfficeDwight MerrimanDwight Merriman is chairman and co-founder of MongoDB, the open-source document database.

/article/232830,Developers Are in High Demand. How Do You Recruit the Best?,These stalwarts of technology seek three big things when seeking employment.,"Software developers are in extreme demand across multiple industries. In many cities, there is major talent starvation. This painful dearth is making it exceedingly difficult to recruit and retain the team you need for success.Rarely will a business succeed today without a digital presence. If you're a small business, it's often the way a customer will first be introduced to your company. And, for many entrepreneurs, digital is at the core of their products.Right now, it's very much a seller's market. You need a strategy to recruit, hire and retain the right team. To best position yourself, you need to understand the mindset of a developer and what motivates him or her.Related: 7 Steps to Hiring the Perfect Mobile App DeveloperWhen I was younger, and needed less sleep, I was a web application developer. I would receive at least a call each week from some recruiter trying to lure me away from my stable corporate consulting gig. I d like to think it was due to my immense talents, but I think it s safe to say that the lack of developers in the market accounted for most of the aggressive recruiting practices. A lot of money was being thrown around in offers. Everyone wants money, but the best developers aren t in it for the money.In speaking with the developers at our top consumer brands -- The Atlantic and Quartz -- they weren t working long hours on projects for money. After all, a Princeton study a while back proved that there were diminishing marginal returns to each dollar over $75,000. The best and brightest engineers were there because they wanted to solve big problems and have a large, positive impact on well-respected brands.Developers want to know that their time is being invested in building something that matters. Not every company can have a business model predicated on social good. But you can recruit developers by demonstrating why their work matters to the company. Your product or service wouldn't exist without their efforts, and with the success of your business, more people will be exposed to and using the product of their work.Many years ago, one job offer that landed in front of me was enticing enough for me to toss aside my comfortable consulting world. I landed in the middle of my career with uncertainty at a political digital agency startup. My salary was pretty much exactly the same as my corporate job, but I had no healthcare, no 401K and really few standard benefits. It was an unpragmatic, borderline foolish decision for a rational person to make.The company was Blue State Digital, and it was a scrappy startup built from the remains of Howard Dean s trailblazing digital campaign for president. The audacious objective of bringing nascent digital technology to progressive political campaigns and advocacy was a big challenge. We had no idea that four years later, Barack Obama would raise half a billion dollars online using the technology born from our engineering efforts.Related: What to Look for When Hiring Web DevelopersOf equal importance with having an impact is solving a big problem. Doing what's never been done is a highly enticing challenge for talented engineers. If you want to attract dedicated, quality technology talent, you have to give them a really big problem to solve, and demonstrate to them the importance and magnitude of their work s impact. This is the same motivation driving the technologists who volunteered much of their time to fix the beleaguered HealthCare.gov website.Why do people want to work at Facebook, Amazon or Google? The work in which they re involved is changing the world on a daily basis. They feel relevant and important, because their work is redefining how we communicate, shop or find information. The scale of the problems being addressed by these companies is unparalleled. Similarly, developers leave these companies to start their own ventures, spotting an unserved niche.The last recruitment point is internal relevance and respect. The prospective developer wants to know that they'll be valued by their non-technology peers.At the companies mentioned above, developers are priority employees, with valued seats at the table, participating in technology, business and strategy decisions. You can demonstrate how critical developers are to your company's success by including them in high-level discussions about strategy and acknowledging that potential for success is largely resting on their shoulders.In today s digital economy, good developers largely have the pick of whatever jobs they d like and competition for those that can code is fierce. You re not interviewing them as much as they re interviewing your company to determine whether it s a good fit.Related: Why Every Employee Needs to Be Part of Your Tech TeamTom CochranTom Cochran is the deputy coordinator for platforms at the U.S. Department of State.

/article/232775,How to Hire Without Spending a Fortune. (Hint: Use Social Media.),Recruit new employees for your startup in a cash-conscious style. Learn about five tools for staffing up without significant budget outlays.,"Sourcing and securing the right candidates for open positions can be an expensive endeavor, often requiring extensive travel to campuses and career fairs as well as time-consuming screening calls and in-person interviews. But social recruiting, or the use of social media in hiring, can cut the costs of the process while delivering top-notch results.  According to a Jobvite survey, 94 percent of recruiters are now -- or are preparing -- to tap social media for recruiting practices, and 73 percent say they have made successful hires in that manner. Because most social media sites frequented by potential candidates are free to use, social recruiting can be extremely budget friendly.  Related: The Ultimate Social Media Guide to Getting a Job (Infographic) In addition to the social media sites used by the masses, including Facebook, Twitter and others, career-specific social sites offer affordable opportunities for interacting with potential employees and building your company s employer brand. For instance, 1-800 CONTACTS recently leveraged the community on one of such sites to boost recruitment with an enhanced employer profile and targeted job ads. With a minimal investment, 1-800 CONTACTS increased its monthly page views from 2,861 to 32,171 and tripled its applicant quality.

Looking for an executive assistant? There s a group for that. Locate the online social connections of individuals working in a given industry and post your jobs within those circles. If no one in that group is a fit, the likelihood of a member knowing someone is high.  There are plenty of ways to recruit top talent without paying top dollar. You just have to be willing to put in the work to present an authentic employer brand. Don t be afraid to jump in and join conversations and share more about your workplace.

/article/232762,4 Common Traits of the Best Chief Operating Officers,The attributes of the greats of these oft-misunderstood leaders can provide examples for anyone.,"Asked to name an inspiring CEO, and most of us can easily name a half dozen or more: Steve Jobs, Meg Whitman, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Marissa Mayer. Now, name three extraordinary chief operating officers? That's another story.Chief operating officers are oftentimes unsung heroes in a somewhat amorphous role. Accenture called the COO,  perhaps one of the least understood roles in business today. As the founder of a private equity crowd funding network and in my years in private equity investing, I ve seen how vital COOs are to companies, particularly during periods of rapid growth or business transformation when execution risks are high.Related: 4 Critical Traits of Great LeadersWhat is it that makes a great COO? With CEOs we talk about strategic vision, leadership, determination, an ability to motivate and inspire -- those traits that create iconic corporations. But the chief operating officer role is less clearly defined.Keith Rabois, former COO of Square, describes the COO at a startup as a doctor in an emergency room, constantly fixing things, triaging and diagnosing issues to determine if they are minor or potentially fatal.As Ernst & Young pointed out in The DNA of the COO,  Rather than possessing a single set of skills that can be easily identified in any business, COOs have to adapt, chameleon-like, to the environment in which they find themselves. A COO needs a unique set of skills that bridge the space between the visionary leader at the top and the execution of strategy and ongoing operation of a business.I have found that great COOs have four attributes, which are good examples to follow for anyone in business: 1. They are strategic with a focus on details. Sheryl Sandberg -- arguably the highest-profile COO in America today -- has an extraordinary ability to dig deep on a wide range of issues. At the same time, she knows the bounds of her responsibilities so as not to lose sight of the forest for the trees. When Facebook hit sticking points in key negotiations with PayPal, Sandberg reportedly helped smooth out differences by contacting John Donahue, CEO of PayPal s parent company eBay.Related: How Much Money Is a Good Leader Really Worth?A successful COO balances a breadth of experience and knowledge with an ability to manage strategically. They keep their company s high-level strategy front-and-center while understanding the details of day-to-day execution to ensure what needs to happen does happen. Handling those details can be no small matter. About six in 10 COOs say the complexity and diversity of the position is fundamentally what makes it worthwhile, according to Ernst & Young s survey of hundreds of COOs.2. They appreciate talent. A good COO is a people person. They understand the business depends on talented individuals working as a team. As they maintain the operations, they keep an eye out for ways to improve the company by deepening the pipeline of talent, constantly raising the level of talent through strong hires, and providing opportunities to develop existing team member skills.3. They have no ego: The best COOs put the organization first. There is a total lack of ego. These COOs find ways time and again to highlight others. They will decline speaking engagements and instead give those opportunities to a business-line head or head of marketing. Similarly, when media outlets request interviews, the top COOs will find ways to share the limelight with others.4. They are data driven: Sometimes it is tempting to rely on your gut for decisions in business. But when a CEO or a business-line head, or director of procurement says,  I just know this initiative will be a home run,  the effective COO is the one who will stop them or slow them down and ask for data to guide decisions. Because they are responsible ensuring strategic vision translates into profitable operations, COOs must be data-driven. Rather than allow the business to be guided by instincts, internal politics, hunches, or executives  gut feelings, the best COOs will insist the business be driven by data.Businesses should not underestimate the value of a strong COO. Not only are good COOs instrumental in turning strategy into operational and financial success, the COO role is the most common stepping stone by far to the CEO seat.Forty-four percent of Fortune 500 and S&P 500 CEOs had been COOs, according to the Crist Kolder Assoicates 2013 Volatility Report. Stellar COOs move up -- look no further than Tim Cook at Apple, and the recent reports that Sandberg is a contender to succeed Bob Iger as CEO of Disney.Related: 5 Attributes to Look for in High-Performing EmployeesRyan CaldbeckRyan Caldbeck is the founder of San Francisco-based CircleUp, which provides an online investing marketplace that supports direct equity investments from individual investors into privately held consumer and retail companies.

/article/232736,Don't Love Your Job? Fix the Job You're In.,"What brings meaning to a job is not the job itself, but what we bring to it.","Considering quitting? Maybe you don t need a new job   just a new approach to the one you have. Caring  is rarely listed on job descriptions. It is seen as a soft skill and not core to success. In some cases, it s even seen as inappropriate in the workplace. But while we re not required to care for our colleagues, clients, or other people, caring can be a difference maker. By understanding the role caring can have in your workplace, you can transform your role and your relationship with colleagues, potentially giving you the ownership over your job you need to thrive.Researchers Amy Wrzesniewski, Jane Dutton, and Gelaye Debebe were particularly interested in this phenomenon when it came to what are known as  dirty  jobs, and looked at maintenance staff at a hospital, the folks who clean up after the sick, dying and recently deceased. They wanted to know how these cleaning professionals found purpose in their work, especially as research confirmed that they were treated with disrespect or disdain. Doctors, for example, would regularly drop their gloves on the floor after doing an exam rather than disposing of them properly. Others complained of nurses avoiding cleaning up bodily fluids and just dumping them on the floor so they became the responsibility of the cleaning team.But the researchers also discovered that many of these cleaning professionals found ways to care for patients that created purpose in their work. The majority of cleaners expressed genuine concern for patients and their families, and responded to patients  requests and took time for friendly chats.None of this was part of their job description, and in many cases could be frowned upon by some managers. However, they weren t simply doing the job and clocking out they were taking ownership of and finding ways to craft their jobs to make them meaningful. They had changed their relationship with others to be able to provide care and, in the process, incorporate new tasks. They had redesigned their jobs to suit them rather than be a victim of their constraints.Job crafting is a conscious or unconscious process of redesigning your own job to better align with your values, strengths, and passions.It is a relatively new area of study that is part of the broader, nascent field of positive psychology. As is clear from these stories of hospital workers, what brings meaning to a job is not the job itself, but what we bring to it. In observing professionals in some of the toughest environments, such as the cleaning people, they are uncovering the natural ways people adapt to bring meaning to their work.From The Purpose Economy, released this week.Traditional thinking says that the best way to find more meaningful work is to find a new job. But job crafting points to another solution changing the job you re in to better meet your needs. Positive psychologists have gone from observing organic job crafting, to documenting the process, to proactively facilitating job crafting. The results are remarkable and point to the fact that we have a lot more control over purpose at work than we may realize. Within job crafting, professionals can redesign not only their mindset, but also their tasks and relationships. It is a process that anyone can use to boost purpose at work. And the best part is that applies to any role from hospital administrator to maintenance worker.Task crafting can entail one of three approaches:1. Task crafting. By redesigning the tasks in a job, you change the rules, taking on more or fewer tasks, or changing its scope. One of the most successful examples of this in my own work was in adding writing to my responsibilities. I made time on my commute to write blogs and articles, which gave me a creative outlet. It wasn t required of my job, but it added a lot of depth to my work, and allowed me to explore issues that weren t part of my day-to-day2. Relational crafting. Through changing your relationships with your co-workers, clients, and others in your work environment, you can bring more purpose to your work as a whole. It is usually about changing the nature or depth of relationships and might involve the simplest of changes, such as taking someone to lunch once a week, or trying to have more meetings in person, rather than over email or the phone.3. Cognitive crafting. This aspect is about approach. Workers can connected each task with its purpose. It is about remembering why you are cleaning the room, conducting an audit, or designing a website.Done well, this process stems from the  who,   how,  and  why  of what drives purpose. Once you have that self-awareness, it is possible to intentionally redesign your job to make it substantially more rewarding. It can move you from being on the verge of quitting to finding the same job rich in purpose.Excerpted from The Purpose Economy, released April 2014.

/article/232718,Why Sucking Up Is Bad for Business (and How to Stop It),Here are six things you can do to immunize your staff from going the office politics route.,"As an entrepreneur, you re accustomed to moving fast, speaking the truth and getting things done. You do what s ethically sound and stay on the right side of HR laws. But let s face it, if you wanted to deal with a bunch of BS, you would have opted for a more traditional gig.But now you re the boss. How do you know you re getting the truth? As your company grows, the risk of you getting the safe answer vs. the correct answer expands exponentially.Related: Leave it in D.C.: 5 Ways to Rise Above Politics at WorkWhether you like it or not, wherever two or more people are gathered, office politics begin. Even if you re the  tell-me-everything-straight  type, they re watching your eyes to gauge your heart. The more you react, the more they re revising their answer.When the desire to please you trumps the right choice, the business suffers on many levels: wasted time, poor decisions and inferior talent. You begin to lose the entrepreneurial edge you value most.You ll never find sucking up on a short list of company values, and yet, office politics is an unspoken part of the decisionmaking process in many companies -- don t assume you re exempt just because you personally hate that stuff.Here's how to immunize your team from the office politics virus:1. Teach the long view. The dangers of making wrong choices outweigh the short-term comforts. Strong leaders take the long view and say what they mean. You know this. Teach leaders at every level how to understand the big picture and where they come in. Make it easy to question any decision that gets in the way of long-term logic.Related: Make Genuine Connections at Work, and Success Will Follow2. Drive decisions as close to the customer as possible. Spend serious time at the front lines. Ask your customers and frontline team what feels stupid and why. Give them solid parameters and decisionmaking skills, and then allow them to do the right thing. Reward exceptional judgment.3. Help them learn. When leaders reinvent history to  protect  those who made the decision or to justify poor outcomes, they sacrifice the important learning that comes from making mistakes. It's much better for the  protected  to admit they ve screwed up before anyone tries to save them the embarrassment. Help others save face by creating a culture where mistakes are accepted as part of the learning process.4. Select the right talent for the right reasons. Immunize your HR team first. Don t settle on hiring a candidate for any other reason than they re the most qualified. If you need more diversity, keep searching. Be involved in the hiring, but know you too have biases. Ensure your team knows it s okay to disagree with your view.5. Make wasted time a deadly sin. Be clear that wasted time is a business risk. Much time is wasted when people tell others what they think they want to hear or spin their words. Be polite, sensitive and kind, but save us all some time and tell the truth.6. Model the way. Nothing s more frustrating to employees at the front line than to see their bosses making poor choices for political reasons.

/article/232636,Spring Cleaning for Small Businesses,Address bad habits within your company. Your employees will appreciate it and your enterprise will benefit. Check out these seven blunders.,"When was the last time you took an inventory of your business practices with an eye toward getting rid of bad habits? If you're doing any of these seven activities, now might be the time to stop. 1. Not setting the right tone by being too harsh or negative or not communicating effectively. At the beginning of a quarter, new company goals and objectives are introduced. It's a priority that your company repeats previous successes or makes up for missed targets. Managers and employees are under an immense amount of pressure to succeed. So motivating employees appropriately is key. Unfortunately, some managers have only one tool in their tool kit and it s a hammer.Not every situation requires the hammer treatment. If you're leading a team or rely on co-workers to accomplish things to meet your goals, be sure your communication style fits the situation and the co-worker you're addressing. Remember your objective is to motivate, help people get their work done and drive the company toward success. Communicate with care, concern, openness, clarity and from a place of support. Save the hammer for the rare occasion it s warranted.Related: How to Turn Negativity Into Creativity2. Lacking proper written documentation of workplace issues. It's time to stop crossing your fingers and hoping you won t need performance documentation if an employment decision such as a termination goes sideways. Trying to piece together and articulate how you handled a situation after the fact may put you in jeopardy of appearing as if you didn't handle it properly. If a situation is improperly documented, this can lead to he said/she said situations and claims and legal liability.So, start documenting things right at the start of any attempt to set an employee on the right path. Take15 minutes after a counseling session with an employee to note what was said, what you agreed to and the next steps. Send an email to the employee to follow up and be sure to continue to oversee the situation until it is resolved.3. Avoiding difficult or uncomfortable conversations before it s too late. Many managers avoid confrontation. Delivering bad news or explaining to someone that he or she needs to turn things around can be difficult. But problems do not fix themselves. Get beyond your feelings of discomfort and begin to address issues that are holding back your team from success. Sooner or later these issues will be apparent to people outside the team and it will reflect on you. Coach employees to help them see what they need to do to meet your expectations; deal with bad performers. You will end up with bigger problems if you don t handle these issues as soon as possible.Related: Difficult Conversations: What Not to Say4. Not appropriately recognizing well-performing employees or providing adequate feedback. Your top performers need to know they are appreciated and respected. At times we may take for granted the consistent, great performers who make things look so easy. What if a recruiter calls and they answer the call because they believe there's a firm out there that will see their star power?! Be sure to recognize your star performers, Tell them how great they are. Invest in their further professional development. Ask them what they need to reach their desired career goal and help get them there.5. Not properly assessing employees' skill sets. Do an inventory of your talent. Bring managers together for a performance roundtable where they discuss the strengths and opportunities of their direct reports and provide feedback to the group about their experiences with individual workers.This will be an eye-opening meeting. Managers will walk away with a more global vision of their talent and the department's or company s resources as a whole.Related: Go on Facebook for Your Next Hire? (Infographic)6. Not keeping a pipeline of great candidates or losing great talent. Turnover is inevitable, yet managers often are ill-prepared to fill positions quickly when employees leave. If you are in a hypercompetitive area, require managers to maintain a pipeline of qualified candidates who have passed a prescreening interview process. Court these candidates. Meet them over coffee, send them an interesting link to an article in their area of expertise or share with them exciting nonconfidential information about your company. This is worth the investment of time so you'll be able to hire a great candidate when growth or turnover warrants it.7. Thinking that your company is immune to laws and regulations. While the number of employees you have influences the laws you must comply with, early-stage and small companies are not immune to laws and regulations. Although it is more common to hear about well-known companies' nefarious employment deeds, smaller lesser-known companies also end up in trouble. Wage and hour claims, harassment complaints, discrimination issues and wrongful- termination concerns all confront emerging companies, which need to learn to navigate these scenarios properly.Jacqueline Breslin

/article/232646,How Leaders Can Win the Talent Battle for the 'Google Generation',Companies are going to need to change their approach to recruiting and to work itself to attract today's best employees.,"The most significant challenge for any organization, and the only source of sustainable competitive advantage, is recruiting, hiring, developing and deploying the right people.To win the battle to attract, develop and retain the best and brightest talent available requires a multifaceted and non-traditional approach. It s not enough to post a job on Monster or to scour LinkedIn, hire employees who look good on paper and then hope that everything will work out.For companies to win the talent battle for the  Google Generation  (those born after 1993) companies are going to need to change their approach to recruiting and even change their approach to work itself.Related: 5 Attributes to Look for in High-Performing EmployeesBelow are five ways leaders can help recruit, hire, develop and deploy the best talent of this generation:1. Look for intelligence, integrity and initiative. Everything else can be taught, or better yet, learned through development plans focused on creating experiential opportunities coupled with mentoring. You can always  buy  specialty experience in specific technical areas, but you can't buy or teach  smarts.  Likewise, you can t buy or teach integrity -- you can only try to identify it as a core behavior or trait in those you are seeking to add to your team.It is easier to identify initiative. All you need to do is ask the right questions. For example,  Can you tell me about your biggest professional (or academic) failure or disappointment?  I am looking for candidates to tell me how they regrouped, rebounded and approached the problem from a different perspective or discovered a completely novel way to succeed. We don t compensate or promote people based on how nice they are or how hard they work. We do these things based on how much value an employee creates. Intelligence, integrity and initiative are key indicators to future value creation.2. Appearances aren t everything. Many of the best people I ve hired didn t have perfect resumes and would not appear to be ideal candidates on paper. But to create the high-powered, learning, collaborative, flexible and adaptable teams needed to be successful in our evolving knowledge-based economy, you need to take non-traditional approaches to talent management and development.Related: Go on Facebook for Your Next Hire? (Infographic)I look for individuals with  street smarts  or demonstrated abilities to perform well under stress and who can change directions on a dime, always learning and looking for new ways to leverage and apply that knowledge. These are better indicators for success in today s business environment than just a high GPA or matriculation from an Ivy League school. How did your candidate pay for school? Was it a free ride or did they pay for it themselves, working their way through school on a work study program or on the GI Bill?3. Go beyond the bottom line. The  Google Generation  isn t just interested in moving up the career ladder and increasing their compensation -- although that is still extremely important. Members of this generation wants to know how their company ranks and how their work contributes towards being responsible stewards of the planet. They don t just want to change their tax bracket -- they want to change the world. Here authentic and credible leadership on the issues is paramount. For example, consider linking your senior executive s compensation to achieving specific sustainability goals, including meeting greenhouse gas emission targets, developing eco-friendly products and earning high marks on surveys from their employees.4. Empower your employees by giving them real responsibilities -- even outside of their specific area of expertise. This generation is comprised of risk takers who are as likely to start a business as to work for one. To keep them engaged, senior leadership needs to let them try new things and back them if they fail. Learning how to fail is as important, if not more important, than learning how to win. It is from this that innovation, maturation and confidence is born.5. Create a sense of community. Truly successful leaders don t simply facilitate the creation of better worker bees -- they facilitate the development of better people. They make better spouses and partners, parents and children, friends and neighbors of their co-workers simply by taking the time, being authentic and acting with integrity.

We want our jobs and lives to fit us as well as custom-tailored clothing. It seems more and more the secret to great success and happiness is finding purpose and working with meaning.This is a step-by-step process. It requires knowing yourself and being honest about your goals. Here is a quick guide to creating a road map to success:1. Identify issues. First, identify where you are in your career, how you got there and why you might lack gratification in your professional life.Related: Richard Branson on Pursuing What Makes You Happy""For some, they may be in the wrong field, wrong position, wrong company and wrong industry in the first place,  explains Jan Spence, a business coach whose clients range from Pillsbury to Wal-Mart.2. Establish the core values. This is a list of intrinsic values that are non-negotiable. These are the traits you want to be known and remembered for. They are the adjectives you want your friends and colleagues to use when describing you. Establishing values pulls your real self out. Once we identify values, we look at [employees personality, skills and interests to make sure that they align with their current occupation,  Spence says.This process allows an employee or entrepreneur to shift so they can shine in areas for which they are best suited.3. Ask the big questions. These steps sound easy tied into neat little paragraphs -- however, this can be a difficult process that uncovers who you are. It forces you to ask the big, important questions that the tasks of day-to-day life normally sweep under the rug. Questions such as  What do I really want?  or  Should I change careers?  will come to the surface. The more grounded you are with the answers to the big important questions, the closer you are to reaching your true goals.4. Be open to the journey. This is not a process that concludes in a week. Once you start down this path, the more open you are to the journey, the more opportunity you will see around you. Everything is not linear. Finding purpose and meaning is a complex process that can be full of many detours, as well as great success stories.Related: Yes, You Can Be Happy While Pushing Yourself to Success Being open to the journey itself, rather than fixated on the destination, is wise,"" advises Cathy Benko, a vice chair and talent expert who is the corporate citizenship leader at Deloitte. ""Beyond that, thinking more expansively about possibilities by looking up, sideways and diagonally. 5. Find a noble purpose. This is a call to action. It is the step that ingrains your core values in your day-to-day life. It gives you meaning and reason to do the jobs you do. Taking the time to identify those core values and develop a plan to bring that into everyday life begins to bring meaning and purpose to the career,  Spence says.6. Formulate an  end game.  Beyond asking the big questions and finding a noble purpose, this is still about your professional career. Examine what you want your career to mean when it draws to a close. Many people are on the treadmill of career life and are not thinking about what their career will mean when they are done,"" Spence says. ""Taking the time to identify those core values and develop a plan to bring that into everyday life begins to bring meaning and purpose to the career. 7. Locate resources. Aside from professional coaching, HR offices view this process in a positive light. It is always important to trust the right people and have your own idea of a goal. Some of the best employees a company can have are those who view their jobs as a calling and are motivated and driven to continue growing,  says Mary Massad, division president of Insperity Recruiting Services.Remember, nobody can believe in you as much as you can believe in yourself.Related: 4 Tips for Being a Balanced Entrepreneur -- At Work and at HomeLeigh HeldLeigh Held is a New York City-based freelancer.

/answer/232614,Effective Employee Management? Look to the Golden Rule.,It should go without saying: treating your employees with respect is the mark of a great manager.,"My professional theory is as basic as treating people as you wish to be treated. Lead through example (e.g., be on time and  present  for meetings; talk only when you have something of substance to say -- not every thought that you have is superior because you are in charge -- encourage others to express their ideas). Ensure that everyone fully understands his/her job and has the knowledge/training, tools, and encouragement to do that job.Stay out of the way (i.e., do not micromanage and demotivate workers by making them feel powerless) and cross-train by offering plenty of opportunities to learn new skills or hone existing ones. Show people that you genuinely see and value their contributions by abundantly and publicly praising, recognizing and rewarding those who produce quality work reliably and who exhibit a  can do  attitude. Assess traits that are holding people back and help them to see how to improve.Related: How Making Employees Lifelong Learners Can Help Your Company SucceedIf you encourage people to take risks, be sure to let them know that you will support them -- even if they make a mistake. This is vital in my opinion.Managers who do all of these things effectively don t see excessive turnover. Of course, you will lose some ambitious people -- very often your most outstanding ones -- if you cannot offer them promotional opportunities. But if you are a capable leader, good people will always respect you and want to work with you; and even if they have to move on due to their family obligations or whatever, they will be happy to return to working with you if and when you have an opportunity available at their level.Related: 5 Ways to Become a Better Manager

/article/232516,4 Factors in Crafting Your Company's Leave Policy,Writing a good leave policy takes a good balance between following the law and respecting the needs of your employees.,"Whether it s a few days to get over the flu or several months to see to a newborn or sick family member, the issue of how much paid and unpaid leave to give employees can be tricky for businesses to address. You need to consider industry norms and what you need to offer to attract and retain talent, as well as all applicable federal, state and local laws, which can be a complicated patchwork of human resources compliance, says Melissa Burdorf of XpertHR, an online human resources platform based in New Providence, N.J.To get it right, there are a number of factors you need to consider:Applicable laws. When developing a leave policy, you need to comply with the law that gives the greatest benefit to the employee, Burdorf says. For example, while there is no federal law requiring small businesses provide sick leave, on March 20, 2014, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio signed a law requiring city businesses with as few as five employees to give qualifying employees up to 40 hours of paid sick leave. The federal Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) requires that businesses with more than 50 full-time employees give their qualifying employees up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave time for specified family and medical reasons. In some cases, it s possible to apply FMLA leave concurrently with other leave time. Be sure you understand the requirements of the laws that apply to your business.Related: When It's Appropriate to MicromanageQualifying employees. Once you know the legal requirements you need to meet, you need to determine whether or not your leave policy will apply to all employees. For example, will part-time, temporary or seasonal employees have the same leave rights as full-time employees? If that s not required by law, you need to weigh the benefit of extending the leave policy to them against the administrative and financial burdens of offering and monitoring these leaves, Burdorf says.Policy requirements. An employer should have a written policy controlling all leaves, summarizing the terms of the specific leave policy, as well as the process by which an employee should request leave. Your policy should include how much notice is required and how requests should be submitted, as well as criteria for requesting leave. It should also address an employees' obligation to use various types of paid leave at the same time and what forms of documentation, if any, employees must provide before going on leave or when returning from leave. For example, for jury duty an employer may request the jury summons or certificate of attendance at the trial, while extended sick leave may require a doctor s note or a medical certification. You should also spell out who s eligible for leave, how leave accrues, and how it s carried over.Related: First Time Manager? Start Here.Sometimes, employees want to use paid time off (PTO) before tapping into their FMLA leave. However, employers may want to  designate the leave as FMLA leave to start the clock running on that 12-week FMLA allotment,  Burdorf says. To do so, assuming the leave qualifies as FMLA leave time, you need to notify the employee that you re designating the leave as FMLA leave time upfront, since designating the time retroactively can be problem if it would result in harm to the employee. You may also wish to include a statement in your leave policy informing employees abusing policies or repeatedly failing to give notice when able to do so may be grounds for discipline, including termination.Industry norms. Different sectors have different expectations around leave, ranging from little to none to paid sabbaticals after a certain number of years of service. To remain competitive, you need to have a good understanding of those options and whether they re feasible for your company, Burdorf says. An employer should also ensure that supervisors and managers are clearly advised on the employer s anti-retaliation provision, which should be included an each policy -- not retaliating against an employee for requesting or taking leave,  Burdorf says.

/article/232403,Gamification Tapped by Some Employers to Recruit Candidates,The approach nets more engaged applications when integrated into a challenge-based hiring process.,"Gamification is too often confused with gaming; of course, gamification makes things more fun. But it also increases engagement and motivation and stimulates users to go beyond their limits to win something.And gamification can make a mundane task like completing a job application fun, creative, competitive and interesting. Says Jessica Miller-Merrel, a human resources veteran and founder of Blogging4jobs.com,  Injecting fun into something that is generally seen as boring or task orientated not only can increase engagement but also drive innovation and productivity, which is something your company desperately needs. Current productivity numbers are at historic lows with Gallup recently reporting that 70 percent of the people in the current U.S. work force have labeled themselves as disengaged or actively disengaged at work.Engagement is especially critical when it comes to new hires since workers are the most engaged, happy and productive in their jobs the first six months. Yet video-game job applications have sometimes proved to be unsuccessful in motivating and engaging candidates, as demonstrated by failed attempts such as the Marriot s My Marriott Hotel Facebook game.Related: 3 Unique Hiring Techniques to Find the Right Person for the JobOn the other hand, several companies have been looking at how to integrate gamification into challenge-based recruiting as a powerful tool to engage candidates and assess their skills. The success of such corporate programs is related to the implementation of four key game-design strategies in the hiring process that can improve the candidate experience and empower applicants to showcase and deliver value to the company. 1. Levels: Providing clarity about the steps of the application process avoids the risk of candidates' feeling lost and disengaged.2 Challenges: Engaging candidates on specific tasks enables them to provide something concrete beyond simply a resume.3. Badges: Virtual goods are ""unlocked"" for those who succeed in the first rounds of the application process. This encourage candidates to stay focused and compete for the job.4. Social status: Celebrating the winners shows transparency and encourages applicants to try again and have a positive candidate experience, which is critical to an employer s branding.Tech companies are leading the way in adopting this new technique, challenging software engineers and developers to assess their coding skills, which cannot be done by screening resumes. Google for example, implemented the Google Code Jam, a global online software writing contest with the potential to attract more than 7,500 people each year. The top 25 finalists are invited to the Mountain View, Calif., campus to compete for $50,000 in prizes as well as a chance to work at Google. Another example is the Facebook Programming Challenge in which candidates can solve programming challenges to ""get noticed  by the employer. Innovative leaders across other industries are challenging candidates on business-related problems, leveraging the four gamification strategies listed above.Related: Team 'Ban Bossy' or Not: 3 Reasons Why Hiring Women In Tech Grows Business.Saul Minkoff, one of the co-founders of Pulse Savings, has experienced in person how challenges can appeal to the entrepreneurial spirit as an opportunity to showcase skills and creativity; in fact, his company is the product of a business-case competition.Based on his experience, he decided to approach hiring the same way:  When looking to hire new team members, I wanted not to be biased by school names or years of experience,"" he said. ""I needed motivated and innovative leaders that could come in with ideas, not simply wait to be fit in a box.""""The results were impressive,"" he added. ""Candidates surprised us with proposals and ideas that my team and I [had] never thought of and that would have never come through a resume or during the interview. Minkoff is using 1-Page, the Silicon Valley-based company where I work that operates at the intersection between gamification and hiring, enabling businesses to engage candidates. Applicants can also access the platform without an invitation from an employer and work on unsolicited job proposals to frame their ideas and pitch the company of their dreams.1-Page is not the only company involved with this type of activity. Another case is MindSumo: Its platform enables companies to engage students in solving real-time both business and tech challenges, rewarding the winners with monetary prizes (usually between $50 and $150).For those entrepreneurs who are embracing challenge-based hiring, the benefits seem to go beyond engaging and identifying the best candidates; Pulse s experience with 1-Page and the MindSumo example show how engaging candidates to solve companies  challenges enables businesses to crowd-source ideas and innovation and access prescriptive data about applicants for enhanced strategic decision-making.

/article/232425,Who Can Claim Exceptions Under Obamacare? Supreme Court to Weigh In.,The Supreme Court hears arguments tomorrow on whether for-profit  businesses can enjoy some exemptions to the healthcare law that non-profits do.,"On March 25, the Supreme Court will hear challenges to the Affordable Care Act brought by two for-profit companies: Hobby Lobby of Oklahoma City and Conestoga Wood Specialties of East Earl, Pa. Both companies say it s a violation of their owners  religious beliefs to include coverage for contraception as part of their health plans, which they are required to do under the ACA, otherwise known as Obamacare.The Supreme Court is expected to hand down its final decision on the cases sometime this summer. In the meantime, legal experts predict other challenges to Obamacare could very well make it to the Supreme Court. And many agree this ruling will set a precedent that will start to clarify which companies can claim exceptions under the law and which can t.  My hope is that the Court provide-bright line guidance, because what makes it difficult for companies is when there s uncertainty,  says Brian G. Muse, a partner on the Affordable Care Act team at LeClairRyan in Williamsburg, Va.  Every company should be able to look at their situations and say,  Here s how we re organized, here s how we re managed, so this is what we have to do. First it s important to understand the provision of the law that s being challenged in this case. The ACA requires that all companies with more than 50 full-time employees provide health coverage, and that the plans those companies offer include certain essential benefits. Those benefits must encompass a range of preventative healthcare services, among them contraceptives and the  morning after  pill. Companies that violate the mandate to provide those essential benefits could face a fine of $100 per eligible employee per day.Under the law, only non-profit religious employers, such as churches, can be exempted from covering contraception. But Hobby Lobby and Conestoga Wood contend that they should have the freedom to design their health plans in accordance with their management s religious tenets.Muse believes the crux of the case will come down to the Supreme Court deciding if rights provided to non-profits should extend to for-profit companies.  Where the courts have been fairly unanimous is they recognize that corporations cannot take advantage of exceptions to providing contraceptive care based on religious grounds,  Muse says. Still, there s always a chance the Supreme Court which hasn t weighed in on the issue until now could decide to make an exception for private for-profit companies that are closely held by people with strong religious beliefs, Muse says. Such a decision could give rise to new challenges for both employers and insurers, says Matthew L. Kinley, a partner at Tredway, Lumsdaine & Doyle in Los Angeles. Because current health plans were designed to comply with the law, insurers are generally not set up to remove certain elements, such as contraception, at the will of individual employers, he says.  This is a practical issue,  Kinley says.  Most companies that buy coverage from [traditional insurers] don t have the right or the ability to shape what s in that plan.  Only companies that partially self-fund their health coverage an option that is now being offered to small employers would have such freedom to tailor their plans, he says.So far, the requirement to cover contraceptives is the only challenge to a particular provision in the ACA that has made it all the way up to the Supreme Court, but there could very well be more such lawsuits, especially as companies get closer to their deadlines for complying. Companies with more than 100 full-timers have until next year to get their plans in place, while those with 50 to 99 will need to comply starting in 2016.Among the most contentious issues that some lawyers predict could end up in courtrooms is the definition of a full-timer, which under the ACA is any employee working more than 30 hours a week. Several groups representing service-based industries such as restaurants, which employ many people who work less than 40 hours a week, are fighting for the definition of a part-timer to be changed to 40 hours.  And there is already pending litigation on the question of whether or not federally run insurance exchanges can provide subsidies to patients who buy plans there.  The law itself says the subsidies are provided by state-run exchanges,  says Ryan Sarni, a lawyer with the Mountain States Employers Council in Denver. On March 25, a federal appeals court will hear arguments on the question of whether the subsidies should also be available in the 36 states where the federal government is running the exchanges because those states declined to set them up themselves.Sarni expects more issues will bubble up with the continued rollout of Obamacare.  This is one of the biggest changes to our social structure since Medicare,  Sarni says.  So there s going to be a lot of litigation to sort it out and identify different issues that aren t so clear.

/article/232373,6 Things You Should Never Ask a Job Applicant,Take these questions out of your job interview repertoire.,"What's your greatest weakness? If you're trying to find the best employees, it could be just asking that question.Many of the common questions people ask in job interviews aren't actually that helpful in predicting how well a person will do in a job, experts say. Instead of finding the best job candidates, they end up finding the people who are best at selling themselves in job interviews.""There are some really good people out there who are not glib, and because they're not glib they're not getting the job,"" said Priscilla Claman, president of Boston-based consulting firm Career Strategies.In general, researchers say the entire job interview process can work against finding the best candidate because it favors people who are sociable, practiced at interviewing and have physical traits such as being tall or having nice teeth.""What it does is it amplifies all the biases that we have,"" said Lauren Rivera, an associate professor of management and organizations at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management.Rivera's research has found that employers also tend to hire people they'd like to hang out with.Of course it's important for employees get along, but Rivera said there's a danger in relying too heavily on that, and not enough on whether the person has the skills to do the job.""There are a lot of well-liked people who aren't particularly competent,"" she said.Instead of asking cutesy, hypothetical or casual questions, researchers say employers are better off asking every candidate consistent, concrete questions that are directly related to the job the person is going to be doing.Jeffrey Daum, CEO emeritus at the consulting firm Competency Management, said he urges employers to base their questions on the qualities they see in the best employees they already have. Those may not be the same skills that make people good job interviews, like being extroverted or extremely well spoken.""If the person isn't going to be a public speaker as the primary aspect of their job, then their ability to communicate in a flowing manner is far less important than the content of what they're communicating to you,"" Daum said.Here are some of the worst offending questions:What's your greatest weakness?Questions about a person's greatest strength or weakness don't do much more than tell you how well a person has been trained to answer interview questions, researchers say. Ditto for the old nugget, ""Where do you see yourself in five years?""Rivera's pet peeve: ""Tell me about a time that you demonstrated leadership.""""It tests someone's familiarity with the6 type of stories you're supposed to tell an employer,"" she said.How many garbage cans are there in New York City?Jobseekers have been inundated in recent years with oddball logic questions like, ""How many red cars are there in Cleveland?"" or ""If you were a pizza deliveryman, how would you benefit from scissors?""These questions are meant to show how a person thinks, but the answers are way too subjective to give you a good idea of how you can do a particular job, Claman said. They also work against people who just don't see the logic in being asked a question that's totally unrelated to their ability to do a job.""It won't pick the person who says, 'What the hell is this person asking this stupid question for?'"" she said.""What three things would you bring to a desert island?""These related oddball questions revolve around theoretical personal choices, such as ""What celebrity would you have dinner with?"" and ""If you were 80 years old, what would you tell your children?""Experts say that can tell you a lot about what a person is like, and whether you have similar tastes in music or survival gear. But it's not going to give you a good idea of whether the person will show up on time or can write great lines of code.As the economy slowly improves, researchers say, there's another danger to asking these kinds of cutesy questions instead of practical ones: You'll alienate your best candidates.That's why Donald Truxillo, a professor of industrial and organizational psychology at Portland State University, dislikes questions like, ""How many uses could you have for a spoon?""""Unless someone has come up with a really good scoring key for that, all it does is make the interviewer feel clever,"" he said.Are you planning to have children?One of the biggest mistakes an interviewer can make is to ask personal questions that are at best inappropriate and at work legally questionable. Pro tip: Don't ask candidates if they are married, have kids or are pregnant, even in casual conversation.What's your SAT score?There's been a mini fad lately of asking people who are long out of college to provide such data as SAT scores or college grade point averages.Experts say there are two problems with this line of questioning: These tests and measures aren't necessarily predictive of your ability to succeed in the working world, and they can be biased toward people from certain socioeconomic backgrounds.Claman suspects people are asking these questions because they want a piece of hard data to evaluate candidates on. The problem is that it's not a very useful piece of hard data, she said.Hypothethically speaking ...Hypothetically speaking, it sounds like a good idea to ask candidates what they would do if they were given a particular task at your company.In reality, Daum said, it's much more useful to have the job candidate tell you about something they actually did, and to keep drilling down on real examples that show how they work in real-life settings.You can even have the person show their skills by actually writing a few lines of code or doing another hands-on project.""A lot of people are good at giving a hypothetical example, but they're not so good at actually doing it on the job,"" Daum said.More from CNBCAsia markets mostly higher after Fed holds rates steady, corporate earnings awaitedMessaging startup Slack is raising $250 million in a new funding roundBank earnings off to 'positive start' in this financial hubAllison LinnAllison Linn is a senior business and economics reporter.

We strive to be a company of learners. I am a big believer that fostering ongoing learning in the workplace not only results in a pleasant and energizing work environment but a successful one with top-performing employees who aren t afraid to question the status quo and work together to seek the truth during difficult situations.Related: Will Tomorrow's Entrepreneurs Learn With Virtual Reality?There are several tactics you can implement to create a culture of learning at your workplace:1. Weekly lunch and learns. One day a week, order lunch in and assign someone in the company to present on a relevant topic. For example, our VP of open source explored the history of open source and how it s evolved over the years. Everyone from our development team to marketing and sales attended to get a better understanding of a key pillar of our businesses.Sessions like these enable your workforce to think more strategically and gain a deeper knowledge of key subjects that matter most to the future of the business. If implement, make sure you leave time for Q&A.2. Training budgets. What does it say if you encourage a culture of learning but don t reimburse your employees  efforts to learn? If you re having an employee-retention problem, it might be because the onus is on them to pay for classes and certification exams. Investing in your employees will pay dividends in the form of a more dedicated and educated workforce and powerful ideas that emerge from the new knowledge.3. Tuition reimbursement and recognition programs. What better way to demonstrate your commitment to learning than funding the acquisition of learning? A tuition reimbursement program gives your employees the freedom to expand their horizons and shows your support in fostering ongoing learning. This is also a huge perk that can attract top young talent.4. Set specific learning goals. Make learning a part of goal setting with employees. Encourage them to set at least one goal per quarter around a learning objective -- whether it s gaining a new skill or fine-tuning an old one -- and then support them in this effort by checking in on their progress during periodic one-on-ones and finding ways to help.Related: Women Win in the Classroom, Struggle in the Boardroom (Infographic)5. Distribute books to read. As an executive team, we aim to read a different book together each quarter ahead of our strategic offsites. Whether they re about organizational health or the psychology of success, the books help us stay on the same page --learning together as a team -- with the added benefit of becoming better managers and leaders. To involve the entire staff and encourage them to participate, invite anyone with an interest in reading the current book to expense the purchase.6. Acknowledge the results, For employees who take advantage of learning opportunities, make sure you take the time to acknowledge their achievements and explain how it s helping their team and the business as a whole. Recognizing the never-ending night classes, online courses or long hours pounding the books will reinforce your company s long-term commitment to learning.A culture that prioritizes learning results in a workforce focused on continuous improvement. When you're an active learner on the job, you see challenges more clearly, get more creative and strategic in your problem solving and ultimately work smarter.Related: How the Changing Education Landscape is Helping EntrepreneursAaron SkonnardAaron Skonnard is the president and CEO of Pluralsight, a company focused on producing online-training courses for professional software developers and IT admins.

/article/232352,Reality Check: 3 Steps to Bring Egomaniacs Back to Earth,"When an employee thinks they're more valuable than they truly are, it can create problems.","There are major differences between self-confidence and egomania, often built around the presence of humility. Yet there is a rather large space between the two, where some people that you currently employ or manage might reside.Let s look at this in terms of value: those that are confident tend to perceive their value in accordance with reality. In other words, their perception of self-worth to the organization, based on value and productivity, is most likely aligned with your views. Those with unhealthy egos believe that their value is beyond that of reality.The unhealthy ego represents a significant problem for your business, as these types will often feel they re underpaid, regardless of what value they bring or revenue they generate, regularly take on more or bigger tasks than they can handle without asking for help and have the unique ability to turn off co-workers and clients.Related: When Ego Is the EnemyWhether those that have unhealthy egos can be saved depends on one very important question -- are they coachable?1. Learn their personality. It s important that you learn during the interview process if they are coachable, but if you don t, you need to find out quickly once they re hired. Pay extremely close attention in the first two weeks and see how they respond to constructive criticism and direction from you.If they take the suggestions and improve, they are coachable. If they get offended or don t make adjustments, they re probably not. If they can t be coached, you either need to find a position that better fits their true capabilities or make the swift decision to move them out of the company before they do any serious damage.2. Open their eyes. As a leader, it is your responsibility to understand where employees' heads are and what aspect of their ego is in need of adjustment. It s you that needs to help shift their understanding of their current value and abilities back into alignment.Related: 4 Ways to Talk to Employees So They ListenThere is a way to get that ego back into check within a relatively short period of time -- there must be a shock to their system, and it s your job to provide that shock. Now, you re not going to be able to provide a shock such as the one Steve Jobs received when he was thrown out of his own company many years ago -- think his ego was realigned after that? -- but you do need to create a situation and interaction that will open their eyes and mind that they won t quickly forget.3. Provide the shock. Let s use an example: You have a salesperson that demands more money because they feel they deserve it, despite the fact that they ve been only scraping by from a productivity standpoint. To start, I suggest that you put together a detailed and overwhelming visual report outlining their performance over time in relation to their goals -- graphs will be really helpful. Then schedule a meeting with the individual at least an hour before the office typically opens, but don t tell them about the meeting until very late in the previous day or provide any details. You must provide the shock.At the point of meeting, present your information in a direct, forward and honest manner. I m not at all suggesting that you be overly aggressive in an attempt to make them cry, but that you be firm and to the point with the goal of helping them to understand where they truly are, realigning their reality. When they attempt to defend themselves, which they will, use factual information to help them understand the inadequacies -- facts don t lie. It might take some time to reel them in, but remain firm. It s only when their understanding is aligned with reality will you be able to take them to the next level.It s critical that you put a plan in place with them moving forward and close the meeting on a positive note. Build them back up and be passionate when you explain that you believe in them and that it s your new goal in life to help them be as successful as possible -- then live up to your word.Related: 10 Reasons to Scrap Year-End Performance ReviewsAdam CallinanAdam Callinan is a founder at BottleKeeper, the fast-paced and sarcasm-infused solution to the warm beer and broken bottle epidemics that have plagued the world for centuries.

/article/232345,When It's Appropriate to Micromanage,There is a fine line between being effectively hands-on and micromanaging. Here's when to get more involved.,"In a recent meeting with a client, the subject of micromanaging employees  work came up. Some tasks weren't getting done fast enough, so the client asked me if I thought he wasn t doing enough to manage his employees and if it s ever appropriate to micromanage.As the ongoing conversation about the failures of managers to effectively lead employees often suggests, executives often micromanage their employees rather than lead them. However, in truth, there is a fine line between being a manager and being a micromanager. There is a time for managers to lead as well as a time for leaders to manage.While there are executives who do in fact micromanage every move their employees make, I don t believe that every manager who is hands-on is a micromanager. And I also can tell you that not every leader who is hands-off is an effective manager.Related: If You Want to Lead, You Also Need to ManageSo how do you know where you fall? There needs to be a proper balance. However, your job is complex and figuring out when you should be hands on and manage the results of your team members can at times be challenging to recognize. Here are a few cases where being more hands-on might benefit you as a manager and a leader, in addition to helping you propel your team members toward the finish line.When time is of the essence. When you assign a time-sensitive deliverable, don t assume that your employees understand the depth of importance or the urgency of the matter. That s up to you to clearly convey and then ultimately manage. And it s also your job to set measurable goals with specific timelines attached. Otherwise, you have no right to complain when employees fall short of getting the job done to your satisfaction. Make sure your team understands what s at stake, what s expected and the timeline in which they must deliver. If you have assigned a team leader to the group, perhaps you can place some of the onus on her and let her be responsible for understanding the timeline, what s at stake and what s expected. Just don t lose sight of the fact that you are ultimately the responsible party, so act like it and check in with your team leaders.Related: Before You Send That Angry Email, Read ThisWhen implementing a new process. One of the biggest failures of managers is implementing a new procedure or process by telling employees what to do and then walking away from it, expecting everyone to jump on board and go with it. People don t like change, especially when they don t see the point or when they feel the change threatens their ability to get their job done. Consider getting in the trenches with employees when you are changing their workflow or making significant changes to any process or procedure. This will give you a chance to see how these changes impact their ability to be productive and will allow you to make necessary adjustments before the changes have a negative impact on employee morale or output.When the expected results on a project are very specific. Just because you say what you expect doesn t mean employees heard it in the way you meant it. Everyone has a different way of hearing and processing information and there s also a chance that the way you explained it may not have been as clear as you thought. If there s little wiggle room on what needs to be delivered, then work with employees along the way to make sure the work is being done according to the specs and expectation. You don t have to pound a gavel to manage this process. Instead, try rallying the team around delivering interim results. Try offering public praise,  thank you's  and even small rewards for a job well done.The moment you realize things aren t going well. There s nothing worse than a manager assigning a task or project and then when she realizes things are not going according to her plan, she sits around complaining about it and the employees involved, rather than addressing the issues immediately. You are the boss. You are the one who has to answer to the c-suite, the board and the client. If things aren t going well, do something about it. Speak with those involved, assess where they need help, reiterate what you expect and make sure they are clear about it. If they re not or if they still do not deliver what you expect, then perhaps it s time for you to roll up your sleeves and show them the way.

/article/232174,How a Personal Assistant Can Help You Be Even More Awesome,"There's a defining time in every well-maintained brand when it becomes so popular and respected that you have to ask yourself, 'Can I continue doing this alone?'","There s a defining time in every well-maintained brand when it becomes so popular and respected that you have to ask yourself,  Can I continue doing this alone? If your answer to the above question is no, and you continue chugging along solo, you could reach a plateau in your personal brand that eventually leads to its downfall.Hiring an assistant can bring a myriad of benefits for efficiently taking your presence to the next level, as well as reduce the stress of maintaining your personal brand. Here are four reasons why:1. They ll save you timeProbably the biggest asset an assistant brings to your brand is their ability to perform tasks that would have otherwise taken up hours of your time.Managing your digital presence is one of the most time-consuming functions that makes up your brand. Having an assistant to engage with your followers, create/curate quality content, etc. will leave more time for you to focus on more important matters such as expanding your network and establishing a strategy for the future.Also, having them screen emails and inquiries that previously took you hours to sift through, and then showing you just the important ones, will keep things running efficiently and save you from wasting time on insignificant matters.Related: 4 Ways to Tell If Your Personal Brand Is in Danger2. They ll offer a second opinionYou ve gotten this far in your personal brand without much help strategy-wise, but once you get to a certain point, doing it alone will prove much more challenging. Having an assistant to bounce ideas off of   and getting points of view you never considered before   could prove extremely valuable as you grow your brand.Maybe your strategy for the future is a little shaky, but you never saw it. Hire a clever, knowledgeable assistant and share your strategy and ideas with them so they can offer insight and constructive criticism.Having your assistant research the latest industry and digital media trends will ensure you re staying on top of things, as well as give you ideas for how to continue moving your brand forward.Related: How to Negotiate for What You Want3. They can do menial, but necessary tasksBilling clients, filing expense reports, scheduling appointments, making inquiry calls   when you have your own assistant, you ll never have to do these things again. Especially if you re a big-picture person, these small-but-necessary tasks are what keep your brand alive.If these tasks are the only thing holding you back from moving your personal brand to the next step, then having an assistant perform them could very well take a huge weight off your shoulders and inspire you to move forward.4. Is an assistant worth the money?After hearing all the benefits above about the benefits of hiring an assistant, you may still be hesitant to bring one on board, especially if you don t have a huge budget.But by weighing the pros and cons, you can determine whether or not an assistant will be a good fit for you. In most cases, the cost of an assistant pales in comparison to the value they ll provide you.Choosing the right assistant can prove tough, but once you find the perfect one, your personal brand will feel stronger than ever before.Related: 3 Ways Introverts Can Boost Their Personal BrandHeather R.

/article/232320,First-Time Manager? Start Here.,Managing employees for the first time is equal parts exhilarating and terrifying. Here's how to handle it.,"My favorite people to coach are first-time managers. They re always either stupidly optimistic or scared witless. I get a real kick out of knowing that they have no idea what they re in for. It definitely brings out the evil in me, sort of like when people who ve been married forever meet newlyweds.Nah, just kidding. Although my first time managing was decades ago, I ll never forget what it was like. And yes, it was equal parts exhilarating and terrifying, that s for sure. And while I wouldn t dream of depriving you of the experience (where s the fun in that?), there are a few things I wish I d known then.Take the job. A friend once told me,  I d rather be a great engineer than a mediocre manager.  Smart guy; dumb logic. Truth is, he didn t start out as such a great engineer. Look, I get that you have no freaking idea what you re doing. Nobody does; it comes with the territory. Just take one step at a time. The first step: take the job.Related: 5 Things You Can't Find on GoogleForget about leadership. You know all the fluff   I mean  content  -- you read about leadership these days? Ignore it. All of it. Your job is to manage. Leadership is a set of traits you use to motivate people. Mostly, it comes with experience   watching how others do it and your own trial and error. That is how you learn. Watch, do and learn.Be a sponge. Management is all about people. Find a few role models, both positive and negative. Some traits or methods you ll want to copy. Others you ll want to avoid. Why reinvent the wheel? Just ask a lot of questions and use your gut to determine whom you should listen to. Don t worry; you ll develop your own style in time.Identify your stakeholders. Clearly, your boss is one. Sometimes your boss s boss is another. And your peers are also stakeholders, some more than others. Any manager with a vested interest in your success and vice versa, is a stakeholder. Periodically meet one-on-one. Share strategies and plans. If you don t agree, hash it out.Make sure your goals are clear and aligned. If I had to identify the number one hindrance to organizational effectiveness, it s poor goal alignment and clarity of metrics between managers and their stakeholders. You need to own your goals and that usually means a little back and forth with your boss and, sometimes, your peers.Related: 7 Things Great Entrepreneurs KnowKnow what you don t know. Want to know the best kept secret in management? The more experienced and successful you become, the more you ll come to realize how little you know. That s called humility. It s a good thing. You ll have a great career if you learn not to take yourself too seriously. Don t be a know-it-all.Embrace the many wonders of failure. Everyone and his brother talks about how great failure is, but nobody explains why. It s simple, really. When you try things and they work, you gain knowledge and make money. That s good. But when you try things and they fail, you gain wisdom and character. The latter is arguably worth more.Grow a few layers of skin. The business world is not for the faint of heart. Competitive markets can be brutal and not everyone processes fear and pressure the same way. The last thing you want to be is thin-skinned and overly sensitive to criticism.Try not to be a bully in a china shop. Remember when I said forget about leadership? There s one exception. If you throw your weight around, you re just asking for trouble. Sooner or later, you will run into a more nimble and powerful adversary   and you will fall hard. Trust me on that. You catch more bees with honey than with a net.One more thing. Always keep your priorities straight. Want to know what your priorities are? Your priorities are meeting your goals and getting the job done, simple as that. The most effective way to do that is usually the right way. And the beauty of it is, that s true whether you re managing someone else s business or your own.Now get out there and kick some butt.Related: The 7 Easiest Ways to Insult Important PeopleSteve TobakSteve Tobak is a management consultant, columnist, former senior executive, and author of Real Leaders Don t Follow: Being Extraordinary in the Age of the Entrepreneur (Entrepreneur Press, October 2015).

/article/232212,5 Hiring Lessons From March Madness,"The same care and effort you take in building your bracket should be used when hiring, and similar elements should be evaluated.","It s that time of year again when everyone pulls out their brackets and ranks teams against each other.Taken into consideration are school rankings, competitiveness of schedule, past victories, etc. The same care and effort you take in building your bracket should be used when hiring, and similar elements should be evaluated. Here a few analogies:Initial Cuts: Teams are cut from the tournament because of their record. When screening applicants, hold the same philosophy. Have one or two deal breakers or non-negotiables that the candidate must have   this may include a degree, minimum GPA, or experience using a specific software.The Underdog   In basketball, as with most sports, there is typically an underdog. This is someone who looks like they have no shot, but they have the drive, patience, determination, or some other X factor that gives them the edge. The same is true of candidates. Perhaps a candidate doesn t have the exact necessary experience for the role. Maybe they were in a totally different career, like engineering or computer science, but the analytical skills they have, or the soft skills they obtained, are their X factor. Ask yourself if that candidate with an art history major could be a good fit for the sales position. Could their creativity be exactly what the sales team needs? Find out what drives them, how is their ability to self-evaluate, their sense of right and wrong, and their willingness to challenge the status quo. These things may be their X factor. Their resumes are indicators of what they can help the company accomplish in the future.    Related: 5 Top Cities for Starting a BusinessThe Final Four   Sometimes selecting the Final Four in your bracket is easy, and sometimes it s tough. Usually if you re lucky enough to get all four teams right, you re left arguing with anyone who will listen that your selection will win it all. Hopefully you are equally passionate about the final candidates in play. To help determine who is right, consider if the candidate asked intelligent questions, shared relevant industry news, showed stats and explained to how they d help advance the company?  Did they seem like a team player? Will they get along with coworkers?On the Bubble   Unlike teams who are forced to wait to hear if they received an at large bid to the tournament, hot candidates don t wait around. There are hundreds of other tournaments they can play in because there are thousands of open positions. Top candidates can quickly be snatched up by another company, so be sure to follow up frequently on where the decision stands, and if you like the candidate, extend an offer.Final Cuts   Although it s easy to get caught with daily tasks, it s important to call candidates that didn t make the cut and let them know. Share feedback on what they can improve on. They will have a positive perception of you and the company, and you never know where your next client or referral may come from.Related: For Capital One, March Madness is a Slam DunkMore from FOX BUSINESSEurope orders France, Belgium to end port tax breaksUS weekly requests for jobless aid up 10K, to 244,000US applications for unemployment benefits rose by 10,000 to 244,000 last week",Inspiring Your Team,2014-03-18 14:00:00

After all, it's cool to work on the Next Big Thing, to pitch investors, and to create something from scratch. Of course, the glamor is something of a fa ade. When you re running a company, you re doing all that, all the while worrying about money, taxes, staffing, schedules, product, everything.No one at a startup clocks in at 9 and out at 5. Indeed, the energy that propels you through long hours is one of the things that makes founding a company so rewarding. But be warned: There is such a thing as taking it too far. If you're one of those people who think your staff should subsist on midnight pizza and catnaps under their desks, you're setting yourself up for trouble.Many founders buy into the idea of creating a culture of brute force effort. Their mistake is equating long hours with smart work. When people get tired they make mistakes, get burned out and can lose sight of the vision that lured them to your company in the first place. Certainly, there'll be times when long hours are called for but if they're your company's norm, you may be hurting yourself more than you're helping.People don't do their best work when they're exhausted. Ultimately, you're building a product or service that's going to succeed on its quality. If the design is less-than-optimal or the release is bug-ridden, you ll face disappointed customers and skeptical investors. You need to develop the best-quality deliverable you can, and it's the rare sleepwalker who can give you what you need.This means your culture needs to balance smart work and balance  Let your people know that it's the standard of work that you value, not the battering they took to achieve it. So stay in touch with them not just about their results, but about how they're obtaining them. Make sure your design, development and QA schedules are realistic. When you're done with an intense, hour-filled sprint, have everyone ease up for a bit to get their breath.Remember that there are more tech jobs out there than there are people to fill them.

/article/232196,These 5 Interview Blunders Will Probably Kill Your Job Prospects,Here are five red flags that most great hiring managers will not miss and will have a hard time getting past.,"It's time to shine in your big interview. What could possibly go wrong? Plenty, of course.Let me count the ways: arriving late, crazy hygiene (I ve seen it) and being rude, just to name a few. Yet, among all the ways an interview can go sideways, I ve found there are five fatal blunders that stand out -- and that are fairly common.A lot of mistakes in a job interview can be dismissed or counter-balanced by positives if a company feels you really are the right candidate for the job. But here are five red flags that most great hiring managers will not miss and will have a hard time getting past.1. Bridge burning. Badmouthing a current or former employer is not the path to my heart. I m always looking for team players who can work well with others, even in trying circumstances. Criticizing colleagues, a boss or an employer, is a very bad sign.  Obviously, most workplaces are not perfect, so if you feel the need to talk about issues and challenges at your former employer, you must do so in a respectful way -- not a rant. Tell a story that lays out a challenging situation but, more importantly, focuses on what skills or insights you gained through that experience. I want employees who, when confronted with tough situations, found the positives and grew. Nobody wants to hire a grouser.Related: This Simple Strategy Will Make You the Top Candidate for Any Job2. Weak on strengths, and weaknesses. Employers need hires who know where they are strong and where they could use support. Don t be afraid to articulate clear strengths, bolstered by examples of goals achieved or issues resolved. You should go into an interview armed with at least a handful of strengths, each supported by a couple of concrete examples. If you can t convey your strengths in a compelling way, you re in trouble.At the same time, you need to be able to talk about areas where you hope to develop. Rarely do we find a candidate who is the whole package, so I want candidates to be genuine when they articulate weaknesses.Even top CEOs are not rock stars at everything. The best recognize their shortcomings and hire rock stars to fill those gaps.3. No research. If a candidate hasn t prepared -- and, ideally, over-prepared -- for this critical first meeting, what can we expect on a typical Tuesday in the role? With access today to company websites and Facebook pages, LinkedIn, news searches, sites like Glassdoor.com and other sources, there is no excuse to walk into an interview ignorant.I expect candidates to understand the business, have read recent news releases on the company, and know a bit about the leadership team. Bonus points to those candidates who find someone connected to the company and can ask a question or two based on those  insider  insights.If you don t know someone at a company, use LinkedIn to try to connect with an employee, former employee or someone who has done business with the company. You ll gain invaluable intelligence. Using the theory that we are all just six connections removed from any person -- and, in this case, any company -- you should make the effort to talk to someone with direct knowledge of the company before you step into an interview.Related: How to Avoid Hiring Duds4. No questions. I want candidates who are curious about the team, the role, our strategy and what they can expect to be doing on day one, in six months and in a year. I also want team members that are passionate about what we re doing -- and excited to learn more.You should go into every interview with a minimum of five questions for the interviewer. Even if you know the answers, you should be hungry to hear your hiring manager or future co-workers respond to those questions. These should be serious and insightful questions.Too often I spot candidates who ask token questions because they know they are expected to. They show little interest in delving into how the business is run, what s the competitive landscape and what s the work environment and culture like.If you don t ask questions that suggests to me you don t care about the people you are going to be spending 8 to 12 hours a day with. Not a good start to a long-term relationship.5. Too much  I .  For some candidates, it starts with  I  and never goes anywhere else. Naturally, a prospective employer wants to hear what you have accomplished, but equally important is how you describe those achievements. Was it all  me  that accomplished the great outcomes? Or was it the team from product development, marketing and  me ? Even if you led the effort, don t forget execution is as important as your strategic planning.We work in an age of collaboration. I want to hire smart people who have accomplished goals elsewhere and can articulate how their contribution worked as part of a larger effort. Do they have a holistic understanding of the way things get done in a business and appreciate that each of us is just a piece of a bigger enterprise?What you may notice about my five deadly red flags is that they go deeper into a candidate s personality and his or her approach to interacting with others and with an organization. Committing these blunders will almost assuredly mean the end of your prospects with the company.Related: 5 Attributes to Look for in High-Performing EmployeesRyan CaldbeckRyan Caldbeck is the founder of San Francisco-based CircleUp, which provides an online investing marketplace that supports direct equity investments from individual investors into privately held consumer and retail companies.

/article/232201,4 Tips for Attracting Google-Quality Software Engineers,Tips for businesses and startups that are looking to attract top developers.,"Free Webinar | August 16thFind out how to optimize your website to give your customers experiences that will have the biggest ROI for your business.							Register Now  According to the latest Glassdoor survey, you don t need to pay Google salaries in order to attract Google-quality software engineers.The online recruiting platform found that 52% of software engineers are likely to accept less money in order to enjoy a better work culture, while 51% are likely to take a lower salary in order to work on an attractive product or service. The average annual salary for software engineers in Silicon Valley is over $111,000. The general perception, if you will, is that software engineers are in such high demand that you need to throw cash at them to hope to reel them in,  says Glassdoor director Samantha Zupan.  The big takeaway is that money isn t everything. And given that one in four software engineers plans to start looking for a new gig in the next three months, small businesses and startups looking for great software engineers may be in luck. Zupan shares four top tips for attracting software engineers:Related: Yelp, Yahoo Partnership Goes Into EffectNo. 1: Communicate your company s story.Zupan says the survey findings underscore how important it is to software engineers to work on projects they feel strongly about. They never know when that hot new startup is hiring that is in an area they feel passionate about, so they are always keeping their eyes and ears open,  says Zupan.To take advantage of this, Zupan says it s important that recruiters and hiring managers do a terrific job articulating what is special about the business. What s your story? What are you trying to do? What s the vision for the company?  asks Zupan, listing some of the important questions recruiters should keep in mind. Recruiters should also think about how they want to portray the company culture.No. 2: Get personal.When reaching out to potential candidates, Zupan says it s important to get personal. It s a turnoff when you get a generic email from a recruiter. It shows they re not not paying attention to who that person is or why they might be a right fit,  says Zupan. Being able to speak specifically about the work that a particular candidate has done in the past will make your company stand out, and speak highly about the office culture.Related: SEO   Y Care? Basics for Business OwnersNo. 3: Discuss long-term plans.Zupan says many software engineers are eager to know what the long-term trajectory looks like at a company before taking the job. What s the type of work that I will have once I finish this project?  asks Zupan, citing an important question many engineers have.  There needs to be a career advancement pipeline. No. 4: Remember that attractive benefits aren t one-size-fits-all.While many startups receive attention for in-office parties and catered meals, Zupan says perks that may be attractive to one engineer might not be all that appealing to another. If you are a software engineer that has two or three kids   on-site amenities that allow you to stay longer at work are not the thing you want to have. You want things that help you be a great mom or dad and allow you to spend time with your kids, like telecommuting,  says Zupan.Related: 5 Top Cities for Starting a BusinessMore from FOX BUSINESSN.

/article/232043,Rules for Hiring a Startup Team That Believes in Your Brand,"Aside from more obvious qualifications, there are many intangibles to look for in your first employees.","You ve heard it before: Teams will make or break your new venture. And we know putting together a strong team is not only crucial for any startup -- especially for early stage startups -- but also one of the hardest things to do as well.Don Fornes of Software Advice recently identified four personality types you should look for when building your core team: the matrix thinker, the savant, the champ and the giver. Usually in a co-founder structure, you see a balance of two or three of these personalities, with perhaps the most common pairing being a matrix thinker with big ideas and a savant with execution skills.Related: These 4 Personalities Make Up Your Startup 'Dream Team'But beyond what personalities and thought-processes are effective together, it s also important to think about the more intangible qualities that can help guarantee a stronger group of first hires for your startup.One obvious one is mutual confidence. Nasir Ali, managing director of StartFast Accelerator in Central New York, and founder and CEO of Upstate Venture Connect, has found that trust and faith in a partner ""enables honest discussion of uncomfortable truths without worrying about egos."" We all know egos are common in the startup world, and being able to measure them against a trusted partner can go a long way.However, Ali also notes such a tight bond can be detrimental, leading to difficulties in hiring that first ""outsider,"" with the added effort of not only bringing he or she into the company, but into ""the circle.""""Another part of the founding team is the ability for each person to become a leader in their own right as the organization grows,"" says Ali, emphasizing that independence, inclusiveness and open-thinking help overcome this possible hurdle.Once your founding team is put together, building the next level of your core team is also make or break. Once you ve decided that skill-set and personality-type criteria, aligned visions and brand image should be a part of the equation.Maxine B dat, co-founder of Zady, a fashion-focused ecommerce site for conscious consumers, considers the next set of hires crucial not only to a team, but to your brand.""Unlike a big corporation, early team members are not just employees, they're key brand builders for your company,"" she says. ""Skill, drive and cultural fit are the three elements that must be present in each and every early hire.""Related: A Strong Team Can Carry Your Vision to the End ZoneWhen she and her co-founder, Soraya Darabi, were forming their core team, they dwelled on the characteristics they thought would be valuable to an emerging brand, and sought out people who embodied those characteristics.""We looked for intelligence, creativity, energy, positive attitudes and generally optimistic people who demonstrated that they would be great team players. Most importantly, we look for folks who believe in and love our mission as much as we do,"" says Darabi, who, with B dat, insists that everyone from engineers to their creative director ""joins the movement"" at the core of Zady s brand.When it comes down to it, while core personality types and skill sets are a key part of building your startup s team, having trust in your teammates alongside independence of thought and general inclusiveness, understanding if a person has truly bought into the mission and vision of your company and recognizing whether he or she will also make a positive impact on brand image should be big considerations as well.""We meet people all the time who love our idea and want to help out,"" says Andrew Young, the CTO and co-founder of SWILL, an on-demand beer, wine and spirits delivery service (yes, you heard that right), ""but in reality, is that person qualified? Do they really believe in our vision? Are they willing to put in the blood, sweat and tears to make this business a success? It s hard to really judge that from one conversation.""Young has found that building a relationship with a person allows his leadership team to get to know them and understand how their brain works.And all of this is hard to do quickly. As the old saying goes, hire slowly and fire quickly.Related: Does Your Team Have the Right Stuff to Attract Venture Capital?Kate BrodockKate Brodock is the president of Girls in Tech, a global non-profit for women in technology and entrepreneurship and the director of the W2O Group Center for Social Commerce at Syracuse University s Newhouse School.

/article/231949,You Won't Find What Makes a Hire 'Special' on Their Resume,"Businesses are all the same, which is why experience in your field shouldn't matter when interviewing job candidates.","Most startups aren t so special, I recently wrote, because every startup needs customers to survive. But it doesn t end there. Most companies aren t special either. Not even your company, no matter how long you ve been around. But for a different reason.What? You say that you re developing an incredible new technology for mobile payments that no other company has thought of? Or that you ve come up with unique content that media companies will be clamoring for? Maybe your pharmaceutical company has discovered a bona fide cure for the common cold. Or your vending machines deliver both hot and cold food and cannot be matched by anyone. Perhaps you re the most brilliant patent lawyer with the most successful patent law firm in town. Or you ve designed a manufacturing process so unique that you re able to keep your costs more than 20 percent lower than your competition. OK, that s all pretty special. And that s why you re doing so well.Related: The One Thing Your Startup Really Needs to SucceedBut everything else? Nah, you re not that special. You re just running a business. And that business has the same issues that every other business has: finding customers, buying materials, shipping things on time, solving problems, paying people, investing in new things, taking risks, office parties, employee of the month, jammed printers, conference rooms.So the next time you look for an employee to work for you, or even a service to hire, consider this: What if she doesn t have experience in your industry, or doesn t have a clue how your topical cream is made? What if she can t identify what s so unique about your manufacturing process, or never had any experience in the patent law field or media industry? What if she has no ""special"" experience in your ""special"" industry?It should make no difference at all.When you re looking for that new employee, instead of asking her what experience she has in your field, find out what her work ethic is. Let s assume if she s an accountant she knows accounting, or if she s a sales manager she knows how to manage a sales force. Instead, evaluate her attitude, capability to solve problems, ability to get along with people, manage projects and get things done.Related: 5 Attributes to Look for in High-Performing EmployeesIs she smart? Did she get good grades in school? Did she get good references from the places she previously worked from other smart people? Can you trust her to do what she says she s going to do? This is what you need to know.Because once you peel away a very thin layer of ""being special,"" your company is just like any other business. And if that prospective employee is smart enough, she can quickly learn what s so ""special"" about your company and apply that to her own skill set in sales, finance, marketing, engineering or management.Businesses struggle with the decision to buy that ""vertical"" software package designed for businesses such as theirs or hire that ""expert"" who has 20 years of experience in their industry. And what I and most of my clients have learned is that none of this is as important as just finding that capable person who can be taught, or that proven product or service that can be customized to meet their needs.No business is special.

/article/231945,"When It Comes to Change, Being Small Is Enviable",Having a corporate structure can hurt the implementation of new processes.,"Entrepreneurs attempting to grow their business are often led to believe that they should automatically step into a ""big"" corporate mode of thought and practice. We have all been bombarded with theories, models and general advice meant to help us with negotiating change. But there is a point at which such advice is not suited for small business. And in all honesty, corporate execs and managers may talk a good game, but their efforts to implement new, effective processes and systems are at best a mixed bag.Listening to the buzz of popular advice, we can easily forget that good judgment may at times suggest doing nothing whatsoever, and that taking a shot with someone else's approach may actually push us into hot water. While large corporations may attempt to train people to manage change, they can also blow through a tremendous amount of money while careening back and forth between multiple strategies and lines of business. When corporate change efforts implode, some heads may roll, but the corporation usually just shakes it off and moves on.Related: How to Always Be Ready to Adapt Your Business to ChangeIn the face of sweeping innovation all around, management in the typical large organization is often pressed to engage with seemingly small, measurable and even fabricated changes that give the appearance of action. Initiatives that can be easily quantified are probably satisfying on some level, but organizations often end up tackling the wrong issues, which wastes large amounts of money, time and effort.For example, I worked with a large, well-known tech sector company that decided to implement self-managed teams. A complete lack of forethought led to a multi-million dollar change that clashed with the old corporate culture. Since there was little rationale or conviction behind the effort in the first place, the group quickly reverted back to the old model and the company gave up on self-managed teams altogether.The logistics of data collection and measurement processes alone can become overwhelming for stakeholders already tied up in the main objectives of their business. In the meantime, some of the most pressing change issues facing an organization are not readily apparent. And issues that are easy to identify and label are not necessarily quantifiable issues.Related: 5 Ways to Grow Your Business Without Adding More ResourcesMany crucial matters are often not dealt with or are ignored altogether because they lack the numbers to get senior management excited. There is also trouble with what can be known about the characteristics of a system, participants or the change opportunity when the act of measurement itself disturbs or influences that which is being observed and measured.In resisting the siren's song of corporate lore, what can entrepreneurs draw from to manage change in their growing business? For one thing, since your business is small, you actually have an enviable advantage when it comes to engaging with change. Hopefully, you have surrounded yourself with co-workers, partners and customers that have earned and deserve your trust. Trust them! You talk with them all the time, so be sure to really listen to them. When they tell you that something is not working, it is not working, and it is time to consider a change. Give your team the go ahead to take charge in implementing and communicating their best solutions.Since you are a small team, you don't have to allow your business to fly apart as you conduct studies through multiple organizational layers, and you don't need to spend hundreds of hours crunching data. The word of one trusted employee or customer is enough to initiate a small change.Many small changes are much better than big, sweeping change anyway, since small changes can be put into place with little or no disruption to daily operations that may affect your customers. If a small change doesn't work after a fair test period, you can smoothly and easily back it out of the game plan. When it is time to change, you and your team already have everything that you need to manage in a way that can teach the big dogs a thing or two.Related: People Must Be Valued or Innovation Will Leave With ThemBrent MissoBrent Misso has taught at the University of Wisconsin, Arizona State and Oregon State and worked in organizational development and training in the tech sector.

/article/231853,A Strong Team Can Carry Your Vision to the End Zone,Former NFL linebacker offers tips on what to look for in potential employees.,"There's a strong correlation between top-performing athletic teams and the corporate world, in that both understand the extreme importance of teamwork.Just as a football coach needs to assign specific players to a position, entrepreneurs need to follow suit when looking to grow their business to take things to the next level. Every employee must have a role, and everyone must play their part. The key is to assemble a team that believes in your vision.I often see entrepreneurs try to do it all on their own. This is a huge mistake. When something means so much to us, we can be hesitant to let others handle important duties or contribute to our masterpiece. However, you can stunt your growth, innovation and sales rate if you don t start enrolling others in your vision.Related: 5 Attributes to Look for in High-Performing EmployeesHere are three tips on assembling a world-class team:1. Fully believe in your vision. It s incredible how many entrepreneurs and business owners hire people who aren t completely sold on their vision. This is extremely toxic and will do more harm than good. Whether you are looking to hire full time, or you're just looking to delegate a project, make sure the candidate fully believes in your vision and where you want to go. Just as a football team needs every single player to believe they'll win the Super Bowl, you need the same type of commitment and unity.2. Fill in the weaknesses. You are the captain of the ship and the main visionary. A big pitfall many entrepreneurs come across is spending an enormous amount of time on activities that aren't their strong suit. Finding someone who is a master at something you may lack skill in is essential. This not only saves precious time, but ensures a fabulous job gets done. A quarterback isn t going to handle a kicker s duties and vice versa. The same goes for you and your business. Stay in your sweet spot and assemble others to fill the other positionsRelated: How to Avoid Hiring Duds3. Look for the hustle DNA. One of the worst decisions I ever made when it came time to assembling a team around me was paying too much attention to resumes and overlooking what mattered most, the  hustle DNA,  as I like to call it. You want to be able to form a team of people who are willing to do whatever it takes to get the job done. The hustle DNA is now one of the first things I look for, because it can t be taught. My philosophy is if you are a relentless worker who never settles for mediocrity and wants to make a tremendous difference in the marketplace, I can teach you the technical aspects of my business.Once you've assembled your dream team, nothing should stand in the way of advancing your vision.Related: What the NFL Taught Me About Being a Motivated EntrepreneurMatt MayberryAs a former NFL linebacker for the Chicago Bears, Matt Mayberry is currently a keynote speaker, peak-performance strategist and writer.

/article/231786,"Why You Should Act Like an Entrepreneur, Even If You're Not",Every successful employee should be the 'boss' of their own future and career advancement.,"Talk to any independent business owner, and he or she will tell you that one of the best parts of the job is  being their own boss.  But while the self-employed enjoy certain freedoms -- from operations, marketing to working hours -- unavailable to those who draw a salary, every successful employee should be the  boss  of their own future and career advancement. Whether there are two or two dozen names ahead of yours on the company letterhead, it s important to remember that no matter who you work for, you also need to be working for yourself.I like to think about this in terms of a model I call  YouCo,  where each employee is CEO of their own job -- not only their daily tasks and deliverables, but also their broader personal and professional goals. YouCo is a company within a company, and allows you to grow in your role by acting entrepreneurially to produce results for your employer and burnish your professional credentials. By placing yourself at the center of your personal one-person company, you re also forced to confront important decisions about your career ambitions head on, and to devise short-, middle-, and long-term plans for attaining those goals.Related: Why the Coach Approach Beats the Manager Mentality MichaelCo,  for example, has helped me make the most of my opportunities while working in a variety of roles at large PR firms and smaller nonprofits alike. The most time-honored way to move up in the workplace is to deliver results for your employer, but for younger professionals, proving that you can think outside the box to maximize productivity and create new and better processes for your role is critical to personal and career advancement.YouCo requires that you take on entrepreneurial initiatives in the workplace that allow you to grow. Smart employers understand the benefits of allowing their staff to take ownership of their roles -- the risks they take, if successful, can be applied to processes throughout the workplace and come at a fraction of the cost of consulting. Room to maneuver within your role allows you to learn how to act like a manager, even if you re the low man on the totem pole.Related: People Must Be Valued or Innovation Will Leave With ThemI ve been fortunate to work for employers who recognize the importance of professional development, and as a manager, I now encourage my staff to seek out opportunities for themselves (another win-win, as appropriate professional development seminars increase their quality of the work).

You may not be an entrepreneur in the traditional sense, but it s important to act like one, and to set your personal company on the path to success.Related: Your Time Is Money, So Stop Wasting ItMichael MoroneyMichael Moroney is a communications professional working in Washington, D.C., and a 2014 Fund for American Studies Journalism Fellow.Read more",Run a Better Business,2014-02-26 18:00:00
/article/231753,Sick at Work? You're Not the Only One.,"In a survey from NSF International, a quarter of Americans reported going to work sick no matter what.","When you're sick, doctor's orders are pretty standard: rest, wash your hands, drink lots of fluids and stay far, far away from other people. But according to a new survey from Michigan-based public health organization NSF International, a quarter of Americans find themselves in the office on their off days, often due to economic necessity. Forty-two percent of the 1,003 workers polled said that they go to work sick because of deadlines and work that would pile up in their absence. Twenty-five percent reported that they come to the office when they're sick because their supervisors expect them to work no matter what. Thirty-seven percent say they simply can t afford to be out for a day, and 57 percent of their co-workers think that's why they're in the office at all. The survey also found that men are about twice as likely as women to go to work when they're ill.Related: How to Make a Flu Season Contingency PlanMost employees are inclined to be understanding when their co-workers are under the weather. Sixty-seven percent say they think their sick colleagues are hard workers, and 57 percent would tell them to just go home and rest. But 16 percent think that ill co-workers are inconsiderate and selfish to expose the office to their germs, and 13 percent think co-workers go to work when they're not well because ""they don't trust their colleagues to do the job while they're out."" Despite your valiant attempts to keep your stapler away from the cubicle mate whose desk has turned into a pharmacy, and no matter how frequently you disinfect the office common space, according to the CDC, flu season is still very much in full swing, especially for adults ages 18-64.Related: New York City to Require Employers to Give Paid Sick LeaveIn October, office supply company Staples reported similar statistics to NSF International.

/article/231725,"Make Genuine Connections at Work, and Success Will Follow",Here are five ways to better connect with your team members.,"Having genuine connections between team members can be integral to overcoming challenges and growing. No matter what role you fill in a team, you can take steps to genuinely connect with your co-workers and go beyond the typical, surface level,  How was your weekend?  interactions. This will result in a more connected, dedicated team that can generate more success.Here are five areas that I struggled with personally that impacted my genuine work relationships -- and my tips for overcoming them and better connecting with my team members.Sharing starts with you. When I first started out, I never shared anything about my passions, what I drive motivation from, in the workplace: music, technology, sports and fashion. I felt that as a young entrepreneur it would make me look unprofessional -- diminish me in some way.Related: 4 Tips on Building Stronger Business RelationshipsBut in the past couple of years, I ve made a concerted shift. Now I share more about my personal life, such as my passions for writing and producing music. By sharing, I ve not only connected more with my team, but I ve opened the door for them to feel comfortable sharing things about themselves. And they do. As a result, we have an environment where people are free to be who they are and not have to distinguish between their  work  and  home  selves. This allows them to be comfortable and free to voice their opinions.  These opinions have lead to many great ideas for our clients and for our own growth.Do something fun together. I decided to use the newfound information about my team members  interests to create opportunities for us to connect. Once you understand what your team members are passionate about, you can begin to do some of those fun things together.This type of connection should allow your team members to fulfill their professional and personal passions at the same time. So plan a quarterly event with your team. It s the quality of the time you spend together that matters, not the dollar amount.Know when to multitask. I recently realized that I spent every meeting with my laptop in front of me. Instead of focusing on the conversation, I was responding to emails -- which made it difficult to connect with others and actively listen to what they were trying to say. My lack of attention was coming across as disinterest, and that didn t allow us to fully connect.Now I only multitask if I m on my own, and I spend meetings focused on the people in front of me. It creates a better connection and makes my team members feel valued.Related: Office Space and Communication Tips and Tricks From a Workplace AnthropologistBe available, but set expectations. I am very enthusiastic when it comes to new ideas, but that excitement would often cause conflict when I realized I didn t have the time to be available for the new initiative. It s important to set appropriate expectations.I ve since shifted my approach. Instead of indicating that I would be available throughout an initiative, I set better expectations for my involvement. Yes, these expectations are important to my team, but they are really more about reminding myself where I have to spend my time. Your team members want your input, but you need to balance your enthusiasm with your schedule. Saying  no  sometimes is far better than saying  yes  and letting people down.Be consistent, no matter your mood. Another thing I noticed, on reflection, was this: my general mood affected how I came across during a meeting. If I felt worn out and negative, I wouldn t respond as enthusiastically to a team member who was sharing a success. This would often create confusion and make it difficult for people to approach me -- which closed down the flow of communication.Other people shouldn t have to gauge your mood before they approach you. They should know what to expect. Try to reset at the beginning of every meeting and not allow a bad mood infect everyone around you. Listening to a song that can set the mood I m looking for before a meeting often works for me. Support your team in a positive way and let them know you re there for them. Show them you have the ability to mute the negative noise.These are the best ways I ve found to create genuine relationships with team members. Now it s your turn to incorporate these changes and see what happens when you build genuine connections at your company.Related: The Lure of the Office RomanceZubin MowlaviZubin Mowlavi is an entrepreneur, musician and innovator.

/article/231714,How to Avoid Hiring Duds,"While executives act like they have their hands on the pulse, often they miss the mark when it comes to hiring. Here are a few ways to make sure you land rock-stars and not complete duds.","So, you thought they d be a superstar.  Your new hire was enthusiastic and smart during the interview, a go-getter with a firm handshake. But then . . . they fizzled.  They reached their peak too early and sunk right into mediocrity. Just another ""dud.""  I would bet that we re all familiar with this scenario. In fact, most executives I work with think they re really good at interviewing and hiring talent while in reality, it s a rarity. Most executives talk so much during an interview that they find out very little about the person sitting in front of them.When they bring on a dud, far too many executives spend inordinate amounts of time trying to salvage these  C  players. Unfortunately, there is very little ROI in doing that.  Instead, when it has become clear that a mistake has been made, admit it, execute a respectful separation and move on. Since very few are coachable it s best to hone your hiring strategy so that you stop getting stuck with them in the first place. There are several critical aspects of hiring that will bring your success rate close to 90 percent (seriously). It s not easy but here s how you can do it.Related: 5 Attributes to Look for in High-Performing EmployeesLook for core values. The single most important element to hiring the right person is to interview for ""core values"" first, experience and skills second. This order is not a typical HR strategy, as most companies hire for experience and skills but they then fire people for not aligning with the chemistry, culture and core values of the company.When I interview executive candidates for clients, I look to discover things like loyalty, respect, quality of work and integrity. If the candidate doesn t get past that step the interview is over. You can't make up for a core values mismatch with experience and skills: They either ingrained or not, they can't be taught.Focus on 'Topgrading.' The second most important hiring element should be Topgrading, a tactic made famous by Brad Smart.  This means, identifying whether the individual is an  A,   B  or  C  player. Great executives know they shouldn t even be conducting interviews with  B  and  C  players -- they should have been screened out via telephone before being invited to interview. Instead, hold out and wait for the  A .  A warm body is NOT better than a no-body.Related: What Makes Job Seekers Lie on Their Resumes?The recession has made the task of finding the right talent even tougher. There have been so many people unemployed and looking for jobs (and maybe just looking for paychecks) that many applicants have become professional interviewees. They ve gone on so many interviews that they have become really good at giving all the  right,  yet superficial, answers. It s all too easy to be fooled by  C  players who look, talk and shake hands like  As.  Interviewing for core values will separate the mid-level applicants from the real deals. To do this, ask behavioral questions instead of resume rehearsals that get to the heart of the applicants decision-making ability.Also, find out if the applicant is currently employed. I find that people who leave a job to join another company show much greater promise than people who may just be looking for a way to pay the bills.Devote adequate time. Executives must ask themselves regularly whether they are spending enough time on people-related issues: recruiting, interviewing, developing and retaining talent. Several Fortune 100 CEOs have stated that they typically spend between 65 and 70 percent of their time on these people issues. And why not?

/answer/231689,Is It Better to Be a Freelancer or Full-time Employee?,Our expert weighs in on the advantages of being a full-time staffer versus a freelancer.,"Contractors usually fill a temporary need for specific talent or skills needed for a short amount of time -- for a specific project, for example. They are supposed to be very temporary, have their own place of business and work for other entities.Most of the advantages of using a contractor (i.e., 1099 worker) fall squarely on the side of the business entity. That is because contractors are not eligible for any welfare benefits such as medical or other insurance, paid time off work, and so forth. Also, contractors are responsible for taking care of their own taxes, with no amounts being deducted or paid by the business entity for social security, unemployment, etc. And, of course, when contractors are let go, they are not eligible for unemployment benefits.Related: The IRS Wants to Know If Your Freelancer Should Be Getting a W2Some people like contracting because they receive more money directly (due to no tax deductions being made to their pay); but many do not for the reasons stated above and because they can owe a sizable amount for income taxes at year s end if they were not paying estimated taxes quarterly throughout the year.There are quite strict laws regarding the definition of a contractor versus an employee because companies like to skirt paying payroll taxes when they can. As a general rule, business entities using contractors -- legitimately or otherwise -- have little incentive to convert them to full-time employees, as doing that gives the worker rights under employment laws and increases the costs by 25 percent to 33 percent or so for each such conversion. On the other hand, if your husband proves to be a consistent and valuable addition to a business entity s team, they might make the conversion, regardless of the increased cost.If you look at Section Two of the IRS Publication 15-A, you will see exactly what the IRS considers when determining whether a worker is an employee or an independent contractor (i.e., 1099 worker).Related: How to Find Great Candidates by Looking Past the ObviousPenny MoreyPenny is a seasoned human resources executive and consultant with over 25 years of diverse business experience in advising enterprise leaders on employment-related matters.Read more",,2014-02-20 21:19:00
/article/231606,6 Ways to Get the Best From Your Team,A team can make or break a startup. Ensuring your team is top notch takes work and dedication. Here are a few lessons I learned on how to get the best from your employees.,"Having the privilege to be part of what I believe is one of the most hardworking, inspirational industries is both challenging and rewarding. You deal with the most dedicated and devoted owners where putting in 60 hours a week is normal. I m talking about the restaurant industry.Being CEO of a business that helps restaurant owners achieve operational and financial goals is an exciting adventure. But to achieve this feat, you need a team of very passionate individuals that can transfer their enthusiasm and commitment, along with their expertise and skills, to the client in order to produce outstanding results.Being a service-based company, there isn t a shiny product we can display, but instead, our  shiny product  is our knowledge, skills, confidence and capabilities: For our consulting company to be on point, our team always has to be on point.After one year going strong as a startup, here are six lessons I learned on how to get the best from your team. Related: Seven Ways to Boost Employee Morale1. Work with people who are passionate about the cause, not about the money. Why say passionate about the  cause  instead of passionate about the  company?  Because we are a bunch of motivated and inspired individuals bonded by a common cause, which is to improve the restaurant industry -- one restaurant at a time. Everything else we do is meant to support that cause. The reason for our company formation is to become recognizable to the industry, the reason for a website is to create a  home  where our clients are welcome and get to know us and our expertise and the reason for participating in various social-media outlets is to provide content to validate that expertise.But at the end of the day (and behind all the business-type activity) our true passion lies with our clients and putting our heart and soul into their restaurant. You need to define your cause, attract people who are equally dedicated to it and don t lose sight of what you are trying to achieve.2. Drive team alignment.  Even though we believe in accomplishing the same goals, that doesn t mean we aren t immune from going in different directions to accomplish those milestones. Because of this, the team needs to be aligned and buy into a single direction. Five people working together and charging in the same direction will succeed more often and frequently than if we were disjointed and doing our own thing.To accomplish this, our team needs to be in constant alignment and direction.A parallel to team alignment with direction is team alignment with how we do things.  To be consistent -- with both our internal and client facing processes -- we need to have a complete understanding and clarity on how we all will operate and get work done. Either written or verbal processes need to be adopted and followed.Related: There Is No 'I' in Startup: The Importance of Having a Solid Team3. Cut out the unnecessary  red tape.  Initially, I had this notion that we needed to act like a big company and do everything a huge corporation would do. I then realized the following:We are not a big companyNeither I nor the team could create or sustain many complex proceduresHaving many overwhelming procedures is actually less efficientIf you are a small startup or just a small company, ask yourself do you have unnecessary red tape? If so, cut it.4. Ensure the team is providing you candid but constructive feedback. We do not have a shy team when it comes to expressing opinions and concerns. (Which by the way, I love.)If you don t have people challenging the way things are done, if you are stifling creativity and inventiveness and if you are not allowing dissent, then you re not going to have an engaged team. As a leader, you need to encourage diversity with thinking and approach, especially with people who have tremendous amounts of experience and a wide-ranging pallet of skills and talents. As long as the feedback is professional, has the cause in mind and will benefit our team and clients, I say, bring it on.Related: 5 Secrets to Creating Harmony Among Co-Founders5. Pace your team. Set targets and goals in small quantities that are attainable and not overwhelming. Then sprinkle in more goals and targets as your team completes them. You ll know when you set too many goals because some will start to lay dormant with no action. If you are laying out reasonable goals for your team, and they are simply not doing what they are supposed to, then you may have other issues on your hands.6. Keep communication constant and centralized. One of the most important elements to a team is constant communication. Whether that is e-mail, phone meetings, in-person meetings or Skype, having open channels of communication is crucial to a company's success.Another component to your strategy should be utilizing a centralized communication hub. We use Basecamp, an app that provides us various tools to stay organized. Having this structure is extremely helpful when files, events, brainstorming sessions, tasks and other items build up.Related: Finding a Kick-Ass Team for Your StartupDavid KojiDavid Koji is CEO of evolvor.com, an online marketing and advertising agency based out of New Jersey, specializing in search engine and content marketing that converts into real results.Read more",Inspiring Your Team,2014-02-19 16:30:00

Subscribe  Secret lovers, yeah, that's what we are. According to a survey of employees and HR professionals by the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM), 42 percent of businesses had instituted either written or verbal workplace-romance policies, up 20 percent from 2005. However, 75 percent of HR professionals believe having employees sign ""love contracts"" is ineffective and simply causes them to hide their interoffice relationships. Evren Esen, SHRM's Survey Research Center manager, explains.What did you find surprising in the survey results?
We asked employees whether they've been involved in a workplace romance, and I think the difference between what employees admit (24 percent say they have been involved) and what HR professionals are saying (43 percent have been aware of relationships) stands out.What are the best and worst kinds of relationships to have at work? 
In 53 percent of relationships, employees are in different departments. These are the best type because they're not actually in the same workplace. They may have a relationship, but it's not necessarily something that others may be involved in or aware of. I think the worst type of relationship is between a supervisor and his or her direct report, which were found in 8 percent of organizations. Proximity is an important guideline; the closer the proximity, the more likely it is to have a negative impact.Over a five-year period, about 50 percent of HR respondents saw flings turn into long-term relationships or marriages.
Work is a big part of many individuals' lives, so romances can turn into long-term relationships. It's not so surprising ... it's just that there need to be some boundaries and guidelines to ensure that their relationship will not lead to unfair or perceived unfair treatment.John Patrick PullenBased in Portland, Ore., John Patrick Pullen covers travel, business and tech for Men's Journal, Fortune and others.Read more",Growth Strategies,2014-02-14 17:00:00

/article/231496,Inside Netflix's No-Intern Policy ,A Quora discussion sheds some light on why Netflix chooses not to hire interns. ,"																																			It can be tough for college students to find an internship in technology. Companies like Amazon offer programs that challenge students but make the application process rigorous.However, the same isn't true for Netflix.We found a discussion thread on Quora explaining why Netflix doesn't hire interns. The thread contained six responses from people claiming to be current and former employees at the company.Here are some of the responses:James Schek, Netflix Content Delivery Network.Schek explains that Netflix doesn't need to hire interns since it doesn't hire new graduates or junior developers. Netflix is not an entry-level company:""Netflix generally does not hire interns, recent college graduates, or junior level developers. There are exceptions for exceptionally skilled candidates or someone with a very rare skill.
""There is also no formal career development or structured ladder at Netflix. Employees do not start from a 'bottom' and are guided towards particular paths. Employees are expected to choose their own path and take ownership of their own career development -- the company won't do it for you. Usually, internships are part of a company's career development strategy, whether formal or informal.
""Internships are also a recruiting strategy to increase the pool of qualified college graduates or gain access to university researchers. Those interns can be thought of as the beginning of a 'pipeline' that eventually produces senior engineers and managers.
""Since Netflix does not employ new graduates or junior developers, it negates many of the reasons to hire interns. Netflix is able to compete for senior level developers against other valley companies so there's no need to create awareness among early-career engineers, to create a career pipeline for training engineers/managers, or create a more positive image among college students entering the market.
""Basically, the benefits don't justify the cost.""Roy Rapaport, Manager, Insight Engineering, at Netflix""Netflix's internal culture (see Culture) is built to optimize speed of innovation by making decision-making as decentralized and distributed in the organization as possible; that means we expect decisions to be made at the absolutely lowest possible level of the organization, and our engineers are, to a great degree, expected to operate in a self-directed way. For this, you need to have a great degree of context as to what's important to us, and some experience to know how to use that context.""That's not an environment that, generally speaking, going to be conducive for interns to be successful in -- They require more hand-holding and active mentoring, and will end up impacting the organization in a less significantly positive way than the other employees.""Rob Fagen, Engineering Services Manager at CheggFagen claims he used to work for Netflix, but this was his response:""When I was at Netflix, I heard it put quite succinctly: if you don't get a puppy, you don't have to clean up its messes.""Essentially, the comments reveal that Netflix wants to recruit the best candidates possible. The company culture isn't ideal for interns to learn and grow. Internships are usually seen as a great way for companies to find new employees, but Netflix doesn't need them to find candidates.More from Business InsiderThere's way too much weed in CaliforniaThere's a funny debate about whether the screenwriter for Steven Soderbergh's new movie is a real personTrump's top Middle East adviser fired for unknown reasonsRyan BusheyRyan is a technology reporter for Business Insider with a focus on apps and gadgets.

/article/231484,"Who Art Thou, Chief Digital Officer?","The CDO position is something every company should have, but how do you fill it when you don't understand it?","It s hard to find something if you don t know what you re looking for.Just ask professional recruiters tasked with finding the elusive chief digital officer (CDO). A recent Gartner poll of executive search experts found that uncertainty about what s expected of a CDO results in flawed searches for these digital leaders. Many business leaders realize the importance of going digital, but that s where their clarity (and experience) ends.Part of the problem is that  digital,  in the context of an enterprise, was for years treated as yet another channel, alongside brick-and-mortar stores or resellers. Now, however, with the new expectations of smartphone- and tablet-equipped customers, employees and partners, the word  digital  has taken on greater meaning, with implications across the whole enterprise. And it s no longer a silo or channel to be managed, but a critical strategy for overall business success.In fact, the CDO has little to do with the traditional practices of IT, making it difficult to define the new role by business function. Broadly, the mandate of the CDO is to lead an enterprise through a digital transformation -- the evolution that adds a digital dimension to the experiences of everyone a business touches. At the heart of leading this digital transformation is a vision that takes into account the implications of technology for every aspect of doing business. This requires a brand new perspective rather than what exists today at most enterprises.Related: 3 Ingredients to Building a Digital Brand From ScratchWho can be a digital leader? Traditionally, a chief information officer (CIO) or chief technology officer (CTO) primarily focused on the question of how to make a company more efficient by deploying technologies inside a company. But digital transformation requires shaping the market position of a company by fully exploiting the potential of a digitally transformed world outside a company. This requires that brand new perspective mentioned above, understanding the relevance of technology to creating differentiated experiences for customers, partners and employees.The importance of digital transformation intersects with many existing roles in an organization, but it needs a leader. And while it would appear anyone could be a CDO, not everyone can be the right kind of digital leader, which presents the wall professional recruiters often run into when searching for a CDO.A CDO by any other name   First, it is important to note that while an enterprise might create a brand new role, it can also assign the important responsibility for digital transformation to another executive. Tomorrow s CDO may well be an evolution of another role in existence today.Arguably the most powerful  CDO-style  strategic impact to date was made by someone who isn t a CDO at all: Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos. In 2002, Bezos declared that all internal Amazon systems would be built from then on to be  externalizable,  a move that truly transformed the company and gave birth to many of its market-leading services.Related: Richard Branson on Finding Talented People Who Can Grow Your BusinessIndeed, Amazon (or Facebook or LinkedIn) will probably never have an executive title of CDO. At companies like these, you could easily add  digital  to everyone s title today. Creating value with digital assets has been inherent in every leadership role at Amazon and similar digital native companies from day one, and it s a big part of their success.Creating the right framework for filling the CDO role -- and, by extension, launching a successful digital transformation -- requires a recognition that every department and every executive position should embody the same passion for creating value with digital assets as the top digital natives do. This digital commitment then will become the determining factor for which companies thrive, or fail, in every industry.How to spot a CDO in the wild. Now back to the original question: what to look for in a CDO?The key is to first understand the most important traits of a digital leader, regardless of title. And these traits might not be the ones you would expect, according to research from the Apigee Institute. Surprisingly, traits that aren t correlated with the most successful digital leaders include willingness to take risks and intellectual curiosity. According to the research, companies in search of a digital leader are better off looking for individuals who are visionary, persuasive and adaptable, and who have strong social and business networks.Gartner research also found that senior executives who search for a CDO to mirror their rivals run a significant risk of failing in their digital business initiatives. Ultimately, having clarity and vision about your own business and digital transformation is step one. This combined with identifying the leadership traits above will be the best indicators of success for companies embarking on a digital transformation and putting the right leader in place to get them there.Related: How to Find Great Candidates by Looking Past the ObviousBryan KirschnerBryan Kirschner is the director of the Apigee Institute, a research and strategy organization that helps companies succeed in today's app economy and tomorrow's programmable world.

/article/231415,Beware! Is a 9-to-5 Schedule Turning Employees Into Zombies?,"Some employees suffer from social jetlag, causing them to not work to their fullest potential. Here are some ways to cure this aliment and get them back on track.","We've all heard of travel jetlag. You know that surreal, confused and disconnected state of tiredness -- the feeling of being out of sync with the world around you. But researchers are now highlighting another sort of jetlag, one where no travel is required, yet the same off feeling may ensue. The term is social jetlag, and it occurs when there is a misalignment between biological and social sleep patterns, causing many people to be unproductive in a typical 9-to-5 working day.So how exactly does social jetlag affect businesses? What does it mean to entrepreneurs? And what can employers do to manage it effectively?The findings on social jetlag suggest when we sleep could be more crucial than how much sleep we get. And for many people, the socially-mandated waking and typical 9-to-5 schedule could conflict with their natural biological rhythms.Related: Steer Clear of Burnout With These 5 TipsThe impact on business. What does this mean for entrepreneurs and managers? Essentially, that many workers are out of sync with their daily working schedules. A third of workers suffer from ""extreme"" jetlag -- a sleep misalignment of more than two hours. Many more people suffer from milder misalignment of up to an hour. This misalignment impacts performance and productivity, leading to reduced creativity and problem-solving capacity.In addition to negatively affecting performance and productivity, social jetlag can have serious health consequences: increased smoking and higher caffeine and alcohol consumption, along with a greater risk of obesity. Social jetlag also appears to be more problematic in darker months and following periods of weekend readjustment to natural cycles, which may partially explain sickness trend data showing more frequent staff absences during winter months and on Mondays.When the issues associated with social jetlag are compounded with the effects of sleep inertia (the gradual awakening of the brain each morning) the picture is bleak: An unhealthy, chronically fatigued, zombie-like workforce more likely to fall asleep at their desks than perform effectively.Related: Yes, You Can Sleep In and Still Be SuccessfulFinding a working solution
Clearly, the evidence shows that sub-optimal timing, quality and quantity of sleep is detrimental to work. So what s the answer?1. Rethink the concept of  office hours . If a traditional 9-to-5 day doesn t work for everyone, why make everyone work a 9-to-5 day. To minimize the impact of social jetlag on your business, there s a strong argument for adjusting your company s working day to accommodate the natural sleeping patterns of both ""A-people"" (early risers) and ""B-people"" (late risers).2. Schedule meetings based on sleep research. If the data shows that a third of your team is jetlagged at nine in the morning and everyone else is suffering from sleep inertia, why schedule a creative session, project collaboration or client meeting for the same time? If you can t tear up your company policy on working hours, the least you can do is arrange meetings that demand alertness and clear thinking for later in the day.3. Assign work tasks for optimal performance times. Would you try and do complicated, original or innovative work while you were jetlagged from a flight? No. So don t try it at the office. In the same way that formal meetings should be adjusted to mitigate sleep issues, day-to-day tasks can be structured around jetlag and inertia. How? Guide people to perform ""auto-pilot"" tasks such as email checking, document formatting and admin-type work for early mornings and leave work that requires creativity and complex problem-solving for later.4. Encourage staff to manage their sleep better. Using normal alarms to wake you up is a bit of a lottery - fixed times and snooze buttons can be detrimental.

/article/231383,5 Attributes to Look for in High-Performing Employees,Finding impactful staff members takes a lot of hard work. Here are the attributes one company screens for in their candidates.,"Free Webinar | August 16thFind out how to optimize your website to give your customers experiences that will have the biggest ROI for your business.							Register Now  With so much attention paid to innovations and disruptive business models in the venture capital and startup world, it can be easy to overlook the vital importance of great people.I keep a quote from legendary venture capitalist Arthur Rock in mind when hiring:  What I m interested in is investing in people. Of course, every company wants stellar employees who are impactful, high performers. Identifying those high performers, however, takes hard work in recruiting, screening resumes and interviewing.  Here are five key attributes that CircleUp looks for in candidates, in no order:Related: Why Hiring Exclusively for Experience Doesn't Make SenseHorsepower: I ll take intelligence over experience any day of the week. Job descriptions alone can intimidate a lot of people -- particularly younger people, who often feel that they lack the experience that the job description suggests they will need. That s unfortunate, because I ve found that most of the time intelligence trumps experience. An intelligent candidate can quickly learn a job and frequently ends up doing it better than someone (less intelligent) who has been doing a similar job elsewhere. Experience is certainly valuable, but brains are the horsepower that drives the business.Ownership and pride: ""Run the mile you are in."" This is a distance-running mantra from Runner's World Editor-in-Chief David Willey that I think applies to many aspects of our personal and professional lives. No matter your current job or where you are in your career, are you focused and engaged and do you take ownership? Do you have pride in what you are doing? Do you have pride in your colleagues and your company?  Run the mile you are in  applies not only to distance running; it applies to life, and it applies to how you will succeed -- or not -- as a teammate in business.Work ethic: What we are doing -- redefining the private equity investing model and bringing fresh capital to consumer goods startups -- requires both smart and hard work. We achieved strong growth in 2013, our first full year in business, because our team works very hard. It s more than that, really. It s teamwork that is self initiated. The valued employee is not only the one willing to work hard; she is the employee who searches out ways to contribute most. She should have a work history of having demonstrated not only a willingness to contribute, but a desire to lead, come up with ideas on her own and to grasp fully the feeling of pride in his or her accomplishments.Related: Hiring a 'Newbie' vs. an Industry ProIntegrity: This is an attribute that is not always easy to flesh out. But it is too important to gloss over in the interview process. I try to gauge integrity by asking interviewees for examples of difficult decisions they have had to make or ethical dilemmas they've faced. I'm looking for candid responses as to how they handled these situations. What was their decision-making process?Teamwork: This is my version of the  no jerks  rule. So much of what we do involves collaboration that we must have team players across our business. It is good for business results and our corporate culture. I ve met nice people who just weren t effective teammates, but I haven t met a lot of great team players who were jerks. This is what Reed Hastings, in his manifesto Netflix Culture: Freedom & Responsibility, calls selflessness. I want people who are ego-less and put the interests of the company above their own and are eager to share information and help their co-workers.This year, we will hire a substantial number of new employees. We ve had great success in our first two years recruiting fantastic talent. I see it in our productivity and growth, and in the endorsements we receive both from investors and startups. It is also evident in the engagement and enthusiasm I see among our team members -- smart, hard-working people thrive alongside other smart, hard-working people.Related: What Makes Job Seekers Lie on Their Resumes?Ryan CaldbeckRyan Caldbeck is the founder of San Francisco-based CircleUp, which provides an online investing marketplace that supports direct equity investments from individual investors into privately held consumer and retail companies.

/article/231354,This Simple Strategy Will Make You the Top Candidate for Any Job,"What does Netflix, comedian Jack Moore and you finding the perfect job have in common? Hint: You won't find it on your resume.","If you read most articles about the world of job seeking, hiring and employment these days, it all sounds so easy. Countless online-business publications snare readers with headlines like  5 things you shouldn t eat before a job interview  or  How to tell if applicants are lying about their last job  (or even the headline to this article). These litanies of tips and tricks play right into the notion that effort isn t really required. That somehow just by studying the game, you can avoid the traps and master the tricks. That you can find the job or employee of your dreams and do it with little true investment.Most job searchers believe that a few key adjustments to a one-page resume, submitted to the best job board and optimized to catch eyes is all it takes. Hit send and hope for the best. Employers too buy into the promise of shortcuts and immediate results. As if it s quick and simple to find the next man up when someone goes down. As if the employment landscape is a plug-and-play world of new faces claimed on an as-needed basis. It s maddening, short-sighted and ironically, it could be a cause of the job crisis in this country. While there are some 10.2 million unemployed in the US, there are also some 4 million open jobs in our country. What we have is a lack of thoughtful pursuit of both quality employees and desirable career opportunities. Because in the torrent of tips and tricks, job seekers rarely get substantive advice on how to connect, engage and relate to an industry or career, let alone build the kind of personal brand that brings employers knocking.Related: 10 Questions to Ask When Recruiting New Employees OnlineClosing the employment gap requires a radical reimagining of how to navigate the job market. Many employers are less interested in the employment history you ve polished up on your resume and more eager to see what you can do for them today. Job seekers must work hard to prove that they can offer true value for their industry, their community and their future employer by developing content that s informative, enlightening, even entertaining. By doing so, they show firsthand the talents and abilities they could bring to the job rather than simply telling employers about them through a resume.The path forward will be paved by the kind of disruptive change that we ve seen in the entertainment industry over the past few years, as movies and broadcast TV have been threatened by upstart Netflix.Once the mail-order version of Blockbuster (without the late fees or the annoying burden of returning a DVD the day after viewing), Netflix today represents 31.6 percent of downstream U.S. Internet traffic. And it s solidifying viewer loyalty by doing the difficult task of creating its own content. Free from the expectations of the industry, Netflix is producing its own Emmy-award winning program, House of Cards, and the highly popular Orange is the New Black. And they are serving it up in an all-you-can-eat, binge-watching fashion that audiences love to coagulate around during a rainy Saturday or a day off from work. Related: Netflix Goes Where No Customer Service Has Gone BeforeNetflix s efforts will forever be linked to the moment in time when viewers shifted their habits toward streaming video content and away from traditional outlets. But more importantly, the company s knockout TV shows add a new, enticing dimension to its brand while proving to viewers that it s as creative and artful as the best in the business. It committed time and energy to the work of developing great stories. This is the kind of effort that draws viewers in droves, and one Netflix s competitors are now scrambling to duplicate. The job market is primed for a similar disruption, and to some extent, it s already begun. Candidates are advancing their career opportunities by doing the hard work of creating standout content and singular brands that truly capture attention, loyalty and opportunity. And that s the secret to getting that dream job: Be like Netflix and create content tailored to your audience to prove you re the ideal candidate.That s exactly what comedian Jack Moore did. Aspiring to be a sitcom and screenplay writer, he demonstrated his talent through the popular Modern Seinfeld Twitter feed, which offers storylines for what George, Jerry, Elaine and Kramer would be up to in today s world. His months of artful execution have led him to his dream job as a screenwriter.  He shattered the confines of the old resume-centric world of job searching by taking the focus off of himself -- the heart of any resume -- and homing in on his audience. Instead of talking about his skills, he used them. He buckled down and proved he could do the job without being asked and made sure potential future employers would take notice. His efforts parallel those of Netflix, which continues to produce its creative best to box out traditional channels and win wider audiences.The kind of disruption and success Netflix has achieved -- and the kind the job market sorely needs -- isn t easy and can t be neatly summarized in a tip or trick. Because it s no trick. It s the sum total of thought, effort and dedication. It s a new ideology guiding the way job seekers think about their careers and transforming the way employers search for talent.Related: The Ultimate Social Media Guide to Getting a Job (Infographic)Joel CapperellaJoel Capperella is vice president of marketing for Yoh, a Philadelphia-based staffing and recruiting firm.

/article/231369,3 Surprising Biases That Could Hold You Back,These factors could be against you when you're trying to get ahead. Here's how to overcome them.,"Getting your startup funded, snagging a juicy promotion or getting hired at a  best-place-to-work  company is a long shot these days. Stiff criteria and even stiffer competition can keep your dreams of launching a business or managing one just out of reach.But are the reasons some of us don't get ahead always fair or even rational?Bias, unconscious or not, often creeps into the decisionmaking that determines the fates and fortunes of entrepreneurs and aspiring executives.  See if one of these biases could potentially trip you up on the ladder to success.Related: 3 Ways to Boost Your 'Executive Presence' While Pitching for FundingPardon my French. A recent study by Wharton management professor Laura Huang could spell bad news for English speakers with a non-native accent. In her paper in the Journal of Applied Psychology titled  Political Skill: Explaining the Effects of Non-Native Accent on Managerial Hiring and Entrepreneurial Investment Decisions,  Huang finds that entrepreneurs and aspiring executives with foreign accents are passed over for startup funding and management positions far more than their competition.  This xenophobia-tinted glass-ceiling is the result of the greater business community s perception that non-native English speakers lack  political skill,  including  effective and competent communication  as well as  the ability to be perceptive and influence others,  according to Huang s research.  Piling on to this bias is angel investor and co-founder of Y Combinator, Paul Graham, who recently said that one of the  tells  in determining whether a startup s going to boom or bust is a CEO's foreign accent. Graham was quoted as saying,  One quality that's a really bad indication is a CEO with a strong foreign accent. For those looking to get ahead, the implications are clear: A foreign accent can be a show-stopper if the speaker is indeed difficult to understand, at which point language lessons and dedicated practice can yield better outcomes. But if clear communication is not an issue, turn it into a positive by pointing out the diverse perspectives (most companies these days acknowledge the value of diversity) you bring to the table and assure that your cultural background will be an asset.Are you invisible? Leadership positions often call for individuals who are visible in the organization and publicly take a stand for issues they believe in. For introverts, these behaviors are neither natural nor easy to exhibit. As a result, those with quiet personalities and shy demeanor are often seen as lacking drive and ambition by their superiors, as a recent Wall Street Journal article reports. Many experience being passed over for promotions to upper management due to what is perceived as an inability to influence and project executive presence.Related: 5 Must-Know Public Speaking Tips for IntrovertsFor those who feel out of place among extraverts, realize that you don t have to change your personality. Instead, take small steps in changing your behavior by speaking up more often, participating in meetings and taking opportunities resulting in increased visibility. It may not be comfortable, but it will become easier with repeated effort and should soon show results.  Careless social media activity. Hiring managers and corporate decision-makers are all digitally tuned in these days and actively seek intel about candidates that would inform their recruiting decisions.  Inflammatory tweets and risqu  Facebook postings pose obvious challenges, though absence of any information online about accomplishments can also cast doubt on your judgment and potential value to an organization. At minimum, a profile on LinkedIn is expected to show you ve not missed the technology train entirely.A LinkedIn profile, however, isn t going to do you any favors unless it is well organized, updated to current status and optimized to make clear what you bring to the table.Mind your photo too. A recent study by TheLadders.com, a New York City-based employment website, shows that recruiters spend about 19 percent of their time on a profile analyzing the picture. In a minute of profile scanning, that s a long 12 seconds (try it yourself) of judging a book by its cover.So exchange that profile picture that looks like a back-to-the-walls hostage photo to an approachable smile in a professional headshot.For those who are in a hiring or other decision-making function, it helps to realize that we re probably not aware of our biases. Therefore, we ought to get feedback from others and check our assumptions rather than give in to snap judgments. Remember, we re all human.Related: 3 Ways You Might Be Screwing Up Your LinkedIn Profile and How to Avoid ThemHarrison MonarthHarrison Monarth is an executive coach, leadership consultant and the New York Times bestselling author of The Confident Speaker, and the business bestseller Executive Presence.

/article/231352,What Makes Job Seekers Lie on Their Resumes?,The reason behind a fraudulent resume?  Try envy. ,"The next time you come across a resume that's too good to be true, add a couple of extra items to the ""abilities"" segment: envy and immorality.Experts say people who lie on their CVs are likely to have been unemployed for a long time and appear to be motivated by jealousy for other people who have landed jobs when they haven't.""Envy was one of the things we found that really mattered,"" said Michelle Duffy, a professor of work and organizations at the University of Minnesota, and the co-author of a paper on resume fraud.Resume fakers are also worth catching, because the researchers found that those who are comfortable exaggerating their skills also are more comfortable being immoral in other ways.Take the case of ex-trader Mathew Martoma, the SAC Capital Advisers employee who was convicted Thursday of conspiracy and securities fraud charges. Years before the trading scandal, court transcripts revealed that he had been expelled from Harvard after forging a Harvard transcript to submit for a clerkship.""If you hire somebody who's misrepresented their resume, not only might you get somebody who has lesser qualifications but you might get somebody who's likely to steal from the organization or commit other types of fraud,"" said Brian Dineen, an associate professor management at Purdue University who also co-wrote the paper on fraud.""If you hire somebody who has misrepresented their resume, not only might you get somebody who has lesser qualifications but ... somebody who's likely to steal from the organization or commit other types of fraud,"" said Brian Dineen, an associate professor management at Purdue University and a co-author of the paper.The researchers found that people who lied didn't necessarily start out intending to embellish or fake their credentials. But the longer they were unemployed with no job in sight, the more tempting it became.Dineen likens it to sticking to that New Year's resolution: During the first week of January it was probably pretty easy to get to the gym and avoid the chocolate box, but by mid-February it's harder to be so virtuous.""Job seekers will channel their envy toward greater effort early on,"" Dineen said. ""But then later on they will channel their envy toward resume fraud.""It's not clear how often people embroider or fabricate parts of their resume. A survey of hiring managers released by CareerBuilder in 2008 found that nearly half of those surveyed had caught someone lying at some point. Less than 10 percent of workers surveyed admitted to lying.A CareerBuilder survey from 2012 found that nearly three in 10 hiring managers surveyed had caught someone using a fake reference.Sherry Dixon, senior vice president with the staffing firm Adecco, said that though she has seen a rise in the number of people intentionally lying on a resume in the past three to five years, it's still a small minority.People are more likely to exaggerate some aspect of their experience, such as their contribution to a particular project, than to fake a credential, such as a diploma.Technology has made it easier to check credentials, Dixon said, but it also has made it easier to fake them. People can create websites for fictitious companies and buy credentials from Internet-based ""diploma mills.""Often, she said, candidates have been telling the lie for so long that it can be tough to catch until the company starts verifying education, checking references and running a background check.""They're good,"" Dixon said.There are plenty of high-profile cases of people who have paid a price for resume fraud. Perhaps the most famous case is Frank Abagnale, who pretended to be everything from a pilot to a pediatrician. His life story was made famous by the book and film ""Catch Me If You Can.""More recently, many people were outraged when the sign language interpreter at Nelson Mandela's memorial turned out to be an imposter who made unintelligible gestures.Despite the high-profile cases, people who embellished their resumes seemed to think it was acceptable--reasoning that people do it all the time and that there was a low likelihood of exposure, according to the University of Minnesota's Duffy.They may not feel too bad about it, either.Duffy said her previous research has shown that people feel all right about bad behavior at work as long as they don't get caught.""People tend not to feel guilty if they get away with it and are successful,"" she said.More from CNBCAsia markets largely gain after Fed holds rates steady and corporate earnings come throughChina's banks are now stable as 'shadow' banking looks less threatening, Moody's saysHere are the two top places where WPP will be putting ad dollars this year, according to CEO SorrellAllison LinnAllison Linn is a senior business and economics reporter.

/article/231164,Prepping for Obamacare? Why Not Every Business Should Shift to Part-Timers.,"If you're thinking of shifting your workforce to part-timers, ask yourself these questions first. ","Next year, all companies with 50 full-time workers or full-time equivalents will have to offer health insurance under the terms of the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare. So if you re the manager of a growing company, you might be tempted to hire only part-timers or to switch some of your full-timers to part-time positions so you can stay under that threshold.Before you embrace the part-time workforce, though, you need to do some serious analysis. Figuring out if a part-time staff is a good idea depends on a variety of factors, including your industry, the types of positions you offer, and the corporate culture you want to create.  If you re going to go part time, the biggest concern is what caliber of people you re going to have,  says Tom Gimbel, founder and CEO of LaSalle Network, a staffing firm in Chicago.  You need to determine if the job can work around the hours. As you research your options, keep these questions in mind. What types of people or training do these roles really require?
Some job functions are a great fit for part-timers, Gimbel says, including retail salespeople and customer-service phone representatives. Those positions work well for people who aren t looking to climb a career ladder so much as they wish to supplement their incomes, such as college students and working moms.Should some functions be outsourced entirely?
Gimbel suggests also looking at high-level staffers, such as accountants, and considering whether you can turn those full-timers into part-timers or perhaps even outsource the function all together.  You need to look at your business from 30,000 feet,  he says.  If you re paying your accountant or bookkeeper full-time but you only need them part-time, maybe you should eliminate that position and hire a small CPA firm to do the bookkeeping. Does your business require long-term relationships with key clients?
Some positions need to be full-time no matter what, particularly if you re in a service-related business where clients expect to be able to form long-term working relationships with particular people. Flynn Zaiger, chief executive officer of New Orleans-based marketing agency Online Optimism recognized that fact when he started the company in late 2012. Of his five employees, he says, three are part-timers who create online content.But it s Online Optimism s two full-timers who deal directly with clients and who are always abreast on the latest happenings with those clients, so they can speak knowledgeably about each project.  There s nothing worse than a client calling and none of us knowing what they re talking about. You need to have employees who deal solely with certain clients,  he says.What can you do to ensure your part-timers don t quit?
Know that if you shift to part-timers, you need to keep them engaged or they ll jump ship to a competing company. Consider inviting everyone to a pizza lunch or a happy hour once a week, for example, and find a place to post everyone s photo, so employees who never cross paths can at least see who their colleagues are.Christopher Weir, founder and principal of Spartan Junk Removal in Laurel, Md., says he fosters camaraderie by keeping everyone informed about how the company is doing financially. Spartan employs four part-timers, most of whom are college students.  I do a lot of education with my employees,  Weir says.  I try to teach business skills. I show them that even though they see a lot of money coming in, there s a lot more going out than they expect. They get really excited about experiencing the business as a whole. Of course, most small-business experts agree that even if you re not planning to provide health benefits, you should do what you can to help your employees full-time and part-time alike to navigate their choices. Create an online library of health-related websites such as your state s online insurance exchange, Gimbel suggests, or bring in an insurance broker to personally guide each employee through the process of finding a health plan.Will providing healthcare keep you competitive?
This is perhaps the most important question of all, since at some point you will need to compete for top talent? Zaigler says he s already thinking about that, even though his company is still so small he doesn t have to worry about complying with Obamacare.  I truly believe that having happier employees is worth the cost of healthcare,  Zaigler says.  If they understand you care about them, they ll work harder.

/article/231163,The Latest Surprise About the Obamacare Health Exchanges,A new study finds a money-saving reason businesses should keep their eye on the new government exchanges. ,"According to a new report released today, average premiums offered on the new individual government healthcare exchanges are comparable to and sometimes less than their employer-sponsored counterparts.The data might intrigue business owners grappling with rising health-care costs and changes related to 2010 s Affordable Care Act. In 2017, states will have the option to open exchanges to companies with more than 100 employees. If patterns continue, exchanges could be a viable alternative for employers in coming years.The study, conducted by PwC s Health Research Institute, reviewed insurance policies from 15 state exchanges and the District of Columbia, as well as exchanges run by the government in any remaining states. Data from median and low-cost premiums were then compared to survey data of employer-sponsored premiums from 156 million people in 2013.Government exchange plans offer four plan levels: bronze, silver, gold and platinum, paying 60 percent, 70 percent, 80 percent and 90 percent of an individual's healthcare costs, respectively. Employer-sponsored plans typically pay around 85 percent of a person's healthcare costs, making the average employer-sponsored plan the counterpart of gold or platinum exchange plans.According to the study,  across the board, at every level, average exchange premiums are lower than this year s average premiums for employer-based coverage.  Researchers found that the average median premium gold plan was 8 percent lower than the national average employer premium. The average of the lowest premium for gold plans was 27 percent lower.Not factored into this analysis were subsidies that employers offer to offset costs or federal tax credits for which a majority   85 percent -- of enrollees to Obamacare are eligible.Of course, there are some important differences to note. Exchange plans often have limited choices for doctors and hospitals and much narrower provider networks. Also, the data from this study examines rates from the government exchanges  first year and it s not known if these patterns will continue.Additionally, to be a true alternative, the government s business exchanges would need to be robust. Currently, Obamacare s business exchanges offer few plan options, though that s expected to change in 2015.Still, if patterns continue, exchanges might give businesses a viable alternative that helps control costs. As the study notes, exchanges,  may provide an opportunity for employers to reexamine new approaches to providing health insurance coverage for their workers.

/article/231122,Obama Proposes Retirement Account Program That May Require Employer Action,"In his latest State of the Union address, President Obama mentioned a new savings account for employees called 'myRA.'","If the president gets his way, employers who do not offer retirement plans may need to begin managing a new program that gives employees access to a savings account.In his State of the Union address last night, Obama unveiled a new idea called  myRA,  which he billed as a starter savings account that would give Americans without access to an employer-sponsored retirement account a way to save money for retirement. While the stock market has doubled over the last five years, that doesn t help folks who don t have 401(k)s,  Obama said in his State of the Union address Tuesday. ""MyRA guarantees a decent return with no risk of losing what you put in. Related: Retiring at 27: Ambitious, Lazy or Crazy?Details on how the program would be run are scant so far, but what the White House did say in a fact sheet is that the savings account would be  available through employers.  The Treasury Department will be responsible for administering the program.And while this could spell significant new administrative work on the part of small-business owners, keep in mind that many a plan has been unveiled to much pomp and circumstance during many a State of the Union addresses and then have amounted to nothing. After all, this is politics.That said, retirement savings   or a lack thereof -- is a critical issue for many Americans. About two-thirds of workers in the U.S. report that either they or their spouse has some money saved for retirement, according to a 2013 survey from the Employee Benefit Research Institute. However, even though a majority of American workers seem to know they should be saving for their elder years, they are certainly not saving enough money to live on. Half of workers say they have less than $25,000 in total savings and investments (outside of the value store in their residence) and 28 percent have less than $1,000 in savings.  Related: Why Americans' Efforts to Save Still Don't Add Up (Infographic)One Washington, D.C.-based small-business advocacy group expressed concern over the potential burden such a program would place on Main Street.  NSBA supports making retirement savings easier, but warns that automatic IRAs put the administrative and financial onus squarely on small firms,  said Molly Brogan Day, the vice president of public affairs for the National Small Business Association, in a statement.Another small-business group felt largely neglected by the president in the State of the Union address last night.

/article/231077,5 Keys to Engaging Performance Reviews,Four hours of a manager's time can add value and improve engagement and performance.,"Many review systems follow a rigid structure that forces managers to apply the same standards to all employees -- that's not very engaging at all. Performance reviews should not be cookie cutter. Our five-step performance review process follows a simple format and is loaded with feedback, focusing on what is going well and areas for improvement. Here s what you need to do to implement it at your company:Agree with the employee to a list of reviewers (15 minutes). This step is very important. You must get a list that will give great representation of different relationships and different viewpoints. The goal is to have about 12 to 15 people provide feedback and to have all of them respond.Related: 5 Steps to Better Performance ReviewsCollect feedback (15 minutes). Your goal is 100 percent response, so you need to ask nicely, remind gently and ultimately push for a reply. The 100 percent is important so you do not have bias -- you agreed to the list, so be sure you have plenty of feedback from a variety of sources. You should also submit your own feedback during this part of the process so you aren t influenced by the responses.Create a feedback document (90 minutes). Be sure to block the full 90 minutes to create the feedback document in one sitting, as this will allow you to maximize your understanding of the comments. Read each reviewers' feedback in full, and categorize them into either positive responses or opportunities for improvement. You may need to slightly alter comments so that you protect anonymity -- the goal is to give exact wording of the feedback without identifying the source of the information.Related: 10 Reasons to Scrap Year-End Performance ReviewsFirst feedback meeting -- present and discuss (60 minutes). You now need to share the feedback. Don t hand it out in advance -- the reviewee will likely read the negatives first. Instead, read it together, reflecting on strengths first. After identifying key messages in the strengths section, you re ready to move on to opportunities. Be sure that you take time and allow them to process the review with you. Do not allow the employee to leave in an emotional state, and end on a positive view.Second feedback meeting -- finalize review and agree on action plan (60 minutes). The first step in this meeting is to revisit the review -- ask the employee if they have any questions, or how they feel now that they ve had it for some time. Then, review their action plan to ensure that it is SMART   Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic and Timely. Ask them how you can help, and gain their commitment that they want to improve and see the value in doing so. Finally, set a plan for how you will review their progress on the plan on a monthly basis.Performance reviews are meant to be thoughtful, providing a chance to look at someone s overall performance from many perspectives. Four hours of a manager s time will add value and improve engagement and performance.Related: How Well Are Managers Really Evaluating Their Employees?

/article/230919,Delegating is Good. That's Why I Delegated This Headline.,Assigning your tasks to your employees or colleagues can have big benefits for your business.,"Ulysses S. Grant instructed William Sherman to seize Savannah; Nolan Bushnell hired Allan Alcorn to design Pong; Woodstock served as Snoopy's sidekick for years, faithfully performing any task that was asked. The point? Delegating works.For entrepreneurs, delegating might not mean the difference between winning or losing a civil war, but it can mean the difference between your venture's success and failure.So, consider the following benefits of delegating (or hire someone to consider them for you):Delegating gives you the freedom to move on to the next opportunity. Virgin Group founder Richard Branson said: ""I delegated the areas I struggled with to people who also believed in the project. This freed up my time to focus on what I was good at."" As founder of an entity that operates 400 enterprises, one thing he was good at was ""finding the next businesses to start up.""Related: Richard Branson on the Power of DelegationHis approach makes perfect sense: the more balls you have in the air the more likely you are to drop one or all of them. So, focus on what you are good at, hone in on the areas that are vital to your company, and delegate everything else. By getting more people involved in the juggling (including expert jugglers) fewer balls are likely to drop.If you are struggling with relinquishing the reins, then start small. Pick something relatively insignificant. Delegate that today, but don't take it back, that task stays delegated. Commit to delegate another activity tomorrow (or the following week), and then another activity the day after that. Manage the delegates, not the activities. Alternatively, identify the tasks that you put off, either because you don't like them or aren't good at them -- those are perfect fodder for delegation.Delegating increases team member engagement. While delegating small or undesirable tasks is a good start, you won't reap the full dividends until you learn to delegate the large and complicated duties.When you delegate meaningful work to a subordinate, they feel more important, and are more likely to give that task their utmost effort. It's human nature. People have an innate desire to be needed and those who feel needed will always aim to perform at a higher level than people who feel ignored or taken advantage of.Related: Stop Wasting Your Time and Learn to DelegateDelegating empowers your employees, and an empowered employee is much more likely to engage with customers and coworkers, problem solve, turn in work that exceeds expectations and offer their opinions. They are also far less likely to spend their days staring out the window, checking TMZ and logging onto Facebook.Delegating increases fresh ideas. Because delegating empowers your employees, it taps into their creativity, inventiveness and ingenuity. It urges them to bring new ideas to the table by making them feel a part of the business.Delegating also saves you from performing non-influential tasks or performing them ineffectively; it gives you the ability to focus on what brought you this far in the first place: your concepts.Delegating might not always save you frustration, it may not immediately increase your revenue tenfold, and it probably will initially add to your workload. However, over time, it will make your life easier, free up your busy day and maximize your odds to succeed.Now, if there was only a way to delegate that visit to the in-laws.Related: Become a Master Delegator in 7 Simple StepsMatthew TorenMatthew Toren is a serial entrepreneur, mentor, investor and co-founder of YoungEntrepreneur.com.

/article/230809,Finding a Kick-Ass Team for Your Startup,"Think you need a lot of money to entice a qualified team? Think again. Our VC expert Kirsten Green explains why founders should focus on vision, discipline and confidence when recruiting potential hires.","Q: When starting up, how are you able to recruit and hire talent with little or no money?
James Foo
Kuala Lumpur, MalaysiaIn our experience at my VC firm Forerunner, we believe there are three key ingredients to attracting top talent to your organization.1. Have a clear vision. The clearer you are about the company aspirations the easier it will be to draw appropriate and qualified people to your company. Identify a mission statement early on. Be specific about the opportunity you are addressing, how you plan to win and what the company will stand for. Obviously the more compelling these attributes are, the easier it will be to gain the confidence of top tier teammates. This kind of upfront effort stands to help you get the right conversations going as you start to interview (entice) people.2. Adopt a disciplined approach. Having a disciplined approach to team building, as with most all other aspects of bringing a product to market and scaling, is critical. As a founder it is an advantage to be clear about the resources and skills you need from teammates to meet short-term goals.Related: There Is No 'I' in Startup: The Importance of Having a Solid TeamOne suggestion is to develop an organizational chart that maps to your year one and year two goals specifically. Think critically about what types of leaders you need in each spot to address the core objectives by department. From there it typically makes sense to rank the order of importance (assuming resources are lean) and prioritize securing talent to address those areas first. Having essential skills on board to manage the most important aspects of launching your company stands to instill greater comfort for your team, while setting you up for success.Related: 3 Steps for Assembling a Startup Dream Team3. Inspiring enthusiasm and confidence. The best ideas are only just ideas until you are able to build and empower a team to execute against those goals. For you mission, bringing authenticity to the table and passion for the pursuit is meaningful. In general, people want to be part of something that matters -- they want to feel connected to a mission and a purpose. The most ambitious people want to have leaders they can look up. Be that person. Respect others, be fair, listen to feedback, be inspirational and confident.None of the above has to do with money. In fact, money will likely follow all of these attributes as well.Having secured funding does help provide comfort to team members that are more sensitive to financial risks, in particular. It is possible, probably likely, that many of the people you identify in the above process will not be in a position to leave their current employment in favor of your venture until you do secure financial support. That's okay, you can have key people identified and let investors know that they plan to formally join the team once proper funding is secured.Kirsten GreenKirsten Green is the founder of San Francisco-based VC firm Forerunner Ventures.

/article/230834,How Much Blame Do the Jobless Bear for Joblessness?,"Business owners have jobs and want to hire, but employers say candidates are unprepared and have the wrong attitude. What gives?","The problem with unemployment may well not rest with the employers but with the unemployed.The monthly reading on small-business optimism from the National Federation of Independent Business showed slightly more optimism among business owners in December, though still far below rates in more vibrant economies.But, tucked beneath the headline number was an interesting commentary on the American labor market. We already know, from the Labor Department, that the employment situation in the U.S. is awful. Not only are people not finding jobs, but more and more are simply dropping out of the workforce. The labor-force participation rate, which measures the percentage of people who could work and do, is at its lowest level since 1978.Related: Why Our Job Market Is Dying Before Our EyesThe general theme has been that there are no jobs to be had. Companies are only out for profit, and choose to hoard their cash rather than employ workers. If only these ""greedy"" corporations would add workers, so the argument goes, joblessness would ease. (And then, no doubt, we can start arguing more about how people are not paid enough.)But there is data to suggest capitalism isn't working against the worker. The worker is. The NFIB's report showed a strong willingness on the part of independent business owners to hire. Owners surveyed added an average of 0.24 workers per business in December. That might appear to be small (and macabre, if taken literally), but it is huge. The NFIB hasn't seen so much hiring among smaller businesses since February 2006.What's more, that figure should be bigger. Forty-eight percent of owners said they hired or tried to hire in the past three months. The ""Help Wanted"" sign is clearly up.Yet, 38 percent of employers reported they could not fill their openings because of a lack of good candidates. This is significant, something NFIB notes in its commentary: ""This is not just a 'skills' issue, but one of poor attitudes, work habits, timeliness, appearance and expectations, especially among the applicants for lower skill jobs.""Pray on that a second. Employers around the country have openings and want to hire. And they are finding people who have the backgrounds and skills to be parts of their organizations. And yet the potential workers are failing to impress, are showing up unkempt or exhibiting behaviors and attitudes that make them unattractive to the people who could give them gainful employ.Related: Entrepreneurship, Not Socialism, Is the Answer to Our Economic ProblemsIt stretches credulity. A career is a transformative event, particularly here in America. You use your skills, whether in mind or body, and apply them to help an enterprise meet its goals. In return, you are given compensation, in salary, wages and benefits, which in turn allow you to make personal economic decisions, manage your life and support the people you love. The fact that so many are not working in America is shameful, but what may be more shameful is that, at least according to those trying to hire, people are making a conscious choice to not do everything in their power to get the jobs available to them.And make no mistake, if 38 percent of those who hire are saying the candidates before them have bad attitudes, are showing up to interviews late, or are not even physically presentable, then any blame falls on those trying to get jobs, not those giving them.It may be worth an honest debate over the reasons why. For younger workers, we are already hearing calls that requirements to work for pay be abolished, with the government providing pay, jobs, security and even land. This move toward a more socialist society is growing -- and not surprising when one considers that 49.2 percent of Americans now get some sort of benefit check from the government.The safety net was supposed to be just that: an opportunity to bounce back after you fell off the highwire. Now it is a hammock, a permanent way to receive compensation, at the cost of taxpayers who often walk that same wire, spinning plates and juggling balls along the way, to support themselves. What is being lost is that free markets thrive off the power of the individual. Yes, people run into hard times. Yes, they struggle. But the ability to bounce back and set your own destiny is at the foundation of our economic system. Those individuals contribute to our economy, using their skills and determination to help create products and services that other individuals choose to buy. Individuals need to believe they are capable to succeed, and sometimes take risks to meet their personal financial goals, for the system to blossom. Some of these individuals take even more chances and start businesses, and, when those grow, they go out and hire other people, easing unemployment. In a word, that's entrepreneurship.Sadly, the economy can't work if the individual is not even taking the step to be prepared for a job interview. Businesses can't make candidates more attractive, nor can government programs. It is entirely in the destiny of that one person. So next time there's a discussion about unemployment, flip the script. If you want to talk about the rights of the worker or the plight of the jobless, perhaps a short gaze in the mirror is in order. It might give the clearest view of one of the true problems.Related: Preaching the Morality of Capitalism Ray HennesseyRay Hennessey, the former editorial director of Entrepreneur, is Chief Innovation Officer at JConnelly, an integrated communications firm in New York, and a senior advisor to Alley, a coworking community in Manhattan.

/article/230784,How to Let Go of Employees With Love and Dignity,There is nothing worse than a firing or a layoff. But you can ease your employees' pain by acting with faith and love.,"Learning to love our customers is critical to the success of any business. It's equally important to love your employees. And, with this, comes some painful situations. Unfortunately, part of having our employees includes the possibility of letting some go. Keeping your love on, as my friend Danny Silk says in his book Keep Your Love On: Connection Communication and Boundaries, makes a big difference in the workplace.There are many reasons people need to be let go. It will take faith, on your part, believing it is best for everyone. Don't forget to have faith, as well, that you'll do well. For some that might involve praying ahead of time for the entire situation. It doesn't mean that every situation will be easy -- far from it. But you will feel your best when you're not erring on the side of overly familiar or just getting 'politically correct' in the workspace.Here's how to handle layoffs, terminations and letting go of employees with both love and honor, depending on the circumstance:Culture cuts. Every company has a culture, whether you know it or not. Hopefully yours isn't filled with cliques and immaturity. A culture is the glue. It's what you determine is most important and nonnegotiable in the company.  When someone is hired who doesn't fit into your culture, be willing to let them go elsewhere. There's no need to discredit them, or act like they'll never be able to find success in someone else's soil. Put a great worker in a wrong culture and even they can go downhill fast. Be willing to let people grow -- even when it's not in your soil.Related: Why Faith Belongs In Your WorkplaceWrong-fit hires. This is when you hire the wrong person. They are a big mistake on the part of the hiring team in your organization.  Whether someone falsified their resume and knows how to play a role really well or maybe the team members interviewing wanted someone to fit a role so much they completely overlooked the warning signs -- whatever reason, someone got past the hiring gate keepers and got into your company. It should NOT happen and it costs the company money when it does. Make the exit as quick and painless as possible. No need to be degrading, intimidating or obnoxious about it. Love your employees and let them go. It's best for you AND for them. Zappos actually offers $2,000 cash if the person who doesn't fit will leave on their own.Termination by fault. This is when you hire an employee or contractor who cannot fulfill their assigned tasks and you both know it. They've been with you for quite some time and for whatever reason, they're sinking fast. The important thing is to remember that everyone has their issues, including the HR manager, CEO and executive team, but there comes a time when disciplinary actions must be taken. If someone is falsifying their time card, spending work hours on YouTube, comes into work intoxicated or whatever it is, you can't let a culture become polluted with repeated actions that aren't being corrected.  Termination does happen. Do it with honor. Make it kind. Even if you have to walk someone out of the building with the security team, do it with the least amount of emotion and abrasion possible. Then, go spend time with your team. Encourage the other team members. Have faith that everyone will be OK, the person leaving will be OK and it won't have long-term effects. Attitudes are more contagious than anything, so be careful what you are passing around the office.Related: How to Respectively Terminate EmployeesDownsizing. It's important to remember that your employees care about their life, their paycheck and their family more than they care about your company. Don't expect them to have the CEO's burden for profits, plans and company challenges. If you have to let someone go, do everything you can to make the transition as smooth as possible. If it's in the company budget, give a severance check to help out with the next week or two. If it's not, make sure that you never forget, it happens to the best of us. This is when I do my best to turn to God to keep my heart strong, my attitude bright and to really care about the people I've had to let go. We reap what we sow in life and it is true within a company as well. Love is always in order.The best exit strategy is professional, kind and loving. Far too many companies grow sterile when they have to let someone go.  Even if an employee is upset or hurt by the dismissal, everyone will benefit if love is the focus. It might not make sense right now, but in the long term, the memory will be much different than being cold. Love works and faith belongs in the marketplace. Don't be afraid to show you care. It matters.Related: The Right Way to Fire SomeoneSandi KrakowskiSandi Krakowski is a Digital Media Marketing Expert noted by Forbes as a Top 20 Women Social Media Influencer and a Top 50 Social Media Power Influencer.

/article/230661,How Hiring and Firing Employees Is Just Like Poker,When do you go 'all in' on talent or fold the hand you are dealt?,"Business, like poker, is a gamble. Some people will lose, some will win and some will simply break even. Employees are one of the most critical variables in your success at the table -- they will make or break you. You can up your odds of success by taking the following steps:Don't be afraid to go ""all in."" A good employee is almost always worth a big bet; they are like the pocket aces of the poker world. If you are fortunate enough to find one, do what you need to do to get them on board and keep them engaged.Granted, reading people isn't quite as easy as reading cards. ""Aces"" don't always announce themselves. There is a deluge of recommendations on how to identify great employees. You'll have to decide for yourself what is most valuable to you and your organization. Is it cultural fit? Is it aptitude? Experience? There's no single ""right"" answer. The best thing to keep in mind is, if in doubt, then odds are you don't have pocket aces. Don't rush a hiring decision.Betting large is a good thing, but only if you've taken the steps to figure out what kind of hand you're holding. This may involve multiple interviews in different settings with different people (e.g. other team members if this isn't your first hire). Background checks are always a good idea. People lie. A few minutes on the phone can save you from a costly mistake. Going ""all in"" with pocket nines may mean you never make it to see those pocket aces.Know your bankroll. While there is little formal research available on failure rates of small business, some statistics suggest that as many as 50 to 70 percent of small businesses fail within 18 months of opening, according to Tim Caroll, Deluxe's VP of small business engagement. One of the most common mistakes that leads to failure involves hiring too many employees or too often.Related: Think You Need to Hire? Think Again.A business with several employees will have a harder time surviving trying times than one with few employees. It really comes down to simple physics: a smaller mass allows you to adapt, change directions and surmount unforeseen obstacles (three things that you often need to do during the business's infancy). You can't win if you don't play the hand, but you also can't win by playing too many hands. Pick and choose which hands to play, keeping in mind the risks associated with being ""short stacked"" (or the errors that can be made by playing too aggressively with a flush stack).Fold your hand early. In hold'em, a 3-7 is bad hand. Sure, you can hit a straight, but the odds are against it. If you've already paid the ante and the flop doesn't bring the cards you need, it's time to fold. Too many employers make the mistake of continuing to pursue a lost cause. Perhaps because of our inherent nature, many entrepreneurs think that by sheer force of will or through coaching, they can turn a bad hand into a winner. This may be the case, but like the 3-7, the odds are against it.If you have given your employee a reasonable shot at success and it isn't working out, the best move is usually to fold. Beyond the initial ante, continuing to play can cost you -- probably much more than you realize.According to CFO Daily, there are six factors that contribute to bad employee costs. These include the cost of hiring, their total compensation, the cost of maintaining the employee, the cost of disruptions, severance and money lost on mistakes, missed business or unhappy clientele.The longer a bad employee is attached to your company, the more money you will lose. Considering direct and indirect costs, by some estimates a bad employee with a yearly salary of $62,000 can cost a company around $600,000 over a two-year period. Beyond the dollar cost, most entrepreneurs can't afford the opportunity cost associated with such a loss. Fold early and give yourself a chance to keep playing.Have patience. Mike Caro, an author, casino executive and professional poker player, once said, ""Aces are larger than life and greater than mountains."" Pocket aces are rare. You have to play enough hands to get them, but when you do, they can make all the difference. The same is true of great employees.Related: The Interview Questions You Aren't Asking But Should BeAdam TorenAdam Toren is a serial entrepreneur, mentor, investor and co-founder of YoungEntrepreneur.com.

/article/230652,These 4 Personalities Make Up Your Startup 'Dream Team',Learning the psychology of your hires can help you place them in their ideal roles.,"When you're building a startup, smart hiring is essential. You need to find the right people and place them in the right roles to create a quality product, build a strong brand and reach the right customers. In other words, you need to create a corporate ""dream team.""I learned this firsthand when starting Software Advice. Hiring was a challenge early on, but since then, we've grown our staff to over 100 people -- and for the top performers, we've gradually developed specialized roles that take advantage of their unique strengths.In an effort to better understand some of these elite employees, I recruited a business psychologist, Dr. James Maynard. With the research help of Managing Editor Holly Regan, we identified four distinct personality types that are indispensable for turning your startup into a profitable business.The matrix thinker: When you're first starting a company, you need people with big ideas. Matrix thinkers are creative problem solvers who are constantly scanning their environment for information. They are artistically expressive and ""think outside the box."" They often connect seemingly-unrelated concepts to deliver clever, revolutionary new ideas, products and processes. However, sometimes this quick thinking results in confusion, and immature Matrix Thinkers are prone to distraction, impulsiveness and chaos.Related: Richard Branson on Finding Talented People Who Can Grow Your BusinessMature matrix thinkers, on the other hand, can synthesize the information they're taking in and communicate effectively with others. They make brilliant marketing strategists, web developers, creative directors or executive-level leaders. Of course, if you founded your company, you're the original innovator -- even if you don't identify as a matrix thinker, you probably share some of the same qualities.The savant: Once you've got your big-picture strategies and campaigns worked out, you need people who can execute them. Savants are intelligent, hardworking individuals who are exceedingly talented in a single field. When free to follow their specific working routine, they can focus on projects intensely. Savants are often skilled writers, artists and engineers, and their prolific nature can make them your company's top producers. Their innate perfectionism, however, can be a double-edged sword, and immature savants tend towards social anxiety, communication problems and depression.Mature savants, however, have realized their natural talent and are driven to succeed. They can become your best content creators, designers, graphic artists or editorial directors.Related: Want to Work at a Startup? Here Is How.The champ (and their chip): Now that you have a product to sell, you need someone who can effectively move it. The champ is your quintessential salesperson: zealous, dynamic and driven to be the best. Champs are confident in their ability to succeed, and they often do. They are great communicators who read people well and don't discourage easily. However, champs also tend to wear a chip on their shoulder. Often, this chip motivates them to keep selling, even in the face of hardship. But in immature champs, the chip can manifest itself through arrogance, resentment and clashes with authority.Mature champs have learned to temper their ego, and can become high performing, charismatic leaders. In addition to sales, they flourish in management and executive-level positions.The giver: After your champs have locked in customers for your company, you'll need someone who can assist them with their requests and problems. The giver is your ideal customer service agent, always putting the needs of the customer, the company and their co-workers ahead of their own. They are team players who always follow the rules, and they are the type of people you'll find coming in early and staying late. However, this mentality can result in them giving so much that they burn out. Immature givers may have unrealistically high expectations of their team members, and their tendency to avoid confrontation can result in passive-aggressive behavior.Mature givers, on the other hand, know to speak up when there's a problem, and go above and beyond in service of the company. Besides their penchant for customer support, givers shine in executive assistance, marketing support and strategy and mid-level management.If you're a startup owner, consider hiring a workforce psychologist of your own to help you analyze your staff and identify what makes someone a top performer. When you've got a team of high achievers placed in their ideal roles, you'll be amazed at what you can achieve.Related: How to Make Your First Hire Less TerrifyingDon FornesDon Fornes is chief executive at Software Advice, an online resource for software buyers based in Austin, Texas.

/article/230678,Kidnapping by Goodyear Workers Union Proves It's No Fun Being the Boss in France,"As if the French president's plan to make companies pay ultra-high taxes on millionaire salaries weren't bad enough, businesses have to worry about kidnapping and extortion -- by their own workers.","Two Goodyear managers who had been held hostage for more than a day inside a company factory in France regained their freedom Tuesday afternoon after police intervened.French union workers, angry that the plant in Amiens was going to close, took Michel Dheilly, the plant's direction of production, and Bernard Glesser, the head of human resources, captive on Monday and held them overnight. The union was seeking assurances about bonuses and severance packages for the factory employees who will be out of jobs when the plant closes before the end of this year.Goodyear refused to come to the negotiating table as long as its employees were being held against their will.The ""boss-napping,"" as this practice is known, was yet one more entry in a history of violence that has marked the Amiens plant in recent months. In March, workers protested, burned tires and fought with riot police.Upon hearing of Goodyear's plan to sell the plant, which would put more than 1,000 people out of a job at a time when France is suffering a 10.9 percent unemployment rate, Industry Minister Arnaud Montebourg himself attempted to find a buyer for the plant last year. But so far, no one has stepped forward.France is hardly a friendly environment for companies. Late last month, the country's constitutional court gave President Francois Hollande approval to go ahead with his plan to tax salaries of 1 million euros and above at 75 percent.And the Goodyear debacle is not the first instance of boss-napping in France. During the economy's nadir in 2009, French workers of Sony, Caterpillar and other companies held managers hostage to send a message about layoffs and severance pay.But labor lawyer Sylvain Niel told the Associated Press that agreements made under such circumstances were later nullified in court. This should come as no surprise, given that the tactic amounts to a textbook definition of kidnapping and extortion. Perhaps the relatively swift conclusion to the Goodyear standoff will show union leaders once and for all that hostage-taking doesn't work as a negotiating tactic. Or perhaps not. Until kidnapping managers becomes a thing of the past, bosses in France should watch their backs.Related: How to Set Healthy Boundaries in Your WorkplaceBrian Patrick EhaBrian Patrick Eha is a freelance journalist and former assistant editor at Entrepreneur.com.

/article/230621,Still Stumped by Obamacare? Health Co-Ops May be an Option.,"Run by members, not shareholders, health co-ops might offer a strong alternative to small businesses weighing their coverage alternatives.","In the midst of the brouhaha over the botched rollout of healthcare.gov on Oct. 1, small business owners may have overlooked another source of affordable health plans: the new state health insurance co-operatives. These plans, which also launched on Oct. 1, are available in 23 states and are being funded through loans provided by the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare.If you're still looking for a health plan to put in place when the employer mandate goes into effect in 2015--or if you're too small to be subject to the mandate but want to cover your employees anyway--a health co-op may be a good option. Unlike traditional health plans offered by large insurers, co-ops are non-profit organizations that are run by their members. Initially all 23 co-ops will operate as public-private partnerships, but once they pay off their loans, full ownership will shift to their members. (""Co-op"" is actually an abbreviation for ""Consumer Operated and Oriented Plan."")That operational model can offer several benefits for small companies, says Julia Hutchins, chief executive officer of Colorado HealthOP. ""Our membership structure allows stakeholders, including small businesses, to have a say in how the profits are re-invested,"" Hutchins says. ""Profits are not going to shareholders--they're going back into reducing costs or expanding benefits, and members will have a vote in how that happens.""Co-ops also tend to be more focused on promoting wellness than traditional plans are, Hutchins says. The plans Colorado HealthOP offers have built-in incentives to keep people healthy, such as the opportunity for employees to get discounts on co-pays if they perform simple preventative actions like having an annual physical exam.There are other options for companies that want to take control of their health coverage, such as partially self-funding their insurance. But that doesn't offer as much opportunity for pooling your risk with that of other companies. Joining a professional employer organization does put you into a larger risk pool, but you'll have to hand over some control of your human-resources functions to the PEO.Co-ops often offer as many choices of coverage as private insurers do. Arizona's co-op, Meritus, for example, has 11 HMOs and PPOs on its menu. That said, for the co-ops to work as they were initially intended, they'll have to build a critical mass of members, and that has been a challenge, says Kathleen Oestreich, chief executive officer of Meritus. ""Like all insurance companies, the larger the numbers [of members] the better the risk,"" Oestreich says. Enrollment in Arizona's co-op was significantly impeded by the delayed rollout of healthcare.gov, even though anybody can enroll in Meritus without going to the exchange, Oestreich says. ""We've been fighting a tide of confusion,"" she says.Meantime, a handful of trade organizations have created private health co-ops, in response to small business owners who have been frustrated by delayed public options. One example is The Dwyer Group in Waco, Texas, which operates seven franchise companies, including GlassDoctor, Mr. Appliance, and Rainbow International, in more than 40 states. It launched a private co-op on Dec. 1 that offers a choice of three health plans, and the response so far has been ""very positive,"" says Doug Dixon, president of ProTradeNet, the division of Dwyer that's running the co-op. ""One thing we kept hearing from our franchisees was that there was too much choice out there with the Affordable Care Act and they were very confused,"" Dixon says. ""What we did was narrow down the choices for them based on our knowledge of the types of plans that would be the best fit for them.""As for the public co-ops, the ACA initially intended to create them in all 50 states, but in early 2013, loan funding was cut during the budget negotiations. If your business is based in a state that does not offer a co-op, stay tuned. In July, Sen. Mark Begich (D-Alaska) introduced a bill that would create funding for additional public health co-ops.Arlene WeintraubArlene Weintraub has over fifteen years of experience writing about health care, pharmaceuticals and biotechnology and the author of a book on the anti-aging industry, Selling the Fountain of Youth (Basic Books, 2010).She has been published...Read more",Growth Strategies,2014-01-07 13:30:00

With Our Smartphones at the Ready.Zappos CEO Tony Hsieh and Huffington Post CEO Arianna Huffington are on the roster of speakers along with top executives from Twitter, Facebook, Google, Instagram and LinkedIn. Also on the 2014 speaker rundown is Eckhart Tolle, the spiritual teacher and author of New York Times best seller The Power of Now.The annual conference, which attracted 350 attendees when it was first held five years ago, is expected to attract 2,000 attendees this year. The conference runs February 14 through 17 and tickets range from $500 to $1,500 depending on how early you reserve a spot.Related: Let Go, Keep it Simple, Move Quickly: Secrets to Being a Productive Entrepreneur (Infographic)The growing interest in the conference mirrors a growing trend in our relationship with technology: As we become increasingly dependent on mobile devices and social networks, we struggle to not feel controlled by them.

/article/230549,How to Handle Being Passed Over for a Promotion,"Besides getting fired, being passed over can be the worst thing to happen to you in your career. But it shouldn't be the end of the world.","That promotion was yours. You worked hard, all the signs were positive, and you thought it was a shoe-in.But you didn't get it.Outside of actually losing a job, being passed over is the worst professional experience you may face in your career, particularly for someone with an entrepreneurial mindset. It is a setback, and comes despite a slew of sacrifices, like missed birthdays, school concerts or vacations. You've given your life to your job. To say you're disappointed is a major understatement.But you need to get over it. While there's value in talking it out with a loved one or even with a coach or therapist, the truth is, the best thing you can do is guide yourself through some self-healing steps. Doing so will help you pick yourself up, dust yourself off and move on.1. Host yourself a pity party. Calling it a pity party might sound sarcastic, but I mean it. Go ahead and have one. Spend some time allowing yourself to work through all the emotions you feel. Let yourself be angry. Cry a little. Feel despair for a bit. Let yourself complain, whine or whatever feels right to you. Giving yourself time and validating how you feel is a necessary step in the healing process. Just make sure you put a time limit on how long you allow it to go on before moving on to step 2.Related: Reality Check: Not Everyone Deserves a Bonus2. Accept what is. You can't move on until you do. Now it's time to accept what has happened. You can't undo it. You can sit and dwell for the rest of your career, but all that's going to do is build up resentment within yourself and, no matter how hard you try, it will eventually show. You can't change what is, but you can control your responses to the situation. Knowing this will give you the power to make new choices and decisions that will lead you to the next part of your professional journey. So focus on that.3. Figure out what went wrong. Consider what you could have done better from what information you have. Then search within yourself for some answers and some conclusions. Even if you have no information at all from outside sources, you know yourself, your company and your employer well enough at this point to figure out what you might have done - or not done - to land you here. Be honest. It's very important to look in the mirror and face reality so you can learn from any mistakes you have made. Those mistakes can be something as simple as reading the situation wrong--maybe you really weren't as much of a shoe-in as you had thought. Pretending you've done nothing to bring on this situation is only going to prevent you from future success because the truth is, the truth will set you free.Related: How to Search Your Soul to Get Through a Crisis4. Solicit feedback. Get feedback from bosses, mentors, colleagues and employees. How you get feedback is completely up to you and might be different when talking with a colleague or mentor versus with an employee. But getting a temperature read on how others perceive you professionally can give you some valuable information that will allow you to make some necessary changes before embarking on the next part of your professional journey.5. Let go of the disappointment. Accepting what is is different than letting go. You must do both to move on. Once you accept what is and do some soul searching from the information you already had and the information you obtained from your research, you must let go. As I said before, you can't change what is. It is done. This promotion was not meant to be or not in the cards for you. But you can let go of the disappointment and see this not as an end, but as the beginning of a new professional chapter. Letting go helps you free yourself of the baggage that this event has left behind and make you ready for the next big opportunity to come your way.6. Figure out your next move. Should I stay or should I go? That's entirely up to you and not something you have to decide right now. But realizing that it's a choice at this point is important. Many times, when people find themselves in this kind of situation, it leaves them feeling understandably but unnecessarily powerless. But considering a strategy for moving forward is the most important thing to do now. If you feel that there is still more work to do at your current organization that may lead you to better opportunities, then by all means stay. But if you believe this is the end of the line for your career with this company, then start getting out there, network and find yourself a new venture. Doing so while you're still employed is much easier than waiting until you are terminated.Related: How to Fire Yourself With Grace

/article/230161,Think You Need to Hire? Think Again.,Asking yourself these three questions can help ensure that your company can afford to hire and will select the right person.,"As your company gains momentum, an extra pair of hands can seem vital. And it might be. But if you still don't have full funding or are relying on clients to keep your cash flowing at the right clip, moving too quickly on a hire can mean weighting yourself down unnecessarily.The truth is, even when you're sure you need a new project manager, you may really not. It's at times like this when it's important to step back and examine your plan in cold light. Before you add to your staff, ask yourself these three questions.1. How will you pay for the new hire? If you can't draw a straight line between the hire and an increase in your margin, don't do it. Too often, entrepreneurs justify new staff by pointing to their financial pipeline -- the sales they're about to close or the investment round that's soon to come through. To be sure, it's a hopeful time when you're preparing to sign a deal. But hope isn't a reason to add expense.2. Are you hiring for the right role? Say you've been hunting for a project manager but haven't found anyone who fits the bill. Then you meet a developer who's got a stellar resume along with experience as a team lead. She's looking to make a change and thinks working for you would be a gas. A better-than-hoped for solution? No.There are specific holes in your operation that need to be plugged, but this person s skills lie in other areas. This hire doesn t address your core needs which will remain unaddressed after the hire.3. How does your team feel about it? In some cases, team members may be clamoring for a new hire to help them keep things going and retain their sanity. If that's the case, your job is to ask them about how a new person will streamline their work, help them accomplish more and strengthen the business's finances. In other cases, you may have decided on your own that the team needs help which it might not. Talk to staffers about what they need since their problems could be solved a number of ways that don t involve new staff, including by adding technology or even getting other departments to pitch in during rare busy times. By surveying your staff, you ll get a fuller picture of your team s needs.And don't forget hiring s personal dimension. Bringing in a developer may get your existing developer's nose out of joint if he believes he's got everything under control. While his feelings may or may not change your mind, consulting with all involved will help you identify any challenges you'll have to address to keep everyone happy and productive.

/article/230396,Still Sorting Through Your Company's Healthcare Options? We Can Help,"December enrollment deadlines for many health plans \u2013 including Obamacare's new SHOP exchanges \u2013 are looming. Signup can be tricky and complex, but we help you navigate your choices.","As if the Obamacare rollout hasn t been confusing enough, there s now another complication to contemplate: the Small Business Health Options (SHOP) exchange will not accept online enrollments until November 2014. SHOP, which provides insurance plans for companies with fewer than 50 employees, was designed to make it easy for small business owners to provide affordable health care, but the inability to enroll online certainly complicates the task.Now what? First, it's important to understand the scope of this latest Obamacare delay. Companies interested in shopping for a SHOP plan can still do so you can view available plans on the federal site. But to enroll, you ll need to go to a broker or straight to the insurance carrier offering the SHOP plan you choose.If you live in a state that has its own healthcare exchange, this delay might not affect you at all. Some states, including California and Colorado, have fully functional SHOP exchanges up and available for online enrollments. Check your state s exchange for details on the deadline to enroll for a plan effective January 1, 2014. On the federal exchange the deadline was extended to December 23, and many states have followed suit.Most insurance experts agree there are still some companies that should endure the hassle of enrolling in a SHOP plan: those who are eligible for tax credits. That's because despite the latest delay, it is still true that you must purchase a SHOP plan to get a tax credit in 2014. And for a small subset of companies particularly those with fewer than 10 employees and average wages of $25,000 or less the credits can be significant.Be aware, though, that plan choices for 2014 may be limited and could vary significantly by state, advises Cameron Kennedy, chief financial officer of Cambridge Consulting Group in Troy, Mich. ""From what I ve learned from our carriers here in Michigan, the bottom line is there will always be more plan options and more flexibility off the SHOP,"" Kennedy says. ""The only real benefit to going to SHOP is you have to be on a government exchange to get that small business tax credit.""If you choose to ditch the SHOP option, but you still want to provide health benefits, you may be able to purchase a low-cost 2013 plan but you have to act fast. If you already have a plan in place and you renew it by the end of December, you may be able to lock in your current premiums, thereby avoiding the rate increases expected across-the-board for plans that comply with the Obamacare regulations that go into effect January 1. Or you can enroll in a new plan, and choose an effective date of December rather than January.Anthony Lopez, manager of the small-business group at Mountain View, Calif.,-based eHealthInsurance, says small companies are racing to purchase 2013 plans. ""We re getting a flood of calls from customers saying 'I've seen the January rates. I need to get a quote for a December 15th effective date,'"" Lopez says. ""It s one of the busiest Decembers I can remember."" Many carriers are now giving companies until Christmas to apply for a 2013 plan with a December effective date, Lopez says.One positive outcome of the ongoing delays not only with the health exchanges, but also with the employer mandate for companies with more than 50 employees is that entrepreneurs now have plenty of time to educate themselves about their options for 2015, says Rick Ninneman, Colorado regional director of Poms & Associates Insurance Brokers in Denver. ""Employers have an opportunity to gain a level of education that will allow them to make high-quality decisions about what s appropriate for their companies,"" Ninneman says. The small companies his firm advises are looking into a range of options beyond the exchanges, he says, including self-funding their health plans or joining professional employer organizations so they can bring their costs down by being included in a larger pool of employees.Entrepreneurs should keep an eye out for more health plan choices to emerge next year. For example, private insurance exchanges which were traditionally offered only to large companies are starting to reach out to small employers. Several brokerage firms, including Cambridge Consulting, plan to launch insurance exchanges specifically for small companies next year. Brokers, Kennedy explains, ""can negotiate with carriers to get favorable provisions and to offer three or four plans to an employer group,"" Kennedy says. ""Plus the technology for online enrollment has really improved. Private exchanges at the small-group level are going to work well.""

/article/230355,Mandela Event Interpreter 'Mistake' Offers Big Hiring Lesson,The hiring of a schizophrenic man as the interpreter for Nelson Mandela's memorial service is a bold reminder that employers need to go the extra mile when screening job candidates.,"When hiring staff for your company, some people you bring on are obvious rock stars. Others may be gambles. But you want to avoid hiring disasters at all cost.At the memorial service this week for former South African president and anti-apartheid champion Nelson Mandela, event organizers hired an interpreter to translate what was being said for viewers who are hearing impaired. What they got, however, was schizophrenic man who translated words into gibberish.In an interview with the Associated Press, the man explained that he hallucinated that angels were entering the stadium where the event was taking place. He continued while trying not to panic since there were ""armed policemen around me,"" he said. In a press conference following the event, A South African deputy cabinet minister said ""a mistake happened"" in the hiring of the interpreter.Employers need to be sensitive when hiring people with health conditions but this goes to show that going the extra mile when screening your job candidates is an absolute must. In this situation, a schizophrenic man was standing alongside some of the most powerful and important people in the world, including U.S. President Barack Obama.Related: 8 Inspirational Quotes on Leadership, Courage and Success From Nelson MandelaWhen hiring for your company, keep these basic yet essential tips top-of-mind:Ask open-ended questions.
Go beyond simple questions that elicit one-word or obvious responses. Asking open-ended questions can get candidates to offer additional details about themselves and their work history.""Tell me about your last job"" is one example. Once the candidate responds you can ask follow up questions like ""Why did you do that?"" to get more detail.Look beyond the facade.
Some job candidates look good on paper. Some still look good after answering some textbook interview questions. Dig deeper by asking unusual or more specific questions. The person's answers can give you better insight about how he or she will react under pressure and hint whether the person might be a solid fit for the culture of your team.Also pay attention to nonverbal cues, such as attire and whether the person seems attentive. Theses can tell you a lot about a person, too.Check references.
This is big. A person can sell him or herself to you any way he or she wants. The best way to verify that this information is accurate is by calling and speaking with former employers and colleagues. This can also help provide deeper insight into the person's work ethic and ability to work with a team.Ask that your candidates provide references when they arrive for the interview. If he or she is evasive, this should raise a serious flag.Related: How One Startup Aims to Revolutionize the Hiring Process

/article/229391,Beyond Secret Santa: Holiday Traditions That Build Teams,A company's holiday traditions should be more about mission-building than gift-giving or hall decking. Here's how you can use the holidays to build engagement with your team.,"Jacksonville, Florida-based accounting software maker LessAccounting.com has 11 employees who live in six different time zones. While such virtual offices may be great for reducing overhead, they can wreak havoc on team unity. We have no water cooler. It is really easy to have a whole bunch of strangers who do not interact at all,  says co-founder Allan Branch of his remote team.The company s annual holiday party via Skype is designed to combat that. At a designated day and time, all 11 members of the six-year-old firm log on to Skype, armed with $20 of booze underwritten by the company. Then the team, eats, drinks and shops online together for each other s gifts, again with a $20 company budget. The twist? The gift recipient places his mic on mute, so he can t comment as his coworkers discuss what he might like as a holiday gift. It is fun to see people s reactions. It really encourages us to get to know each other and learn that one woman likes horror movies and other person smokes a pipe,  Branch says. Plus, with a total tab of $440 he says it is  the world s cheapest Christmas party. At North of Nine Communications, pranks are a holiday team building activity. Here an office elf has covered manager Allison Kubota s desk with a Texas-themed gifts and d cor (she s from Texas).Image credit: North of NineThere are few things less jolly during the holidays than being forced into office celebrations that seem superfluous. But if you can create traditions that fit with company objectives, be it volunteering at a soup kitchen or a party with a dance floor, office holiday customs actually can make folks merry. Traditions are important rites of culture, so you have to think about them carefully,  says Susan Strayer LaMotte, founder of exaqueo, a workforce consultancy.  There s this idea that we have to offer these perks, but you want to make sure your culture is in everything you do. As a holiday prank, staffers from North of Nine Communications surrounded Connie Zheng s work area with chairs. Others haven t been so lucky: they ve discovered their desk covered in festive holiday wrap.Image credit: North of NineThat means being mindful of religious observances and making people feel comfortable.  It's not about being politically correct, it's about fostering an environment where all employees feel like they belong,  LaMotte says.Still, you ll need to acknowledge your company s culture. A one-time holiday event won t transform it overnight. Also, LaMotte urges executives to pay attention to what their staff is telling them:  Traditions happen because of consistency, so the first year is really important. When introducing traditions, watch that first year to see how heavily they are adopted and how enthusiastic employees are about them. To create a holiday observance that fits with your business goals, consider these other tips:  Don t plan fun just one day out of 365. Yes, the holidays are special, but when your culture has easy, informal interactions throughout the year, you ll find more collaboration and enthusiasm for every office happy hour or planned excursion.  Encourage your employees to help plan the tradition, be it a philanthropic day or a catered lunch. You ll get more buy-in if you have input from the beginning.  Remember your regular work flow. If you re overextended from your annual holiday community service, you re not doing a service to yourself, your staff or your clients.  Don t overdo it. Some office gift-giving traditions can quickly become costly and time-consuming. Suggest that gestures be free or low-cost (sending a funny electronic cards or video, or buying someone their favorite morning coffee) to keep stress levels low. At North of Nine Communications in San Francisco, the traditional one-day gift exchange has morphed into week-long elf extravaganza they call the Secret Santa Stalkers. For the sixth year, these office elves will deliver pranks as well as legit gifts. One day an elf may leave a present on a desk at lunchtime or rearrange the contents of papers in an in-box. It is good team bonding,  says Emmi Buck, a client executive at the firm.  You have to coordinate 30 employees and even those in our remote offices are involved.  At the end of the week everyone guesses who they think was their elf. So far, no rules have been necessary to assure that no one crosses a line from funny to frustrating. Still, experts say having such guidelines in place isn t a bad idea if your tradition is going to push the envelope.Adds LaMotte:  Any time a new activity or office-wide outing occurs is a good time to remind employees of your values and policies. If you're actively seeking anonymous and individual feedback from your employees, they'll tell you when it's time to move on. Fun is behind the holiday tradition at Bed Rest Concierge. Each employee at the Plano, Texas-based firm brings in what they believe is the worst fruitcake ever and the entire staff blind taste-tests the much-maligned seasonal dessert. The winner gets a full day off during the busy holiday season. This is a way to relieve holiday stress,  explains chief executive officer Stephanie D. Johnson.  Even secret Santa can be stressful.

/article/230171,Latest Obamacare Delay Means Small Businesses Will Have to Wait. Again.,The launch date for the online exchange that will allow small-business owners to shop for insurance has been pushed to November 2014.,"The beleaguered and defeated Obamacare has taken another punch, and Main Street is feeling the pain.Just as most of the country was heading full throttle toward the tryptophan-induced haze that is Thanksgiving, the White House announced yet another delay in the rollout of Obamacare   one that affects small businesses.Burying the news at the bottom of a blog post published the day before Thanksgiving, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services stated that the online marketplaces for small-business owners are expected to come online in November 2014.That s a year later than expected. A year later than the already pushed back deadline.Related: Readying for Obamacare's Small Business ExchangesThe online marketplace for small-business owners, called the Small Business Health Options Program, or SHOP, is intended to provide companies with fewer than 50 full-time employees to compare insurance options and register for coverage for themselves and their employees on the Internet.The SHOP online marketplace was initially due to open in October. Then, in September, the White House pushed the deadline back another month, scheduling the launch for Nov. 1, leaving only three months for small business owners to be set up and ready for the launch on Jan. 1. Now, that deadline has been delayed by a full year.The Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare as it has come to be called, does not require businesses with fewer than 50 full-time workers to provide health insurance to their workers. Those small businesses that do wish to shop for coverage through the SHOP marketplaces can still do so before November 2014, albeit not online. Instead, they will have to work directly with an agent, broker, or insurer to sign up manually. This process, called  direct enrollment,  is similar to how most small employers get insurance today,  the HHS blog post said. In other words, not much is going to change from how it already looks for small-business owners looking to work with a professional to buy insurance.Related: HealthCare.gov: Your Reminder Not To Skimp on Quality AssuranceThe delay in the online marketplace, however, provided yet another opportunity for already fuming Republicans to lay a few targeted jabs at the White House.""Once again, President Obama has unilaterally delayed another major portion of Obamacare, and once again, he has tried to bury bad news around a holiday hoping nobody will notice. These are hardly the actions of a transparent administration,  said House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R, Va.) in a written statement.The Obama administration s approval rating has been at historic lows as of late, and the blundered rollout of HealthCare.gov has been much to blame.  If small firms failed to provide services this frequently, they would be fired,  said House Small Business Committee Chairman Sam Graves (R, Mo.).  This pattern of continued delay and disarray is especially disappointing. This mismanagement and inadequacy is causing the American people and small business owners to lose trust in their government s ability to do just about anything. Business owners like to plan. And the repeated deadline changes are leaving business owners unable to get their bearings for the coming year.Related: Making Heads or Tails of Obamacare as a Sole Proprietor or Small-Business Owner (Video) The Obama Administration continues to make it incredibly difficult for small businesses to adequately plan and prepare when they continue to move the goal post,  says Katie Vlietstra, director of government affairs for The National Association for the Self-Employed in a written statement.  We are disappointed to say the least. The announcement of the delay in the online SHOP was made as the White House was sweating to make its own, self-imposed Nov. 30 deadline for righting the broken online portal for individuals to sign up for health insurance. Since the White House is in the business of setting and breaking its own deadlines these days, even the President didn t seem convinced that his administration would make its very own Nov. 30 deadline. I think it is not possible for me to guarantee that 100 percent of the people 100 percent of the time going on this website will have a perfectly seamless, smooth experience,  said Obama earlier this month.

/article/230145,What Role Should Religious Values Play in Business?,The Supreme Court will soon take on the thorny issue of whether companies should have the same right to religious expression that they have to free speech.,"The decision by the Supreme Court earlier this week to hear an appeal to Obamacare forcing companies to provide contraceptive insurance coverage, over objections of owners who resist such coverage as a matter of their faith, will once again bring up a subject of much debate among business owners: Are the for-profit companies they have founded, own and manage extensions of themselves and eligible for Constitutional rights?It is one of the thorniest of judicial issues today. Known in the legal world as  corporate personhood,  the concept says that companies are like people in the eyes of the law, and therefore have rights bestowed on them by the Founders.For decades, courts rejected the idea. People have Constitutional rights. Companies don't. But then came the famous Citizens Union decision from the Supreme Court in 2010, which said companies could spend what they wanted on political campaigns, because curtailing that would violate companies' First Amendment rights to free speech.So, if companies have a First Amendment right for speech, shouldn't they have the same right to religious expression?That is what the court will decide, but, for business owners today, the issue continues to be a tricky one. For one thing, many entrepreneurs see the companies they have created as extensions of themselves. In fact, their personal values and belief systems are often part of their company's values.Related: In Taking Aim at 23andMe, Regulators Missed the MarkSometimes, those are overtly religious values. Take Hobby Lobby, the retail chain that successfully fought Obamacare on religious grounds and whose case is one of three that the Supreme Court has agreed to consider. Christian values are so strong at the company that the stores are closed on Sunday and religious music plays for shoppers. The company's founders took their deeply held religious beliefs and made them part of the corporation's culture. Personal and corporate values became one.It actually happens more than one would think on a smaller scale. Here in New York, the go-to place for technology products is a local business called B&H [http://www.bhphotovideo.com/]. But don't try to go there on Friday afternoons or Saturdays. The store is closed, because the owners are Orthodox Jews. The store theoretically could be open, staffed by gentiles, but the values of the owners' religion call for honoring the Jewish Sabbath, so much so that the company doesn't even take orders online from Friday evening to Saturday evening.Of course, corporate personhood goes beyond store hours, and can run counter to the beliefs of the employees that work there, as in the case with mandatory contraceptive coverage. The fear for opponents of corporate personhood is that the individual rights of employees are more likely to be trampled by the Constitutional rights of employers.
But we are not talking about discrimination here. Companies given Obamacare exemptions can't all of a sudden decide that they can violate employment laws and not hire women or racial minorities. It is the time-tried and tired tendency to assume that, in capitalism, companies always are itching to do wrong by their own employees, in blind pursuit of profit. (It is interesting that opponents of capitalism often apply the word  evil,  so imbued with religious overtones, as the favorite adjective for  corporations  when discussing the companies they want to atheize.)Related: The Ridiculous Thing One Congressman Said About Self-Driving CarsIn fact, the market serves as a pretty good regulator to limit corporate behavior if companies are afforded personhood. Say Hobby Lobby and companies like it prevail and are exempt from paying for contraceptive coverage. The company can be upfront about that issue in its hiring process. If you want to work our registers, you have to pay for your own contraception. At the same time, competitors could use lack of contraceptive coverage as a selling point in attracting the best employees, conceivably stealing them away from Hobby Lobby.And there is an additional market dynamic. Ultimately, the Supreme Court is deciding whether corporations can choose to deny certain care on religious grounds. That doesn't mean companies will automatically deny such care. Again, it seems short-sighted from a market perspective to hold back on some coverages if you are in competition for employees. (That competition isn't as fierce now, because of relatively high unemployment, but it will be once the jobless rate is normalized.) Also, consumers aware of these policies may choose to take their custom elsewhere, because the owners' decisions may run counter to their own beliefs. Workers and customers can vote with their feet   and their wallets.Most companies won't take advantage of a religious exemption because they will see it as bad business. After all, the good book of many boards leans more toward balance sheet than Bible. So, at its heart, the Supreme Court decision will be about choice. It will be about the freedom of corporations to choose what they offer in insurance coverage, and freedom to make those decisions based on corporate religious values, born from the shared values of the founders and owners and often codified in the very culture of those companies.Is having a choice, with transparency and evaluative knowledge about the consequences for employees and consumers, really that bad? We'll find out soon enough.Related: GoldieBlox Removes Popular Video After Legal Fight With the Beastie BoysRay HennesseyRay Hennessey, the former editorial director of Entrepreneur, is Chief Innovation Officer at JConnelly, an integrated communications firm in New York, and a senior advisor to Alley, a coworking community in Manhattan.

/article/229885,3 Ways to Re-Engage Your Employees,"Our experts tell you how to get your staff, your most important asset, to reconnect to your company and your goals.","A star employee starts missing sales targets. A manager s eyes glaze over at the weekly check in. Other staffers seem to withdraw, and while their work is adequate, it s lackluster. Getting disengaged employees to re-engage in their work may seem like a Herculean task. And sometimes, acknowledging irreconcilable differences between an employee and your company and parting ways amicably may be the best solution. But more often, you can bring wayward employees back into the fold with a few simple steps. We spoke to three experts who offered their advice on how to reignite your staff.Find ways to reconnect
Employees who have withdrawn have withdrawn for a reason. Maybe it s a personal problem or maybe they feel unappreciated, but  the approach should be  What can we do to help?  rather than  You need to shape up,  says Paul Hebert, human resources expert and vice president of solutions design at Symbolist. Remind that  we  includes the company as a whole and that other staffers may be willing to lend a hand. Simply asking the question may jumpstart some employees and make them feel cared for and recognized within the company. Helping staff connect to each other outside of work can deepen engagement in the office, as well. Take this opportunity to help your employees reconnect to the company. This is your chance to over-communicate your firm s goals to the team and how each staffer s role fits in.  An enlightened company knows that they have human beings on staff, and know that they have problems that require human solutions,  says Hebert. Talk less and ask more questions
Disengaged employees often have potential, but don t feel that their perspectives are being heard. So resolve to listen more. At meetings, keep questions open ended. Ask  What do we think? How could we make this even better?  Resist the urge to fill any empty silences with your own voice and let your staffers offer their own suggestions. Make a habit of one-on-one lunch or coffee meetings where you ask staffers individually what you can do to make work better for them. Keep it professional, not personal, both in tone and subject matter.  Managers often make the mistake of berating someone or telling them they need to change their attitude, when in reality it s always better to put a positive spin on it,  notes Susan Strayer LaMotte, founder of exaqueo, a workplace consultancy.  Give them an opportunity to make an ask of you, whether that is a different project or new department or additional training.  Present yourself as a partner and that you plan to work together to make changes. If you get the dreaded  Nothing, I m fine  in response to your queries, keep the conversation going. If you can t get them to open up in that moment, revisit the conversation later at an agreed-upon date try again. This gives you time to evaluate if the issue is ongoing, and gives your staffers time to prepare for their ask.Actively manage 
Sometimes disengaged employees don t feel anyone is watching, says Laurie Ruettimann, founder of Punk Rock HR, The Cynical Girl and The HR Blogger Network. Studies show that lack of praise and recognition is a top reason that employees are unhappy at their jobs. This is your chance to rethink how you give feedback to your staff, positive and negative. It might even be a chance to reacquaint yourself with staffers  roles, since you might not understand them as well as you think you do. Sit down with your staffers to set goals together that you can work toward.  The best way to refocus their attention is put a deadline in front of them,  says Ruettimann. Together, brainstorm a list of specific things that need to be accomplished in the next 30 days and have check-ins throughout that 30-day period. You might find that you learn more about this staffer s role than you would have otherwise and that your employee will rise to the challenge. Says Ruettimann:  If you hold them to performance standards, work can actually be a good distraction from what else is going on in their lives.

/article/229720,Reward Better: New Programs Let You Recognize Employees in Real Time,End-of-year fruit basket? Company coffee cup?  Shelve old-school gifts next to the rolodexes and update your recognition program with LinkedIn badges or an array of online gift cards.,"In a fast-paced workplace, where conference calls are replaced with Google hangouts and voicemails generate nothing but eye-rolls, it seems only right that employee recognition programs need to hit the fast-forward button. In a study by WorldAtWork, a global human resources foundation, 54 percent of employees said that short-term incentives have a high impact on engagement, while only 32 percent cited long-term incentives. Several different companies are helping workplaces revamp the way they reward their staff, trading company coffee mugs for 6-month subscriptions to Rdio. These new options let you hand out employee perks online in real time and some also add in a social media platform so your team can openly thank colleagues for a job well done.
Of course, no rewards program is a substitute for an in-person  atta-boy!   There s never a good replacement for face-to-face interaction,  says David A. Owens, professor of practice of management and innovation at Vanderbilt University s Owen Graduate School of Management.  You have to walk around your office and check in with off-site employees and know what the members of your team are dealing with. 
And regardless of what system a company chooses, recognition should recognize special achievements or contributions.  Too much public recognition can lead to the Lake Woebegone effect of  everybody is above average  explains Ravi Gajendran, associate professor of business administration at the University of Illinois College of Business.
We looked into a few new services and asked the experts to weigh in on implementation. Here s what we found:YouEarnedIt. This social-media based recognition program lets your entire team award points to their colleagues that can be redeemed for a variety of different rewards.  We provide a curated master catalog of gift cards from top retailers and donations to a variety of meaningful charities,  explains Steve Semelsberger, chief executive officer of YouEarnedIt, but notes that companies can also build in their own rewards such as a day off. One company even offers a  Coffee from the Boss  where employees redeem points to get a hand-delivered coffee from their manager.What to keep in mind: Bosses need to know what they want out of this or any program   and continue to evaluate if the program is meeting their company s overall needs.  Obviously, we want people to be able to say thank you to each other, but rewards need to align with where you want to go,  Owen says. 7Geese. Another social-media based program, 7Geese is focused on replacing classic HR programs with online reviews and forms. Managers can set up online goals, people directories and organization charts so that team structures are clear. Rewards come in the form of recognition badges that are pinned to company core values. The badges can then be shared on social networks such as Twitter and LinkedIn profiles.  We didn't expect it, but people really love the recognition aspect,  Amin Palizban, the chief executive officer of 7Geese.  It s currently the glue of 7Geese because it brings people to the app on a continuous basis.  Bad reviews are private, but can include requests for one-on-one coaching sessionsWhat to keep in mind: Gajendran thinks a program like this is best suited to a collaborative workplace with many shared projects so teammates could report on project progress, discuss what problems are holding them up, and get coworker feedback. In more competitive workplaces, like a sales office or a call center, such programs might not be as close a fit since coworkers compete with one another. In these workplaces, Gajendran says, it's more likely to be used as ""a strategic tool to toot your own horn. Kiind. This straightforward gift card campaign company lets managers send gift cards to employees online, but the company isn t charged until the gift is redeemed. Says Leif Baradoy, chief executive officer of Kiind, the platform also allows managers to send out multiple gifts such as subscriptions to Rdio with employee-specific messages while tracking fulfillment.  If an employee chooses Amazon, an employer can make sure to put Amazon in the next reward email,  Baradoy explains.  It increases personalization and is one of the big values we bring to the table. What to keep in mind:  You have to evaluate if people already find an intrinsic value in what they are working on and whether they need direct gifts,  Gajendran says.  But if you have a work force doing a common job that isn t rewarding, having a clear link between your job and a gift is great.  So someone doing basic data entry or coding might see this as a huge incentive, while an architect or marine biologist might not need this type of carrot.

/article/229962,How to Find Great Candidates by Looking Past the Obvious,Experts aren't everything. Here's how to eliminate the false positives and find the employee you need.,"When your business is growing fast -- faster than you could ever possibly imagine -- it's likely that you will consider bringing in an expert who has ""been there and done that"" to help your business go where you want it to go. But whether you are inventing something completely new, creating a new business model or merely shaking up the status quo (and aren't we entrepreneurs always trying to do that?), an expert from the trenches of business-as-usual may not be the perfect fit for your company.It's not that you don't need an expert. Most growing businesses could benefit from a seasoned point of view. But you need a very special kind of expert, someone willing to help you build the business you want to build, not the one she thinks you should be building. That kind of expert is not so easy to find.To avoid making costly mistakes (and I'm speaking from experience), here's what we try to do at my company, Lolly Wolly Doodle:Don't start with the title.
Old-fashioned job titles can send you down a rabbit hole. Even if you're sure you need a vice president of operations, you should identify the top three things that you want accomplished by the person sitting in that job. Be as specific as possible. Then, when the VP of operations from the big-box store down the road walks in for an interview and shares her experience with you, listen for those three things.Prepare three scenarios and ask how she would react to them. If she answers differently than you expect, don't discount the expert right away, but explain how your company reacts and listen carefully to how she responds. That will give you clues as to how her experience might align with your needs.Related: Hiring: Why the Most Skilled Candidate Isn't Always the Right CandidateGet granular.
If you're interviewing a candidate from a traditional top-down company for your new and growing business, don't gloss over the specifics of his experience. Startups require someone who is hands-on and flexible and who has been close to the ground recently enough to understand not only how to manage people and develop processes, but also how to roll up his sleeves and do it themselves.If you're looking for an expert in enterprise resource planning, ask each candidate how many systems he has implemented. What went right and wrong? What was his specific role? You may be in apparel, like Lolly Wolly Doodle, and the candidate may come from the grocery business, but you may find that his experience dovetails with your needs. You won't know unless you ask for specifics.Don't compromise.
It's so easy to be dazzled by the promise of experience when you're determined to succeed. But tread carefully. A wrong hire can prove costly -- in time, in money and in business progress. Make sure the cultural fit is right. If you're gutsy and fast-paced, then your expert -- no matter whether he hails from a traditional role in corporate America or the startup in the office next door with the magnetic black walls and neon chalk -- better share your values and vision.Know exactly what you need.
If we knew exactly what we needed, we might not have sought an expert in the first place, right? Well, not exactly. As someone who built a business from the ground up, I still feel the urge to do everything myself, but realistically I can't. So if you wind up hiring an expert who doesn't work out (and it's bound to happen at some point), reevaluate those top three things that you thought you needed in the first place.The best way to revamp that list is to do the job yourself. If the person you hired was perfect on paper but didn't work out, it may be that you didn't fully know what you needed. You probably won't be able to do the job perfectly, which means you will quickly learn what skills you are seeking to fill your knowledge gaps.

How could a gig at the biggest, most ambitious tech company on the planet possibly be bad?Well, take a look at this Quora thread, which is being used by current and former Google employees to dish the dirt on working for Big G.We've edited some of the standout comments into this excerpt.Everyone is awesome, so they can hire the very best people to do even the most mundane jobs.""The worst part of working at Google, for many people, is that they're overqualified for their job. Google has a very high hiring bar due to the strength of the brand name, the pay & perks, and the very positive work culture. As a result, they have their pick of bright candidates, even for the most low-level roles.""""There are students from top 10 colleges who are providing tech support for Google's ads products, or manually taking down flagged content from YouTube, or writing basic code to A|B test the color of a button on a site.""Google staff are so outstanding that there's an internal joke about it.""  I used to joke with my colleagues that Larry & Sergey go out on their yachts - tie them together, sit back on the same recliners you'll find on their jumbo jet, each on his own yacht/set of yachts, smoke cigars, and put up pictures of Googlers with little snippets like ""was a GM at muti-national telecomm company, got a Harvard MBA and is now answering Orkut tickets.""  and then they would erupt in laughter and clink their cigars & Scotch together in celebration.  This, of course, is highly unlikely given neither of them would ever smoke a cigar or drink Scotch.  Remainder is plausible.""Image credit: REUTERS/Robert GalbraithGoogle is not a startup any more. It's a big, big corporation.""Google was not a start-up environment by the time I left. The same office politics. It was easy to get promoted if you worked on the right projects and projected your work in the right way.""Many of the engineers are arrogant.""Unfortunately, in spite of the common belief, I think the average level of Google engineers is mediocre. With a lot of arrogance, too. Everybody believes he (males dominate) is better than his neighbor. So it is really hard to discuss any issue unless it is your friend you are talking to. Objective discussions are pretty rare, since everybody's territorial, and not interested in opinions of other people unless those people are Important Gods.""Google is so big you can't have any impact on it.""I worked at Google for 3 years and it was very difficult to leave but there was one major factor that helped me make the decision - the impact I could ever have on the business as an individual was minimal. As noted in many answers below, Google is an incredible machine that prints money thanks to AdWords. Unless you are an amazingly talented engineer who gets to create something new, chances are you're simply a guy/girl with an oil can greasing the cogs of that machine.""Image credit: Office SpaceMiddle management is mediocre.""I'd say the relentless daily mediocre thinking of middle management types who are completely focused on metrics to the exclusion of all other factors. They don't want to rock the boat, they don't know how to inspire their workforce, and they rely far too much on the Google name and reputation to do that for them.""Google may understand engineering, but not design.""There is not enough focus on product and visual design.  This has led to many aborted/semi-successful products, like Wave, Google Video, Buzz, Dodgeball, Orkut, Knol, and Friend Connect.  There is probably too much focus on pure engineering.""Your office space can be too small.""... if you have to work in one of the four main campus buildings, you will most likely be extremely cramped. It's not uncommon to see 3-4 employees in a single cube, or several managers sharing an office. With all the open areas for food, games, TV, tech talks, etc, it can be surprisingly hard to find a quiet, private place to think.""Get things in writing.""If you are in the process of gaining employment with Google, negotiate hard, be demanding, and make sure to get EVERYTHING in writing. Google makes lots of vague promises, and seems to not deliver.""Googlers can get caught up in trivia.Image credit: Jacopo Werther""In Zurich there is a quiet room where people go to relax, or take a nap. There are very nice looking fish tanks there and you can waste as much of your work time there, watching the fish do fishy things. There was a 100+ emails thread about removing the massage chairs from that room because some people allegedly were being kept from sleeping because the massage chairs were too noisy.""The culture is immature.""It's like never-never land - people never grow up.  They drink at all hours, socialize constantly, play games, and do little to no work.""You can't work remotely.""But the killer to me was the inability to work remotely, which I have been doing successfully for the past 5-6 years.""Googlers treat temps with disrespect.""As someone who has worked for a temp job working for Google, the worst part is the smug attitude of those who work for the REAL Google.

/article/229734,Hiring: Why the Most Skilled Candidate Isn't Always the Right Candidate,Smart hiring looks beyond skillsets to find someone who will work well with your team and your workflow. These 4 tips will help you look beyond the resume.,"Hiring a new employee is a leap of faith. It's more alchemy than science, based on a combination of skill-matching, research and gut feel. When you begin the process, you consider the work that needs to get done and the skills required to do it. So, when it comes to making the hiring decision, should you focus on technical expertise? Well, no. Too often, founders pay more attention than they should to skills alone. Later, they're surprised when someone who's perfect on paper turns out to be disruptive, less than productive, or simply not as good at their job as managers might hope.Not long ago, I hired a contractor who fit the bill perfectly. She was smart, assertive, kept me informed and met her deadlines. Unfortunately, her vision of each project differed from mine, and when I revised her work the resulting arguments were long and maddening, the kind that leave you with the need for 10 minutes of deep breathing once you've hung up the phone. Finally, I decided I was better off living with the hole in my team than continuing what had become a vicious and frustrating cycle.In hindsight, I could have avoided all that heartache if only I'd stepped back and asked myself whether our styles meshed. I'd ignored an important rule: You don't hire based on skills alone.By the time you've asked a candidate in for an interview, you've already decided that they can do the work. While you still want to vet their talents when you get together, now is the time to get a sense of whether this person can meet your needs in a way that fits with your approach. How do you do that? Here's four bits of advice.Ask open-ended questions. Find out how they've handled tensions with co-workers and managers. If their examples are all about being the smartest guy in the room, or their determination to advocate a ""better approach"" even after a project's well underway, they may not fit well with a team that's respectful of each other's expertise and follows a well-tested approach to their work.
         Ask other people to interview them. You're not the only person who'll be working with the new employee, so getting a sense of how others react to his or her style is equally important. Plus, others on your team have been removed from the hiring process. They'll look at the candidate with fresh eyes, and may notice traits that you didn't.
         When checking references, ask about  soft skills.  While talking to past employers and colleagues about candidates, you'll undoubtedly learn about their skills and productivity. Don't forget to ask about their ability to get along with others, work through problems and get things done even during periods of tension.
         Debate them. Politely disagree with the candidates  approaches to a problem and make them defend it. You can bet that people who become frustrated and defensive in the interview will display those traits on the job. People who are confident but not overbearing, who listen to your points and at least try to incorporate them into their thinking, will probably be more valuable than those who insist their way is always the right way, or even those who quickly give up and say, ""You're the boss.""
        Just remember, interviews aren t the place for you to show off your own skills. The interview is about the candidates and what that individuals can bring to your team. If you re talking to the right people, you ll likely be learning something along the way.Mark FefferMark Feffer is the Managing Editor of Dice News, which provides news and advice for job seekers on the technology career site Dice.com.

/article/229819,Why ENDA Is Actually Bad for Business,"The Employment Non-Discrimination Act, or ENDA, would add costs and complications to businesses that have already shown they are far more enlightened than the government, writes Ray Hennessey.","For companies set on doing the right thing, no good deed goes unpunished.Congress is once again considering the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, or ENDA, a bill meant to ban workplace discrimination over sexual orientation or gender identity. If ENDA sounds familiar, it is because the bill has been kicking around for decades, though it only recently added the transgendered to the list of protected classes.On the surface, ENDA seems to meet meritorious goals. After all, discrimination of any kind is simply wrong. If there is discrimination against LGBTs in hiring, it should be addressed.But, that is the rub in this law: There has been a strong, efficient move against discrimination against gays and lesbians in the corporate world already, driven not by force of law but by the market. It has been effective and fair. And, ENDA would perversely add costs and complications to businesses that have already shown they are far more enlightened than the government trying to impose new fiats on them.It is simply a question of numbers. According to the Human Rights Campaign, which is backing ENDA, 88 percent of companies in the Fortune 500 already have corporate policies that ban LGBT discrimination at work. That is an overwhelming majority, so big in fact that one has to assume the other 60 companies aren t too far behind in writing their own policies.Related: Confessions of a Cheating Nation: One in Four Have Stolen From Their EmployersThese are easy policies for corporate human-resources departments to write: Discrimination is not only morally wrong, it also doesn t make good business sense. When you refuse to hire a homosexual   or a Latino, a woman, or even a Whig for that matter   simply because of a bias, you are running the risk of not employing the most qualified person for the job. Particularly with smaller businesses and startups, every employee counts. Smart business owners don t care with whom their employees share a bed. They only care that they themselves will sleep soundly on a big pile of money.Also, employees who face discrimination at a particular employer can simply take their talents elsewhere. And they apparently do. There have been very few lawsuits brought for LGBT discrimination in states that have passed their own laws. As Walter Olson, senior fellow at the Cato Institute, notes,  most employees with other options prefer to move on rather than sue when an employment relationship turns unsatisfactory.  The forbidden group categories that tend more to drive HR managers crazy are things like age, disability, and criminal record consideration, where the law regularly tries to forbid behavior that in fact is perfectly rational for employers to engage in,  Olson said.An argument for ENDA, of course, can be made by simply saying that since LGBT protections are so widespread in work environments around the country that it wouldn t have any impact, so jump on board. Trouble is, laws have a way of adding cost and complexity to businesses. Take lawsuits. While companies will now have to expend billable hours fighting lawsuits, most people don t consider the added costs involved in avoiding lawsuits. That means additional training, additional layers in human-resource functions. For smaller businesses, that uses resources often not readily available (though ENDA does exempt companies with fewer than 15 employees).
And ENDA will be trickier than other anti-discrimination laws. Right now, the biggest objection cited by opponents is how it actually infringes on religious liberties. While there are some exemptions for religious organizations, opponents worry the bill opens up faith groups to lawsuits.Related: Could This New Recruiting Tool Be a Bigger, Smarter LinkedIn?One other wrinkle is the nature of sexual identity in the workplace. A black employee doesn t have to declare his race. It is there for all to see. Sexual orientation requires identification and discovery, and often these happen in the types of workplace conversations about personal relationships that drive HR managers to drink already. As a result, there are more potential landmines for businesses with LGBT discrimination than with race, gender, age and disability.Discrimination is bad policy, bad karma and bad business. But the markets know that already. That s why, for years, corporations extended benefits for domestic partners, irrespective of gender, even though the government did not. There is not just a little irony that the federal government, which only recently decided gays could serve in its military and get tax breaks for being married, is deciding it needs to take a hard line on businesses.Businesses knew better and did the right thing.

/article/229631,Why Your Employees Think You're a Creep -- And How to Avoid Being One,You may be offending your employees without even knowing it.  Here are five rules to keep you out of trouble.,"I have this nasty habit of saying what s on my mind. Being fearlessly direct and willing to oppose the status quo has played a big role in my career. But my big mouth has also gotten me into trouble on more than one occasion.A couple of weeks ago, I told my wife I thought a woman we ve been working with was attractive. I know it was dumb. Not because I said it to my wife. We ve always been open and secure. It s what happened next that s the problem.My wife told the woman -- even worse, she embellished -- that I said she was hot. My wife was trying to stir up trouble, I guess. I don t know if this woman is creeped out at all, but I sure am. The last thing I want is for her to think  What a creep,  when she sees me.The truth is, I should have known better. I ve always had a strong work ethic and a healthy respect for individuals that kept me from crossing the line. But that line has become increasingly blurred thanks to runaway political correctness. With more and more of us leading entrepreneurial work lives that involve all sorts of business relationships, it s not always clear who you can be candid with and who you need to be careful around.Here are five practical rules to help you (and me) stay out of trouble:1. Don't talk about how people look, if you can help it. Jennifer Aniston s sex-crazed character in Horrible Bosses aside, this is generally a guy thing. Besides, that was a movie. Anthony Weiner and Ben Roethlisberger s sexting scandals were real life. And while texting lewd pictures is a far cry from telling a coworker she looks nice, be aware that being a little risqu  is a lot riskier than it used to be. If you re not sure if it s cool, it probably isn t.Related: 6 Items Every Entrepreneur Needs to Dress for Success2. Don't get too close to vendors and customers. There are boundaries for every professional relationship, whether you work for the same company or not. Remember Mark Hurd, the former HP CEO who got fired over his relationship with a marketing contractor? Never mind that nothing really happened or that third parties are not protected by the same legal statutes as employees are.3. Don t document your stupidity. Back in the day, you had to get caught doing it in front of others to get nailed for sexual harassment or discrimination. Now, it s remarkable how many people document their stupidity in emails, text messages, and on social network sites. Remember, the internet and most of your communication is not only forever, it s also discoverable in court.4. Date with caution. The ever-increasing work-life blur has, for many of us, turned our work into our lives. It s where lots of us meet our better halves. So dating coworkers, employees or the boss -- once taboo -- is now tolerated. Sort of. How you approach it is tricky. If you have a thing for someone, try becoming friends first. Take it slow. And, if you re a guy or the boss, it s safer not to make the first move.Related: 6 Dating Tips for the Single Entrepreneur5. Forget the law. I don t mean that literally. Of course you should know the law. Just be aware that you can be sued by anyone for just about anything. It doesn t matter whether you did anything wrong or not; it may still cost you -- and your reputation. An attorney I once knew used to say,  If people had an ounce of common sense, lawyers would starve.  Truer words were never spoken.I despise political correctness. I think it s taken all the fun out of work and turned our society into a bunch of thin-skinned whiners who get offended and sue if you look at them funny. Still, some company cultures are more PC than others and you ve got to be practical.If you find yourself parsing every word as it travels from your brain to your mouth, you ve probably gone too far into the realm of the politically correct. Be direct, be genuine, be professional and have a little common sense. You ll be fine.Related: Why Friends And Family Are Your Worst Business Enemies Steve TobakSteve Tobak is a management consultant, columnist, former senior executive, and author of Real Leaders Don t Follow: Being Extraordinary in the Age of the Entrepreneur (Entrepreneur Press, October 2015).

/article/229413,5 Signs You're Expecting More From Employees Than They Can Give,Entitled leaders often make the worst managers and bosses. Here are five entitlement traps to avoid when running your own business.,"Don't you just hate all those entitled people in the workplace today? No, not employees but managers and leaders: entrepreneurs and business owners who have unrealistic expectations about what they deserve, stressing employees out with their entitlement mindset.Entitlement is the belief that you have the right to something; that it is due and should be given. You don't need to do anything to earn it; you deserve it.Here are five entitled leader traps to avoid when running your own business:1. Expecting respect without giving it first. Someone once said that respect can only be given. While that is true, the bigger point is that it is rarely given to the undeserving. Respect is about your character and ability, not your position or status. I can't count how many successful people I know who think their success in business entitles them to respect, regardless of how they treat others. Someone might acknowledge your accomplishments, but you don't deserve his or her respect. You need to earn it.Steve Jobs, brilliant visionary that he was, wasn't known to always treat people well. He often berated and belittled them. His success was respected, but his treatment of others was often feared. How much greater might is legacy have been had he focused on both process and people?2. Needing adulation. If your ego needs constant praise, you're facing more than a business issue. I know an entrepreneur who had an out-sized talent for creating business opportunities and an out-sized need for adulation to match. He interpreted anything less than awe for him and his abilities as a personal slight. Not surprisingly, he burned through a lot of employees and even business partners.3. Demanding sacrifices from others. Rational people are willing to sacrifice when necessary for compelling reasons. But they trust that the sacrifice will be appropriately acknowledged.A manufacturing company faced a business downturn and asked employees to make sacrifices in pay and benefits. The employees agreed. When business got better and earnings were up, those rewards -- in large part due to past employee sacrifice -- were never shared. The employees felt betrayed and morale took a big hit.4. Not showing employees you can be trusted. Management guru Tom Peters was once asked how to gain employee trust. His answer was short and classic: be trustworthy. If you can't be trusted, your employees would be sheep to place their confidence in you.5. Expecting employees to treat you like a true friend. You can treat you employees like friends, but don't expect them to be actual friends. The kind of energy, chemistry and emotional bonding required for true friendship is significant. Neither you nor your team has time to be each other's friends. Sure you can be colleagues you like, but unless you use the term ""friend"" very loosely (and many do) don't expect friendship just because someone works with you.In life, you see what you're focused on, find what you're looking for and get back what you give out. Entitlement on the leader's part fuels entitlement on the part of employees. Put out the kind of effort and attitude you expect from others and you'll be far more rewarded at the end of the day.Mark SanbornMark Sanborn is an author, speaker and president of Sanborn & Associates Inc., a leadership development firm based in Lonetree, Colo.Read more",Run a Better Business,2013-10-15 13:00:00
/article/229279,Company Turns 'Unsexy' Corporate Compliance Training on Its Head,"True Office gamifies the way companies train their employees, with its founder insisting it's cheaper and more fun than hiring an expert.","Free Webinar | August 16thFind out how to optimize your website to give your customers experiences that will have the biggest ROI for your business.							Register Now  ""There's got to be a better way.""That's what True Office founder and CEO Adam Sodowick thought to himself when he envisioned the typically yawn-worthy problem of company compliance training. At the time, he was making mandatory training videos that, while better than most of the material out there, were still staid, static. ""It was a one-to-many approach,"" says Sodowick. ""It wasn't interactive.""Anyone who has waded through mountains of HR paperwork or watched outdated training videos from the  80s would probably agree with Sodowick when he says, ""traditional compliance training is the most unsexy, boring thing imaginable.""Enter True Office. Founded by Sodowick in 2010, the company now employs 23 people, and received a series A round of $3 million back in January 2012. Currently, the startup has a distribution deal with Thompson Reuters's government risk and compliance group and is slated to release 20 new applications co-branded with the company and distributed to over 2,000 financial institutions globally.Related: Richard Branson on How to Train Your EmployeesTrue Office is founded on the belief that company risk management and HR training should cater to the way we naturally absorb information. ""People really learn through stories and play they don't naturally learn through PowerPoints and three-ring binders,"" says Sodowick.Jon Lawitts, director of game design, makes ""natural learning"" a key design principle for all of True Office's gamiefied training. When developing a game, Lawitts generally works with both a subject matter expert (True Office's upcoming game on workplace harassment, for example, relies heavily on experts in the field) and the source material provided by the company, which means he often starts with complicated (and let's face it   dry) material. His job is to turn that information into a living, breathing narrative, distilling out the essential player decisions and actions that will make those narratives playable. ""It's not just about digging through the material and refracting it,"" Lawitts says. ""It's also about trying to figure out exactly what sort of game mechanics and learning mechanics will work well for a specific topic.""True Office's new demo teaches employees about insider trading: what it is, how to spot it, and the consequences for those who are caught doing it. ""Lizithin, a once promising obesity drug, was found to be causing seizures in humans while in clinical trials,"" a voice-over informs us. ""This news doomed the chance of FDA approval,"" the narrator continues, ""and sent the value of Litzer Pharmaceuticals stock plummeting."" When playing the game, your job is to figure out whether the allegations against several hedge funds of the bank RXG Capital (which shorted Litzer stock before news of the failed trials went public) are justified.It's a detective story. It also mirrors stories that have found themselves splashed across the headlines of late. ""We're trying to bring to light that this isn't just mindless training,"" Lawitts says. ""This can actually affect you. It's very real, and there are real consequences.""Related: How to Make Employee Training a Winning InvestmentTrue Office's workplace harassment game, which is currently in development, is applicable for most companies. And while Sodowick would not get into specifics on price, he insists that on a dollar per person basis, it's cheaper than hiring an expert to train the office on appropriate behavior.""We've all been there,"" Lawitts says. ""You're sitting through a long HR lecture, you're not really paying attention. It's not engaging, but it's expensive. If you have to get 30 employees in a room and hire someone to train them for two hours, not only are you wasting time, you have to pay for the room, you have to pay for the materials.""""With our product you can go on line, log in and take the training in your own time and you're done."" Although the jury is still out on whether this approach to employee training will be effective enough -- both in terms of cost and impact -- to replace more traditional approaches, the overall premise is compelling. Workers today collectively spend billions of hours playing games and imaging themselves juggling risk and reward in fictional settings.

/article/227918,How to Keep Your Employees Engaged,Keeping employees invested in their jobs and dedicated to the company vision is one of the seminal workplace -- and maybe the most misunderstood.,"						This story appears in the September 2013 issue of Entrepreneur. Subscribe  Q: How do I gauge employee engagement?A: Don Rheem believes keeping employees invested in their jobs and dedicated to the company vision--that is, engaged in their work--is one of the seminal workplace issues of our time. And maybe the most misunderstood.As a founding partner with Engagient, a Centreville, Va.-based consulting firm, Rheem has advised thousands of CEOs on the topic. ""For us,"" Rheem says, ""it's almost a mission.""The core of his pitch echoes a familiar refrain: Culture is king. As Rheem explains it, company culture, with its enormous impact on employee engagement, might be even more critical to success than most entrepreneurs ever realized.""Culture is a social ecosystem--it's rarely in a perfect state,"" Rheem says. ""It's either thriving or it's in the hands of the gossipers and the rumormongers and the cynics and the grudge collectors.""Rheem considers engagement the key result of discretionary effort. That's the difference between a worker who does the minimum amount of work required (or less) and the worker who goes above and beyond. Employees are more likely to put forth discretionary effort when their objectives align with the company culture. ""We're trying to create a work environment where employees see their own progress in the company's progress,"" Rheem says, ""where it's not just a career but 'a place I go to find meaning and purpose in my life.'""Frequently the depth of employees' engagement is a barometer of a company's direction. Engagient's work with a new client typically begins with a 26-question online poll of employees. Do your opinions count? Are you consulted on key decisions that impact your job?Do you have resources to do what you need to do? Do you trust your manager? ""You can't manage what you don't measure,"" Rheem says.
Subsequent polling will tell an entrepreneur whether engagement is improving. ""If you see you're trending down,"" Rheem explains, ""you know with great certainty that every goal you have is going to be harder to achieve, whether it's about customer loyalty, profitability, the wellness of my employees--all of those things are on the decline.""Rheem commonly asks CEOs: What does it feel like to work here? ""The answer to that question is your culture, because the way people feel determines how they behave,"" he says. ""You want to create a place where employees love coming to work every day. Because when they do, they're less focused on money, more productive and much more aligned with you and your goals.""Greater GoodThere's a sweet spot for employees where maximum job satisfaction and their maximum contribution to the company line up--it's called engagement. Here's what employees in North America had to say about it, according to a survey by consulting firm BlessingWhite.
40 percent of employees reported feeling engaged in 2012--up from 33 percent in 2011.
55 percent said they ""definitely"" intend to stay in their jobs--""intent to stay"" being an indicator of their commitment to company success. 12 percent said ""no way.""
48 percent agreed or strongly agreed that they have career opportunities with their employer.
74 percent of engaged workers agree or strongly agree that they trust their manager. For disengaged workers, the number was just 14 percent. ""It stands to reason that managers who develop an awareness of trust and how to earn it will have much greater success in engaging their team members,"" the report says.Christopher HannChristopher Hann is a freelance writer in Lebanon Township, N.J., and an adjunct professor of journalism at Rutgers University.Read more",Run a Better Business,2013-10-08 16:00:00

/article/228583,7 Ways to Pump Up Employee Engagement In Your Office,Giving your employees the ability to set and maintain their own goals will be a big morale booster. Here's how.,"Employees have an enormous impact on the success of virtually every business. If they do an incredible job, the business thrives. Conversely, if employees perform poorly, the business tanks. So, how do you tell if your employees are performing well or not?The answer is fairly simple: establish goals and metrics for each of your employees. By setting goals, your employees know what to strive for. And by measuring their performance towards achieving these goals, they know if they are on the right track.Properly setting goals and metrics is fairly complex. Below are seven helpful tips:1. Have employees set their own goals and review them.
It is much more motivating for employees to set their own goals rather than dictating them. So, ask your employees to set their own goals. Then, review their goals with them and either approve or modify them.2. Make sure goals are within your employees' control.
Make sure employees have control over whether or not they can attain their goals. For example, holding your customer service manager accountable for overall sales goals is a bad idea. Even if he or she does a phenomenal job, sales could dip as sales volume is generally outside their control.3. Make sure goals are timely and measurable.
At a minimum, employees should set goals monthly. At a maximum, you can consider annual, quarterly, weekly or daily goals as well. In any of these cases, the goal needs to be tied to a specific time period. Likewise, goals must be measurable. If not, neither you nr your employees will know whether they achieved them.4. Set both big and underlying goals.
Employees need to set both big-picture goals that identify what they'd like to accomplish overall, and underlying goals that help them get there.For example, a salesperson might set a big goal of achieving $100,000 in monthly sales. To achieve this goal, the salesperson should establish several underlying goals, such as making 100 phone calls to new prospects, calling 25 past customers, and issuing 20 new proposals.By setting and tracking these underlying goals, employees maintain better focus and are better able to realize their big goals.5. Leverage team accountability.
Meet with your team in a group setting at the beginning of each month. During this meeting, have each team member state the goals they set last month, how they performed, and their goals for the coming month.These meetings provide positive accountability, as nobody wants to publicly state over and over again that they failed to meet their goals. Rather, team members start to improve performance so they have the satisfaction of publicly stating they've successfully achieved their goals.6. Enable employees to see results in real-time.
Employees must be able to see results on their big and underlying goals at least daily. Doing so allows them to understand how they are progressing and what changes they must make, if any, to achieve their monthly goals.Not doing so is similar to telling an athlete the score only after the game is over. You aren't giving them a chance to modify their strategy and performance based on whether they are winning or losing.Having a dashboard that reports team and individual metrics accomplishes this, keeping everyone accountable and focused.7. Creatively set goals when needed.
For some roles, such as sales, goals are fairly easy to develop. As mentioned above, goals might include the number of outbound sales calls, number of proposals issued and amount of sales closed among others.For other roles, such as technology development, goal setting might be more challenging to devise. To overcome this, think about the scenario in which your technology person does a phenomenal job. Perhaps they 1) complete all new tech requests within an average of only two days; 2) ensure your website is up 99.9 percent of the time, and 3) identify less than two new bugs each month. Make sure each of these goals can be measured in order to confirm whether this employee is performing acceptably.By aligning employee and company goals, and providing real-time visibility so employees know whether they are achieving them, both employee and company performance will benefit.

/article/228210,How to Use Humor at Work Without Acting Like a Jerk,"You may be the funniest person in the room, but keep these three tips in mind when using humor in the workplace.","Ever thought you had the perfect joke, shared it with a colleague, and it fell flat? Or worse -- offended someone? We spoke with several professional comedians who shared their best tips to let your natural humor shine through in the workplace, without the funny business.1. Know your audience.
""People have all different levels of senses of humor,"" says Dan Nainan, a former Intel engineer turned professional standup comic. Just because some people find something funny, doesn't mean everyone will. For example, at Intel Nainan was written up for impressions he performed of his boss at the annual sales conference. He had performed before senior executives and they loved his impressions, but he hadn't cleared it with his boss first, who wasn't pleased.""What a comic can get away with at a comedy club or on TV may be inappropriate in the workplace,"" Nainan says. ""What matters is how it affects someone else,"" he says. ""In the workplace, err on the side of caution. The loss or downside [to a joke bombing] is much worse than any benefit of it being funny,"" he notes. ""When in doubt, take it out.""Being funny at work isn't the same as performing a standup act. For starters, you shouldn't try to dominate all the conversation with your quips, cautions Jennifer Dziura, a New York-based education expert and career writer at GetBullish.com. However, she notes that the skills she's picked up in comedy such as knowing who to look at, controlling a room, and being a dynamic speaker have served her well in high pressure speaking situations such as interviews. Related: The Esquire Guy's Guide to Swearing in the Office2. There's a place for humor.
And that place may be during a demo or presentation. People with comedy experience paired with another area of expertise are in demand at corporate training events or with technical presentations, say Dziura and Nainan.""If you do the same training over and over, you can use the same jokes,"" Dziura says. Standup comedians typically have a few jokes they use regularly for certain situations, like when the checks come at the end of a show and nobody's paying attention to the performer, or when they get heckled. 3. Don't force the funny.Bob Kulhan, a New York-based professional comedic improviser, teaches improv to business people at Duke University, Columbia Business School and companies around the world. He believes humor and business can mix, when the comedy comes from a spontaneous response to the moment.""Humor in the workplace is not about forcing the funny. It's about letting the funny happen and then taking advantage of it when it does,"" he explains. ""In doing so, a level of honesty and vulnerability comes with the spontaneity  and those traits should certainly be welcome in business,"" Kulhan says.

/article/228366,"6 Easy Ways to Make Meetings Fun -- Or At Least, Not Suck",What if the dreaded meeting could actually be an event your team looked forward to? Here are six ways to revamp meetings to get employees engaged and interested.,"How many times have you been in a meeting that you knew right away would be dull and potentially pointless? The ineffectiveness of so many meetings can be remedied simply by revamping the first and last five minutes.Standup comics live by a performance adage: open strong, close strong. By using the same philosophy when leading a meeting, you will get better interaction and engagement out of your employees.Try these six tips for your next meeting:1. Set an example from the start. If you want energy and engagement from your team, you need to embody those qualities while they walk through the conference room doors. We are highly empathetic creatures. Within a tenth of a second, your team gauges and mirrors your mood and energy levels. They look to you for clues about the tone of the meeting. If you have a dark cloud over your head, the energy in the room sinks and the meeting drags. If you are positive and energetic, the meeting will be more lively and productive.Now, here's where it gets a little tricky.You too are wired to pick up on the energy levels of others and mirror them back. Don't let any negativity sway you from your assertive state. Stay focused. If you want employees to be friendly, upbeat and engaged, you have to be friendly, upbeat, and engaged. Lead with your body language and tone.2. Make a connection with everyone in the room. Some people have a habit of starting meetings by reading the agenda. Everyone else tilts their heads down to follow along, not making eye contact and certainly not connecting. The point of meeting face-to-face is to, well, meet face-to-face.Make it a priority to build and maintain rapport so you can foster collaboration. Reading an agenda shouldn't be your meeting opener. It doesn't have to be a long monologue, just a few sentences about why everyone is together and what you hope to accomplish to set the tone.3. Remind everyone of your greater mission. Don't get so focused on the minutia of a meeting that you forget to step back and see the big picture. Remind everyone they are working towards a higher purpose and not just clocking meeting minutes. How does this meeting fit into the overall vision? How will this help the company? How will it benefit the team? How will the discussion move things forward? You will get more engagement if everyone sees the bigger picture.4. Provide action steps. Before everyone scatters to their next appointment, make sure they know their next action steps. Rather than delegating or reading off who is in charge of doing what, ask everyone in the room to say a few words about what they are personally responsible for. This helps make sure everyone is on the same page and gives you an opportunity to listen and observe. Pay attention to what they say and how they say it. Have they ""bought in"" to the idea? Is their body language congruent with what they are saying? This is your chance to do some preemptive damage control.You miss out on such valuable information when you dictate the do-to list at the end of the meeting.5. Acknowledge successes. Recognition is an important part of building a positive culture. It's easy to get caught up with deadlines and think there will be high-fives and group hugs when everything is done, but that rarely happens. Once one item is complete, another is right around the corner. Recognition and praise should be on your mental checklist for every meeting. You can always find somebody doing something right. Just mention it. Saying, ""I'm loving the go-get-'em attitude Janice!"" or ""Thank you for your thoughtful contributions today Charlie,"" can really go a long way. It's important to leave the meeting on a positive note.6. Start where you began. Just as you prepare your opening remarks to create connection among the group, you should end in the same manner. Have an idea of what you're going to say at the end of the meeting. Ideally, your closing remarks would mirror your opening remarks. Reinforce the big picture again.

Failure to do so could keep you from making the leap to the next level, or, worse, could wipe out the progress you ve already made.Here s why:Square pegs in round holes produce inefficiency.
At its heart, the problem is about having the wrong employee in the wrong role. If your employees are a bunch of square pegs trying to fit into round holes, you re wasting valuable time and money. Sure some employees displayed promise during the startup phase and have had success at certain out-of-the-box functions. But, those functions get more complex as a company grows. An admin assistant who managed payroll for five workers has a bigger learning curve once you hit 50. Rather than waste resources supporting a learning curve as you ramp up, you are often better off hiring someone from the outside with a better skill set and less of a need for hand-holding. It might be uncomfortable to do because it might require managing employees  feelings about their value to the organization. But, if done right, it s what s best for both your employees and for your business long-term.You re risking employee engagement. 
If you continue to expect the ""right"" employees to fill the wrong roles, at some point they will get frustrated. Think about it: If you have all these mismatched workers and roles, employees have a higher risk of failure. Some may never get it right. It may not be for a lack of trying, but this kind of situation can have a severe impact on employee engagement within your company. Once employees have lost interest, it s hard to recapture it.You could be suffering from reputational risk. 
Do you really want to be known for your inefficiencies? The busier you get, the harder it is to fake that you have employees who have no idea what they re doing. They re not just faking it internally. These are the people servicing your customers. You may think that no one on the outside notices, but you re wrong. Once your customers get wind, your reputation is at risk. Remember, it only takes one bad review to hobble your success   and jeopardize your future.You could be hurting your ability to be compliant. 
Every industry has its own compliance requirements. Some have tight government-imposed regulations, while others rely on companies themselves to do most of the policing. Either way, you need people with compliance expertise in areas like legal and accounting to do it right. I ve seen business leaders convince themselves that it s OK to make it up as you go along or learn as you go. This might work for a little while, but it can t last. As an entrepreneur, you must understand that the longer you wait to correct mismatches, the harder it will be later. Don t wait until you have a legal or quality-control problem to do this assessment. By then it could be too late.

/article/228191,Millennial Managers Seen as 'Entitled',"Gen Y managers are seen as 'entitled and concerned primarily about individual promotion,' according to a new study.","Like your new, young, manager?If you said no, you've got lots of company.Generation Y managers are widely perceived as entitled, and score significantly lower as hard-working team players in newly released research from EY, the global firm that includes Ernst & Young LLP.That's especially striking since members of Gen Y, or the millennial generation, which EY defines as people aged 18 to 32, are moving into management at a rapid pace. Some 87 percent of Gen Y managers in the EY survey took on a new management role, between 2008 and 2013, compared with 38 percent of Gen X managers and just 19 percent of those aging baby boomer managers.Gen Y workers, including managers, now make up about a third of the U.S. workforce, according to Karyn Twaronite, EY's Americas inclusiveness officer. And at EY itself, which hires thousands of young recruits every year, Twaronite says the workforce is almost two-thirds Gen Y.So if 68 percent of that age cohort is perceived as ""entitled and concerned primarily about individual promotion,"" as the EY survey found, that's an issue.Entitled workers, those who feel they are owed things from their organization and that their excellence is a given, are less likely to lead teams effectively and advocate for subordinates.A 2010 study by Paul Harvey, then an assistant professor of management at the University of New Hampshire, found that entitled employees are more likely to feel frustrated on the job and to lash out at colleagues.""The frustration experienced by entitled workers appears to stem from perceived inequities in the rewards received by co-workers to whom psychologically entitled employees feel superior,"" Harvey said.Part of Gen Y's management problem may just be inexperience. The next older cohort, Gen X, ages 33 to 48, were perceived as the strongest managers by 70 percent of survey respondents, Twaronite said.""That's even more than boomers,"" Twaronite said. ""Only 5 percent said Gen Y was prepared to lead.""But if managers think this is something that will simply fix itself, they are mistaken, she said.""I would caution companies from thinking this is generational gibberish,"" Twaronite said. ""There is a real shift.""She thinks companies need to be helping their Gen Y managers develop more positive management qualities.Fewer than half of Gen Y members expect to be working standard office hours five to 10 years from now.The good news is that Gen Y members are perceived as tech savvy, and smart about ways to leverage social media. They are also seen as inclusive leaders who display what EY calls ""'diversity"" skills, or the ability to build culturally competent teams.""And they come across as enthusiastic and adaptable, qualities that may help them shift gears so that in a future survey, fewer than the current 36 percent of respondents may say they are hard to work with.
Gen Y members are also quite ambitious. Twaronite points out that they view promotions as a perk more highly than their older counterparts and Gen Y women value them more than Gen Y men.""It really demonstrates that the next generation of women leaders are really serious about their careers,"" she said.Looking further ahead, there may be even more good news. ""I have read in the research that the generation coming up behind Gen Y will tend to be much more conservative,"" Twaronite said. They appear to be less likely to change jobs as often, for example.If they can get that entitlement thing under control, that will really be something to anticipate.

/article/228002,Changing Your Health Plan Due to Obamacare? Survey Staffers First,Getting your team's input should be one of your first steps to prepare for the new health reforms.,"Part of our ongoing Obamacare strategizing timeline to help businesses prepare for the upcoming health-care reforms. A few years ago, insurance provider Aflac surveyed its employees about its benefits plan, inviting staffers to write responses to open-ended questions about what they did and did not like about their health-plan choices. Much to the surprise of Aflac's top executives, several employees divulged that they were single parents who were not happy that they had to pay for expensive family coverage, says Audrey Boone Tillman, executive vice president of Aflac Corporate Services in Columbus, Ga. So Aflac came back the next year with an additional option that was affordable for both the company and its single working parents: a medical plan that would cover one adult plus his or her children. ""We wouldn't have put that on our radar if we hadn't done the survey,"" Tillman says.Now that you have an additional year to comply with the Affordable Care Act, otherwise known as Obamacare, you should consider surveying your employees before you start plotting any changes to your health plan. Regardless of whether you'll be offering health coverage for the first time in 2015--perhaps because you have more than 50 full-timers and are required to under the law--or you need to change your plan to be fully compliant, a workplace survey can put you on the right path. ""Benefits are a tremendous investment, and you want to make sure they're of value to employees. There's no better way to find that out then to ask them,"" Tillman says.A good way to start your survey is to ask employees to rank all the current features of your plan, along with potential services you might add. This should include dental, vision, and mental health coverage, plus niche services like subsidies for gym memberships or adult day care for elderly parents. Even if you don't think you can afford to offer all those features, just knowing whether employees want them can be valuable. ""If you're a small employer, it might not be feasible to offer more than one plan, so the primary goal is to figure out how to develop a plan that meets most of the needs of most people,"" says Christopher Ryan, vice president of strategic advisory services at ADP, a firm that specializes in outsourcing, payroll and benefits consultancy. In the survey, you should also ask employees to rank various options for out-of-pocket expenses and provider choices. Ask them to rank a high-deductible plan with a low premium against a low-deductible plan with a high premium, for example.""'How important is it for you to keep your current doctor? Or would you be open to an option that has a restricted provider network but is much lower in cost? Give people these hypotheticals and ask them to rank them,"" Ryan says.Then you can finish the survey with a couple of open-ended questions that allow employees to volunteer their suggestions.Doing employee surveys about health care can be tricky, however, because patient privacy regulations prohibit companies from gathering specific information about employees' health conditions. You can ask them to rank the importance of maternity benefits, for example, but you can't ask whether they intend to get pregnant in the near future. If you're afraid of crossing the line when it comes to patient privacy, it might be a good idea to assign the development and administration of the survey to a third party, such as your insurance broker or a human-resources outsourcing firm.Another benefit of using a third-party administrator is that you may be able to collect more comprehensive information through the survey than you could if you were doing it yourself. If you already offer a health plan but are planning to change it, a broker or benefits advisor can do a ""disruption survey,"" asking employees what doctors they use now and then cross-comparing the results with the list of doctors who participate in the potential new plan. Then that third-party provider can tell you, without divulging too many private details, which employees would be disrupted by the change, meaning they would no longer be able to see their favorite doctors.""You can determine if the people who are disrupted are important or not,"" says David Lewis, founder and president of Operations Inc., a Norwalk, Conn.-based HR outsourcing firm. ""If you're choosing a plan where everybody's doctor participates except for your CEO's wife's doctor, you have to rethink it.""If you're running a startup and you just can't afford to hire someone to manage a survey, you can still find a way to gauge your employees' sentiments about health care. ""Have a focus group or town hall and talk with people about what's missing from their benefits,"" Aflac's Tillman says. ""That way the employees have some ownership in the process.""Arlene WeintraubArlene Weintraub has over fifteen years of experience writing about health care, pharmaceuticals and biotechnology and the author of a book on the anti-aging industry, Selling the Fountain of Youth (Basic Books, 2010).She has been published...Read more",Growth Strategies,2013-08-29 10:00:00
/article/227993,Should You Give Your Employees Unlimited Vacation Time?,Unlimited vacation isn't as radical as it sounds. Here are four ways to make the policy work for you.,"While many workers get two weeks per year to cram in all of their vacation time, an increasing number of companies, including Foursquare and Tumblr, have introduced a popular perk: Unlimited vacation time. If allowing your employees that kind of freedom makes you fear that no one will ever show up to work, you might want to take a closer look at the policy, says human resources consultant Andrea Herran. She is the founder of Focus HR, a human resource consultancy in Barrington, Ill., and a self-described ""huge fan of the policy. An unlimited vacation policy isn't a free-for-all. It simply means that employees are not limited to predetermined amounts of vacation time as long as their work is performed to acceptable standards and they follow the policy guidelines. In her work with companies of all sizes, Herran has found that many see little increase in vacation time used once the policy is put in place.She says adopting unlimited vacation can work for a surprising number of companies, provided there are clear guidelines. Companies benefit from a popular new perk, while relieving themselves of the drudgery of tracking vacation time used and enforcing vacation time policies. Herran offers these steps to setting your own policy.1. Involve employees.
The first step in setting a strong policy is to get the input of employees. Talk to them about how this policy will affect them and what rules and guidelines they'd like to see in place.""When you leave it up to your team to set rules, they'll often be stricter than you might be because when other people are out, it affects them directly,"" says Herran. ""No one is going to want a policy that lets someone be out for weeks at a time or who can call in at the last minute and take vacation.""Related: Your Last-Minute Summer Vacation Survival Guide2. Distribute the work. 
Work with employees to develop flexible coverage plans for each employee. For example, if the receptionist is out, how is that work covered now? Is that a sustainable solution over longer periods? If not, how can the work disbursement be adjusted to be more effective and efficient? It's a good management practice to have plans for every employee's absence anyway, Herran says.3. Set the rules. 
The first and most important rule is to be clear about the criteria that need to be met in order to take vacation time. First, employees need to be clear about their job requirements and be confident that their work performance and status is sufficient. Employees need to understand that this doesn't mean they can now take off in the middle of a big project if that will leave everyone in the lurch, Herran says. It's important to make clear the protocol for taking the time off.Require sufficient advance notice, such as several weeks or months, depending on your firm's needs. You may also limit the number of consecutive days or weeks employees may take as vacation. She also suggests that teams work together to determine when each member can take time off to ensure that two key employees are not out at the same time.4. Encourage time off. 
Clearly, employees still have to navigate guidelines and approval processes to take advantage of unlimited vacation time. However, if you find that you have employees who are simply not taking vacation at all or who are taking only a few days each year, that's an issue that needs to be addressed, as well, Herran says. Is there some sort of dysfunction there? Is there a problem with the team? The employee could be overwhelmed or even staying put to cover up wrongdoing.""Employees need to get away and recharge. If they're not doing so, something could be seriously wrong and it could be hurting your company,"" she says.Related: Most Americans Work While on Vacation, Report Finds

/article/227886,The Ins and Outs of Creating a Parental Leave Policy,"Maternity leave is nothing new, but should you give dads equal time? These four steps will help you to set a policy that works for your business.","Prince William's decision to take a two-week paternity leave following the birth of the famous royal baby George Alexander Louis received a lot of press. But his decision to take time off isn't one most men make. The 2012 National Study of Employers conducted by the Families and Work Institute, Society of Human Resources Management, and others found that leave for the spouses of women who have given birth declined between 2005 and 2012.It's one thing for the royals to take time off to hang with the little prince, but does a spousal parenting leave policy make sense for your business? The answer is a resounding ""yes"" if you ask Chris Duchesne, vice-president of global workplace solutions for Care.com, an online service that helps people find caregivers.Related: Modern Dad? Prince William to Take Two Weeks of Paternity LeaveDuchesne, a father of three, believes that allowing both parents to take advantage of leave makes a big difference when it comes to how your employees feel about your workplace. He advises some key strategies to make it work.1. Know the law. 
Employers with more than 50 employees are subject to the Family and Medical Leave Act, which requires at least 12 weeks of unpaid, job-guaranteed leave for childbirth, adoption, foster care placement, a serious personal medical condition or care of a child or spouse with a serious medical condition be granted to employees who have worked at least 1,250 hours during the preceding year.Some states have laws about paid and unpaid family leave, as well. For example, California's Paid Family Leave law allows up to six weeks of leave with partial wage replacement. It's always a good idea to check with your state's Department of Labor to determine if any state or local laws or regulations apply to your business.2. Consider the pros and cons when you set your policies. 
When it comes to spousal leave for childbirth, policies are varied. Some companies provide paid leave to both spouses. Some provide more time to mothers who have given birth than to their partners. Duchesne says the decision about what your leave policy should include depends on your business and what you can afford.If you can't afford to offer two weeks' paid leave, perhaps offer a week and the option to take additional unpaid leave, as well. Or, have leave policies accrue as employees hit certain milestones. For example, they might earn an additional day of paid leave when they've been employed a certain number of months or years.3. Walk the talk. 
Duchesne says that fathers in particular are often reluctant to take advantage of paid leave. So, if you set the policy, you should make sure that you're willing to encourage its use and not treat the leave like out-of-office work time.At the same time, it's okay to set expectations upfront: Let employees know that you expect them to develop a work coverage plan for the time they are on leave at least a few months in advance of when they expect to be out. It's also reasonable to ask if they can be available, at least by phone, for serious issues or emergencies on the job.Gwen MoranGWEN MORAN is a freelance writer and co-author of The Complete Idiot's Guide to Business Plans (Alpha, 2010).

/article/227742,Your Company's Obamacare Game Plan,Bookmark this benefit strategy timeline to make the most of the year-long extension.,"If you are still struggling to understand the Affordable Care Act, relax. You have some extra time to figure out how to comply with it, thanks to the one-year reprieve the White House announced on July 2. But that doesn t mean you should wait until next summer to start planning for the changes coming under the ACA, otherwise known as Obamacare.If your company has 50 or more full-time employees, you will have to provide health insurance starting in 2015 or face fines. While changes to the act are still likely, experts recommend that you start mapping out a strategy for the next 12 months today, so by this time next year, you ll be ready to roll out a benefits plan that s both affordable for your company and desirable to the employees you re trying to attract and retain.Here are some steps you can take in each of the coming seasons to prepare.Fall 2013Renew now. If you already offer health insurance, consider renewing early for 2014, suggests Anthony Lopez, manager of the small-business group at Mountain View, Calif-based eHealthInsurance. By doing so, you may avoid premium increases caused by some of the provisions in the law.For example, the ACA stipulates that starting next year, insurance carriers will only be able to set premiums based on a three-to-one age ratio, meaning there can only be a three-fold difference between your young, healthy workers and your older workers.""If you renew early, you can keep your age bands from the previous year,"" Lopez says. Check with your insurance broker or carrier for the early-renewal deadline and an estimate of how much you might save by renewing early.Survey staff. If you will be offering coverage for the first time in 2015, or you re planning a major benefits overhaul, now is a great time to survey your employees about how they get their health coverage today. Where do they buy their coverage? How much do they pay out-of-pocket each year for healthcare? Knowing the answers to questions such as those will help you design the optimal plan for your company.""Let s say half or more of your people get coverage through their spouse. It s not likely you re going to be able to compete with what they have access to today,"" says Tracy Watts, U.S. health-reform leader for Mercer, a unit of New York-based insurance broker Marsh & McLennan. ""You might want to offer the bare-minimum plan so it can be affordable for your employees and for you.""Winter 2013-2014Research your state s exchange. The state health insurance exchanges, which are now called ""marketplaces,"" will roll out in January. That s the time to start sussing them out as you strategize for 2015. If you employ 100 or fewer people, you may be able to buy an affordable small-business plan on your state s exchange. And depending on the size and makeup of your workforce, it may actually make more sense for you to send all your employees to buy individual plans on the exchanges, rather than offering an in-house plan. But before you do anything, scrutinize your state exchange to make sure it s operating smoothly and all the kinks are being worked out in a timely manner.Consider part-timers. Winter is also a good time to determine whether you should shift to a largely part-time workforce to dodge the ACA all together, or at least to hold down the costs covering your employees, suggests Brian Miller, chief operating officer of the small-business consultancies AdviCoach and The Entrepreneur Source in Southbury, Conn. ""The reality is that small businesses may want to hire more part-time workers,"" Miller says. ""But you need to do some workforce planning and make decisions about what kind of job-sharing you can do without sacrificing the quality of the employees you hire or the customer care you provide.""Spring 2014Don t forget private exchanges. By the time the flowers start blooming next year, you should have a pretty good idea about how you d like to structure your benefits plan in 2015. Your broker can shop around for the best health plan, but you can also do some research yourself. For example, you may want to explore the many private health exchanges that are now offering small-business plans, such as those run by Towers Watson, Mercer, Aon Hewitt, and eHealthinsurance. Lopez suggests doing a  dry run,  by having your broker model several choices for you or using one of the many available online tools that allow you to input some basic information about your employees and then view a sampling of available plans.Summer 2014Educate your staff. With your benefits plan firmly in place for 2015, next summer is when you need to start thinking about the best way to educate your employees about the impending changes. Take the time to put together a clearly written educational package, so you can distribute it before open enrollment starts in October. After all, health reform is confusing, and it s your job to answer your employees  questions and allay their concerns. An overview of how to orient your staff can be found here.By next summer, your employees will have been barraged with ads from insurance companies eager to sell them individual plans. It s up to you to help them sort out their options. ""We re going to be hit with a huge media blitz TV ads, radio spots"" from insurers and others who stand to benefit from health reform, Watts says.

/article/227750,4 Ways to Destroy Toxic Office Politics,"When the workplace is filled with drama, employees and productivity suffer. Here are four ways to stomp out the politics and get back to work.","Whether it's the office gossip or the passive-aggressive employee who makes everyone miserable, office politics can be a drain on productivity and a death knell for office morale.Office politics can be an issue in businesses of all sizes, says human resource and ""culture correction"" consultant Kirsten E. Ross, founder of Focus Forward Coaching in Royal Oak, Mich. Ross works with both companies and individuals to develop good workplace cultures. Her clients have included Monster.com, Fitness magazine, and Blue Cross Blue Shield, to name a few. She offers these four tips to jettison the politics and get back to work.1. Review your processes. 
Inefficient or poor processes can cause power struggles and frustration, fostering conflict and creating a breeding ground for office politics. For example, if expense reimbursements are handled by one employee who uses his or her power to delay those reimbursements inappropriately, perhaps holding up checks for people she or he doesn't like, employees will feel angry and betrayed by the company.This feeling can hurt their overall job performance. The solution may be to have a system of accountability such as another having another employee responsible for reviewing a list of reimbursements due to ensure that checks are being cut in a timely manner.""Look for processes that are causing conflict or where one person has too much power and figure out how to spread that power to more people,"" Ross suggests.Related: 5 Ways to Keep Employees From Checking Out on the Job2. Create incentives for the results you want.
If you want behavior replicated in your workplace, it's important to model the behavior, as well as recognize and reward it when you find it in the workplace. Ross says that company owners who treat their people fairly and recognize productive collaborators and team-builders will find more of that behavior in their cultures. The reward doesn't have to be monetary, Ross says. Public recognition in a meeting can serve as an appropriate ""great job.""3. Discourage power- and attention-seeking behavior.
When your people come to you with petty disagreements or conflicts, don't reward the behavior by getting involved immediately. Of course, if it's a big issue, like someone is being threatened or a customer is involved, you need to take immediate action. But, Ross advises directing the employees to get together and figure out a way to solve the conflict themselves. Since so many of those conflicts revolve around power struggles and poor processes, finding ways to diffuse power struggles by streamlining and improving how the process is carried out can reduce the behavior.4. Conduct regular performance reviews. 
Incorporate your expectations about teamwork and collaboration into your performance reviews. Discuss with your employees how they get along with others and how they help others in the workplace. If you have an employee who seems to regularly be at the center of conflicts and drama, discuss your concerns with that employee and get to the bottom of the issues. In some cases, the employee may be unaware of what he or she is doing. If it's purposeful and persistent, you should take action to correct the behavior or, in the worst cases, possibly fire the employee, Ross says.Related: 3 Toxic Employees You Need to Fire NowGwen MoranGWEN MORAN is a freelance writer and co-author of The Complete Idiot's Guide to Business Plans (Alpha, 2010).

/article/227710,How to Get Everything Done By Doing Less,"Entrepreneurs often have the urge to do it all themselves. But if you want your business to grow and keep your sanity, try these three strategies instead.","Most entrepreneurs subscribe to the philosophy: ""If you want something done right, you have to do it yourself."" This mantra, accepted by many small-business owners as fact, is only half true. If you want something done right once and you have no other time commitments, then the fastest way, in fact, is to do it yourself. However, if you want something done right repeatedly, day-in and day-out, all day long, and you don't have the time to do 10 full-time jobs all at once, you can't do it yourself.To get everything your company needs done, you must transfer procedural knowledge, decision-making guidelines and a schedule from inside your head to your employees.Here is how you do it:1. Document the process. Every kind of work in a business follows a process. There's a process for the best way to answer the phone. There's a process for shipping products.In most small businesses, the knowledge about how to do everything is stuck inside the entrepreneur's head. In situations where employees lack knowledge, the employees will either guess what is supposed to be done or constantly pepper you with questions that take longer to answer than just taking action yourself.To solve this dilemma, document the step-by-step procedures for how to complete a commonly performed task in your business. There are three ways to do this:Write a procedural manual describing how to perform a task.Create a checklist describing the steps -- assuming your employees already have the skills to do each step but often forget or skip steps.Make a video using your smartphone as you perform the task, explaining aloud what you are doing and why you are doing it.The next time you assign an employee a particular task, just give her the manual, the checklist or video tutorial.2. Document decision-making guidelines. In most small businesses, employees will ask you, ""What do you want to do?"" As an entrepreneur, you make decisions big and small all day long. To grow a business without driving yourself crazy, you can't delegate only the tasks to others. You have to delegate decisions to others as well. The key to getting others to make good decisions is to provide them with the implicit decision-making guidelines you personally use.When an employee asks you, ""What do you want to do about this situation?"" without even realizing it, you run that decision through a set of decision-making criteria. If you want to extricate yourself from these decisions, write down the decision-making criteria you usually implicitly use and give the list to others.For example, in my company, my staff uses three criteria to make any customer service-related decision that isn't already documented in our procedures:Does the decision protect our reputation?Does the decision favor the customer?Does the decision cost less than $500 to implement?If the answer is yes across the board, staff members can make a customer service decision for themselves without having to ask me first. If the decision will cost more than $500 but less than $1,000, they can still make the decision without me, but they are expected to notify me after the fact. If the cost is more than $1,000, they need to ask me first.So far, they have made the same decision I would have made 98 percent of the time. Best of all, there have been virtually no meetings, phone calls or emails to discuss these decisions.3. Create a schedule. To ensure the right things get done in the right way at the right time, you need to follow this final step: creating a schedule. Create a list of daily, weekly, monthly and quarterly tasks that need to be done for each role in your company. For more complex tasks, reference where staff can find the procedure manual, checklist or video tutorial that explains how to do the task.Follow these three steps and tasks will be completed, decisions will get made and things will be done on-time with only minimal involvement from you.

Your Four Main Obamacare Options,A recent webinar outlines the choices businesses need to make under the Affordable Care Act.,"Small businesses with fewer than 50 full-time employees -- or the equivalent -- as defined by the U.S. Affordable Care Act may wonder what they should do to prepare for employee open enrollment on the new healthcare exchanges this October.If you're among those with questions, watch this recent webinar hosted by a state office of the U.S. Small Business Administration. In it, Frank Knapp Jr., president and CEO of the South Carolina Small Business Chamber of Commerce, shares the main options. We've listed the highlights below, but you can access it yourself here.Option 1: Do nothing. Businesses with fewer than 50 ""full-time-equivalent"" employees aren't obligated to provide coverage under the ACA. These businesses can opt out of providing health insurance and take no action. In this scenario, employees will be responsible for obtaining their own health insurance and will be eligible for government premium subsidies if they qualify based on income and if they purchase coverage on the individual exchanges. Bear in mind that the law defines full-timers as employees who work, on average, at least 30 hours weekly, and counts the hours worked by part-timers toward an employer's number of full-time-equivalent workers.To note: You may decide to ""do nothing"" as a business owner, but you're still required (as an individual) to obtain health insurance for yourself and family, either via the exchange, outside the exchange or through your spouse's employer.Option 2: Do not offer health insurance, but offer help. These companies can find an insurance agent or broker to guide employees through the exchange, and help them choose the most appropriate coverage for themselves and their families. Qualifying employees will be eligible for subsidies under this scenario as well. Keep in mind that subsidies are not just for low-income Americans; many middle-class individuals and families will qualify as well. Brokers receive commissions from the exchanges and might negotiate fees with businesses, depending on the additional services they can offer you.Option 3: Use the exchanges to offer one plan for all employees. Offer health insurance to employees through the small-business exchange in your state, choosing one plan for all employees. You can do this on your own or consult with an insurance broker or agent who also can handle enrollment. Employees enrolled in this plan will not be eligible for government premium subsidies. (The Obama administration expects that employers eventually will be able to offer employees a choice of plans on the small-business exchanges for coverage starting in 2015.)Option 4: Obtain health insurance for employees outside of the exchange. Employers may do this on their own or through a broker or agent. By securing group health insurance outside the exchange, however, the employer will become ineligible for the tax credits that are available to many small businesses offering coverage through the official, state-based marketplaces. Employees won't be eligible for government premium assistance in this scenario.Dinah Wisenberg BrinDinah Wisenberg Brin is a freelance writer based in Philadelphia.

/article/227699,Companies to Disclose CEO Pay Vs. Employee Pay,"Think it'd be nice to know how much a CEO makes compared with his or her typical employee? Well, you're going to find out soon.","Do you think it'd be nice to know how much a CEO makes compared with the typical amount made by an employee of his or her company? Well, you're going to find out. Soon.This past week the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission told a congressional committee that the agency is finally ready to put into effect a law passed by Congress three years ago.""I hope that it is completed in the next month or two,"" Mary Jo White said at a Senate Banking Committee hearing on Tuesday, according to The Hill. ""We are very much as a staff and commission focused on that rule-making.""Publicly traded companies will have to calculate how much all their employees get paid, figure out the median, then compare it to the CEO's pay package. Oddly enough, both supporters and opponents of the new rule argue it's all about the investor.""It will add another data point for investors and even boards of directors to compare performance,"" said Brandon Rees, acting director of the AFL-CIO's office of investment.""This is useless information,"" countered Baruch I. Lev, a professor of accounting and finance at NYU.Both sides have what seem to be some valid points.When the CEO is making huge amounts over and above everyone else in the company, that hurts morale, which in turn hurts productivity, Rees argued. This kind of information will flag to investors when it's getting out of hand. It will also allow investors to compare the company's pay structure to that of competitors, he suggested.Sure, the ratio of a CEO's pay to employee pay might be vastly different between Wal-Mart and Goldman Sachs. But if it's vastly different between Wal-Mart and Target ... that could flag a potential problem, Rees suggested.On the other hand, when you get the numbers, what do they mean?""First, there is no yardstick for fair differential between CEO and median employee,"" said Lev. ""We have no way of quantifying adequate compensation for CEO's vastly larger responsibility, experience and risk, relative to median employee. What is a fair differential? 10, 50,100 times? No one knows.""""Second, who is the median employee? In McDonald's it's probably a part-time employee. Same in retail. And if McDonald's median employee earns more than Wendy's, great for the former. Who cares what the CEO makes? The whole concept of such a comparison fits a society built on envy. I don't begrudge the higher salary of a Nobel Laureate professor.""Of course investors have always groused about CEO pay, particularly when that CEO hasn't goosed any gains in the company stock. Indeed, stories here on CNBC.com comparing CEO pay versus stock performance always are popular (much like Apple stock).How the SEC directs companies to make the median calculation will be crucial. What employees will be counted? Overseas? Part-timers? And over what time periods?Our competition over at Bloomberg put together a neat little table making a stab at a calculation of sorts. Of course, they couldn't get real company payroll information, so they used industry averages estimated by the government. You can check it out here.The figures are intriguing, ranging from nearly 1,800-to-1 down to 173-to-1. The wide range may also signal how subjective the numbers may be or even how easily they may be manipulated.""One of my clients told me he could probably just outsource some departments to alter where the median falls,"" said a pay consultant.Indeed, the possible complexity of the calculation has been a main complaint of the business lobby. Labor opponents argue there are plenty of statistical methodologies available.""It's hard to believe they can't formulate a calculation,"" said Rees. ""What's more likely is that they just don't want to do it because it will embarrass CEOs.""More from CNBCAsia markets largely gain after Fed holds rates steady and corporate earnings come throughChina's banks are now stable as 'shadow' banking looks less threatening, Moody's saysHere are the two top places where WPP will be putting ad dollars this year, according to CEO SorrellAllen WastlerAllen Wastler is Managing Editor of CNBC.com and the author of the CNBC.com blog, Two Way Street With Allen Wastler.

/article/227681,Would You Let Your Employees Drink on the Job?,A Portuguese court ruled that employees could drink alcohol at work. Is it a human resources nightmare or happy perk?,"Is a drunk worker a happy worker?The Huffington Post notes that a court in Portugal ordered a garbage company to re-hire a worker it had terminated because he was drunk on the job.The main reason was that the company, which wasn t named, didn t have a formal written policy on alcohol in the workplace. But the court went further, suggesting there might actually be benefits to being soused at work.""It is to be noted that with alcohol, the worker may forget about life's hardships ... and the public may even consider that this happy worker is a very efficient, excellent and quick remover of scrap,"" according to the ruling, as quoted by HuffPo.Most U.S. companies that don t want their employees hitting the Wild Turkey tend to write such language into contracts. However, they are routinely broken. In theory, getting a cold one from the beer cart during a sales golf meeting or having wine at a client dinner, can violate the policies. Mostly, companies don t enforce these rules unless someone goes too far.However, at the same time, drinking on the job can be dangerous. No one wants a drunk at the wheel of a construction crane, or someone smelling like Ketel One and Listerine at a client presentation.Still, would allowing a worker to take a dram now and again spur creativity or make them happier?

/article/227670,The Dark Truth About the Falling Unemployment Rate,"The unemployment rate is dropping not because more people are finding work, but because more people have stopped looking for work.","What if the biggest problem with job creation is that Americans don t want to work?It is a surprisingly fair question when one focuses on the numbers behind the July Employment Situation Report, released Friday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.The U.S. economy added 162,000 jobs in July, which was well short of estimates, and the number of jobs added in June was revised downward to 188,000 from the original report of 195,000. May s report was also revised lower.
The unemployment rate, though, ticked down to 7.4 percent from 7.6 percent. That is the lowest it has been since December 2008.Related: Why Overseas Job Creation is Good for U.S. WorkersIt is also one of the most bearish numbers in the jobs report. While some view the unemployment rate as a sign of the health of the economy, it is really just a simple equation involving those who are actively participating in the workforce and those who are employed. Because of this, one typically sees the unemployment rate rise as more payrolls are added, since the number of people looking for work rises as jobs become more available. In recoveries, the unemployment rate almost always ticks higher before starting a steady decline.That is not happening here. If anything, the unemployment rate is dropping not because more people are finding work   after all, the 162,000 last month is nowhere near enough to keep up with population growth   but because more people have stopped looking for work. If you are not looking for a job over a certain period of time, the Labor Department drops you from its unemployment calculation.The total number of people considered in the labor force decreased by 37,000, to 155.8 million. The total number of people not counted in the labor force in total in July rose 240,000 to close to 90 million.That has had an impact on what s known as the labor-force participation rate. This calculates the civilian population that is actually in the job market in one way or another. Because it doesn t exclude people not looking for work, it is usually a better gauge of how many people nationwide are actually working. The participation rate in July fell to 63.4 percent, from 63.5 percent.Ponder that for a moment: Just 63.4% of the working-age civilian population in the United States is involved in the job market.Related: Small Businesses Fuel Private Sector Hiring in JulyWhy so few? Economists have pointed to a number of factors. For one thing, there could be pessimism about their prospects, so some job seekers choose to stay home. More likely, though, is that, having lost their jobs, it is difficult to find work at or near their past pay levels. That is not the job-seekers fault: Many businesses are loath to hire someone who is taking a large salary cut for fear that the employee will continue to look for a better job elsewhere.Then there is the nature of the workforce. Part-time jobs in July came in at 174,000. Full-time jobs came in at 92,000. (If you re wondering what that adds up to well north of 162,000, the Labor Department calculates full-time and part-time from a different survey than it uses for the headline number.) Some of that may be because of added seasonal summer health, but it is confirms the predictions that Obamacare, with its requirements of health coverage for a certain threshold of full-time workers, would lead to more part-time hiring.The jobs people have right now aren t great. Average hourly earnings fell 0.1 percent to $23.98. Economists expected that figure to rise. The average work week fell to 34.4 hours, from 34.5 hours   again another sign of an increase in part-time help.So the job market is soft, and people just aren t ready to look for work since the pool of jobs isn t all that great.That is why there can t be a meaningful improvement in the job market for quite some time.First, there is the philosophical problem. America is built on a free-market system where people are rewarded for their labor. Unlike it controlled economies, the system is set up to provide equal opportunities, not equal outcomes. Work hard in capitalism and you will be rewarded with pay and benefits. That benefits the worker, and it benefits the employer (and the state, which derives revenue from the taxes on that relationship).But chronic unemployment has led to more safety-net programs kicking in, thus taking away an incentive to find work. As a result, the time many workers spend out of the labor force has risen. There is something almost cancerous to the American capitalist system when so many people don t seek work.Then there is the employer s perspective. While the potential worker is not looking for a job, employers become even less likely to hire them when they do. For one thing, productivity, thanks to innovation and more use of technology, improves every day. Companies that once needed, say, 20, workers to thrive have learned to do so with maybe 16 or 17. There is no reason to hire to get back to pre-recession levels if your profitability has improved with a smaller labor force.Also, when you don t remain active in the workforce, you are often viewed as less desirable as a potential hire. As you stay home, voluntarily or otherwise, you are perceived as having an erosion of skills. Rightly or wrongly, that s why employers love stealing away a worker from a competitor, rather than offering a job to someone who is unemployed.So, as more numbers like the July employment report crop up, it is hard to find a narrative that supports job creation. There is more work to be done.Ray HennesseyRay Hennessey, the former editorial director of Entrepreneur, is Chief Innovation Officer at JConnelly, an integrated communications firm in New York, and a senior advisor to Alley, a coworking community in Manhattan.

/article/227651,Startups Creating Fewer Jobs -- Not a Problem,The decline in new jobs created by small businesses could be a good thing. Here's why.,"Many policy makers and entrepreneurship advocates are worried. Startups are creating far fewer jobs than they used to, according to analysis of the Census Bureau's Business Dynamics database. New firms' share of employment fell by nearly two-thirds between 1977 and 2011.In large part the decline in job creation stems from a decline in the new-firm share of businesses. Despite ticking up in 2011, the new company fraction has been trending mostly downward for the past 35 years and in 2011 was roughly half (8.2 percent) of its 1977 level (16.5 percent).But the decline in new business job creation might be less of a problem than many entrepreneurship advocates and policy makers think.Consider what else is correlated with startup rates and employment by startups and you will see why. Sure the startup rate is down substantially over the past 35 years, but so is the business failure rate, or the number of companies that go under every year. That is, as the rate at which people start new companies has gone down, so too has the rate at which existing businesses shut down.A similar pattern is present with job creation. Just as the rate of job creation by new businesses is down significantly over the past three-and-a-half decades, so too is the rate of job destruction from business closures. As you can see from the figure below, as fewer jobs are being destroyed by the closure of existing businesses, fewer jobs are being created from the founding of new ones. This is where the decline in startup employment might not be a problem. Job loss from business shutdowns is a bad thing. No one wants people thrown out of work because their employer fails. Therefore, the declining startup rate is associated with a good thing: a declining business failure rate.We don't know why both startup and failure rates have been going down over the past 35 years. But one plausible scenario is that existing entrepreneurs have gotten better at running their businesses. As a result, fewer existing businesses go under every year, destroying the jobs of those who work for them. With fewer existing businesses going under, fewer entrepreneurs need to start businesses to replace them, leading to lower levels of new company employment.Consider the example of the local pizza place in your neighborhood, which is the prototypical startup. If the people running the restaurant are doing well, their business stays alive and maintains its current level of employment. No one else needs to open an eating establishment in your neighborhood because the surviving pizza place is meeting demand. But if the existing pizza shop isn't doing well and the entrepreneurs running it have to shut it down, there is unfulfilled demand for a restaurant in your neighborhood. So someone might take over the shuttered location and hire people to work in a new dining establishment. The first example means low rates of new company job creation and low rates of job destruction from firms going under, while the second example means high rates of both new company job creation and job destruction from companies going out of business.Before policy makers and entrepreneurship advocates get too worked up about the decline in startup company employment, they need to ask the question: Are fewer people working at new businesses simply because fewer people are losing their jobs through the closure of existing ones?

/article/227632,Obamacare Delay Estimated to Cost U.S. $12 Billion,The Congressional Budget Office estimates the increased cost of giving large employers an additional year before they are hit with fines.,"Giving businesses another year to comply with the Affordable Care Act is expected to set the Obama administration back $12 billion, according to estimates by congressional researchers.The Tuesday report by the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan economic watchdog of the federal government, says that giving businesses with 50 or more full-time or full-time-equivalent employees until 2015 to comply with the Affordable Care Act will cost $12 billion in lost tax revenue.The CBO now expects Obamacare to cost $1.375 trillion over the next decade, which is $12 billion more than previously estimated. The increase is primarily due to a $10 billion reduction in penalty payments by employers that would have been collected in 2015, the CBO says. Changes to the exchange subsidies are expected to cost another $3 billion, while other smaller changes are expected to save $1 billion.Prior to the July 2 announcement that the administration would delay collecting fines until 2015, businesses with 50 employees would have been required to offer their employees health coverage or face an annual penalty of at least $2,000 per employee starting in 2014.

Of those, the smallest -- ones with fewer than 20 employees -- added the most, with 51,000.Businesses with 50 to 499 workers added 60,000 jobs. Large businesses, with 500 more more employees, added the remaining 57,000. Most were large organizations, with more than 1,000 employees, which accounted for 50,000 of the new positions, according to ADP.Small businesses have traditionally been the driving force in job creation, as the economy has slowly added more positions following the financial crisis and resulting recession. In the latest report, it appeared the all sectors -- except for manufacturing -- saw job gains, with the service sector continuing to account for much of the job growth.The 200,000 jobs added were above the 180,000 predicted by economists.

/article/227623,Thousands of Fast-Food Workers Strike to Raise Wages,Restaurant workers in seven cities around the U.S. strike for the right to unionize and $15 an hour wages.,"You may find yourself waiting longer for McNuggets or a Whopper this week as thousands of workers in seven cities around the country strike for the right to unionize and $15 an hour wages.Building on the momentum of strikes that began in November in New York City, organizers say dozens of restaurants in New York, Chicago, St. Louis, Milwaukee, Kansas City, Detroit and Flint, Mich., will be affected by waves of worker walkouts over the course of the week.""These workers need a raise and they need representation in the workplace,"" said Martin Rafanan, community director for STL735. The acronym stands for ""St. Louis Can't Survive on $7.35,"" referring to Missouri's minimum wage. Rafanan said the group, which plans to strike Monday and Tuesday, hopes to build on a May strike when about 100 workers walked off the job.Related: D.C. Moves to Hike Minimum Wage for Big-Box Retail Employees Despite Wal-Mart Opposition""In this particular set of actions this week, we're expecting to strike 50 stores and between 100 and 200 workers,"" he said, adding that the response to the May strike was greater than anticipated. The group only expected 40 or 50 workers to walk out. ""It ended up being a much bigger thing.""Monday's action could see 500-plus workers at dozens of New York City fast food restaurants abandoning their posts for picket lines, said Jonathan Westin, director of Fast Food Forward and executive director of New York Communities For Change.At a McDonald's across the street from Yankee Stadium, several dozen people chanted, ""We can't survive on $7.25."" In April, 400 fast food employees walked off the job in New York. At twice the size of the group's inaugural walkout in November, local organizers called that event the biggest fast food strike in the country -- until now.These actions are designed to call attention to ""the contradictions between the folks at the top ... and the workers themselves living in poverty,"" Westin said.Spokespeople from McDonald's and Yum Brands (the parent company of Taco Bell, KFC and Pizza Hut) referred questions to their trade group, the National Restaurant Association.Related: Taco Bell Avoids Childhood-Obesity Debate by Axing Kids' Meals""The restaurant industry provides opportunities for millions of Americans, women and men from all backgrounds, to move up the ladder and succeed. In addition to providing more than 13 million job opportunities, the industry is one of the best paths to achieving the American dream, with 80 percent of owners and managers having started their careers in entry-level positions,"" Scott DeFife, the executive vice president for policy and government affairs at the National Restaurant Association, told NBC News via email.""Restaurants operate on very thin profit margins. Significant additional labor costs can negatively impact a restaurant's ability to hire or maintain jobs. The cost of living varies greatly nationwide, while current proposals aimed at doubling the minimum wage would have a significant effect on the private sector's ability to create jobs, especially those typically filled by first-time workers and teens.""Representatives from other restaurants responded to the walkouts.""As a corporation, we respect the rights of all workers; however, Burger King Corp. does not make hiring, firing or other employment-related decisions for our franchisees ... Burger King restaurants offer compensation and benefits that are consistent with the QSR industry,"" a company spokesperson said in a statement via email. QSR is industry jargon for quick-service restaurant, or fast food.Wendy's is ""still assessing the situation,"" company spokesman Bob Bertini said via email. ""We have no additional comment.""This week's actions come on the heels of a much-lambasted budget guide for McDonald's workers that recommended they get a second job and budgeted just $20 a month for health insurance, and a report by the National Employment Law Project showing that the vast majority of fast food positions are dead-end jobs.Earlier NELP research found that nearly 60 percent of post-recession job creation was for work that pays an hourly wage of $13.83 or less.An open letter signed by more than 100 economists and published this month by the University of Massachusetts, Amherst's Political Economy Research Institute titled, ""Economists in Support of a $10.50 U.S. Minimum Wage,"" makes the case that raising wages would add just 5 cents to the price of a Big Mac.Although fast food jobs are often thought of as work that provides teenagers with spending money, the average age of today's fast food worker is 32, the paper said, which has much grimmer implications. ""If a worker today is employed full time for a full 52-week year at a minimum wage job today, she or he is making $15,080. This is 19 percent below the official poverty line for a family of three,"" the paper said.Related: The Five Things Employees Really WantMore from CNBCAsia markets mostly higher after Fed holds rates steady, corporate earnings awaitedMessaging startup Slack is raising $250 million in a new funding roundBank earnings off to 'positive start' in this financial hub",Growth Strategies,2013-07-30 19:00:00

/article/227560,"Brace for a Bumpy Road Ahead, Obamacare Rollout Expected to Be Patchy","Small-business owners will soon be able to enroll for health insurance on new, online marketplaces. Health-care experts weigh in on how that process might look.","The transition to Obamacare is expected to be smooth in some states and messy in others.As part of the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, digital exchanges where individuals and businesses can shop for, compare and purchase health insurance will launch in October. Small-business owners will have their own online marketplaces to compare insurance programs and enroll in coverage for themselves and their employees, called SHOPs, an acronym for Small Business Health Options Program.On a conference call with reporters today, organized by small-business software provider Sage, several health-care industry experts weighed in on what to expect in this first phase of Obamacare. My expectation is that the rollout, which starts on October 1, is going to come close to succeeding in a number of jurisdictions, and it is going to be a big mess in some others,  says Henry Aaron, health-care expert, economist and fellow at the nonpartisan Washington, D.C.-based Brookings Institution.Related: Health-Care Innovators Get President Obama's AttentionThe transition will be very different in, say, Massachusetts than it will be in Texas, says Aaron.  The bottom line here is this experience is going to be all over the map,  he says. In Massachusetts, Maryland and Washington, D.C., Aaron has seen a  cooperative spirit  among policy makers, industry leaders and state officials, where all parties have an understanding of the inherent frustrations involved in launching a new system.  You are going to have other situations where the problems are worse because of the lack of cooperation to begin with, and people are going to point to those problems and say,  See? We told you so.   Small-business owners have reported feeling anxiety ahead of the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. Aaron, who has been appointed to the District of Columbia Health Benefit Exchange Authority and is responsible for establishing the health-care exchange for Washington, D.C., says he has observed  a sense of hope mixed in equal parts with deep concern and worry about what is going to happen in six months to a year. Seventeen states and Washington, D.C., have opted to set up their own health-care exchanges, while the rest have deferred the responsibility, leaving it in the hands of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The relative level of ease that business owners can expect in signing up for the exchanges will depend on several factors, including the number of uninsured individuals in your state and cooperation from state-level regulators and insurance officials, says Aaron.Related: Businesses Have Additional Year Before Facing Obamacare Penalty FeesPart of the struggle is that millions of individuals will be accessing the exchanges, so even a small percentage of error can translate into a huge number of mistakes.  If we do something reasonably well, most of the time, that means we are good 90 percent of the time, which most people would give you an  A,  says Bernard DiFiore, president and chief executive of BenefitMall, a benefit provider that has been involved in the implementation of exchanges in a number of states. But when you are dealing with health insurance, a 90 percent success rate is going to come across as a failure to the public.For example, a 90 percent success rate for a health exchange that is responsible for matching 30,000 individuals would mean 3,000 very unhappy individuals, says DiFiore. A few unhappy, vocal customers have the potential to upset the public and sour them on the process entirely. That could  create massive concern about the delivery of the products, and I worry about that,  DiFiore says.Johnny Laurent, the vice president and general manager of Sage, says Obamacare is the most pressing issue for approximately two-thirds of Sage s clients. And politicians know that. The relative success or failure of the Affordable Care Act s implementation is expected to be the central, deciding factor in midterm Congressional elections, says Aaron.Related: Health Insurance Reform: Prep Your Staff for the ChangesMedia outlets and politicians will likely present a range of narratives about the implementation based on their political leanings, breeding confusion and stoking anxiety, says Aaron. ""We are going to have something of a media circus starting in a couple of months,"" he says.To help small-business owners navigate the process in their state, Sage is developing a computer program, expected to be released this fall, to walk employers through upcoming decisions that they will have to make. Already, a number of online resources are available to help business owners understand the upcoming decisions.

And this isn't the only recent deal announcement that included pot-sweeteners to keep key employees onboard: In April, Dell's board approved $91.1 million in retention bonuses for key players while it pursued a buyout deal.
Retention bonuses can be useful tools in specific situations, says business consultant Andy Birol, who heads Pittsburgh-based Birol Growth Consulting, an international management consulting firm specializing in growth strategies, including mergers and acquisitions.Designed to keep key people during periods of transition, retention bonuses usually come with a contract, and sometimes the bonus that accrues over time--the longer they stay, the more the employee will get paid up until the expiration of the bonus period. These incentives help ensure that expertise and institutional knowledge isn't lost during acquisition, merger or other times when it's most critical.
He says there are three times when they're most appropriate. 1. Talent preservation. 
Jittery employees may jump ship, fearing their jobs are in jeopardy during times of transition. When you have personnel who are essential to your business, such as product designers, key managers, and rain-making salespeople, you want to be sure that loss of talent doesn't add to the considerable challenges of merger or company sale. Loss of key employees could cause problems, especially if the deal depends on certain performance measures and assets.""You can't have the keeper of the keys leave before the keys are turned over,"" Birol says. ""Retention bonuses can help you keep your best people by offering them some security in exchange for staying.""Related: How to Keep Employees Engaged2. Key function continuity. 
Whether it's keeping your customer service department running smoothly to retain customers or ensuring that accounting processes remain uninterrupted to ensure healthy cash flow and expense management, retention bonuses can be a valuable tool, Birol says. Companies may pay retention bonuses to top employees who run essential functions that directly affect overall operations.3. Relationship management. 
If your number-one salesperson has a strong relationship with your top customers, losing the employee could mean losing the customers, too. Key employees may hold relationships with customers, vendors, or others who are essential to keep your business operating well. Paying retention bonuses to procurement officers, salespeople or others who hold those relationships and the institutional knowledge that goes with them can help you keep those aspects of your business constant as it completes its transition.""Retention bonuses are not about loyalty. They're about triage during transitional events. It s about stabilizing the patient who's bleeding profusely. They help keep your key people from leaving during a specific period of time and affecting your company in a negative way,"" Birol says.Related: What Really Motivates Employees?

/article/227518,Modern Dad? Prince William to Take Two Weeks of Paternity Leave,"As more businesses expand paid time off for families, our male readers express a range of opinions on how much time to take.","Royal fever came to a head today with the birth of a royal baby boy. In a show of modern fatherhood, Prince William is expected to take two weeks of paid paternity leave.William is the first senior royal to receive such leave, which became standard for working dads in the U.K. in 2003, according to the Associated Press. As a helicopter pilot in the Royal Air Force, he will receive his full salary during the time off, the AP reports.While the U.S. does not federally mandate paid paternity leave, increasingly companies are moving to offer men more time off with pay. For instance, earlier this year Yahoo extended its parental-leave policy to provide up to eight weeks of fully paid leave for both mothers and fathers. Yet even as some companies are beginning to offer men more time, a recent report in the Wall Street Journal shows that men are still reluctant to take it. While Ernst & Young offers up to six weeks of paid paternity leave to fathers on staff, 90 percent of those dads take only two weeks, WSJ reports. What's more, a 2011 study by the Boston College Center for Work and Family found that the majority of new fathers take only a week or two off.We polled our readers on Facebook and Twitter to get their perspectives on paternity leave in the modern era. Many men said they would take as much time as they were able.""There is nothing more important than family,"" said Ahmad Moore, a business owner in Newark, N.J. ""You can run the business and have everything going well, but if the cost of running that business is the dysfunction of your family and your absence in their life, you have paid too much and made no profit.""Meanwhile, new dad Scott Walker said he leaned on technology to stay connected to work: ""I was out of the office for six weeks due to mom and the baby having complications, but worked from either the hospital or home during that time and didn't fall behind. It's easy to take mobile technology for granted, but it can truly be the lifeline that keeps your head above water in tough times.""Several others said they simply couldn't be away too long, and one to two weeks is the right amount of time.

/article/227432,3 Ways You're Derailing Your Employees' Productivity,Often times you are the the reason your team isn't getting as much done as you'd like. Here are three ways you might be unknowingly making them less productive at their jobs.,"In the past six years, my wife Jodi and I have launched three businesses and hired and fired employees along the way. We've learned the hard way that there are certain things that can derail our team members' daily productivity. This isn't a surprise. Entrepreneurs are often stressed and they transfer that stress onto their employees, making them less productive.Earlier this month, while in Portland, Ore. for entrepreneur Chris Guillebeau's World Domination Summit, I decided to ask as many people as I could what their bosses had done in the past to get in the way of their productivity. Here are four answers I kept hearing:""They micro-manage me. I know how to prioritize my work.""""They don't acknowledge the work I've done. They only notice what's left to do.""""They surprise me with questions I wasn't prepared to answer about the business.""""They call or stop at my desk and talk nonstop about personal things while I'm trying to get work done.""You might be so caught up in your own stress that you don't realize you're causing your own employees stress on a daily basis. When your employees are stressed out, they are unproductive and ineffective.Here are three ways you might be derailing your employees' productivity without realizing it:1. You ask the question: ""Do you have a minute?""
There are three kinds of conversations you have with people every day: ones that build relationships, transactional ones or opportunity development ones. ""Do you have a minute?"" is usually the lead-up to a transactional conversation. This is problematic for two reasons. First, what you're about to ask is going to take longer than a minute to answer. Regularly interrupting employees' workflow sends the message that you don't value or respect their ability to focus and get things done. Secondly, they may not be in a position -- physically or mentally -- at that very moment to have the conversation.The next time you need some time with an employee, send them an email to tell them exactly what you need ""a minute"" for, if possible, 12 to 24 hours in advance so they can prepare.2. You dictate without asking what they need to better do their job.
One of my favorite ways to engage everyone around me to be more productive is to end our conversation asking what they need from me in order to get a task done. I like to ask:  Now that we've talked about that, what can you think of that you'll need to ask me about over the next 72 hours? One of my clients, Joe Bruzzese of www.Sprigeo.com, an online bully reporting website and education program, began doing this and found that in one week's time, five of his team members asked a total of 27 questions when he ended conversations this way. His big takeaway: They would have had those questions at some point, and because they talked earlier, they were able to handle more on the front side.3. You send mixed messages about your company's goals.
Make it a point to remind your team of your main purpose. This may seem obvious, but one of the biggest ways to derail your employees from being productive is sending them mixed message about your company's end-goal and overall message.Being clear about your company's goals makes it possible for everyone to set their own priorities and be their best every day. By being more engaged in work we believe in, our stress is lower and we get more done.Over the next week, carry a notecard with you everywhere you go. Keep track of how many times you interrupt or distract employees in these ways. You just may see, you're actually causing them stress. Minimize the stress and they'll ultimately get more done.

/article/227446,3 Toxic Employees You Need to Fire Now,"If you can't correct their bad behavior, there are three types of employees that have to go.","From a thoughtful hiring process to a thorough training program, you've done everything you can to find and prepare the best employees for your company. But no system is foolproof and sometimes a few bad apples can slip through the cracks.
Of course, some people just need a simple redirect to fall in line, so trying to correct the behavior should be your first step. But other times, employees can be so toxic, they can poison your workplace, says human resources consultant Suzanne Benoit, founder of Portland, Maine-based Benoit Consulting Services.""You can have someone who is a very good technical performer but that makes other people in the office go home crying,"" Benoit says. ""If you have people who are interfering with the performance of others, you need to consider letting them go.""It's a good idea to consult legal counsel before you terminate someone for their behavior to ensure you've protected yourself. But, in her experience, Benoit says these three types of employees usually just have to go.1. The Untouchable
If someone has made him or herself ""invaluable"" or closely aligned with a powerful person within the company and is using that position to bully others or get preferential treatment, the situation can be damaging to your business, Benoit says. She's even seen situations where the company owner has relinquished so much control to an assistant or subordinate that he or she is afraid to let that person go.Perhaps your assistant is stepping over the line with his authority or a junior salesperson whose mentor is your top performer is ordering others around. If you see this kind of behavior or you sense bad blood between employees, it's probably time to investigate the source.Related: 4 Ways to Keep Employees From Checking Out on the Job2. The Pot-Stirrer 
This is the person who pits office mate against office mate using gossip, rumor and innuendo. The Pot-Stirrer can usually be found at the center of any office drama, possibly with popcorn in hand. And while the arguments may seem like petty nonsense, this person is causing repeated disruptions in the workplace and costing you productivity and employee engagement.
When there is repeated discord in your office, keep an eye out for the person who seems to be orchestrating it -- perhaps trying to act as an intermediary or even  confiding  in you about various events going on around the office to try to get you involved. Then, have a frank discussion with that person about your expectations about how people behave in the office. If that doesn't work, it might be time for a pink slip.3. The Renegade
Despite training and repeated correction, this person just doesn't follow rules and puts your company at risk. Whether it's not wearing a helmet on construction sites to ""winging it"" in customer service matters and making decisions that he or she is not authorized to make, Renegades are determined to do things their way.The fallout could range from lost customers to safety hazards. And, worse, when other employees see that not everyone has to follow the rules, you may find yourself with more Renegades. Lay down the law or them free.Related: What It Takes to Be a Boss Every Employee Loves

/article/227467,Half of Small Businesses Will Cut Employee Hours to Avoid Obamacare Penalties,"Anxiety about Obamacare is increasing, according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's quarterly small-business outlook survey.","Half of small businesses affected by the new national health-care law plan to either cut hours to reduce workers to part-time status or replace existing full-timers to part-time hours to get around Obamacare requirements, according to a new survey.What's more, another 24 percent of companies answering the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's quarterly small-business outlook survey said they will reduce staff to under 50 employees to avoid paying penalties for failing to offer health insurance.Anxiety about Obamacare is increasing, even as the administration has put off implementation of some key provisions. Forty-nine percent of small-business owners surveyed said Obamacare is a top worry for them, up from 42 percent in January. Seventy-nine percent believe Obamacare will increase the costs of health care at their companies.Related: Health Care Reform: Procrastinate No MoreAnd the biggest impact appears to be on hiring. In addition to cutting more workers to part-time status, many companies are curtailing hiring altogether. Just 17 percent of owners surveyed said they had added staff within the past two years. Just 20 percent said they plan to add workers over the coming two years.That's not just Obamacare. There is an overall pessimism about the state of the U.S. economy, according to the survey. More than three-quarters of owners said the economy is on the wrong track, and just 26 percent said they saw signs of improvement over the past two years.The results echo long-held worries by small-business owners about the impact of Obamacare, which some say will threaten an employment recovery. Much of hiring in the U.S. recently has been in companies below the 50-worker threshold. The most recent ADP payroll report, for instance, saw businesses with fewer than 50 employees add 84,000 workers in June, or 45 percent of the 188,000 total private-sector jobs added in the month.There is one bit of potential good news for the Obama administration in the Chamber's survey: Small businesses overwhelmingly want immigration reform. Eighty-one percent surveyed said the current system does not work and needs to be fixed. Another 57 percent said immigration reform would strengthen the economy and help with global competitiveness.Related: White House Plays Offense: Says Immigration Reform Will Turbocharge Entrepreneurship

/article/227418,5 Ways to Keep Employees From Checking Out on the Job,"Seven out of 10 employees are not engaged at work, according to recent research. Here are five ways to get your team engaged.","Have you ever interacted with an employee at a local business who was checked-out? You know the type. You ask to pay, and they roll their eyes at you and act as if they're doing you a favor by taking your money.Well, you're not alone. According to a recent Gallup poll on employee engagement, seven out of 10 U.S. workers aren't mentally showing up for work. While it's certainly annoying when you see this as a customer, when that employee works for you, it's an outright disaster. Checked-out employees convey a bad impression to customers, are more prone to making mistakes and worst of all, they become role models of disengagement for co-workers and new employees. According to Gallup, mentally checked-out employees cost $450 to $550 billion -- that's billion with a ""B"" -- in lost productivity every year.Here are five steps to ensure that your employees are fully engaged in taking care of customers and getting the job done right the first time:1. You get what you measure. If you aren't measuring engagement, don't be surprised that some of your employees aren't engaged. That which gets measured gets done. Every quarter, survey your employees and ask them three simple questions:Do you find your work here meaningful? Do you feel valued by your manager? Are you proud of what you do here? You're looking for 80 percent or more of employees to answer yes to all three questions. If they don't, it means you have a problem with employees being checked out and need to take action. To ensure candor, have an outside party administer the survey on an anonymous basis.2. Keep employees well informed. We all desperately seek to feel included and part of the group. When employees feel as if they're just tools for management to do what it pleases with them, their attitude toward work is equally unenthusiastic.Provide regular updates to all employees, much like you would to investors. An investor would never tolerate putting money in your company and not hearing back about how the business is doing. Why would you expect employees to react any differently? After all, your employees are investors too. They're investing their careers in your company. Keep them up-to-date on how things are going. When they feel included, they will be more engaged.3. Involve employees in decisions that impact them. People support what they help build. Ask your employees for input on key decisions that impact them. In addition to getting valuable insight from them, the act of soliciting feedback on important decisions conveys that they, too, are a key part of building this company. To get more engaged employees, simply engage employees more.4. Hold managers accountable. One of the main causes for employee disengagement is when they don't feel valued by managers. Make sure managers whose employees report low engagement scores are asked to take steps to engage employees on a one-to-one basis and to include them as part of the group.5: Get rid of the bad apples. Some employees will never be engaged, no matter what you do. After you've done your part in creating an engaging work environment, it will become clear which employees are permanently checked out. It's time to replace them with people who want to mentally show up for work. On the flip side, be sure to reign in any employees who overstep their bounds. Be clear to them that this is an opportunity for them to provide input, not to lead a takeover of your company.Nothing ruins office culture more quickly than the presence of a few people with bad attitudes.

/article/227372,D.C. Moves to Hike Minimum Wage for Big-Box Retail Employees Despite Wal-Mart Opposition,"Washington, D.C., lawmakers have voted to require big-box retailers to pay 50 percent more than the district's legal minimum wage.","Washington, D.C., politicians have moved forward with plans to raise the local minimum wage for employees at major retailers, despite opposition from retail behemoth Wal-Mart.The Washington, D.C., city council voted Wednesday to pass a law in the capitol city that would require big-box stores to pay their employees 50 percent more than the existing district minimum wage.Called the ""Large Retailer Accountability Act of 2013,"" the Act, which still needs to be signed by D.C. Mayor Vincent Gray, would require retailers with more than $1 billion in annual revenues and indoor retail premises of 75,000 square feet or more, to pay employees making less than $50,000 a year at least $12.50 per hour. Currently, the minimum wage in D.C. is $8.25 per hour.The vote came the day after Wal-Mart threatened to pull back plans to open stores in D.C. if the city council passed the act. In an op-ed published in the Washington Post on Tuesday, Wal-Mart's general manager for the U.S., Alex Barron, who is responsible for all planned stores in the D.C. region, said that the D.C. city council would give the retailer no choice but to backtrack on its plans if city leaders passed the law. Wal-Mart had plans to open six stores in the metro area, and three are currently under construction.""Unfortunately, the district may soon adopt legislation that discriminates against business and threatens to undo all that we have accomplished together,"" Barron wrote. ""From day one, we have said that this legislation is arbitrary and discriminatory and that it discourages investment in Washington.""Related: Wal-Mart Offers Entrepreneurs a Chance to Compete for Shelf SpaceIn the wake of the vote, Wal-Mart confirms that it will not pursue three of its planned D.C. stores and will review the implications on the three stores already under construction, says Steven V. Restivo, senior director of communications at Wal-Mart.  This was a difficult decision for us and unfortunate news for most D.C. residents, but the council has forced our hand,  says Restivo.The city council says that the cost of living in D.C. is 42 percent higher than the national average, and local workers need more money to maintain a decent standard of living. ""District residents at the lowest end of the wage spectrum find it increasingly difficult to earn a living,"" the council says in a background briefing on the bill. What's more, the council says that low-wage workers are likely to spend the money they make in their local economy, which would be a boon to the region.In a strongly worded statement, the National Retail Federation has expressed its disapproval of the ruling. ""The Large Retailer Accountability Act is a flawed and unwarranted bill and a prime example of why the district is consistently ranked as one of the worst places to do business in the nation,"" says David French, the senior vice president of government relations at the Washington, D.C.-based advocacy organization. ""It is also a prime indicator as to why unemployment remains consistently high for district residents even as it improves in surrounding jurisdictions.""

Bush has voiced support for immigration reform. It comes on the same day as a new White House report on the positive economic impact of proposed immigration reform. Bush is the latest in a growing group of high-profile supporters that crosses party lines and industries.""The laws governing the immigration system aren't working,"" Bush said. ""The system is broken."" The former president said he hopes for a ""positive resolution"" to the current debate over immigration reform, but avoided policy specifics. While a comprehensive immigration-reform bill passed the U.S. Senate in June, political observers expect it to face opposition in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives.The bill's provisions include a visa for foreign-born startup founders and an increase in the number of visas available to highly skilled workers, such as those employed by technology companies. The bill also would make citizenship possible for the millions of immigrants already living illegally in America.Bush's brief remarks took place at a naturalization ceremony for 20 new American citizens at the George W. Bush Institute in Dallas. ""I welcome you to this free nation,"" he told them. ""It's an honor to call you fellow Americans."" The ceremony kicked off a policy gathering at the Institute on the subject of immigration and economic growth.Bush spoke about the contributions of immigrants who have strengthened the U.S., spotlighting Irish immigrant James Hoban, who designed the White House in the 1790s. The former president joked that he was ""familiar with the place"" and said Hoban ""did a fine job.""Bush's brother, former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, publicly voiced his support for the immigration-reform bill last week.

/article/227353,White House Plays Offense: Says Immigration Reform Will Turbocharge Entrepreneurship,A new report released from the Obama Administration breaks down the economic impact of the bipartisan immigration reform bill passed by the Senate.,"The White House is coming out with guns blazing today, saying the U.S. needs to pass immigration reform to drive entrepreneurship, create jobs and generate revenue.According to a new report from the Obama Administration, immigration reform will result in more highly skilled workers moving to the U.S., more businesses being launched, revenue being generated and more jobs being created.Related: Entrepreneurs, Politicians Join in a Virtual March on Washington for Immigration ReformThe report, titled The Economic Benefits of Fixing Our Broken Immigration System, has been released by President Obama s National Economic Council, Domestic Policy Council, Office of Management and Budget and the Council of Economic Advisers. It examines how the U.S. economy would be affected if the Senate-passed bipartisan immigration-reform bill became law. The Senate passed its version of immigration reform in late June. Immigration reform faces an uphill battle in the Republican-controlled House.Related: Immigration Reform Clears Senate, Faces House FightIf the Senate's immigration-reform bill passed the House, it would result in a directly related Gross Domestic Product increase of 3.3 percent by 2023 and 5.4 percent by 2033, the report says, based on Congressional Budget Office estimates. That would mean an increase of $700 billion by 2023 and $1.4 trillion by 2033. A primary focus of the White House report is how immigration reform would affect entrepreneurship. Here is a breakdown of what it says:Keep highly educated immigrants, create U.S. jobs: The Senate immigration-reform bill would make it easier for highly skilled and highly educated workers to come to the U.S. Science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) doctorate and master s graduates would be exempt from the annual caps on green cards available. Each foreign-born student with an advanced degree that stays in the U.S. and works in a STEM field creates 2.6 jobs, the White House report says. Offer a startup visa for immigrants, create U.S. jobs: The Senate immigration-reform bill creates a new Startup visa, called the Investing in New Venture, Entrepreneurial Startups and Technologies (INVEST) visa. Entrepreneurial immigrants would be eligible for temporary and permanent visas if they can prove they have ideas for businesses that attract money from U.S. investors, generate revenue in the U.S. or can generate jobs. If all of the green cards offered by the immigration bill are used, as many as 50,000 jobs could be created, according to the report. Immigrants are more likely to be entrepreneurs than U.S. natives: Immigrants and their children have founded Google, Disney, Procter & Gamble and 40 percent of America's 500 largest companies, the report says. Immigrants, typically motivated to improve their standing in life, are more than two times as likely to start businesses than those born in the U.S., the White House report says, citing the 2012 Kauffman Index of Entrepreneurial Activity. Immigrant-owned small-businesses generated a total of $776 billion in revenue and employed approximately 4.7 million people in 2007, according to a report from the Fiscal Policy Institute, cited in the White House report.

Here are the top 10 most innovative economies:SwitzerlandSwedenU.K.NetherlandsU.S.FinlandHong Kong (China)SingaporeDenmarkIreland Innovation results today still remain fairly highly correlated with income levels,  says Soumitra Dutta, an editor of the report, at a meeting on the report s release in New York City this morning.  The difference between the richer, high-income economies and the lower-income economies is fairly significant.  The top 25 most innovative economies are all nearly the same from years past. While the rankings have shifted in the past three years, there have been no newcomers to the echelon of the top 25, says Dutta.Related: Crowdfunding's Growth Spurt Going StrongThe report measures 84 criteria for 142 economies. It looks at five ""input"" categories: institutions, human capital and research, infrastructure, market sophistication and business sophistication, and ""outputs,"" which are categorized as either knowledge and technology or creative outputs.While the rich economies produce more innovation, if total innovation output is divided by input, the list of leading innovative countries looks very different. These countries are those that are doing the most with what they have. Here are the top 10 most efficient innovative economies:MaliThe Republic of MoldovaGuineaMaltaSwazilandIndonesiaNigeriaKuwaitCosta RicaThe Bolivarian Republic of VenezuelaAnother measure of an economy's innovation is whether it outperforms its income group. By this scale, the following countries are considered to be rising stars on the innovation spectrum: the Republic of Moldova, China, India, Uganda, Armenia, Vietnam, Malaysia, Jordan, Mongolia, Mali, Kenya, Senegal, Hungary, Georgia, Montenegro, Costa Rica, Tajikistan and Latvia.Related: The World's Most Meaningful Brands (Infographic)National leaders' attitudes about innovation are paramount to progress, says Dutta. If the mindset is not there, you are unable to actually act on the multiple different factors required to move the country up on the various factors of innovation,  Dutta says.What's more, to drive innovation, a country must have a pool of educated workers.  The core ingredient behind innovation is talent,  he says.Related: U.S. Entrepreneurship Climbs to Highest Level in More Than a Decade (Infographic)Catherine CliffordCatherine Clifford is senior entrepreneurship writer at CNBC.

/article/227310,"Jobs Growth Stronger Than Expected, Unemployment Holds Steady",Multiple reports released this week signal greener pastures ahead for the labor market.,"The U.S. economy adds 195,000 jobs in June, more than economists had expected, and job growth has been revised upward for the past two months, signaling greener pastures ahead for the labor market.The change in total nonfarm payroll employment for April has been revised to 199,000 jobs gained, up from a previously reported 149,000. For May, 195,000 jobs have been added, up from the 175,000 jobs previously reported.Unemployment, meanwhile, stands at 7.6 percent in June, unchanged from the previous month. While this figure might not have market watchers jumping up for joy, ""it is a positive sign that more people flowed into the labor force and shows the labor market is on the right track,"" says Kurt Rankin, an economist at PNC Financial Services Group. ""We're not seeing a summer swoon as we have in the past few years.""It also means the Federal Reserve is likely to forge ahead with its plans to cut back on its bond-buying activity later this year and to ultimately end the bond-buying program by mid 2014. All eyes are on this month's job report, since a worse-than-expected hiring picture might have diverted the Fed from its stated course of action.""I think the Fed will stay exactly on track with its plan,"" Rankin says.Total nonfarm payroll employment in June is in line with the average monthly gain of 182,000 jobs over the prior 12 months. In June, job growth is seen in leisure and hospitality, professional and business services, retail trade, health care and financial services.Related: The 10 Fastest-Growing Industries for Small BusinessWhile the monthly jobs report does not break out companies by size, a separate report on Wednesday from payroll processer ADP shows that small businesses added 84,000 jobs in June, on a seasonally adjusted basis. In May, small businesses added 63,000 jobs, revised upward from the previously reported 58,000, and in April, small businesses added 57,000 jobs.The June jobs growth accounts for 45 percent of employment gains across all payroll size groups, according to ADP. Among small businesses, 64 percent of the employment growth comes from companies with between one and 19 employees, ADP says.Another report, SurePayroll's Small Business Scorecard, released Monday, paints a slightly worse hiring picture for ultra-small firms. Month-over-month hiring was down 0.1 percent in June, and the average paycheck was down 0.1 percent. SurePayroll compiles data from more than 40,000 small businesses, including trends affecting businesses with an average of eight employees. Despite the drop in employment among micro-firms, optimism remains high for better times ahead. More than half of small businesses polled by SurePayroll say they expect to surpass expectations in the third quarter of this year. More than half also plan to make new investments in the third quarter, most likely in marketing, technology and new staff.Related: Small Business Optimism Grows Despite Stagnant Hiring, Paycheck SizeCheryl Winokur MunkCheryl Winokur Munk is a freelance writer and editor in West Orange, NJ.

/article/227298,Businesses Have Additional Year Before Facing Obamacare Penalty Fees,The Obama Administration announces that it will delay the health-reform fines for businesses with 50 or more employees until 2015.,"If you were struggling to get your business ready for the impending health-care reform, you just got a one-year extension.The Obama Administration announced that it will delay collecting fines on the employer mandate for businesses with 50 or more full-time or full-time equivalent employees until 2015, according to a blog post on the U.S. Treasury Department's website. Before this announcement, businesses would have been required to offer their employees health coverage or face an annual penalty of at least $2,000 per employee starting in 2014.The Obama Administration has had conversations with businesses about the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, says Mark J. Mazur, the assistant secretary for tax policy at the U.S. Department of the Treasury in the blog post, and many businesses expressed concern over the fast-approaching deadlines. ""We have listened to your feedback. And we are taking action,"" says Mazur. More details on the delay of the law will be released in the coming week, he says.Related: Small-Business Owners Still Confused About Health-Care ReformBusinesses told the Administration that the process that was being established to report their employees' access to and enrollment in health insurance was burdensome, says Valerie Jarrett, a senior advisor to President Obama who is responsible for overseeing the Office of Public Engagement and Intergovernmental Affairs, in a statement on the White House's official blog. ""As we make these changes, we believe we need to give employers more time to comply with the new rules,"" Jarrett says.The announcement was cheered by the International Franchise Association, a Washington, D.C., industry advocacy organization. Many franchisees have more than 50 employees and will be affected by the fee. The IFA called for additional reprieve for small businesses.""This will relieve the onerous and costly burdens of the ACA for one year, and allow the Administration to reexamine its implications for small businesses,"" says IFA President and Chief Executive Steve Caldeira, in a statement. ""We look forward to continuing our work with the Administration to ensure that the Affordable Care Act is implemented with minimal negative impact on franchise small-business owners.""Related: Health-Care Reform Creates Boon for Tech StartupsMeanwhile, one small-business advocacy organization says the fee delay won't impact the majority of business owners. Ninety-six percent of businesses in the U.S. have fewer than 50 employees, says Terry Gardiner, the vice president of policy and strategy at the Small Business Majority, in a statement. And of those businesses with more than 50 employees, 96 percent already offer health insurance and will likely continue to do so regardless of the fee, he says.The health-insurance exchanges, says Gardiner, are the most critical piece of the health-care reform for small businesses because they will provide marketplaces where individuals and business owners can compare, pick and buy health insurance. There has been some concern that the health-care exchanges for small businesses won't be up and running by the Oct. 1 deadline. However, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services says that it is on track to have the exchanges implemented on time. ""The most important provisions for small-business owners in the law are still moving full steam ahead, including health-insurance exchanges,"" says Gardiner.Related: Small-Business Health-Care Exchanges May Be DelayedCatherine CliffordCatherine Clifford is senior entrepreneurship writer at CNBC.

/article/227110,4 Steps for Handling a Key Employee's Departure,"When a trusted member of your team decides to throw in the towel, here are four steps to ensure a positive departure.","Having a trusted team member leave your startup is never easy, but it doesn't have to be business crippling.With Yahoo's recent acquisition of Tumblr, the micro-blogging site lost a key employee -- its fifth hire and creative director Jacob Bijan. The many employees who have left gaming company Zynga has been well documented in the media. And with engineers in short supply and high demand, poaching at major tech companies occurs on a regular basis.So if -- or better yet when -- it happens to you, don't be surprised. Just remember to keep your cool and follow these steps to ensure a positive parting:1. Understand their perspective.
Even if your startup is trucking along, seeing traction and has big plans to raise a round of funding, a larger company can swoop in and nab one of your employees for a much larger paycheck. Consider the example of Facebook. At the tech behemoth, if a coder gets an offer he almost have no choice but to accept it (if it makes you feel better it has been reported Google has offered its employees millions to not leave for the social network).While being priced out by a larger company is a potential scenario, there are numerous other reasons for someone wanting to jump ship. Understanding their reasons could be a turning point for you or your company. If you feel comfortable, ask them to give it to you straight. If not, ask them to write out their reasons for leaving. If they deserve a recommendation, give it to them.Related: 7 Steps to Hiring Your First Employee2. Sever gracefully.
If you're parting on good terms, make their last day a reason to celebrate their time with your startup, such as serving an ice cream cake during lunch or a trip to the local watering hole. If the employee is leaving on not-so-great terms, provide a note expressing your regret that it didn't work out and thank them for their contribution.After they've given you their two-weeks' notice, it is not your job to announce their decision to all of your team (not including HR and other hiring managers). Give your employee space and let them look back on their time with your company fondly.3. Headhunt.
Don't put off the hiring process. Get it done and get your replacement trained as soon as possible. You should first figure out if anyone on your team can step into the former employee's shoes. If not, ask your peers and employees for recommendations, while also posting the position opening on job sites.Once you narrow down potential candidates, make sure they'd fit in with your startup culture. Ask yourself if they are someone you'd be able to spend countless hours with during a crunch-time weekend.Related: 6 Keys to Hiring and Retaining the Best Employees4. Keep in touch.
Once the employee has left, don't be a stranger. Forgetting that someone exists is generally not the best course of action. Even if you aren't happy with the departure, rage cools, feelings mend and you may come to realize it was for the best. Keep their email in your contacts and wait awhile before asking for an update on their life. By being nice, people are more willing to throw business, partnerships and other networking opportunities your way.How did you handle a key employee departure?

/article/227244,DOMA Is Dead: What That Means for Your Business,The Supreme Court voted to overturn the Defense of Marriage Act this week. Here's a look at some of the ways it could affect your business.,"Many business owners may need to adjust their employee benefits packages and tax liabilities now that legally married gay couples will be eligible for federal benefits.The U.S. Supreme Court's landmark decision to overturn the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act this week has been celebrated by many as a social-justice victory. DOMA defines marriage as only existing between a man and a woman. By striking it down in a 5-4 decision, the Court cleared the way for same-sex couples, in the 12 states and Washington, D.C., where those marriages are recognized, to receive federal marriage benefits.Related: Twitter Reacts: Historic Gay Marriage RulingThe ruling will require that many business owners make changes to their office administration. ""Anytime the Supreme Court or Congress makes major changes to a law, there is a lot of work that happens behind the scenes to ensure the changes are understood and implemented correctly,"" says Martin Mucci, president and chief executive of payroll and human-resource outsourcing company Paychex, in a statement.While necessary changes will depend on the state your business is in, here are a few areas that may require updates, according to Rochester, N.Y.-based Paychex.Health insurance plans: The cost of an employee's health-insurance coverage can be deducted from their income before taxes. With the DOMA ruling, employees will now be able to deduct the cost of their same-sex spouse's health-insurance costs, just like opposite-sex spouses can.Related: Obamacare Choices: Weighing Your Healthcare Options
 Flexible spending: Flexible spending accounts allow employees to set money aside for certain costs, such as commuting, qualifying prescriptions and childcare expenses. Same-sex spouses will now be eligible to set aside pre-tax money into these accounts, which helps reduce the employee's tax bills, says Mike Trabold, the director of compliance for Paychex.
 Tax liability: As a business owner, many of your tax liabilities are calculated based on the taxable income of your employees. If the total taxable income of your employees decreases because they are able to deduct the cost of their same-sex partner's health insurance and flexible spending plans, the business's tax bill will also decrease.
 Employee time off: The Family Medical Leave Act protects an employee's job for up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave to take care of immediate family, such as a spouse. The DOMA ruling could increase the amount of time off taken by employees.The specifics of how the Internal Revenue Service plans to handle same-sex tax benefits remain uncertain, says Trabold. For example, how will same-sex couples who live in a state that does not recognize same-sex marriage be treated come tax time? Will same-sex couples and businesses that employ them be able to go back and file amended tax returns? What about someone who works in a state that recognizes same-sex marriage but lives in a state that does not?""We are expecting a tremendous amount of clarifying regulation and other types of guidance coming out from both the federal agencies, like the IRS, and the states,"" says Trabold. ""There is likely going to be a lot of questions, probably a lot of lawsuits.""Related: Most Americans Work While on Vacation, Report FindsCatherine CliffordCatherine Clifford is senior entrepreneurship writer at CNBC.

With laptops, smartphones and tablets, we are more connected than ever before. Even when we're trying to unplug.Nearly 60 percent of U.S. employees check email regularly, take a work-related phone call or otherwise check in with the office while they are on vacation, according to a new survey of more than 1,000 American workers by Pertino, a cloud-based networking business in Los Gatos, Calif.It's not all bad news. For many, being able to check in makes it easier to check out for a while, the survey finds.

/article/227170,Obamacare Choices: Weighing Your Healthcare Options,"Under new healthcare reform, your number of employees will have a big impact on coverage costs.  Here's how one entrepreneur is weighing his options and what this means for your business.","This is the second of a two-part series about the impact of health care reform on a Texas-based small business, Software Advice, and how the CEO, Don Fornes, plans to keep providing quality benefits while controlling costs.In my first post, ""Health-Care Case Study: One CEO's Take on Obamacare,"" I discussed how healthcare will change dramatically in 2014 due to the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Now, I'll talk about one of the things my business is considering doing in response.Whether or not my business will be classified as a large group or a small group has a big impact on ACA requirements and health-care coverage costs. Yet a pending Texas State Senate bill leaves us uncertain as to how we'll be classified. If we remain a large group -- and are therefore not subject to community rating -- we'll stick with our current health insurance coverage. If we're classified as a small group, our costs would increase 30 to 40 percent due to community rating and we may consider self-funding.You are probably familiar with a fully-insured plan, which is what my company currently has through Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Texas (BCBSTX). We pay premiums to BCBSTX, and they pay our employees' health care claims. Both the benefits and the premium per employee are fixed for the year, regardless of the volume of claims filed.Under a self-funded plan, our company would pay these claims -- partially funded by deductions from employees' paychecks. We'd be assuming more risk, but if our employees incur fewer health-care costs, the company would keep the difference. And we'd get to choose what coverage our plan would offer, how much to charge employees for premiums and how high to set copays and deductibles.Paying health care claims is a complex burden. Under our fully-insured plan, our insurer handles the administration, which is built into our premiums. Under self-funding, we'd have three options:Administer the plan ourselves. This is only recommended for large firms with the necessary resources and expertise. We can't take this option.Elect Administrative Services Only (ASO) from a carrier like BCBSTX. They'd handle claims administration, and we'd cut them a check to pay the claims, plus a yearly administration fee.Hire a Third Party Administrator (TPA). The TPA would administer the claims and we'd reimburse them as well as pay them an administration fee.We'd prefer option number two, since we'd gain access to the carrier's broad provider network, but many ASO offerings are limited to companies with at least 100 employees. So that might leave us having to pursue a TPA option and ""rent"" a carrier's network.We'd then have to forecast our expected annual claims amount. This is largely determined by the claims history for all employees: Costs in previous years provide an idea of what costs will be for the year ahead. And we'd budget for 125 percent of this amount to cover worst-case scenarios.I already learned my lesson when it comes to worst-case scenarios. In 2012, I racked up $40,000 in health care claims when I crashed my road bike. No matter how well we budget, there's always the risk that an employee will have a catastrophic accident or illness.That's where stop-loss insurance comes in. It is purchased from a carrier, or provided, under ASO, to provide a safety net for employers. We'd set liability limits -- the maximum amount per month or year our company would pay -- at both an individual and a company-wide level. The stop-loss carrier would reimburse us for everything exceeding these limits.No fully-insured plan is as flexible as a self-funded plan, in which I can choose types of coverage and set costs. If premiums are paid into an interest-bearing account, I could even make a slight return on investment during months when we take in more than we pay out.With a fully-insured plan, I pay taxes on premiums. With self-funding, I wouldn't. There are taxes on stop-loss coverage, but they're a fraction of the fully-insured cost. We'd still save about two percent each year.That said, self-funding means assuming a lot of risk. There's no way to fully predict claims costs. True, stop-loss insurance can help cover me in worst-case scenarios. But its cost will go up after such incidents, and it may be hard to switch carriers or go back to a fully-insured plan without paying higher prices.If any legal action is brought against my self-funded plan, my company's assets are also on the line. A carrier or TPA can help us stay legally compliant, but it's a potential risk.A high-quality provider network may also be harder to get. Insurance carriers like BCBSTX have the best and cheapest access to providers. But we may not meet the size requirements for ASO. And TPAs typically don't have access to the same quality or quantity of providers that carrier networks do -- at least, not for the same price. That means my employees might lose access to, or pay more for, the doctors and clinics they prefer.The bottom line: There are many factors to consider when it comes to self-funded insurance plans -- most of which will depend on what size group we are. The rest will come down to weighing the pros and cons and running the numbers.

He has been given a cot and is being fed three meals a day. While there is no sign of violent torture, workers have been making harassing noises and shining bright lights in the business executive s eyes to keep him from sleeping, news reports say. His company, Specialty Medical Supplies, makes alcohol pads and diabetes equipment in the factory.According to The Wall Street Journal, it is a sign of rising anxiety over the slower pace of growth in the Chinese economy. As the economy has exploded, some manufacturing has started to migrate to other parts of the world where labor is less costly. The dispute occurred after Starnes said he planned to move some of his manufacturing operations to India. When some employees were asked to move and declined, the company gave them severance packages. Workers who had already moved then demanded severance packages, Starnes says. Workers inside the factory say they are owed two months of back pay and were afraid of losing their jobs, according to news reports.Read full stories on CNN and The Wall Street Journal.Related: 4 Ways to Show Employees They're AppreciatedCatherine CliffordCatherine Clifford is senior entrepreneurship writer at CNBC.

/article/227166,What It Takes to Be a Boss Every Employee Loves,Letting employees know you're invested in them makes a huge difference in their attitude. Here are four easy ways to build morale in the office.,"Being a successful leader means being good at what you do and possessing integrity. But more than anything, it's about your ability to build healthy relationships with others -- particularly those who work for you.As an entrepreneur, you're viewed differently than you were when you were a manager or colleague in a traditional job. You stand to gain the most from the company's success, and it is easier for your employees to think you're more interested in the business than them and their lives. Your success is paramount, but it shouldn't be achieved at the expense of healthy relationships with those you depend on.1. Don't treat people as transactions.
Years ago in my first real job out of college, I was delighted to have my very own assistant. She was a very capable and competent woman who I really liked.One day while a client was visiting the office, I made the na ve mistake of introducing my assistant by saying, ""This is Teri. She works for me.""Teri's response would have served me better in private, but her point was valid none-the-less: ""I work with you, Mark, not for you.""I meant no ill respect with my choice of words, but it suggested to Teri that she was a means to an end, that I was ""above"" her. And while technically she did report to me, the difference between working for and with someone is critical. The former can make a person feel conquered, while the latter signals collaboration.Think through how you title and refer to your employees. Focus on reciprocity: look for ways you can help them achieve their work-life goals while they help you achieve yours. And guard against letting tasks trump a true regard and appreciation for the relationship you have with those who have voluntarily chosen to work with you.2. Invest in those you value.
The ultimate test of value in a relationship is how much time, interest and support you are willing to invest. Rather than ask, ""What have you done for me lately?"" turn the tables and ask yourself what you've done lately for those you truly value.Here's one way to invest for great dividends: identify the potential in an employee that he or she doesn't recognize in him- or herself. Often people are blind to their own abilities or potential, and good leaders not only recognize these latent strengths, they help develop them.Several years ago, my office manager was spending more time on our website and technology platforms. A colleague was presenting a multi-day event in Las Vegas that I knew would give my team member information and skills to help her in these areas. Going to Las Vegas for the event was an added perk, so I gladly paid for the seminar and trip. She came back better equipped for her work, knowing I was willing to invest in her success.3. Be involved, but know your limits.
You can work in the same office space with people every day and still be absent because you are preoccupied with your own worries. An open door policy means nothing if you don't stop what you're doing long enough to give your attention to those who walk through it.How can you do this? Make it a point to ""check in"" with every employee each day. That means a simple but sincere question: ""How are things going?"" Listen and if necessary, probe for information you can use to support your employees. Identify frustrations they are facing, opportunities they've recognized and gauge their emotional energy and commitment to their work.You'll know you're micromanaging when you're spending more time telling someone how to do something than you are in clarifying what needs to be done. A thorough explanation with a chance to ask questions is vastly different than a droning presentation about how you'd do it. Give people the freedom to achieve the best results in their own way.4. Show your gratitude.
I've heard a lot of complaints from employees who feel underappreciated by their manager, but I've never heard anyone complain they were recognized, rewarded or appreciated too much. I'm puzzled at why so many entrepreneurs and leaders are reticent to voice appreciation. Don't be afraid of over-doing it. You connect with people more deeply when you recognize the best in them and let them know.Here's a powerful way to show appreciation: When you get feedback from a customer about someone on your team who has done a great job, get their permission to record it. Then play the recording at the next team meeting. There is even more power in a customer's expression of a job well done than simply acknowledging it yourself.Growing your business successfully means doing all that you can to make your team want to work their hardest for your cause. That means connecting with employees in a meaningful way.What do you do to deepen your connections with employees?

				5.
				San FranciscoSource: Cardhub ... and Best Boston, Minneapolis and Seattle ranked among the best for small-business workers and job seekers. They collectively boast high small business per capita, low unemployment rates (suggesting less competition for available jobs) and a variety of industries.San Francisco: The Bay Area ranks six among 30 in most small businesses per capita, five for small-business vitality and net small business job growth. The city also offers the second-highest wages to new hires. That is due, in large part, to having a minimum wage in the city of $10.55 an hour, the highest in the nation.Denver: The Mile High City tops the list in part because it has a high concentration of smaller employers. About 97 percent of Colorado employers are classified as small businesses, according to CardHub's study. Denver's workforce is also growing at the second-fastest rate in the country, and ranks fifth for highest wages for new earners.New small-business hires make the most money in Washington, D.C., San Francisco, and New York, where cost of living is high, according to the study. New earners make the least in Riverside, Sacramento, St. Louis -- all in the bottom half for cost of living.'Gloomy About the Future'The city rankings come as more Americans seem to be willing to relocate for jobs, or strike out on their own.""Anecdotally we've seen people display more of a willingness to look for jobs in a variety of different areas -- both geographically and in terms of what they're doing on a daily basis,"" said CardHub's Kiernan.Others are creating their own opportunities. A separate study shows more U.S. entrepreneurs are launching ventures based on perceived opportunities, growth ambitions and a broad optimistic outlook -- a group sometimes called opportunity entrepreneurs. U.S. entrepreneurship activity rose to the highest level in 14 years, according to a 2012 Global Entrepreneurship Monitor report.In May, U.S. small-business optimism rose to a one-year high. It was the second straight month of gains for the National Federation of Independent Business Small Business Optimism Index.But the broader economy, including small businesses, are adjusting to higher taxes and deep government spending cuts. Bottom line: The small-business half of GDP is not generating growth beyond population gains, according to the NFIB.""We've made a lot of progress, but we're still kind of gloomy about the future,"" NFIB Chief Economist Bill Dunkelberg told CNBC earlier this month. ""And if you're gloomy about the future, you don't spend money, you don't hire. And that's kind of where we sit.""Related: America's Bright Spots: The Top 10 Cities for HiringMore from CNBCLive blog: Deutsche Bank doubles its pretax profit as busiest day of earnings season beginsDeutsche Bank reports surprise surge in profits for second quarterWhite House's Scaramucci calls airing of financial form a 'felony,' then removes postHeesun WeeHeesun Wee is an editor at CNBC.com.Read more",Inspiring Your Team,2013-06-24 11:30:00

/article/227098,Men's Wearhouse Mysteriously Dismisses Founder George Zimmer,"In a bizarre move, the men's apparel company ousts the man who founded it 40 years ago, providing few details.","Men's Wearhouse dismissed chairman and founder George Zimmer today, and we've never seen anything like it.The abrupt termination begs for answers about what could have happened.Here are three reasons why it's a bizarre story:1. The terse press release. ""The Board expects to discuss with Mr. Zimmer the extent, if any, and terms of his ongoing relationship with the Company,"" Men's Wearhouse said in the statement (see the full thing below). There is no polite mention of the founder's impact on the brand, as would be customary.2. Shares and profits were gaining. The company just announced last week that profits were up a whopping 23%. Stocks have been consistently gaining over the past few years. This is not a company disaster scenario, a la Ron Johnson.3. Men's Wearhouse cancelled its shareholder's meeting one day before. This sends a huge red flag to investors at a time when the company is trying its hardest to impress.Clearly, the circumstances surrounding Zimmer's firing are dramatic.Here's the company's full, icy press release:FREMONT, Calif., June 19, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- The Board of Directors of Men's Wearhouse (NYSE: MW) today announced that it has terminated George Zimmer from his position as Executive Chairman. The Board expects to discuss with Mr. Zimmer the extent, if any, and terms of his ongoing relationship with the Company.In light of Mr. Zimmer's termination, the Company also announced that it is postponing its Annual Meeting of Shareholders, which had originally been scheduled for June 19, 2013, at 11:00 a.m. Pacific daylight time. The purpose of the postponement is to re-nominate the existing slate of directors without Mr. Zimmer.The Company expects to announce the rescheduled date, time and location of the postponed Annual Meeting shortly. The Company will set a new record date, provide additional information with respect to the Annual Meeting in a supplement to its proxy statement to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commissionand commence a new solicitation with respect to the supplemented proxy materials.

/article/227091,Billionaire Carlos Slim: Why 60 Is the New 30,The mega-rich telecom entrepreneur says knowledge workers enter their prime in their 60s.,"            The world's second-wealthiest man explains to CNBC why workers in Europe and
other parts of the developed world are at the ""best"" part of their career after they
reach their 60s.Billionaire Carlos Slim, age 73, says workers -- those in developed economies, anyway -- are at their prime in their 60s.""When you have an industrial economy like in the past where people ... do a lot of physical work and people live less years, it's OK to retire at 65,"" Slim told CNBC. ""When you have a society of knowledge and experience and information, at this age is where you are at your best. It's [foolish] to retire at this age. And you don't have the physical work, and you have the intellectual work and you are in your best in your 60s.""The comment came up in a discussion about what to do to fix the European economy. Many economists and politicians have said retirement ages around the world need to rise because people are living longer and the benefits promised to retirees are unsustainable. However, Slim said, even beyond that, workers are better in their 60s than when they're younger.Another way he would fix Europe: split the work week.""Today they are working 35 hours. Now when you talk about 9 to 5, it's five days, eight hours. But with a coffee break and lunch etc., they work seven hours. They are working at most 35 hours. Maybe it's better to work only three days for 11 hours and have four days and this way others will work,"" he said.Slim's theories about the value of older workers bring may have something to them, if worker pay is any indication. A recent analysis of U.S. government data form the Brookings Institution found that people who still work near or past their traditional retirement age earn significantly more per hour than their younger colleagues.That report, which was funded by the Social Security Administration, found that 60- to 74-year-old men earned $25.12 an hour, on average, in 2011. That's over 20 percent more than the average hourly wage of working men 25 to 59. Older women also out-earned their younger counterparts.More from CNBCLive blog: Deutsche Bank doubles its pretax profit as busiest day of earnings season beginsDeutsche Bank reports surprise surge in profits for second quarterWhite House's Scaramucci calls airing of financial form a 'felony,' then removes postMichelle Caruso-CabreraMichelle Caruso-Cabrera is CNBC's Chief International Correspondent.

/article/227093,Small-Business Health-Care Exchanges May Be Delayed,"The health-insurance exchanges due out in October may not be ready on schedule, according to Congress's watchdog.","If you have been counting on the new health-insurance exchanges where you can shop for plans for your small business, you may have wait longer than you thought.The health-care exchanges were supposed to be functional by October, but there is a chance that deadline will be missed, according to a report today from the Government Accountability Office, Congress's watchdog.The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has given conditional approval to 18 states to run their own Small-Business Health Options Programs (SHOPs) and to another 17 to run their own insurance exchanges for individuals. While progress has been made, ""many activities remain to be completed and some were behind schedule,"" the report says.Related: Health Insurance Reform: Steps to Take Now to Prepare""This GAO report confirms our suspicions about the implementation of the health-care law,"" said House Small Business Committee Chairman Sam Graves (R, Mo.) in a statement. ""The law is indeed a train wreck with no relief in sight.""The insurance exchanges are behind schedule in areas including enrollment, plan management and consumer assistance. In particular, the program to educate small-business owners and their employees and help them enroll in the health-insurance exchanges is approximately two months behind the deadlines the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services laid out, the report says. Of the tasks expected to be completed by March 31, 44 percent were behind schedule, the report says. The report notes that CMS says it has been changing its target deadlines and so certain delays may not affect the implementation of the exchanges.Related: Health Insurance Reform: Prep Your Staff for the ChangesThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services spokeswoman Joanne Peters says it will meet health-insurance exchange deadlines. ""We have already met key milestones and are on track to open the Marketplace on time,"" Peters says in an email. For example, it has published a streamlined application for the exchanges and is in the final stages of testing the technological infrastructure necessary to support the enrollment process.This is not the first delay for the health-insurance exchanges. In April, the Obama Administration requested that states be given more time to set up multiple options for health-insurance coverage, effectively pushing deadlines back by one year. In 2014, states would be required to have only a single health-insurance option ready on the SHOPs.The health-care overhaul passed by President Obama three years ago requires that each state which elects to operate its own health exchange must also offer a SHOP. An exchange is a marketplace where, eventually, individuals and business owners will be able to compare, select and purchase health insurance. The SHOPs are where small-business owners specifically can find insurance options for their employees. Should a state decline the option to run its own health-insurance exchange, the U.S. would step in and establish the exchange in that state.Related: The Basics of ObamacareCatherine CliffordCatherine Clifford is senior entrepreneurship writer at CNBC.

/article/227090,Don't Force Businesses to Pay Interns (Opinion),Business strategist Carol Roth argues that forcing businesses to pay interns ignores both the costs incurred by the host business and the value interns receive.,"A recent ruling against Fox Searchlight Pictures from a lawsuit where former interns sued the company because they weren't compensated with the minimum wage -- and a host of other class action lawsuits from former interns of companies ranging from Warner Music Group and Atlantic Records to Conde Nast Publications -- may seem like a David vs. Goliath story. However, the actions of these interns are going to end up hurting students all across the country -- and ultimately our country's competitive edge.At some point, many people in our country crossed the line that separated respecting money and worshiping money. However, now we are in a precarious position where we may cross a line of no return. That line is the one where people think that the only thing that has value is money.Before money was created, individuals mutually bartered goods, services and time. Even now, small businesses facing cash flow issues are looking to alternative ways to fund their businesses, such as collaborating on marketing endeavors instead of using marketing dollars. But now a bevy of short-sighted interns and even shorter-sighted courts have become blind to the alternate benefits that you can garner in exchange for work.The majority of students -- or those who apply for internships -- often have little-to-no relevant skills. Internships are a fantastic way for a student or other low skilled individuals to get a taste of a real work environment. They can see up-close-and-personally if a particular industry or company is a good fit for them. They can make key relationships that can provide a lead to or a recommendation for a future job, or even some ongoing career insight and guidance. And whether they pick up real skills or experience, or just create the perception that they have some, these real-world opportunities give students an advantage in being hired. Sometimes, an internship even leads to a permanent position at that very company. An internship isn't just valuable; as MasterCard would say   it's priceless.However, interns, whether skilled or not, create a measurable burden on the companies where they ""work."" Even without compensating them, interns create time costs, opportunity costs and often monetary costs for those who have to take the time to house and train them. The internship provider may get some low-skilled tasks accomplished, but they give up a lot to provide training and insight, particularly to someone that they know likely won't be working there at the end of a short stint.Forcing businesses to pay the minimum wage for interns ignores both the costs incurred by the host business and the value received by the intern. Ultimately, it will lead to fewer businesses offering internships, as they weigh the cost of having to pay the interns in conjunction with the soft costs of having interns to conclude that it isn't worth it. The ones who lose out in this scenario in the short-term are the students. In the long term, we all lose out, as we have less prepared individuals entering the workforce.We should be encouraging more -- not fewer -- internships for students. Students should be urged to try out several positions with a variety of companies in different industries during their studies. This gives them a broader network and more insight into where they can make the best impact post-graduation or after a job switch. However, these lawsuits and the narrow judgment of all involved threaten that reality.It's time to pass a law to allow companies to ""hire"" unpaid interns at mutual discretion. If both parties agree upfront that they are getting value from the arrangement, the government should not intervene. That's what free market capitalism is all about. If we don't, we risk hurting students and other interns -- the very individuals that the legislators and courts are trying to protect.More from CNBCAsia markets mostly higher after Fed holds rates steady, corporate earnings awaitedMessaging startup Slack is raising $250 million in a new funding roundBank earnings off to 'positive start' in this financial hubCarol RothCarol Roth is the creator of the Future File  legacy planning system, a  recovering  investment banker, business advisor, entrepreneur and best-selling author.

/article/227056,Are the Days of Hiring Unpaid Interns Numbered?,A recent court ruling in favor of two former 20th Century Fox interns could set a precedent for other industries.,"Most people remember ""Black Swan"" for Natalie Portman's Oscar-winning performance, but the movie has a farther-reaching legacy for the hardworking unpaid interns of the world. Two interns who worked on that movie sued 20th Century Fox and won. The Atlantic Wire has the skinny on the ruling: Indeed, it's the first time a major U.S. court has ruled that zero dollars for legitimate work does not a legal unpaid internship make. ""Considering the totality of the circumstances,"" reads the ruling from federal judge William Pauley, the plaintiffs, Eric Glatt and Alexander Footman, ""were classified improperly as unpaid interns and are 'employees' covered by"" the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) as well as New York's labor laws. The judge added: ""They worked as paid employees work, providing an immediate advantage to their employer and performing low-level tasks not requiring specialized training."" Does this mean the end of the unpaid internship? Maybe. The ruling is already having some major effects.The Atlantic Wire reported Thursday that two former interns at magazine publisher Cond  Nast have hired the same attorneys as the ""Black Swan"" plaintiffs and have filed suit for back pay. Those interns were paid, but only something in the area of $12 per day. They're seeking class-action status. ""Precious"" director Lee Daniels and Philly Post columnist Victor Fiorillo are among the voices speaking up in defense of unpaid internships in the wake of the ruling. ""I've been at it for a long time, and I've always had interns to work for free, and I worked for free,"" Daniels said. Rumblings over whether unpaid internships are fair certainly aren't localized to Hollywood, either. There have been plenty of discussions within the PR field. Efforts to bring the issue to the forefront have been going on for years. A survey conducted last year found that 23 percent of PR interns weren't paid at all, and only 28 percent were paid at or above minimum wage. No one is saying you have to pay Google-level intern wages, but if you're looking to pay your interns a low wage, you're going to have to formally teach them something. Part of the judge's ruling had to do with the notion that although those interns learned a lot on the job, ""those benefits were incidental to working in the office like any other employee and were not the result of internships intentionally structured to benefit them,"" the ruling states. The bottom line is this: You're probably better off paying your interns. The cost in wages is marginal compared with the potential cost of legal fees or the PR damage a disgruntled ""free"" worker might inflict upon your organization in the age of social media.

/article/227027,"Leadership Playbook: 3 Ways to Coach, Not Criticize, Employees",Giving employees consistent honest feedback is important if you want them performing at their absolute best. Here are three ways to take a coaching approach to feedback.,"Most entrepreneurs hate giving their employees feedback on how they're doing. As a result, they do this once a year in the form of employee performance reviews, or, at worst, they avoid the process entirely.That's because people often equate feedback, especially the negative kind, with confrontation. Most of us are usually never taught how to give feedback in a welcoming way, yet we know how to receive constructive criticism in other areas of our lives and actually appreciate it.Take sports, for example. No matter what sport you played growing up, you had a coach who told you what you were doing right and wrong, so that you could improve upon it. A good coach constantly gave you feedback and you appreciated it because you wanted to get better in order to win. But while most of us have had such positive experiences at some point in our lives, this kind of coaching is rarely used in business.Here are three steps to help you turn cricitism into coaching so that employees welcome your feedback:1. Define the goal.
Feedback works so well in competition because the common goal -- to win -- outweighs the coach's discomfort in giving cricism and the player's discomfort in receiving it. Olympic athletes don't resent getting criticism on how to improve. In fact, they resent not getting the proper insight that might help them win medals.So what is your business's goal? Unless you have a startup that's trying to change the world, like Apple in its early years, I find personal goals that also benefit the company resonate better with employees than big-picture company goals.For example, an employee will be more motivated to achieve a personal goal of $1 million in sales than to help the company as a whole make $10 million in sales. All employees have career goals even if they don't tell you about them. The key is to find out what goal each person has that benefits both the individual and the company. Agree to work together to help them achieve it.2. Set feedback expectations early and often.
Once a goal has been defined, set the expectation that employees will receive informal performance feedback. You can give feedback as often as daily for someone in a new role to monthly for a veteran running her own division of your business. Most employees would benefit from even 30 seconds of feedback delivered most weeks. Tell them how often you will provide feedback and that they should ask you for it if you forget.3. Start every discussion with the goal.
Start every feedback discussion with the employee's bigger picture: ""John, I have some suggestions to help you achieve your goal of $1 million in sales."" Notice the keywords in the phrase: ""you"" and ""your."" By making the conversation about the employee's goal, your critique lays the groundwork for a welcome conversation instead of a confrontational one. Always frame the discussion as a way to help your employees achieve what's important to them.Coaching feedback helps competitors win medals and trophies, so there's no reason it can't help you and your employees achieve business success.What strategies are you using to coach employees to be better performers?

/article/226953,"You're Not a Tiny Startup Anymore, So Stop Hiring Like One","In this case study, the Canadian social media company Hootsuite realized that its hiring process was holding the fast-growing company back.","The Challenge: In the past three years, HootSuite, a social-media management tool, grew 900%, from 30 to 300 people. The Vancouver-based firm is still hiring approximately 10 new employees a week, primarily in engineering and sales, while expanding internationally with field representatives in the U.S., Hong Kong, Australia and Europe.While HootSuite had outgrown its scrappy startup days, its hiring process hadn t. Like lots of young companies, leadership knew in its gut when it had found great fits, and with the firm s mad dash growth, and more time could have been spent on processes such as reference checks, said HootSuite s founder Ryan Holmes. In 2012, when HootSuite made its biggest hiring push, growing from 100 to 250 employees, Holmes was spending several hours a day on hiring, even with a full-time executive on staff devoted to human resources. The primary challenge of the past few years was our insatiable appetite for more talent,  Holmes, says.  We always need more engineers, more salespeople, more marketers   and it becomes a relentless pursuit that you spend all of your time on. In addition to the sheer volume of hires were the growing pains associated with transitioning from a small startup to a medium-sized global company. Hiring would bottleneck and Holmes had less time to spend on the product.  When you re a 30-person firm, there s no rules. Everybody is just hustling,  says Holmes.  When you have 300 people, you need systems in place. The Fix: Rather than micro-managing the hiring process, Holmes shifted some staffing responsibilities to managers. The company had moved past the one-man-band generalists that helped its launch and departments sought out specialists to meet their goals. Today, managers ensure hires have the right skillsets through tests like those given to developers to gauge problem-solving skills and software knowledge or the role-playing exercises that vet customer service candidates, says Ambrosia Humphrey, HootSuite s vice president of talent.As the company grows internationally, human resources has become more formalized. Orientation for international hires occurs via Skype, says Humphrey. New employees watch videos on the company s mission and history to help build culture with hires time zones away. HR check-ins with new staffers happen at multiple intervals, after the first and second weeks as well as after the first 30, 60 and 90 days to ensure they have the tools they need and can get questions answered.Now, with a dedicated human resources department in place, Holmes spends less than two hours a week on talent acquisition and hiring, working with the department s leadership through email and in-person meetings. And if these processes don t work to keep the firm and its employees thriving, Holmes says, he s willing to try out others.  I want an entrepreneurial culture. If these systems become a burden, hopefully they get broken and reinvented and accepted, or broken and reinvented again. That s part of what growing is. The Takeaway: A large, rapidly growing company must evolve its hiring practices and empower staff to take the reins. Amy S. ChoiAmy S. Choi is a freelance journalist based in Brooklyn, N.Y.

/article/226839,10 Questions to Ask When Designing Your Office,Here's a look at how to design or refashion your office to meet the requirements of today's fast-changing workplace.,"The work environment is evolving at many companies these days, resulting in the need for new office design. At some businesses, for example, individual cubicles and offices are being dismantled in favor of a more open environment in which an employee's work station is wherever he happens to plug in his laptop.Whatever the specific design, the emphasis today is clearly on being lean and flexible, says Alan Feltoon, managing principal at Washington, D.C.-based MulvannyG2 Architecture. He is one of three experts we consulted to come up with questions small-business owners should ask before designing or refashioning an office to meet the requirements of today's fast-changing workplace.Do I want to encourage transparency and camaraderie?
More companies are knocking down walls and cubicles to create more open space. Now, top executives and managers may even sit in open areas with other employees. Feltoon recalls an office he designed for an investment bank, where he used glass instead of solid walls and provided open space for ""impromptu get-togethers."" The owner of the firm wanted people out in the open to convey an image of transparency to clients. An open design also can encourage team spirit. ""When you open things up, all of a sudden, you have a vitality and transparency that encourages conversation, participation and learning,"" says Janet Pogue, principal at Gensler, an architectural firm based in Washington, D.C.How do I provide privacy when necessary? 
While you may want a more open office design, it's still important to provide spaces where employees can work quietly on individual tasks or simply have a private conversation. People spend about half their time in ""focus mode,"" so the office needs to have a mix of ""me spaces"" for individual work and ""we spaces"" for group work, Pogue says. She suggests designing privacy rooms where there are no visual distractions.How much space do I really need? 
Office designers used to plan for about 250 square feet per employee, which included a walled workspace with a desk for a computer and personal items, such as photographs. Now that number has dropped to 150 square feet. The photos are on each person's laptop, which can move from home to the office and then to different locations within the office. Feltoon calls it a ""'work from anyplace"" mindset, and with an increasing number of companies letting employees work from home certain days, the office may only be partially occupied at any given time. ""You don't want to pay for more space than you have to,"" he says.What if some people often work from home?
As it becomes more common for employees to work at least partly from home, companies need to be concerned about home office design, too. Ergonomics is an important but often overlooked issue in home offices. ""Being huddled over your laptop at the kitchen table is not the way to go,"" says Tom Polucci, senior principal and director of interior design for HOK, a New York City-based architecture, engineering and planning firm. The computer monitor should be positioned properly relative to your chair and desk height to avoid stress and strain on your back, neck, shoulders and eyes. You also need the right kind of lighting to reduce glare and eye strain. You might hire a consultant to help your employees set up their home workspace. Alternatively, ""your health insurance provider might have information available to assist employees with home office set up,"" Polucci says.How can I make my space flexible?
A young, growing business that is expecting to add employees and services doesn't want to be pouring precious dollars into reconstruction. Pogue suggests keeping your space as flexible as possible. You can buy desks and tables on rollers for easy movement to reconfigure a space on the fly and create ""plug and play"" areas where employees can take their laptops to work. Private offices can double as huddle rooms for group meetings, and you can use dividers to make conference room space as big or as small as needed.How do I make my reception area warm and welcoming?
The reception area ""is the first impression someone is going to have of the company,"" says Polucci. So, it's important to create a comfortable and hospitable atmosphere. You can impart a feeling of warmth by allowing daylight to stream in and by making artificial lighting indirect and soft. Some designers suggest specific paint colors to convey a certain vibe: creams and beiges for sophistication, blues for honesty and loyalty, and greens for prestige. Finally, the overall space should not be imposing. ""If it is a large lobby, for example, we create pockets of space within that volume for people to have a comfortable place to go,"" Polucci says.What do I want my office space to say about my company?
Your office design can help communicate your corporate mission and image to both clients and employees. That can be especially important if you change your business model. Pogue uses the example of UBM, which with Gensler's help, redesigned its office to reflect its transformation from a century-old print media company into a 21st century online media firm. ""Their San Francisco office was moved from a dated 1980s style cubicle farm into a bright, open and fully networked space that communicated the paradigm shift the company was undertaking,"" she says. ""The space redesign not only clearly reflected the company's new focus and products, but allowed their employees to live the brand on a daily basis.""What kind of employee behavior do I want to encourage?
Your design can incorporate elements that will help you achieve certain results. If you want to encourage recycling, for example, you can install recycling stations throughout the office, providing easy access and clear instructions. Do you want more mingling between employees in different departments? Create a centralized coffee bar or printing station that will entice them to leave their immediate work area and share their thoughts with co-workers from another group.Do I have comfortable places for employees to socialize and relax?
Popular spaces are cafes, pantries and other spots where people naturally congregate. Some businesses offer more elaborate amenities, such as fitness rooms, acupuncture/message therapy centers, dry cleaning drop-off points, and wellness rooms for everyone from nursing mothers to employees who don't feel well. ""Creating spaces that allow employees to socialize and get some exercise or rest is important to create a sense of balance and well-being,"" Polucci says.How do I make the space as green as possible?
Thinking in terms of sustainability is becoming the norm in office design, Polucci says. ""We're designing every project with a sustainable focus, from mechanical and electric to lighting to recycled, renewable and reused materials. And we're to a point where many of the sustainable choices add no cost."" For example, some overhead lighting will automatically grow dimmer as more natural light enters the space. Such a system can pay for itself in reduced energy bills within three years, Polucci says. Many ""green"" offices also use carpeting made of recycled content and wood harvested from sustainable forests.Lisa GirardLisa Girard is a freelance writer who covers topics as diverse as golf fashion, health and beauty, the hardware industry and small business interests.

Here are seven lessons from the lighthearted romp about how to build a company culture like Google's -- without a billion-dollar budget: 1. Don t skimp on the office decor. Vaughn and co-star Owen Wilson spend their summer surrounded by ping pong tables, gourmet food courts, colorful bikes, an outdoor volleyball court and a giant slide.  It was like being at an all-inclusive resort because the food was free,  joked Vaughn.  They had nap pods that looked like Qantas Airlines!  To simulate this environment in your business without spending a fortune, opt for an open workspace with brightly painted walls, meeting rooms that inspire creativity with whiteboards and couches, and a distinct space for relaxation -- nap pods optional.2. Articulate your company's unique identity. The film contends that the secret to working at Google is possessing an innate sense of  Googleyness.  A Google spokeswoman who worked on the film explains:  We believe in having a collaborative, vibrant culture where people work really hard, but they still like to have fun as well. We are a serious company, but we don t take ourselves too seriously, which is one reason that we decided to collaborate on this project in the first place.  Bring your team together by identifying what your company stands for and communicating it to employees. And consider showing off your company's personality in job postings to attract the right candidates.3. Make your new-hire orientation a celebration. On the first day of Vaughn and Wilson s internship, all the summer recruits mingle at a meet-and-greet and in a series of introductory seminars, complete with goofy, spinning hats with the brand s logo. Putting together a fun welcome event, such as picnic or ice cream social, can help ensure that every new hire authentically feels part of the team.Related: To Boost Efficiency, Rethink Company Culture4. Engage employees with learning initiatives. In the film, Wilson s character accidentally attends a lecture on HTML5, which mirrors Google s Tech Talks that feature anyone from an innovator in the health sciences to a chef releasing a new book. ""Google is a lot like a university campus,"" says the company spokeswoman. A business is only as strong as its team, so it's important to continue investing in your employees long after you've hired them. Put together an informal speaker series where upper-level team members share their success stories. Invite experts in a related field to the office for an industry update, or attend local seminars as a group.5. Create team challenges to motivate employees. Wilson and Vaughn find themselves fumbling through several tech-based challenges throughout their summer internship. Spurring innovation through healthy competition among groups of co-workers can be effective off-screen, too. Consider creating a monthly challenge in the office, or build team bonds with recreational activities, such as a company softball league. Vaughn said of real-life Googlers,  They played that game Quidditch -- like for real, an intramural game. 6. Provide sales training and exposure to every worker. After the film s tech-savvy interns compete to create a new app, the final two challenges focus on customer service and sales. By exposing every member of the team, no matter what their position in the company, to these two critical areas of the business, everyone remembers that the customer always comes first. Even the best product on the shelves won t sell itself.7. Use your internship program to develop talent. You won't see Vaughn or Wilson fetching coffee, making copies or running menial errands in The Internship. If those are your current intern assignments, hire an administrative assistant and refocus on shaping these potential new hires who could push your company forward. Making this change also gives the interns what they really want. ""Try and stay enthusiastic,"" Vaughn advised the screening s audience of summer interns. ""Even if you get a boss that s kind of a jerk or doesn t recognize that you re doing good, still try to get what you came for, which is the experience.

/article/226949,"U.S. Sees Modest Growth, Small Businesses Face Jobless Recovery","As several reports show a slight improvement in the economy, small businesses remain cautious though the franchise sector is the bright spot.","The overall U.S. economy sees modest growth in May, driven by housing and manufacturing improvements, but small businesses remain cautious, according to multiple reports this week.The economy adds 175,000 jobs in May, more than economists expected, but the growth is still nothing to write home about. The unemployment rate ticks up slightly to 7.6 percent in May, from 7.5 percent in April, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reports Friday. Employment improves in retail trade, professional and business services, and bars and restaurants in May.Meanwhile, job gains for March and April have been revised down by a combined 12,000 jobs. March's growth has been revised to 142,000 from 138,000 jobs, and April's to 149,000 from 165,000. Over the prior 12 months, employment growth averaged 172,000 per month, the Labor Department says.A separate report by payroll processor ADP, which focuses on small business, finds that companies with fewer than 49 workers have added 58,000 jobs in May, below the average of 65,000 jobs per month over the last six months. Companies with one to 19 employees account for 64 percent of the growth in May, or 37,000 jobs, according to the ADP National Employment Report.Small-business hiring gains in May show progress since April, when small companies added 49,000 jobs, but are well below the 72,000 new jobs added in March, ADP says.Improvements in housing and manufacturing are helping the economy grow, albeit at a tepid rate, the Federal Reserve's most recent Beige Book survey finds. But it's not enough to make a meaningful difference in job growth, observers say. The job market has been weighed down by various fiscal concerns ranging from tax increases to government spending cuts. Small businesses, in particular, remain pessimistic that the economy is really on the rebound. Related: Entrepreneurs See Brighter Days for Their Business, Not the Economy""We're currently in a recovery; it's just a jobless recovery,"" says Michael Alter, chief executive of SurePayroll, a payroll processing company that focuses on small businesses.Small businesses today are doing more with fewer people, Alter says, by using technology and leveraging freelancers to fill in the gaps. He believes hiring won't get a real jumpstart until demand increases significantly or there are specific needs to fill.""We just aren't seeing enough growth to justify [major] hiring,"" Alter says.Separately, a report Wednesday by the International Franchise Association says the franchise sector will continue to outperform the economy as a whole and grow at a slightly faster rate than other businesses in 2013. Nonetheless, the IFA remains concerned that franchise development is being impeded by the ""uneven economic recovery and the onerous public policy environment facing our members and the small-business community,"" says Steve Caldeira, president and chief executive of IFA, in a statement.

/article/226923,Apple Aims to Increase Its Silicon Valley Workforce By Nearly 50 Percent,"The tech giant says it expects to hire 7,400 additional employees to work in its new headquarters in Cupertino, Calif.","Apple has big plans for its headquarters in Cupertino, Calif. Not only is the tech giant planning to construct a new 3.4 million-square-foot office campus there, it says it expects to hire 7,400 additional employees by 2016, when the new campus is expected to be completed. That's an increase of nearly 50 percent over the 16,000 full-time Apple employees who currently work in Cupertino.The details of Apple's plan were outlined in a report prepared by real estate advisory firm Keyser Marston Associates and submitted to the city of Cupertino yesterday to win approval for construction. In addition to creating new jobs, Apple said the new office campus can help increase revenues of local businesses and enhance tax revenues in Cupertino. Apple did not describe the types of jobs it plans to fill with the new recruits, other than to call them ""high quality.""Apple's current headquarters -- called the Infinite Loop -- is an 856,000-square-foot facility that houses approximately 3,000 employees. Apple says the other 13,000 employees work at various locations around Cupertino that the company either leases or has purchased. In all, Apple employs about 73,000 people worldwide.While the report did not divulge details about new products Apple may be developing -- such as a smart watch, for instance -- Apple did note that it has experienced an average annual revenue growth rate of more than 35 percent, with net sales skyrocketing from $24.6 billion in 2006 to $156.6 billion last year.Apple has been planning to construct a state-of-the-art headquarters since 2011. Plans call for a spaceship-like structure that houses a restaurant, a 100,000-square-foot fitness center and a 1,000-seat corporate auditorium, among other amenities.Related: In Major Hiring Push, Web Hosting Powerhouse Go Daddy to Expand Its Services

/article/226888,The Great Debate: Should You Let Employees Work From Home?,"Yahoo and Best Buy may have concluded that telecommuting doesn't work for their companies anymore, but it could still make sense for your business.","Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer sparked a national debate last month when she decreed that Yahoo employees will no longer be able to work from home -- and now Best Buy is following suit for its corporate headquarters employees. Mayer's stated goal was greater collaboration, and she may have a point: Extensive research, including a massive study conducted by Harvard Medical School's Isaac Kohane, suggests that proximity to one's colleagues is a key driver of innovation.But there's also research suggesting that employees who work at home can be more productive than their in-office counterparts. And plenty of businesses large and small have found that telecommuting, especially when deployed part time, can create a best-of-both-worlds environment that fosters happier, more productive and more loyal employees.""Work at the office to collaborate with the team,"" observes Amy Marshall, chief operating officer of Internet marketing company Fathom Columbus, ""and work from home to get things done with fewer interruptions.""Making it work
Making telecommuting work relies in part on making sure off-site employees have the tools they need to be productive, from simple telephone and Internet connections to, in some cases, video-conferencing hardware and software and document-sharing services. But it's important to make sure employees are ready for the responsibility.""Many companies decide whether someone works from home based on the job itself: Can it be done remotely?"" observes clinical psychologist Aubrey Daniels of Aubrey Daniels International. ""This is a fundamental management error. The decision should be based on whether the person has earned the privilege of working at home. If the person is a poor performer at work, they will most certainly be a poor performer at home."" And, one might argue, they will most certainly be fired eventually.Ari Zoldan, CEO of Quantum Networks, a technology incubator in New York City, says his once-generous telecommuting policy was not sustainable for his firm. ""People were taking advantage of it,"" he says. ""We would have office days with half our employee base missing to 'work remote' for one reason or another, and it was impeding productivity and efficiency in the workplace."" He now requires that employees who want to work from home schedule it at least five business days in advance.Others have found ways to make sure off-site workers keep their end of the employer-employee bargain. To make sure deadlines at her marketing and PR firm are met, Kristin Marquet, president of Marquet Media in New York City, has her employees send in detailed weekly updates while working off-site.Ellen Arndt, communications manager at AlphaCard in Portland, Oregon, says her firm uses a cloud-based project management service to track daily assignments. ""Employees must record what projects they plan to work on at home, and then check off what they were able to complete at the end of the day,"" she says. ""Harnessing this tool allows supervisors to have visibility into productivity patterns and provides accountability to employees.""Tailoring your approach
Often, different companies find that different approaches of managing off-site workers make sense for them, depending upon the nature of their work and their workforce. Some employers, for example, swear by software programs that track the tasks employees are performing, the websites they're visiting, and how much time they're spending away from their computers.Hassan Osman, a senior program manager at Cisco Systems, where he leads virtual teams on delivering large and complex projects and programs, dislikes that approach. ""Although it might be perfectly legal, you would be defeating the entire purpose of a teleworking arrangement,"" he says. ""The idea is to give employees the flexibility of integrating their personal and work lives so that they can take care of non-office-related tasks during work hours if they need to. You're better off not agreeing to the telecommuting arrangement in the first place if you're going to be constantly monitoring their activity.""Perhaps, although some business owners would surely argue that for them, telecommuting is more about allowing people to work where they're most productive and less about letting them squeeze in non-work activities. But for everyone who takes that view, there's another who recognizes that employees are subject to many distractions in an office environment, too.Yung Trang, president of the daily deal website TechBargains, is probably typical of business owners who like the idea of letting employees work from home but also worry about how it will impact their business. To make it work at TechBargains, Trang has established clear ground rules.""First, working from home is a privilege, not a right,"" he says. ""It can be revoked if abused. Second, when you are working from home you must be available -- and productive, via email, chat and phone -- as if you were here in the office. Third, if working from home impacts productivity and adds to the work of others, then you must come into the office.""Still not sure if telecommuting is right for your company? Why not start small?""Sometimes employees work better in their own spaces. Sometimes they don't,"" says Emily Taffel, who lets employees at her firm, Mugsy PR in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, telecommute. ""But you will not know unless you give it a try.""Randy MyersA former reporter for The Wall Street Journal and Dow Jones and contributor to Barron's, Randy Myers is a contributing editor for CFO and Corporate Board Member magazines.Read more",Growth Strategies,2013-06-03 09:30:00

But offering more thoughtful perks can help further your mission and give employees something to smile about.,"Ping pong and free snacks have long been the hallmarks of a fun,  work hard, play hard  startup culture. But these days, those ideas have grown as stale as the free cheerios in your office s kitchen.Though well-liked by many, at the extreme, such startup staples are often perceived as superficial, unimaginative or even a negative signal that a startup is trying too hard to fit in.One San Francisco-based startup which makes Buffer, a social-media management tool, has a unique set of perks and practices that manage to distinguish the company s culture and secure its roots as an organization that prizes communication and life-long learning.What makes Buffer s perks and practices meaningful is that they re not incidental to the task at hand but, rather, deeply connected to making the actual work more fulfilling and enriching to the team as a whole.

Rather than coming off as intrusive or  Big Brother,  the practice ends up sparking conversations about the connection between personal energy levels and productivity at work   and that can be enlightening in itself. Work smarter, not harder  is one of Buffer s mantras, and they use the Jawbone to get those critical insights on how, for example, the amount of sleep they got affects how much work they got done.3.  One-on-one time.Buffer has a team of more than 10 people spread across multiple time zones, each with their own schedule and preferred way of working. Rather than trying to cram everyone together at specific times every week, you get on a call with just one other person in the company to talk about the challenges you re facing and the progress you re making.Related: Tips for Overcoming Early HR HurdlesThis way, Buffer is able to offer its employees one of the biggest perks of all: control over their time and work, all while fostering meaningful conversation and feedback one at a time.4.

/article/226407,The Basics of Obamacare,Here are the vitals you need to know about SMBs and The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.,"						This story appears in the May 2013 issue of Entrepreneur. Subscribe  For nearly three years, Willan Johnson has been trying to figure out the best way to provide health insurance to his 72 employees. He has been delayed by confusion and uncertainty.When he founded Los Angeles-based pool maintenance company VivoPools in 2009, Johnson's goal was to create a national brand with high service standards to compete in a fragmented industry of mom-and-pop providers. Part of his strategy was to provide health insurance and other benefits to attract and retain good workers. But when he studied his options, The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (PPACA)--also known as Obamacare--had just been passed. That changed his plans.""I called a number of different health-insurance consultants and said, 'OK: What do we do about this?' And, by and large, everyone said, 'Don't do anything yet,'"" he recalls. The advisors were concerned that he would launch a program that wouldn't be in compliance with the complex new legislation.But Johnson is going to have to make some decisions before Jan. 1, 2014. That's when the law, which has been rolling out in phases since its passage, mandates that ""large employers""--those with 50 or more full-time or full-time-equivalent (FTE) employees--need to provide health insurance or face penalties.Changes by the Year2013
  Employers begin reporting healthcare premium costs on 2012 W2s.
  Employers must provide employees with notice of exchange availability.
  State exchanges begin open enrollment in October.
  Employers must withhold an additional 0.9 percent from the FICA wages of employees earning more than $200,000 per year.
  Flexible savings account spending limit is reduced to $2,500.2014
  Employers with more than 50 full-time or FTE employees must provide health insurance to those employees or face penalties.
  Annual limits on health-insurance coverage are eliminated.
  Clinical-trial insurance coverage provision begins.
  Coverage denial based on preexisting conditions or gender is eliminated.
  Small-business health-insurance tax credit increases.According to the PPACA and additional guidance provided by the Internal Revenue Service, full-time employees are those who work an average of 30 hours or more per week or 130 hours or more per month. FTE employees work an average of 120 hours per month. Seasonal businesses whose employees work 120 hours per month or for more than four months may also be subject to the mandate, says Kevin Kuhlman, manager of legislative affairs for the Washington, D.C.-based National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB). Companies with fewer than 50 full-time or FTE employees individually, but that have a common owner and exceed that threshold when combined, may also be subject to the mandate.""The employers in that [40- to 60-employee] threshold are concerned, or those who have a ton of seasonal employees,"" Kuhlman says. ""They're the ones who are going to face the most scrutiny.""For many businesses that already provide health insurance to employees, little will change, except for a few additional reporting requirements. W2 forms for 2012 (issued in early 2013) need to include the cost of coverage provided. Starting in 2014, the coverage has to be ""affordable,"" so the employee contribution cannot exceed 9.5 percent of the employee's household income for the taxable year. That can be a problem for business owners who might not have information about total household income, Kuhlman says, so the IRS has proposed basing affordability on the employee's wages alone. In addition, firms will need to ensure that their plans comply with new provisions of the healthcare law that go into effect Jan. 1, such as a ban on annual coverage limits and eliminating discrimination based on preexisting conditions or gender.Larry Levitt, co-executive director of The Program for the Study of Health Reform and Private Insurance, part of the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation, says employers need to work with their providers to ensure their policies are in compliance. He cites the example of the law requiring all policies to cap patients' out-of-pocket expenses by 2014, stating that currently ""not all employer plans have an all-encompassing cap on what patients have to pay.""Policies that have been in place since before the law was passed and which have not undergone significant changes may be grandfathered and have certain exemptions, Levitt says. Check with your financial advisor about those thresholds, rather than making a guess for which you could be penalized.Not Just the Bottom Line
At least one person is not losing much sleep over the changes. Josh King, general counsel and vice president of business development for Avvo, an 85-person online law resource based in Seattle, says companies like his simply have to provide an effective health insurance plan if they have any hope of attracting the best talent.""On the long list of things that I worry about every day as a managing partner, healthcare costs and healthcare benefits are not on the list,"" King says.A report by the Kaiser Family Foundation and Health Research & Educational Trust states that the average annual health-insurance premium for employer-sponsored policies in 2012 was $5,615 for single coverage and $15,745 for family coverage--up 3 percent and 4 percent, respectively, over the previous year.While the management team at Avvo is unfazed, Marcia Boyce, co-owner of Boyce Body Werks, a Batavia, Ill., automotive repair shop, is worried about healthcare costs in general. She received her plan renewal for her 29-employee firm--24 of whom are covered by the company health insurance--in January, and the rate increase was 33 percent. In 2012, the cost increased 14 percent over the previous year. In 2009, for the first time since the business was founded in 1985, she began having workers contribute $6.50 each week to their health insurance costs. Now employees pay roughly $70 per month and will pay even more when the plan renews. ""I've been talking to my insurance broker about options, and it's just overwhelming,"" Boyce says.A report by the Kaiser Family Foundation and Health Research & Educational Trust states that the average annual health-insurance premium for employer-sponsored policies in 2012 was $5,615 for single coverage and $15,745 for family coverage--up 3 percent and 4 percent, respectively, over the previous year. While that gain seems modest, it can be a hefty increase when multiplied by a sizable work force. The report also stated that covered workers in 2012 contributed, on average, 18 percent of the premium for single coverage and 28 percent of the premium for family coverage, which is the same percentage reported in 2011.The much-touted small-employer health credit is available to employers who pay at least 50 percent of each eligible employee's single coverage, have fewer than 25 full-time or FTE employees and pay average wages of less than $50,000 per year. (Boyce doesn't qualify, as she has 29 employees with average wages of more than $50,000.) Qualifying businesses may receive a maximum 2013 credit of 35 percent of the employer's premium cost; this increases to up to 50 percent for qualifying employers in 2014.State Programs
In an effort to curb costs and make policies accessible for small businesses and individuals, every state will have an Affordable Insurance Exchange. Open enrollment is expected to begin in October 2013. The exchanges will operate Small Business Health Options Programs (SHOPs) that offer small businesses and their employees four tiers of policies with varying levels of coverage. Initially, businesses with more than 100 employees will not be permitted to participate in the SHOPs; however, that may change in the future, NFIB's Kuhlman says.Some states are opting to create their own exchanges; the federal government will create one for those that are unwilling or unable to do so. If businesses with more than 50 employees choose not to provide health insurance, they will be subject to a fee of $2,000 per employee for every full-time employee beyond the company's first 30 workers. In those cases, employees would then purchase insurance directly through the exchanges or, if they prefer, through a traditional insurance broker and may qualify for tax credits, based on their income.Brad DeLong, an economics professor at the University of California, Berkeley, and a fellow with research group the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation, likens SHOPs to outsourced benefits departments. ""The small and medium-size businesses will no longer be at a disadvantage to large businesses that can offer health insurance, which is a tremendously valuable benefit,"" he says.Still, there is a great deal of uncertainty. The IRS just issued its guidance on full-time and FTE calculations in January. Many states are lagging in developing their exchanges, even with open enrollment slated to begin this fall. And some large companies have made headlines by announcing that they're going to cut workers' hours to avoid the mandate requirements.At VivoPools, Johnson is still working through his analysis paralysis. But he says he is committed to getting his employees covered. He is considering restructuring his pricing model and increasing service offerings to make up the cost, but he sees the investment as a long-term advantage, helping him attract better employees and keep them longer.Stay Informed on ReformThroughout the year, more information will emerge from the federal and state government agencies responsible for implementing healthcare reform.

/article/226836,How Far Would You Go to Check Out a Job Candidate?,"At a recent StartX event, a panel of entrepreneurs detailed their unusual approaches to checking candidate references.","Requesting a list of references from job candidates is as standard as requiring a resume, but some startup founders are putting a unique spin on the traditional hiring routine.At a recent event hosted by StartX, a nonprofit startup accelerator for Stanford University students, a panel of small-business owners expressed a range of approaches to reference checks, from talking to the candidate's peers to promising to call former employers after the first candidate screening call.Laura Borel, chief executive and co-founder of Nutrivise, a mobile app that makes meal recommendations, has interviewed more than 100 candidates to scale her team from two to eight employees since 2011. Calling candidates' references is the final phase of Nutrivise's hiring process and an important step, said Borel. But she prefers to speak with the candidates' former colleagues rather than their managers because she believes they give greater insight into questions about teamwork, work ethic and follow-through. She tends to ask the colleagues: What is your least favorite part about working with the candidate? And, when does the candidate call a project finished?Meanwhile, Tony Lai, chief executive and co-founder of LawGives, an aggregator of legal resources, uses an approach inspired by business book Topgrading: The Proven Hiring and Promoting Method That Turbocharges Company Performance (Penguin Group, 2012). During the initial screening phone call with candidates, Lai asks if they are comfortable with him calling any of their former employers at random. Gauging their reaction to his surprising reference-check test shapes his impression of the candidate, he noted. ""If people are evasive, that just raises red flags,"" he said. ""You don't want to get to the very end of the interview process and be surprised.""This approach helps to weed out second-rate candidates when looking for ways to get through a stack of 200 resumes, which is exactly the position Lai and his co-founder found themselves in when searching for a chief technology officer.Related: 3 Unique Hiring Techniques to Find the Right Person for the JobTech entrepreneur J. Scott Zimmerman, on the other hand, isn't sure reference checks are all that helpful for startups. The chief executive and co-founder of Xola, an online booking and marketing system for travel that was founded in 2011, said he still goes through the motions of calling references but questions how useful it is.""I proceed with caution about how I use that information to substantiate our decision to hire a candidate,"" said Zimmerman, whose company has five employees. If the applicant is coming from a corporate environment, their references might provide some helpful information, but not necessarily demonstrate their fit for a startup environment, he said.As new managers build confidence in their hiring process and judgment, it's important they take information gleaned from candidate references with a grain of salt.""Reference checks are useful only to the extent that you do them diligently,"" said Hayagreeva Rao, professor of organizational behavior and human resources at Stanford University's Graduate School of Business, in an interview. Because the references that candidates supply typically speak well of them, he suggests digging deeper than the initial reference pool.For example, Rao advises asking references volunteered by the candidate to suggest another colleague who might also be able to speak about that potential hire. This approach allows the potential employer to move beyond vetted referrals and gain a more complete picture of the candidates' capabilities.Related: 5 Ways to Recruit Rock-Star Employees on a BudgetNathalie PierrepontNathalie Pierrepont is a Silicon Valley-based freelance writer.

When it comes to immigration reform, however, many politicians and entrepreneurs are on the same team.Scores of heavy hitting politicians, including the New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and former U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, and innovative tech leaders, including Craigslist founder Craig Newmark and Mashable founder Pete Cashmore, will voice their support for immigration reform online today. The goal of the virtual demonstration, called the March for Innovation, is to bring attention to the need for visas for highly-skilled workers into the U.S. The tagline of the movement is:  It s a no brainer to keep and attract brainpower in America. The virtual march comes the day after the Senate Judiciary Committee voted to move forward the immigration reform proposal from the so-called  Gang of Eight,  a step in the legislative process being cheered by advocates.Related: What 'Gang of Eight' Immigration Reform Would Mean for EntrepreneursEntrepreneurs care about immigration reform because of the difficulty in hiring skilled engineers to staff tech-startups. Politicians care about it because both Democrats and Republicans want to secure the Latino vote for the next election season. Here is a list of some of the biggest players in both categories who have pledged their support to the bipartisan group organizing the march, the Partnership for a New American Economy, according to Alex Katz, spokesperson for the association.New York City Mayor Michael R.

/article/226698,How to Recruit a Top-Notch Recruiter,"For a growing company, asking a recruiter to help you fill key jobs can be ideal, but how do you know the recruiter 'gets' your company? Here's how to vet a recruiter.","If your business is growing, you probably don't have time to find the quality candidates needed to fill all those new positions. You might consider a third party recruiter.But hiring one of these pros can be tricky. After all, you don't really know if they're any good, since their recruitment skills can only be determined based on their ability to deliver high-quality candidates to you. And that's something you won't know until you've worked with them for months.Instead of crossing your fingers and hoping for the best, you'll need to suss out their skill level early on. Beyond asking about a recruiter's experience hiring in your industry for the type of talent you need, try getting crafty with your questions.Here's a sampling of clever and probing questions from three recruiting experts:1. What's your recruiting firm's internal turnover rate?If you want to gauge a recruiting agency's history of hiring dedicated recruiters, this is a somewhat sneaky way to shed some light on the question. The logic: if the agency vets its own recruiters well, they'll stay longer -- and that's an indicator the recruiting agency hires individuals who are passionate about their job, and who will be dedicated to finding you great candidates.Related: Blue, Green, Gold? How to Manage Employees Based on their ""Color"" TemperamentsJulie Labrie, the president of BlueSky Personnel, a recruiting agency based in Toronto, says her goal when hiring new recruiters for her agency is ""to find out first if they're passionate about what they do and if they really care. At the end of the day, I need to find out if they're going to dig for that person.""2. What is your sourcing strategy?Recruiting is one of the most challenging tasks for any company, as most of the top candidates for any position are passive. In fact, only 10 percent of the relevant talent is actively looking for a job. A great recruiter will have to do more than use job boards and scan LinkedIn to access that other 90 percent.Related: Quirky Startup Perks:  A Mating Call' for Tech Talent?Excellent recruiters will have a system to source these candidates. Ask how they would locate these diamonds in the rough, and how they'd engage the candidates they find, suggests Jennifer McClure, the president of Unbridled Talent, an HR consulting and advisory firm in Cincinnati. She adds that once the recruiter finds a good fit for the job, it's important to ask the recruiter ""How they connect with them, build rapport and how they sell them on the opportunity -- especially if it's a passive-type candidate.""3. How do you determine if a candidate will be a good culture fit with your clients?The authors of Who: The A Method for Hiring found that ""Not evaluating cultural fit was one of the biggest reasons for hiring mistakes."" As such, you should find a recruiter who's able to determine a candidate's cultural fit with your company, since this is absolutely necessary for your (and their) success.McClure further recommends asking recruiters what questions they'll use to judge a candidate's cultural fit. Things like: ""Tell me about the best culture that you've ever worked in. What made it really enjoyable for you to work there? Where's a place where you didn't fit well and what was that like?""And, you should assess how the recruiter will get to know your culture, since they'll have to understand it before they can gauge any candidate's compatibility. ""Most third-party recruiters will probably go through a checklist or they'll spend some time with you on the phone or they'll do some research to get a sense of who you are as a company,"" says Jessica Miller-Merrell, the president and CEO of XceptionalHR and head-writer of the well-known HR blog, Blogging4Jobs.Related: How to Hire the Right Employees for Your StartupFinally, you, as the employer, will have to do your part too.

/article/226663,Tips for Overcoming Early HR Hurdles,"Of all the struggles you'll face as an entrepreneur, hiring, training and managing employees is one of the biggest. Here are some tips for clearing your startup's way of HR obstacles.","On the road to entrepreneurship, you're sure to face many hurdles -- biggest of all is often HR.Between finding talent and hiring staffers to training employees and managing their productivity, the time you spend on human resources can be a significant drain on any fledgling startup. Moreover, if you do make a wrong move, that distraction can not only affect your small company's culture it could also harm your business. Think about how productive you'd be if you had to devote copious minutes to smoothing over employee strife.The best way to create continuity in your organization -- and save yourself some anguish in the process -- is to hire people for the long term who can add immediate value to your company. But one's ability shouldn't be the only factor.Here are a couple of other key considerations to make before biting the hiring bullet:Ensure the fit, before you buy.
Attaining a culture fit should also be a top priority. Passing on a fantastic engineer or a stellar business-development manager because they won't mix well with others at the company can be a smart business decision. Yet, seeing if a candidate is a good culture fit is harder to determine in a 30-minute interview than skill qualifications. Once a person's expert skill level is identified, make time to ask questions about the job seekers' experiences have would relate to your company's culture.Related: Biggest Mistakes: Skillshare on Knowing Your Strengths -- And Weaknesses (Video)Of course, you'll also need to have already identified the cultural nuances of your company. Hiring to that mold is the surest way to build a sustainable and productive workforce. For example, if your core employees are music enthusiasts, beer drinkers or pride themselves on being fashion forward, don't just consider it a trend. Perhaps they enjoy weekly team activities after work. Perhaps most of your employees work odd hours, work from home or like to communicate exclusively on Skype vs. email. You may not want to hire a candidate who prefers face time.Take your time to tease out cultural fit. If possible, have team members spend time with the candidate outside of the office.If it's broken, fix it.
Obviously, you're trying to hire people because you need help. But don't sacrifice quality for bodies. Often when you make quick hiring decisions, you're hiring minimally-qualified people too. You know they're not perfect for the role but you pull the trigger anyway.But that's a flawed strategy. Because time is your scarcest resource, you don't have the hours, let alone the resources, to train new employees. You also don't have the time to ""hope"" that they will bring immediate value to your business.Related: Quirky Startup Perks: 'A Mating Call' for Tech Talent?That's not to suggest that many employees don't grow into their positions. The problem is, as a startup, you're running against the clock and don't have time to know if they will blossom into their roles. You're better off waiting for the best candidate.In Silicon Valley, there's a saying that one great engineer is better for a company than six mediocre ones.

/article/226693,Memorable Management Blunders From 'The Office',"To mark the series finale of the popular NBC sitcom, here's a look back at a few of Michael Scott's not-so-shining moments as a boss.","Michael Scott, fictional manager of the Scranton, Pa., branch of paper company Dunder-Mifflin on popular NBC sitcom The Office, has become a symbol of bone-headed bosses everywhere. Over seven seasons, Michael made us laugh, groan and occasionally feel sympathy for him. One thing he didn't give in abundance was good management.Steve Carell, who played Michael, departed in 2011 but is reportedly returning for the final episode Thursday night. With The Office ending after nine seasons, it's the perfect time for a look back at a few of Michael's memorable management gaffes -- and the lessons you can learn from them.Gaffe No. 1: Fan the flames of diversity issues.
In season one, Dunder-Mifflin's corporate headquarters orders racial-sensitivity training for Michael's office. But he hijacks the proceedings and organizes his own diversity seminar. This quickly devolves into employees slapping index cards marked with different races on their foreheads, then attempting to guess their new racial identity based on clues provided by a coworker.Needless to say, these clues relate to offensive stereotypes about the ""races"" in question, which include ""Italian"" and ""Jamaican."" ""Stir the pot!"" Michael encourages his receptionist, Pam, when she is reluctant to participate. ""Stir the melting pot!""The worst part? The tolerance seminar was only required in the first place because of Michael's offensive imitation of a Chris Rock comedy routine.Lesson: This is definitely not the way to promote a tolerant work environment.Related: Blue, Green, Gold? How to Manage Employees By 'Color' TemperamentGaffe No. 2: Hog the spotlight.
When Jim, one of Michael's employees, allows fellow staffer Phyllis to play Santa Claus at the office Christmas party in season six, Michael is outraged at the loss of his traditional role. Throwing a tantrum, he turns his Santa suit inside out, so that it looks as if he's wearing a white robe. He emerges from his office to declare himself Jesus Christ, apparently thinking Jesus is the only Christmas figure who can trump Santa.""All I want to be is Santa,"" Michael says. ""And if you want to take that away from me, fine, go ahead. But when you need my help because I am ruining everything, don't look at me!""Lesson: As a business owner, don't let your ego get tied to such petty things. And don't try to hog all the holiday spirit for yourself. Spread some good cheer among your staff, and they will look up to you instead of resenting you.Gaffe No. 3: Try to force camaraderie among your employees.
In season two, Michael plans a team-building leadership event for his staff. The only problem is that it takes place on a booze cruise in the middle of a Northeastern winter. Needless to say, the staff isn't thrilled. To make matters worse, Michael breaks out some awkward moves on the dance floor. ""Sometimes you have to take a break from being the kind of boss who's always trying to teach people things,"" he reflects. ""Sometimes you have to just be the boss dancing.""Why a cruise? Michael had an epiphany that, as he put it, ""the word 'ship' is hidden inside the word 'leadership.'""Lesson: Real leaders know how to create a dynamic company culture without resorting to cheesy team-building events.Related: How to Think Like a Confident LeaderBrian Patrick EhaBrian Patrick Eha is a freelance journalist and former assistant editor at Entrepreneur.com.

/article/226665,The Salary Dilemma: Should You Be Open About Employee Pay?,"Deciding whether to be transparent about employee compensation can be tricky. But if your office gets talking, the choice is out of your hands. Here are three ways to handle the issue with care.","When you start a new business and have just one or two employees, it's both easy and practical to make salary decisions on a case-by-case basis. As your business grows, however, this approach likely will cause employees to speculate, often inaccurately, and gossip about who earns how much. This dynamic can distract them from doing their jobs.In an effort to avoid such fallout, some entrepreneurs make all their employees' salary information available to everyone in the company. At the other end of the spectrum are those business owners who think this approach is completely crazy.So who's right? Should your company's salary information be transparent? In my experience, many entrepreneurs debating transparency don't see the underlying issues.When you look at employee complaints about salary, they usually stem from at least one of the following three core issues:Employees perceive salary decisions as arbitrary and presume they're unfair.Employees view their performance differently than you do.Employees are confused about how the performance and compensation system works.Here are three ways to address these issues:1. Develop a salary formula. 
Stop making case-by-case salary decisions. Instead, define every job in the company and develop a salary formula for each one. To eliminate any perception of arbitrariness, the formula should take into account factors like an employee's skills, experience level and performance.Related: What Employee Stock Ownership Plans Mean For EntrepreneursFor example, say the salary range for a customer service agent is $20,000 to $30,000. An employee with average skills, experience and performance would earn $25,000. You can then rate the employee on a scale of -10 to +10. For example, if the employee had no experience, they would receive a -10 for experience. The combination of these ratings would then determine where in the salary range the employee falls.With this formula, employees will stop asking ""Why does Mary earn more than me?"" and start asking ""What do I need to do to become a senior customer service agent like Mary?"" Instead of complaining about seemingly arbitrary salary decisions, employees will focus on improving their skills to earn more. It's a subtle, but important distinction.2. Regularly tell employees where they stand.
Every job in the company should have a written set of objective performance expectations. Employees should know how their performance compares to those standards. In addition to an annual formal review, it s critical to provide frequent informal feedback.Let me illustrate this point with a personal example on a smaller scale. I have three daughters under the age of nine and they all have ""jobs"" (household chores) around the house. If I gave them feedback on their ""job performance"" only once a year, they certainly wouldn't keep up with their chores. While employees don't need the hourly feedback my kids seem to need, a single annual review just isn't enough.When you provide frequent performance feedback -- say, monthly -- employees have no reason to be resentful about salaries because you give them ample time and guidance to improve. Conversely, when you tell an employee on December 31 that he or she has been doing a bad job since February 1 and, as a result, won't be getting a raise, expect him or her to be rightfully resentful.Related: 5 Ways to Recruit Rock-Star Employees on a Budget3. Educate employees on your performance and compensation system.
Once you've adopted a systematic performance and compensation system, communicate it to all employees, department by department -- even if employees don t (or are afraid to) ask about it. In a department-wide meeting, explain the hierarchy of job titles, the skills needed to qualify for each level and the performance criteria for each job level. (Also be sure to include the same information in materials for new employees.)For example, you might announce that the customer service department now has only two job titles -- Customer Service Agent, and Senior Customer Service Agent. To qualify for the latter, one must have mastered computers systems X, Y and Z; be certified on product lines A & B; and have a quality rating of 9+ for the last two years.Before the new system goes into effect, give each employee a ""sneak preview"" performance and compensation review, based on the new guidelines. This gives everyone a chance to get used to the new system and to identify any conflicts without salary changes at stake.Once you've followed these three steps, you'll have an objective, systematic and well-communicated approach to inform your company's performance and salary decisions. At that point, whether or not you make salaries transparent will be a moot point because you'll have effectively eliminated the underlying issues.Related: 3 Things on a Growing Company's ChecklistVictor ChengVictor Cheng is a former McKinsey consultant, author and co-founder of Entrepreneur-to-CEO Mastermind, a Seattle-based firm that advises entrepreneurs of fast-growing companies.Read more",Run a Better Business,2013-05-15 07:00:00
/article/226614,New York City Council Approves Sick-Leave Requirement for Small Businesses,Business owners react to a bill that mandates paid sick leave for companies with 20 or more employees.,"UPDATE: The paid sick-leave law passed in New York City June 27 when the city council overrode a mayoral veto.The New York City Council today passed a bill requiring many small businesses to provide five days of annual paid sick leave to their employees.The legislation, which passed 45 3, is expected to go into effect next April, affecting companies with 20 or more employees. In October 2015, it would begin applying to New York City businesses with 15 or more employees. Next, the bill will go to Mayor Michael Bloomberg's desk, although he has said he will veto it. The Council is expected to have enough votes to override any veto attempt.Supporters say the legislation will provide necessary economic security for workers, while opponents are concerned the new requirement will discourage hiring among small companies during a time of high unemployment.After fighting the bill for three years due to concerns over its economic impact, Christine Quinn, speaker of the City Council, now says the local economy is strong enough to handle it.""I think this is just a great day for city workers, with a million workers now going to get sick leave,"" Quinn said at a press conference. At the same time, she said ""the smallest of businesses, those that operate on month-to-month cash flow,"" are exempted from the new law, as is the still-struggling manufacturing sector.Workers can use the sick leave when they or an immediate family member get sick, as well as during public health emergencies.Related: New York City to Require Employers to Give Paid Sick LeaveIn the City Council chambers, council members rose before the vote to comment on the sick-leave bill. ""We can celebrate today for the million workers, but we cannot celebrate for the hundreds of thousands who are not included in this,"" said Councilman Charles Barron.Councilman Peter Vallone, who identified himself as a former small-business owner, said the Council should stop telling entrepreneurs how to run their businesses ""before we run them into the ground."" He voted against the legislation.Attitude New York, a local limousine company, has more than 70 employees and doesn't currently provide paid sick leave for its 40 to 50 chauffeurs, though it does for its managerial staff. ""If everybody feels like they can just take their five days regardless [of whether they're sick], that could be very expensive,"" says Rosina Rubin, chief operations and financial officer for Attitude New York. Her husband founded the company in 1986 and she joined in 1990.But some entrepreneurs, particularly in the tech industry, are not flinching. ""I don't think we'll even blink at it,"" says Shane Snow, founder of Contently, a 30-month-old tech startup with 18 employees. Top tech startups already offer excellent benefits, Snow explains, because they must compete with Google and other progressive companies for elite talent. And digital work can be done remotely, making it easier to offer as much time off as needed, ""so long as you get your work done,"" which Snow says is the policy at Contently.Besides, Snow says employee happiness is crucial at a small company. ""If you put your people in a bad financial position just because they got sick, they're not going to be excited to come to work, and neither will their coworkers,"" he says. ""And guess what? Before you know it your business is lagging, people are leaving.""Although it isn't the first of its kind in the United States, the New York City paid sick-leave bill could influence other urban hubs to adopt similar legislation. San Francisco, Washington, D.C., Milwaukee, Philadelphia and Seattle have already passed mandatory sick-leave laws. Portland, Ore. passed such a bill earlier this year that will go into effect in January 2014.If a critical mass of cities is reached, sick-leave laws could come up for votes in state legislatures and in Congress.""I absolutely would like to see the state [of New York] pass legislation of this type, as well as I would like to see the federal government pass legislation of this type,"" Quinn said. ""I hope New York City taking this action will get other jurisdictions to think about what actions they should take.""Related: Can NYC Keep Its Startup Prowess?

/article/226580,When a Family Business Should Outsource Human Resources,"In this case study, Philadelphia's Buzz Marketing hired a pro to handle HR, saving the owner time and tension over family hires.","In this ongoing series, The Fix, we look at real problems faced by real companies and how they solved them. The Challenge: 2012 was a big year for Buzz Marketing Group. The Philadelphia research and viral marketing firm had reached its 16th year and landed large clients such as Dell which would drive its annual revenue up 112% over 2010. To handle this influx of work, the team had grown over the same period, with 60% more contractors and 33% more employees.Growth has its drawbacks, however, and founder Tina Wells was frustrated with how much time she spent on human resources, rather than business development. Wells estimates that she spent nearly 8 hours a week handling tasks like tracking vacation time, updating the employee handbook and creating job descriptions. Additionally, she'd hired several of her five younger siblings at different points in the company's history and even today, two of her siblings are full-time employees. Wells says there was a misperception within the firm that family received special treatment, creating tension she wanted to erase. Related: Is it Time to Outsource HR?""We needed to address how we were going to attract new senior talent as well as promote open communication within the company, whether or not your last name was Wells,"" she says. ""Sometimes regardless of how a company operates, you can't help how others feel when a lot of employees are family. I try to remind people that Walmart and Campbell are both  family' businesses too.""The Fix: Last year, Wells expanded its contract with Paychex, a third-party payroll and human resources firm. Buzz initially started working with Paychex in 2011 to manage its payroll. In 2012, Paychex began managing the firm's human resources, overhauling the company's handbook from 20 pages to 130 pages, codifying the firm's policies, crafting job descriptions and tracking employee performance. With an online HR system, employees could easily access company manuals and forms as well as track paid time-off themselves. After expanding its services, roughly 1 percent of Buzz's budget goes to Paychex, according to Wells. Paychex also helped ease the transition for two key hires to the company in 2012, a vice president of marketing and a chief operating officer, creating job descriptions, offer letters and working with new hires in their first weeks.Related: 3 Tools to Take the Headaches out of Hiring and HRBut most importantly, hiring Paychex created a neutral, third-party layer of management to address misperceptions of nepotism within the company. ""We had an HR process previously, but having somebody completely unassociated with the family manage human resources made it easier for everyone on staff to communicate,"" says Wells. Paychex created a cushion between the staff and leadership, leading to ""a much more comfortable working environment. Bringing in a third party was the only way to make everybody feel like there was a fair playing field.""These days, the time Wells spends on HR concerns for her 8-person firm has shrunk by 88% to one hour a week and she can focus more on decision making for her business. ""This has given me the time to be the creative executive I want to be, coming up with solutions for my clients,"" she says.The Takeaway: Hiring a third-party human resources firm can save time and ease communication issues in a family business.Amy S.

/article/226567,5 Ways to Recruit Rock-Star Employees on a Budget,Entrepreneurs usually can't offer new hires the promise of a hefty salary. But there are ways to get A-list employees without breaking the bank.  Here are five budget-friendly techniques to get you there.,"Most startups are in a big bind when it comes to hiring. They don t have enough money to lure top talent through salaries. Yet without that talent, entrepreneurs will be hard-pressed to develop a world-beating product that customers want to buy.Fortunately, there is a way around this dilemma that can help you convince the most talented people to give up a bigger, steadier paycheck. Here are five strategies you can use to recruit and retain talent when you're on a tight budget:1. Grab potential hires emotionally.If you hope to lure the best employees, your startup must have a compelling mission. I once interviewed the co-founder of a software company who had been one of Facebook s first 100 employees. Walking away from Facebook before its initial public offering was a big financial loss, but to him, the startup -- whose software decodes the genetic basis of cancer -- offered a more compelling goal than increasing ad click-throughs.If you can convey your company has a mission that's more compelling than others in your industry, you will have an easier time hiring top employees.Related: 3 Unique Hiring Techniques to Find the Right Person for the Job2. Show them you only hire the finest.If you want to hire top talent, you absolutely must staff your executive ranks with leaders in the field. The reason for that is very clear -- A-players want to work with other A-players.The best way to hire A-players is to be one yourself. In my many interviews with Silicon Valley venture capitalists, I learned that the best startup CEOs have great reputations among the people they've worked with in the past. Make sure you can tell compelling stories that show you have superior industry knowledge and a strong vision for your company's future.3. Present them with a challenge.If you're trying to attract the best hires, there is nothing more compelling than offering a chance to work on the most challenging problems in their field. It costs you nothing to define your venture's strategy in that way, but top talent loves it.If you want to make this clear to potential hires, tell them about your customers' enthusiasm for the way your product solves a big problem that has gone unsolved for years. Highlight the new challenges you plan to tackle and make it clear to them that they have the chance to make a big difference in coming up with that solution.Related: Richard Branson on Keeping Your Most Valued Employees Happy4. Be clear about the potential for growth.Prospective hires look at your startup through a lens similar to that of a venture capitalist. The best hires in your field like a compelling mission and challenges, but they also have a mercenary side. So when you're trying to bring those kingpins to your startup, make it clear that they are going after a big opportunity.Conveying this message credibly is a challenge for entrepreneurs. Potential employees -- not to mention investors -- expect you to overestimate the size of the potential opportunity. But you don't want to overpromise. Be very specific in distinguishing the specific segment of the market that you are targeting.5. Know your customer inside-out.You also want to give potential hires the confidence that you know your customer very well. Interview at least 50 potential customers. Based on those interviews, you should know the specific criteria that customers use when they buy products in your market and why your product beats the competition in the minds of those customers. Letting potential employees know this gives them the confidence to come on board.Recruiting top talent boosts your venture's odds of success. Without offering big salaries, these five intangibles can make a vital difference to your hiring effectiveness.Related: The Benefits of Unconventional Hiring Practices Peter S.

/article/226569,Jobs Report: More Companies Are Hiring But Small Businesses Remain Cautious,"Several indicators show the overall economy is on the upswing, but small-business hiring is down slightly.","The U.S. job market is finally showing signs of life, but small-business hiring is down slightly, according to several reports released this week.The economy added 165,000 jobs in April, and the unemployment rate ticked down slightly to 7.5 percent, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. The job growth and unemployment rate were both slightly better than economists had predicted and an improvement from the previous month. In March, a revised 138,000 jobs were added and unemployment stood at 7.6 percent. Unemployment has been dropping for the past several months, but previous reports showed that people were leaving the workforce rather than finding jobs. This month, however, the decline in the unemployment rate is a sign of a stronger job market. ""Today's report is pretty good news,"" says David W. Berson, chief economist at financial services company Nationwide Insurance. ""It [shows] stronger job growth, not declines in the labor force as it has over the last six months.""In another sign of economic improvement, the employment data for February and March were revised upward. In those months, 114,000 more jobs were added than previously reported, suggesting that the job market in 2013 is somewhat stronger than people thought, says Berson. What's more, a Labor Department report on Thursday revealed that first-time claims for unemployment benefits slid to their lowest level in five years, indicating fewer layoffs.To be sure, economists aren't breaking out the champagne yet. The job numbers are considered good but not great, and unemployment is still higher than forecasters would like.Related: Survey: Fewer Small Businesses Expect to Hire or GrowMeanwhile, hiring among small-business owners is not keeping pace with the national average. On Wednesday, payroll processor ADP released a private-sector jobs report showing that small businesses added 50,000 jobs in April, compared with 60,000 in March. And a report this week by online payment processor SurePayroll showed that hiring fell 0.2 percent in April from the previous month at companies with an average of eight employees. It appears that the impending health-care reform may be negatively impacting hiring at companies around the 50-employee threshold. The slowdown in small-business hiring is coming primarily from the leisure and hospitality, retail trade and construction sectors, according to ADP. These are industries where one would expect the effects of health-care reform to be more significant, says Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics. Under the Affordable Care Act legislation, known as Obamacare, companies with more than 50 staffers have to provide health-care insurance to workers or face substantial fines. Related: Bracing for Obamacare, Some Businesses Try PEOs Higher payroll taxes and government spending cuts may also be taking a toll on small-business hiring. In January, the payroll tax increased to 6.2 percent after two years at 4.2 percent, taking a larger chunk out of workers' take-home pay. What's more, industry observers say uncertainty surrounding the automatic federal budget cuts, known as the sequester, is likely having some effect.

/article/226561,3 Ways to Find Your Perfect Board of Advisors,Successful leaders know how to seek out advice. Having a board of advisors that can help you assess key decisions is important to the growth of your business. Here are three ways to build your board.,"Most entrepreneurs use the  Me, Myself and I  approach to corporate governance: I am the sole shareholder. I vote myself to be the sole board member and as a board member, I hire myself to be the CEO.This certainly provides the ultimate in control, but entrepreneurs taking this approach are missing out on the benefits that Fortune 500 counterparts with their own boards are using to their advantage.A board of directors serves two roles -- to legally represent the interests of shareholders (especially in public companies) and to serve as advisors to the CEO. The board in its advisory role brings a range of perspectives and skills to major business decisions. Many entrepreneurs don't use such a board because they think it's only useful for big companies or it seems too complicated to administer.But if Warren Buffett and Steve Jobs weren't skilled enough to make decisions entirely on their own, what makes you think you are? A board of advisors can help in hearing out ideas or playing devil's advocate for key decisions. In short, they can help you make better, more effective, lower risk decisions about your business.Here are three ways to seek out and create your own board of advisors:Related: 3 Meetings Every Business Should HaveRecruit peers. A simple and cost-effective strategy for forming a board of advisors is to look within your business community to identify other business owners whom you trust and respect. Ask them to participate in monthly or quarterly advisory board meetings for your business, and in exchange, offer to sit on their board. This ends up being an effective barter transaction.Not only do you get the benefit of a trusted outsider's perspective, this kind of exchange will help you build familiarity with a business that is not your own. This develops your ability to see issues in an unbiased way -- a valuable skill when running your own company.Join an advisory board program. If you have difficulty finding a group of peers with whom you'd want to swap board seats, consider joining a board of advisors membership program. Organizations like Vistage, the Entrepreneurs' Organization and the CEO Clubs of America all have board of advisor programs. Simply join one of these organizations and you will be assigned to a pre-staffed board. Most advisors are owners of other local businesses of similar size and revenue who are eager to offer and seek advice from others.Hire experts you trust. Another approach is to find specific advisors you respect and hire them. You might seek out the best banker in town, the top tax attorney, a reputable business coach or a marketing expert. While most board seats run for one or two year terms, with paid advisors you can try them out for a few months before having them participate over longer periods of time. While this approach costs more than the others, you can custom-build your team of experts. Also, because they are all being paid cash fees, you don't have to worry about the quid pro quo of returning the favor.I've used all three approaches to assemble a board of advisors for my own company and have been recruited via all three methods to serve on other boards. They all work. The key is to find the approach that best matches your situation and get in a place where you can start receiving valuable outside counsel as soon as possible.Related: How to Build an Advisory Board

/article/226542,"In the Latest Move to Revamp Yahoo's Culture, Marissa Mayer Expands Parental Leave","With her policies under scrutiny, the Yahoo CEO follows her ban on telecommuting with new perks for new parents.","After taking flak for banning telecommuting at Yahoo in February and taking just a two-week maternity leave herself last year, chief executive Marissa Mayer has dramatically expanded the company's benefits for new parents.Yahoo will now provide up to eight weeks of fully paid leave for both mothers and fathers. Mothers who give birth to the baby rather than adopting or using a surrogate will receive a maximum of 16 paid weeks. Under the old policy, new moms received only six to eight weeks of paid maternity leave, and Yahoo provided no paternity leave, according to Yahoo. What's more, Yahoo now plans to give new parents up to $500 to help with child-care expenses. By law, U.S. companies are only federally mandated to offer 12 weeks of unpaid parental leave.The move appears to be part of an ongoing effort to revamp Yahoo's culture and compete with other Silicon Valley tech companies to lure top talent. Like rivals Google and Facebook, Mayer introduced free food in Yahoo's cafeterias. However, she caught heat several months ago for putting an end to employees' ability to work from home. Some employees felt they were more productive at home, while others criticized Mayer's new policy as unfriendly to working mothers.The youngest CEO of any Fortune 500 company, 37-year-old Mayer is a new mother herself. She gave birth to her first child in September, just two months after taking the top job at Yahoo. Working from home during most of her two-week maternity leave, she set off a national debate about maternity leave standards.While Yahoo's new parental-leave policy is a boon for working parents, at least two tech giants in the San Francisco Bay area offer even more generous benefits. Google allows new mothers to take up to 22 weeks of paid leave, while Facebook provides 16 weeks of paid time off for both mothers and fathers.Related: 4 Reasons Telecommuting Can Be Bad for BusinessBrian Patrick EhaBrian Patrick Eha is a freelance journalist and former assistant editor at Entrepreneur.com.

/article/226531,3 Meetings Every Business Should Have,Plan office meetings strategically and you're creating a road map for success. This doesn't have to be complicated. Here are three kinds of meetings that will help your business set and meet its goals.,"Your company's success depends on having more meetings. I'm assuming that's not what you wanted to hear. My general stance on meetings is that in most cases, they aren't necessary and an email detailing the information you want to convey will suffice.So, why do I want you to have 25 more meetings each year? The meetings I recommend relate specifically to achieving your annual goals. Here's how:One big-picture meeting
Once a year, your management team should meet to set goals for the upcoming year. If you don't have a formal ""management team,"" this group should include those who oversee key functions of your business such as marketing and manufacturing. Typically, this group should be comprised of up to seven individuals.The goals you set include your financial metric goals for revenues and net profit you'd like to achieve. They also include your ""business asset"" goals, such as attaining new customers, building new products and recruiting and training new employees. Without defining such goals, success will be elusive.Running this meeting is easier than you might think. Start by asking this question: How do we want our company to look a year from now? Use this question to gain consensus on your annual financial metrics and goals. Then, work with your team to determine what needs to be done to achieve these goals.Related: 3 Tips to Make the Most of MeetingsMonthly goal meetings 
The key to attaining your annual goals is to break them into smaller monthly goals that you can successfully achieve.Meet with your team at the beginning of each month. Start the meeting with a 15-minute recap of the previous month. What were the company's monthly results? Did you meet or exceed your goals? If not, what happened, and what do you need to do differently this month?In discussing your prior month's results, have each key employee take five minutes to report back on the goals they set for themselves for that month. Which ones did they achieve and which didn't happen? Why?Finally, set your overall goals for the current month. Take 15 minutes to discuss what your company can realistically accomplish as a team. At the close of your meeting, give each member about a minute to state at least one goal they plan to personally achieve.If you stick to a structured time schedule, assuming you have seven employees in the meeting, it should last approximately an hour and fifteen minutes.Have someone take notes that you then share with the team. After the meeting, each team member should identify five to seven specific goals they will achieve that month. Have them post their goals using an online collaboration tool, such as Google Docs, where everyone can view them.Related: Blue, Green, Gold? How to Manage Employees by 'Color' TemperamentMid-month check-ins
The next meeting is your mid-month meeting. During this meeting, have each employee state the progress they've made on their five to seven specific monthly goals. Importantly, if any goal seems like it will not be accomplished, collectively figure out how you can meet it. Also discuss how the overall company is doing and whether you are on track to meeting your monthly goals. If not, figure out what the team must do to get back on track. Budget approximately one hour and fifteen minutes for this meeting.Most business owners wait until the end of the month to determine whether results were positive. Your mid-month meeting provides timely insight as to whether your company is doing well so you can course-correct if needed.Employees despise most meetings because they are either irrelevant or boring. Conversely, employees usually enjoy these meetings because they have a voice and can shape your company's strategy and goals. As a result, their morale and performance increase dramatically.Related: Why Employees Need a Say in Your Business PlanningDave LavinskyDave Lavinsky is the co-founder of Growthink, a Los Angeles-based consulting firm that helps entrepreneurs identify and pursue new opportunities, develop business plans, raise capital and build growth strategies.

/article/226453,What Employee Stock Ownership Plans Mean For Entrepreneurs,Partial ownership of your business is one way to reward employees. A new bill proposed in Senate this week encourages such employee stock ownership plans. Here are the pros and cons for your business.,"Every small business owner will eventually need to think about a succession plan if they don't try to sell their company outright. This week, a bi-partisan supported bill was introduced in the Senate to encourage one option -- giving your employees partial ownership in your business over time with what's called employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs). The bill specifically intends to remove the barriers for S Corporations to establish ESOPs as well as provides S Corps with similar tax incentives to those offered to C Corporations. Small-business owners who are heavily invested in their companies may want to consider this option.What exactly is an ESOP?
Think of a 401(k) plan, except the funds employees are awarded are invested directly into a trust that acquires shares from the small-business owner over time. The employees will essentially be earning shares from their boss. Of course, there's more to it. The company generally benefits by making a tax-deductible contribution to the trust and the small-business owner can sell stock at a lower capital gains tax rate, as opposed to being subject to the higher ordinary income tax rate levied on profit withdrawals.Related: Some Small Businesses See Obamacare as Welcome ReliefShould you set up an ESOP?
This really depends on the company size, small-business owner and employees. For very small companies, setting up and maintaining an ESOP could be a very daunting task. The cost alone to hire ESOP specialists, valuation experts and attorneys can offset many of the benefits in the early years. There's also the big risk for valuation mistakes and the company not performing as well as another retirement account. On the other hand, an ESOP should be strongly considered for companies that have a long track record of success and high employee retention rates.What are the benefits of the plan?
It provides for a clear and tax friendly way for a small-business owner to realize the value they've created in their company. They also have the option to defer tax liability from the sale to later years by investing the proceeds in replacement property via a Section 1042 transaction. The other benefit, and in some cases the most important one for the small-business owner, is that it provides incentives for their employees to stay with the company and keep it going years after the owner retires.Related: To Boost Efficiency, Rethink Company CultureWhat are the drawbacks?
In theory, the ESOP makes a lot of sense to the small-business owner and their employees because of its succession incentive. But it's not all peaches and cream. Many small businesses are private companies that need to rely heavily on outside third parties to value the stock at various periods for marking to market the shares. It's extremely difficult and costly to do this and it can be very hurtful to the employees should the shares they purchase be overvalued.ESOP critics also question whether it is in employees' best interest to tie their entire retirement to the company's success. This is a valid point as it's important to have a fair amount of diversification in your retirement account and you wouldn't want to put all your eggs in one basket. If you're actively building other retirement accounts such as IRAs or Roth IRAs, that's a different story.What does the Obama Administration think about ESOPs?
There is also the risk of regulatory changes in the future. It's possible that this administration will work to eliminate many of the incentives for creating an ESOP plan as they've hinted with their latest proposal.If you happened to review President Obama's 2014 budget proposal, you would notice that ESOP provision IRC Section 404(k) was eliminated from the budget. By removing this section, the Obama administration is discouraging ESOP creation and operation as it specifically relates to large C Corporations. As mentioned previously, one of the benefits in ESOPs is that it allows companies to deduct the value of dividends paid on ESOP stock passed through to employees. This was never a benefit for S Corporations and other entities, so one can position that Obama is trying to penalize larger companies.In the end, you'll need to weigh the pluses and minuses for an ESOP plan as it specifically relates to your company and goals. Don't be afraid to ask your employees what they think about the plan.Related: Why Employees Need a Say in Your Business PlanningRyan HimmelRyan Himmel is a CPA and financial technology executive who has dedicated over a decade of his work toward providing solutions to help accountants and small-business owners better run their firms.

/article/226422,What 'Gang of Eight' Immigration Reform Would Mean for Entrepreneurs,A bipartisan group of Senators has established a blueprint to overhaul the immigration system.,"From a startup visa to mandatory ""e-verify,"" the immigration reform plan expected from Senate leaders addresses a number of matters critical to business owners.
The proposal will include a new merit-based visa option which would be available to especially talented individuals and a new W-Visa program, which would allow immigrants to move to the U.S. for lower-skilled work, according to a Congressional summary obtained by Entrepreneur.com.The bipartisan group of leading lawmakers, called the ""Gang of Eight,"" postponed the release of the bill in a show of respect to those injured in the bombings near the finish line of the Boston Marathon Monday.The compromise proposal is considered a significant step towards bipartisan reform, but it is also not likely to get past the Republican-controlled House of Representatives without significant rancor. Here is an outline of key measures that affect entrepreneurs and their employees.Related: How to 'Virtually' March on Washington for Immigration Reform1. A visa for foreign-born entrepreneurs who want to startup in the U.S.Technology and innovation leaders have been pushing for a way for foreign-born entrepreneurs to be able to stay in the U.S. to launch and grow their business. Canada, the U.K., Australia, Chile and Singapore already have such a visa and business leaders say that the U.S. is losing competitive startups by not having a similar option.2. A merit-based visa. 
Some entrepreneurs may benefit from the proposed merit-based visa, which could help keep especially talented employees in the U.S. The merit-based visa would not be available until the fifth year after the law is passed, according to the summary. These visas would be distributed to those who earn the most points in a system that rewards individuals based on education, employment, length of residence in the U.S., and other various metrics. To start with, 120,000 visas will be available based on merit and the number could increase by 5 percent per year if the allotment runs out in any year where the unemployment rate in the U.S. is less than 8.5 percent. The number of merit-based visas would max out at 250,000 visas.Related: Entrepreneurs Like Obama's Call for Tax Reform, Immigration Overhaul and Deficit Accord -- Minimum-Wage Hike, Not So Much3. Mandatory e-verify for all employers.
An e-verify program is an electronic employment verification system whereby employers have to check the immigration status of potential new employees before offering them a job. Some small-business advocacy groups, including the Main Street Alliance, oppose mandatory e-verification because it unduly burdens small-business owners who don't have the resources to handle the extra administrative requirement, they say.The proposed bill from the ""Gang of Eight"" would require that all employers use an e-verify system by the end of a five-year phase-in period, according to the summary. The gradual introduction of e-verify would hit larger employers first: those with more than 5,000 employees would be required to use an e-verification system within two years and businesses with over 500 workers would have three years.4. Raise the cap on the number of skilled-worker visas. 
Technology entrepreneurs in particular depend on having access to engineers to build their business. Startups struggle to staff their startups because of insufficient engineering talent in the U.S. Federally mandated caps on what is called an H-1B visa, which allow skilled workers to stay in the country, add to entrepreneurs' headaches. The ""Gang of Eight"" would increase the annual cap to 110,000 H-1B visas from the current 65,000 cap. The number of H-1B visas allowed would float by as many as 10,000 each year either up or down. The maximum allowed in any given year would be 180,000 and that cap would depend on demand for the visas and the employment situation in the U.S. at the time, as measured by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.One common objection to increasing the number of skilled workers allowed to enter the U.S. is that it will take jobs away from people already living in the U.S. To safeguard against this, those businesses that employ H-1B workers would have to pay ""significantly higher wages"" to the H-1B workers, the summary says.Related: Entrepreneurs Support a Pathway to Citizenship for Immigrants5. New visa program for lower-skilled workers. 
While Silicon Valley is powered by engineers, many entrepreneurs depend on low-skilled workers to run businesses like restaurants, lawn-care shops or garages. The ""Gang of Eight"" blueprint includes a new classification for these workers, called the W-Visa, which would allow a low-skilled worker to come to the U.S. to work for a registered employer in a job that would also have to be registered. The W-visa would be valid for three years initially, with the opportunity to extend if employment continues. A W-Visa-holding worker would be permitted to bring his or her spouse and children for the same allotted period. While there currently exists a visa option for business owners to bring unskilled workers into enter the U.S., known as the H-2B visa, the program is considered especially frustrating to small-business owners because of the red tape involved.What proposal would most impact your business?

/article/226346,Why Employees Need a Say in Your Business Planning,"When employees help set your company's goals, they'll be more committed to seeing them through. Here are some strategies to better engage employees in business planning.","The other day, I presented a webinar to hundreds of entrepreneurs on key organizational changes that boost profits. During the webinar, I asked the following question: Do you have a written list of the top five goals you need to accomplish this year to give your company the best chance of long-term success?The overwhelming majority responded ""no.""I followed up by asking if they believed having this written list would allow their businesses to grow more successfully. They unanimously agreed.This list of priorities is the basis for the business plan that successful companies develop each year. But sitting down and writing the business plan by yourself is not enough. You must involve your employees.Let me explain why. Research from Harvard Business School and the Balanced Scorecard Collaborative, now part of The Palladium Group based in Boston, found that 95 percent of a typical workforce doesn't understand its organization's strategy. Think about that for a minute. Ninety-five percent of your employees don't understand your strategy. If that's the case, how could they possibly perform at their peak? How could they possibly make the right decisions when doing their jobs? Clearly, they can't.Related: 5 Ways to Train Yourself to Be a Great LeaderThe solution to this disconnect is fairly straightforward. Get your employees' input in developing your business plan. When you do so, they will clearly understand your organization's strategy and goals. They will also become more productive. Because they helped develop your strategy and goals, they will be more motivated to help you achieve them.Here are four steps to involve your employees in the business planning process:1. Ask for their feedback. 
Ask each of your employees to identify the three things they think are working best and the three things that are least effective in your business. Brainstorm with them to figure out how your company can do more of what's working, and fix -- or simply stop doing -- what's not serving your business.2. Have them set goals for the business. 
Have your employees establish specific goals for each functional area of your business they are involved in. For example, within marketing, do they have specific goals for the number of leads generated during the year? Does your manufacturing staff have goals for the number of products produced?Related: Richard Branson on Building a Strong Reputation3. Build a plan off their ideas.
Develop the business plan using your employees' input. Once completed, have employees read the plan. Make sure they understand and agree with your strategy. Be open to modifying it if they don't.4. Meet and update your goals monthly. 
Annual goals are impossible to accomplish unless they are broken down into smaller goals. For example, an annual goal of acquiring 1,200 new customers is overwhelming. But when you break it down to 100 new customers per month or 25 new customers per week, it's more attainable.Set goals with your team each month so that when they are accomplished, your company is on track to meet yearly targets. As needed, revise your annual goals up or down based on monthly results.Great companies have a leader who involves employees in developing their strategy, plans and goals. Do this and your business with thrive.Related: How to Get Ahead by Being GenerousDave LavinskyDave Lavinsky is the co-founder of Growthink, a Los Angeles-based consulting firm that helps entrepreneurs identify and pursue new opportunities, develop business plans, raise capital and build growth strategies.

/article/226310,Health Care Is Now the Top Concern for Small Businesses,"For the first time in two years, health care trumps the economy as the biggest issue that small-business owners are worried about, according to a new report.","Small-business owners are fed up with the U.S. government when it comes to health-care reform, rising energy costs and taxes, according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's first-quarter survey of small businesses.The survey of 1,332 small-business executives, conducted by Harris Interactive in March, found that the majority of small businesses (79 percent) believe the U.S. economy is on the wrong track. A whopping 77 percent see higher energy prices as an immediate threat to their businesses, and 84 percent said regulations, restrictions and taxes negatively impact their ability to do business.The findings, released on April 4, largely mirror the sentiment of small-business owners over the last few quarters, who believe Washington policies continue to impede hiring and growth. Indeed, more than a quarter of small businesses who participated in the survey said they have lost employees in the last year.Related: Job Growth Slows Dramatically in March ""Though the general trends of the economy seem to be improving, a closer look shows full-time employment dropping,"" said Martin Regalia, the Chamber's chief economist, in a statement. ""Washington needs to enact policies that will breed confidence and encourage small businesses to expand, instead of cutting back staff and employees' hours.""What's more, requirements of the health-care law are now the biggest concern for small businesses, displacing economic uncertainty in the top spot for the first time in two years. The Affordable Care Act, known as ""Obamacare,"" was signed into law by President Obama in March 2010. Despite its aim to reduce health-care premiums for both individuals and small businesses, 77 percent of small-business owners polled believe the health-care law will make coverage for their employees more expensive, and 71 percent said the law makes it harder for them to hire more employees.Related: Tax Dilemmas Add to Burden of Healthcare Reform for Entrepreneurs Of particular concern to entrepreneurs is the mandate that companies with 50 or more workers must offer health-insurance coverage to employees or face substantial fines. In response to the mandate, the survey found that 32 percent of small businesses plan to reduce hiring, and 31 percent will cut back employee hours to reduce the number of full-time employees.On a brighter note, two-thirds of small-business owners surveyed believe immigration reform will help strengthen the U.S. economy and increase America's global competitiveness.

/article/226267,White House to Delay Health-Care Marketplace Options for Small Businesses,The Obama Administration has proposed a change in the deadline for states to have multiple health-insurance exchange options available for small-business owners.,"If you were looking forward to an easier way to shop for employee health-insurance plans, you may have to wait a bit longer.Last month, the Obama Administration requested that states be given more time to set up multiple options for health-insurance coverage, pushing deadlines back by one year, according to the Federal Register, the official newspaper of the federal government. In 2014, states would only have to offer small-business owners a single option on the exchange, giving them until 2015 to set up a model for providing employers multiple choices, the Federal Register says.As part of the Affordable Care Act passed by President Obama three years ago, each state which chooses to operate a health exchange is also mandated to offer a Small-Business Health Options Program, called a SHOP. In general, exchanges are marketplaces where individuals and business owners can compare, pick and buy health insurance. The SHOPs are where small-businesses owners can find insurance options for their employees. If a state does not want to run its own health insurance exchange, the federal government will step in and run the exchange in that state.Related: New York City to Require Employers to Give Paid Sick LeaveAs the New York Times first reported, the proposed rule change would allow states an extra year to get to the point of offering small-business owners multiple insurance options.  For transitional purposes we have proposed that in 2014, a SHOP may elect to have businesses choose one plan to offer employees, and in 2015 employees will be able to choose from the full range of plans in the Marketplace,  says Brian Cook, spokesperson for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in an email to Entrepreneur.com.States looking to set up their own exchanges say they are worried that they won t be able to meet the existing deadlines, according to the Federal Register. Employers, employees and brokers all need to be educated, and enrollment and accounting systems all need to be updated to participate in the exchanges.Last week, Rep. Sam Graves (R, Mo.), the Chairman of the House Committee on Small Business, sent a letter to the Administrator for the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services calling for additional information about the SHOP delays. Graves has voted more than once to repeal the law entirely. He requested a response to his inquiry by April 22.Related: Small-Business Owners Still Confused About Health-Care Reform If one of the key goals of supporters of the health care law was to provide small-business owners with a competitive process by which they could select from a number of affordable health insurance plans for their employees, then that goal is not in sight. In the meantime, it is likely that entrepreneurs will continue to experience the premium increases they have come to expect,  Graves wrote in the letter.Small-business owners are anxious about the implications of the health-care law and they are also still largely in the dark about what the primary components mean. In particular, there remains confusion about the health-care exchanges. Another largely misunderstood component of Obamacare is the employee mandate, which requires businesses with 50 or more full-time workers to health-insurance coverage for their employees.According to the employee mandate, if your business has more than 50 employees and you do not provide health insurance to them, then you have to pay an annual penalty starting at $2,000 per employee after 30 employees. If you have fewer than 50 employees, the health-insurance mandate does not apply to your business.Related: Business Owners Fed Up With Washington, But Many Are Optimistic on Their ProspectsAs a small-business owner, are you planning to provide your employees with health insurance or are you planning pay the penalty?

How can you get on the bus?The date for the event, called the March for Innovation, hasn't yet been set. But the timing is expected to coincide with the progress of immigration legislation in Congress, according to Jeremy Robbins, a policy advisor and special counsel for New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg. The plan is to simultaneously rush members of Congress with tweets, Facebook messages, phone calls and in-person meetings in Washington on a single day. Organizers partnered with Thunderclap, a tool that coordinates social-media efforts and sends out a unified message, flash-mob style.Related: Immigration Reform Proposals Hold Promise for Entrepreneurs Here's a list of suggestions for participating from the organizers:Sign up for updates on the homepage of the March for Innovation, an organizing site to gather supporters, which launched this week.Follow the movement on Twitter by searching the hashtag #iMarch or Tweet about it yourself.

/article/225975,Want to Harness the Power of the Crowd? Consider These Tips,Crowdsourcing is altering the way companies come up with innovative ideas and accomplish large and small tasks.,"Many hands make light work. Add to that the Internet, and the power of the crowd is changing the way people work and come up with ideas.Crowdsourcing involves getting many people to participate in performing a task or generating an idea. The rise in crowdsourcing over the past few years is shifting  where decisions are made, how they are made, how you engage intelligence, how you engage labor  and it is transforming the business landscape, says David Alan Grier, author of the forthcoming Crowdsourcing for Dummies (For Dummies, April 2013).  Basically, if you don t follow along, if you don t say there is something here that I might be able to use, you can very quickly find yourself in a place where your business is obsolete or not competitive."" Grier was speaking yesterday at Crowdopolis, a crowdsourcing conference in New York City.Related: Crowdopolis: Crowdsource Like the Big GuysIf you want to integrate crowdsourcing into your business, here are tips for success.1. Split tasks up into small chunks. If you are looking to crowdsource a project, break the work into bite-size, manageable parts, says David Bratvold, founder of Daily Crowdsource, a San Diego, Calif.-based website, which offers news, research and guidance on crowdsourcing to large corporations. The crowdsource philosophy is that it is more efficient to have each person do the small piece of a large project that he or she is best at than it is to have one person do an entire project from start to finish.2. Give participants instant gratification. People are motivated to work for rewards and recognition. Idea-generation platform IdeaScale gives out badges to members of a crowdsourcing community depending on how each person best contributes to the community, says IdeaScale co-founder Rob Hoehn. Embee Mobile, a San Francisco-based company that gathers intelligence from the crowd for consumer market-research firms, motivates its community of users to perform tasks or give opinions by giving out points that can be exchanged for money, says Eric Chan, the site's co-founder. In India or Bangladesh, Chan says, he can pay as little as 10 cents to motivate people to perform tasks, such as taking photos of their morning commute. In the U.S., he has to pay between 50 cents and a dollar for a similar service. Both Hoehn and Chan spoke at the crowdsourcing conference.Related: Quirky: The Solution to the Innovator's Dilemma3. Define your goals. Before you start a crowdsourcing project, articulate clearly what you intend to get out of the effort. A popular goal for IdeaScale clients lately is saving money, Hoehn says.4. Keep it simple. If what you are hoping to solicit from the crowd is consumer opinion, your research will be more valuable the larger your crowd. The way to get a large number of responses is to keep your request very quick and easy for consumers to respond to, says Chan. People are more willing to give their thoughts if the question doesn t make them work hard or think much, he says.5. Validate your users. To maintain the integrity of your crowdsourced feedback, check the members of your crowd and be sure you are not getting multiple responses from a single user, says Chan. The Embee Mobile crowd has 3.4 million community members and so effort goes into preventing fraud, such as fake profiles and spam from one source. In addition to checking user Facebook profiles, gender, age, location and phone numbers, Embee Mobile has built in fraud-detection software.Related: Crowdfunders Step Up Lobbying for SEC RulesIf you have already implemented crowdsourcing in your business, what is your biggest recommendation for fellow entrepreneurs?

/article/225450,How to Hire an IT Professional,What questions to ask to make sure your full-time IT hire knows his or her stuff.,"						This story appears in the February 2013 issue of Entrepreneur. Subscribe  Ilustration  Jason LeeQ: How do I make sure my full-time IT hire knows his or her stuff?A: From your question, I assume that the days of enlisting everyone to jump in and help each other figure out hardware and software issues, from setting up a network to hooking up the printer, has become a waste of time. Or maybe your system crashed and you discovered that your IT contractor, the one who set up your business and knows it inside and out, is on vacation.Whatever the case, there comes a day when a full-time IT staffer is no longer a luxury but a necessity. That day arrives for the average tech company upon reaching 20 employees, according to Spiceworks, a small-business IT management platform with clients worldwide. Nontech businesses can usually wait until they cross the 70-employee threshold.So how do you know whether the IT candidate who answered your want ad is up to the task? We asked Nathan Brown, senior director of IT and production operations for Waltham, Mass.-based Care.com, which connects consumers with care providers, to detail his own selection process.What kind of tests should IT candidates take?
I conclude IT interviews by having potential hires set up what will ultimately become their own computers. I'll ask them to install and configure software from scratch, and to do it as if they were setting up a standard configuration for the company. This exercise allows me to assess an applicant's ability to think long-term and big-picture, because I want my IT staff to think beyond the technology and focus on supportability, licensing and future needs of the company. If they come back to me with suggestions for improvements, updates, etc., I know they're worth a second look.What specifics should I look for in my first IT hire?
I don't focus too much on certification; hands-on experience is more important. In particular, look for someone who understands and has worked on servers, switches, routers, firewalls and virtualization technology (where the same PC supports two completely separate users/files/programs, among other aspects). Ask your applicant what computer they have at home. If they say ""Dell"" and don't go into the processor, memory and operating system, they're not the geek you want.Finally, look for someone with experience who started with desktop support and worked his or her way into networking and system administration. Understanding the support side of IT makes for a better infrastructure person. I also like to see diversity in knowledge of operating systems and hardware (i.e., Windows, Mac, Linux), as this demonstrates a broader knowledge, openness and--this is important--a general love for technology.What about the nontechnical side of the equation?
So much of IT is customer service and relationship building. Your first IT hire needs to be someone who can be a real geek one moment and then go talk to the CEO the next and explain complex technical issues in a way that allows the CEO to make the right decisions.If there's anything about the person that makes you question his or her ability to get along with all types of personalities, don't hire them.Mikal E.

/answer/225794,How Can I Keep Employees From Texting Too Much?,,"Years ago, this question was about how to control use of company phone systems and company time on personal phone calls. Sounds like eons ago, doesn t it? However, the rules for managing excessive texting or other personal use of cell phones during work hours are basically the same.
A well-crafted company (or departmental) policy needs to be promulgated and then enforced. The key will be consistent enforcement. If someone violates the policy, he or she should be disciplined as employees are for other policy infractions (e.g., verbal warning, written warning, final warning, termination).An effective way to reinforce this policy -- assuming that use of cell phones is a significant problem -- is to include in the policy that at the written or final warning step of the disciplinary process -- whichever the employer prefers -- the employee will be required to surrender his cell phone during working hours.Of course, as always, do not put forth any policy that you do not intend to enforce uniformly. Doing that only erodes respect for management. Here is a sample policy:Personal Use of Cell Phones, Computers, and PDAs at Work
While at work, employees are expected to refrain from excessive personal use of cellular phones, computers and PDAs. Personal calls, personal instant messaging, personal text messaging or tweeting during the work day -- regardless of whether the equipment used is company-provided or not -- interferes with employee productivity and is distracting to others. Employees are at work essentially to provide value to the company. They are expected to limit personal interactions during work time and make personal calls and/or send personal text messages, tweets or instant messages on non-work time and to ensure that friends and family members are aware of this company policy. The company is not liable for the loss of personal cellular phones, PDAs or other personal electronic equipment brought into the workplace.Penny MoreyPenny is a seasoned human resources executive and consultant with over 25 years of diverse business experience in advising enterprise leaders on employment-related matters.Read more",Growth Strategies,2013-02-15 11:38:13

/article/224935,How to Attract Top Candidates Without Posting to Job Boards,Everyone else is flocking online to find new employees. Here are five ways you can uncover superstar job candidates without visiting a single site.,"In his book The Roadmap to Freedom, peak performance expert Chris McIntyre describes how to build a core team of superstars that will help you lead your company to the next level. In this edited excerpt, the author details the five ways you can uncover superstar candidates offline.Yes, social media can connect you with potential superstars. But don t forget about the face-to-face approach either. Here are a few ways you can find superstar talent offline.1. Make Superstars Look for You
Getting noticed by the best happens more when you re the best. Imagine what life would be like if superstar employees were begging to work for you. If they re not, I challenge you to figure out why. Here are some questions that might help:Do superstars seek us out? Why? Why not?What is it about working here that differentiates us from our competition?What indicators do we consistently reference to keep tabs on our reputation?How might those indicators be changing (i.e., social media)?What are a couple of reasons a superstar would not choose us other than salary?What can we do about it?Being the best means you re less likely to have to battle with the mass of mediocre competitors out there. The value of clarifying why you re not currently the best in the minds of superstars could highlight a competitive advantage your competition currently has on you. You may want to plug that hole.Related: How to Hire the Right Employees for Your Startup2. Two Degrees of Separation
In 1929, the Hungarian poet Frigyes Karinthy suggested you could access anyone on the planet through leveraging no more than six different people; this became popularly known as  six degrees of separation.  I d bet the right kind of talent for your business is less than two degrees of separation from you right now. In other words, someone you know knows someone you might want to hire.How many contacts do you currently have in your contact list? If you re one of those small-business owners with hundreds -- or even thousands -- of contacts, I guarantee all your staffing needs are sitting right under your nose.Don t be afraid to network in-house, too. Most superstars know other superstars. Chances are, they can connect you to a new addition they would be willing to work with. Even if you re not ready to hire, it may be useful to have lists of possible hires standing by.Related: 5 Best Places to Find Qualified Talent3. Overbook Like the Airlines
Phil Coady, CEO of software development company Microgroove, said he likens the superstar hiring process to  overbooking like the airlines do.  Why not find talent before you need to? Attend trade shows and loiter around the halls of professional organizations and forums within your industry. You might also check in with vendors, suppliers, and other contacts associated with your craft.By periodically cycling through your contacts, you ll be able to stay connected to the talent pool and find yourself less frequently in a hiring rut without options. You may want to check in with one or two contacts every month. Maybe one month you could check in with a few vendors, just to say hello. The following month, you might communicate with a few key suppliers. The goal is to keep potential leads warm in case you ever need to find a new superstar.4. Always Hiring WOW ers
Steven Jones, CEO of Jones and Associates Consulting, a diversity consulting firm, suggested:One of our criteria for hiring people is when they walk into a room, the response of people is  Wow . . . I want to listen to that person.  Those folks have flexibility, humility, and their egos in check. They ve got the talent. They have the intellectual rigor and communication skills to take complicated issues and present them in a way that moves people to action.Have you ever met someone who made you say  Wow   she was great!  Maybe you received exceptional service in a restaurant or at a hotel. Or perhaps you heard an outstanding speech. You might even have seen someone hand a stranger back his dropped wallet or give up his seat on the subway to someone. Notice these people, and add them to your contact list.5. Dig Up Rough Diamonds and Pre-Credentialed Superstars
You should regard a down economy as an ideal time to find cheap diamonds. Part of the value of economic turmoil and high unemployment is that superstar talent can be purchased for minimal cost. People get laid off from jobs they ve had for decades. Many of those folks never needed degrees and now find themselves stuck because they don t have formal credentials. Those highly skilled folks are diamonds in the rough.Similarly, don t be afraid to take a risk on the pre-credentialed crowd -- someone without the latest degree or certification. Maybe they lack certain technical skills but have ""wow"" people skills. Hire for the wow, and be flexible enough to teach the how.The pre-credentialed pool offers the biggest bang for your buck. These are the superstars who will shine soon regardless of where they land, so you may as well get them before your competition does.

/article/224929,How to Hire Superstar Employees,Making sure you hire the best employees -- and the right employees -- for your business isn't a matter of luck. Here are six steps you should take to guarantee you'll land superstar talent.,"In his book The Roadmap to Freedom, peak performance expert Chris McIntyre describes how to build a core team of superstars that will help you lead your company to the next level. In this edited excerpt, the author describes his six-step process for finding, hiring and keeping superstar employees.How solid is your current hiring process? One of the best ways to get the right talent on board is to have a trusted hiring process in place. Here's a six-step process you can adopt as is or tailor to meet your needs.Step 1: Define the Knowledge, Skills, and PEAs (People Skills, Work Ethics, and Attitudes)
You probably have a good sense of the hard objectives you expect your applicants to achieve, such as a certain percent increase in sales, a certain number of products produced per month, or manage x number of people in accomplishing y tasks. Every successful small business should have its basic business metrics and key measures.You'll also need to have a strong sense of the critical soft skills you expect from employees. Getting the best out of your superstars means expecting and measuring all critical success factors. By knowing all the necessary elements for success in a particular position, you can draft the position description.Related: Tips for Hiring the Best EmployeesStep 2: Require a Strategic Cover Letter
When you publicize your description of the position, request a cover letter that requires candidates to research your company. Ask two or three open-ended questions that would require candidates to dig into your website or otherwise research your organization.Here are a few examples of good, strategic cover letter questions:How do you see yourself relating to our core values? Why?What is it about our history that you most identify with? Why?Which of our products are you most excited about? Why? Unlike a resume, a strategic cover letter addresses questions specific to your organization. A strategic cover letter can weed out 30 percent of the potential candidates who just won't invest the extra effort to respond. Of those who do respond, 30 to 40 percent will probably disqualify themselves with incorrect grammar and poor attention to detail, such as not answering your strategic questions. That could leave you with only the top 30 percent to consider for the next phase of your job hunt.Step 3: Assemble a Hiring Panel
What if you happen to be a CEO who doesn't have access to a panel of superstars? You might consider asking a few of your most trusted vendors, suppliers and contractors for their confidential assistance in your hiring process. I've also seen small-business owners contract with management consulting companies for their temporary and confidential assistance with their hiring process.You might also try a staffing agency. Some staffing agencies can actually serve as a panel in your hiring process. Good agencies can offer expert interviewers and help you focus your position description, PEAs and cover letter questions.Step 4: Dig Into the Resumes
Divvy up the remaining resumes along with your requirements for the position. Have the panel members take a week or so to pick their top five preferences and prepare a blurb or two on why they chose their candidates.Be sure your panel defines the ""why"" as well. That can help crystallize position requirements and clues about your culture. Then get the panel back together to review the blurbs and tally the votes for all potential hires. Hash out some kind of consensus on the top few candidates to bring in for an interview. Related: A Lie-Detector Test for ResumesStep 5: Win the Interview
Rally the panel and conduct the interviews. Agree in advance which questions will be asked of all interviewees, and stick firmly to them. Straying from your pre-determined questions can skew the dynamics of each interview.Immediately after each interview, have panel members take the time individually to record their thoughts and numerically rate each interviewee. If you or the panel members run right off to the next activity without accomplishing this, you'll likely forget noteworthy subtleties that might have been the difference maker.Reconvene the panel immediately after everyone has had some time for individual assessments, and combine comments and ratings on a scorecard. Scorecards can help you split hairs in competitive hiring situations. Related: Avoid These Interview MistakesStep 6: 90-Day Check-In
Check in with your new hire after 90 days of employment specifically about their overall new-hire experience. That's usually enough time for you to have a good sense of an employee's overall capability and work ethic and offer feedback directly related to all the key skills you hired them to deliver. Pull out the job description, and offer specific examples of how they are hitting the right target -- or missing it, as the case may be.Be sure to ask how you can better support the employee in doing their job. Ask for feedback on their initial experiences and on your functional processes. There's nobody better to help you see your process inefficiencies than qualified new folks, so take advantage of their fresh perspectives about your organization. They may have great feedback on needlessly complicated internal and external processes.This article is an excerpt from Roadmap to Freedom, available from Entrepreneur Press.

It also links to other tools, including an interactive map, where you can find out information specific to your state, and a glossary of health-care-related terms.The SBA's blog, called Health Care Business Pulse, will have tips and advice about the implementation of Obamacare.

For example, if you have fewer than the equivalent of 25 full-time employees, pay average annual wages below $50,000, and contribute 50 percent or more toward your employee health-insurance premiums, you are eligible for a tax credit worth up to 35 percent of what you are spending on those premiums.

/answer/225567,How Can I Hire Exceptional Individuals?,,"First of all, good job specifications are needed. You may have all the information in your head, but the real challenge is to clearly convey not only what the job is (its purpose and major responsibilities) but what are the qualifications that enable someone to do the job well.
Qualifications should include education, experience and knowledge; skills and abilities; and traits and characteristics. You can use something like the Predictive Index to spur your thoughts on the last item -- which may be the most important one. Personal traits and characteristics are often the most important aspect of an individual who being considered for hire. But in order to find the people with the right characteristics, you must first identify what is most desirable. Having hired one star already, you might want to study what personality characteristics he has that make him so outstanding as an employee. Is he highly intelligent, self-motivated, conscientious, forthright, outgoing?
Not every job will require the same exact traits any more than every job requires the same education, experience and knowledge. However, there may be a common ""profile"" that appeals to you for every member of your team. Do your best to determine what that profile might be and then hire people that fit that profile -- even if they fall a little short on your ideal benchmark for education, experience and knowledge or skills and abilities. That is your gut trying to tell you what is most important to you.Using behavioral assessments can work well. Not all are created equal. Find one that is validated, that measures the personality traits that are important to you. Then, if you take the assessment and understand your profile in key areas that relate to your passion for the business, you should be able to find people whose mindsets are similar -- not identical, perhaps, but close enough on the important traits to make them good fits for your company team.Penny MoreyPenny is a seasoned human resources executive and consultant with over 25 years of diverse business experience in advising enterprise leaders on employment-related matters.Read more",Growth Strategies,2013-01-23 10:05:00
/answer/225568,Do I Owe Subcontractors Health Insurance?,,"Your friend is wrong on both counts. One of the benefits of working for yourself is the independence you gain to work as you please. But because you are not an employee, no one owes you anything. Not even health care. That s one of the reasons that corporations like to hire independent contractors -- precisely because they DON T have all of the financial, tax and benefits obligations that they do for their employees. Flip that coin over, and the same rules apply. If you are doing the hiring and you hire other independent providers, you do not need to provide them with health insurance, or any other benefits for that matter.
Here s where you need to be careful: You must be absolutely clear that you are hiring an independent business owner/independent company as your subcontractor. One way you can gauge the ""independence"" of a subcontractor is by whether they have other clients (and are not moonlighting from their current job, or ""in transition""). Otherwise, you could be deemed to have hired a part-time employee instead of an independent contractor, which can send you ""down the rabbit hole."" If the state unemployment, disability, or workers' compensation authorities see that you ve hired a part-time employee without having the proper employee insurances in place, you can get hit with penalties and interest.Nina KaufmanNina L.

/answer/225516,How Do You Find Employees With the Right Mindset?,,"First of all, as an entrepreneur, you need to understand that just about no one will ever care about your business as much as you do. That does not mean that everyone else is unenthusiastic or watching the clock. But, as you stated, ""my company is my pride and joy."" The key word being ""my.""  It is like your baby. You see its beauty in a unique light, which makes perfect sense.
There are two things you should be seeking. One is skills. You want to hire people who have the skills you need to complement what you bring to the company. Skills are fairly easy to assess, of course, and very important. As a startup founder, you need to find skilled people to do things that you either do not know how to do or dislike doing.
The other thing you want is to hire people who share the characteristics and personality traits that you value most highly. Behavioral assessment tests can work well to identify these hires. Not all such tests are created equal. Find one that is validated, for example, that measures the personality traits that are important to you. Then, if you take the assessment and understand your profile in key areas that relate to your passion for the business, you should be able to find people whose mindsets are similar -- not identical, perhaps, but close enough on the important traits to make them good fits for your company team.Penny MoreyPenny is a seasoned human resources executive and consultant with over 25 years of diverse business experience in advising enterprise leaders on employment-related matters.Read more",Growth Strategies,2013-01-15 09:00:00
/article/224925,How to Start Off New Employees on the Right Foot,"Don't just hire a great job candidate and ignore them. Instead, find out why getting them to offer three very specific updates after their first 30 days can help them thrive.","In his book The Roadmap to Freedom, peak performance expert Chris McIntyre describes how to build a core team of superstars that will help you lead your company to the next level. In this edited excerpt, the author explains what kind of feedback you need from your employees after 30 days to help them succeed.Performance management conversations often get hurt by lack of focus. How can you ensure your 30-day check-ins are optimally focused? There are three statements your superstar can make to guarantee you hit the feedback bull's-eye.Related: Five Steps for Giving Productive FeedbackCheck-In Statement 1: Here's What's Not Green and Why One of my favorite approaches for receiving status updates is the simple stoplight approach:Red = Stop: On hold, not currently moving forwardYellow = Caution: There could be an issue hereGreen = Go: Everything is fine and on trackThe stoplight approach is useful for keeping your 30-day check-ins highly focused. When it comes to obstacles, you must first expect your team to identify them by clarifying what's not moving forward appropriately -- and why.The why part of this question is pretty straightforward, but let's touch on the principle behind it. You probably hate to hear ""I don't know why it's broke, boss"" from someone who's clearly trying to duck ownership of an issue. Now, if the answer was ""I don't know why yet, but I'm trying to figure it out,"" that's a different story. The principle is that your superstars should never feel comfortable bringing you a problem without also bringing you a reason why the problem is occurring.Check-In Statement 2: Here's What I'm Doing About ItThe ""Here's what I'm doing about it"" response may seem obvious, but there's a more strategic function at play. Too many small-business owners set themselves up as being the primary solution provider. That traditional top-down leadership approach can be a roadblock to long-term freedom and limits the growth, creativity and accountability of your team. The ""What I'm doing about it"" approach expects superstar ownership and minimizes the potential for consistently saying ""What do you think, boss?""The ""Here's what I'm doing about it"" approach isn't meant to give your glory hounds another chance to brag about the work they do. It's to ensure your team isn't in the habit of pushing tough decisions up the chain.While the yellow and the red areas are critical to discuss during your check-ins, be sure not to focus solely on them. Reporting on the green areas gives your superstars a chance to shine and allows you some good news along with the never-ending challenges.  Related: Seven Steps to Coaching Your Employees to SuccessCheck-In Statement 3: Here's Where I Need Your HelpThe first two check-in statements are all about expecting your superstars to own the issues related to their performance. There's still one final, laser-focused statement for them to answer, but this one is about you: What can you do for them? Without fail, one of the questions the best leaders consistently ask is ""Where do you need my help?""Expect your superstars to directly ask:Could you start _____________ so I can_____________________?
Could you stop ______________ so I can _____________________?
Could you continue ___________ so I can _____________________?Start: Hey, boss, could you start delegating more of the cable business services work so I can develop a better relationship with their sales team?""In the above, you're encouraging very direct language for a reason. Encouraging direct language creates trust and improves communication. By expecting superstars to speak up about their needs, you empower accountability. By linking their requests to the business case, you're asking them to demonstrate that they understand the impact of their actions on the goals.Stop: Hey, boss, could you stop dropping off last-minute noncritical tasks, like updating the database, so I can focus on more important work like the Canadian proposal?One of the biggest gaps in leadership today occurs because small-business owners often fail to ask the most important question of all: Tell me what I need to stop doing to help you better accomplish your objectives. How empowering. How ego-free. How necessary. It's very possible that you are doing things you think are useful that may not be. Ask. Listen. Stop.Continue: Hey, boss, I'd love for you to continue letting me run the staff meetings, so I can establish myself more as a leader on the team.Related: How to Foster a Feedback-Friendly CompanyLastly, ask what is something you are doing that is working for them. By encouraging answers to that question directly, you can confirm what things you're doing that work for each superstar. This is important for you to know, not guess about.Hitting the bull's-eye with each of your superstars by consistently responding to these three statements will add substantial focus to your feedback sessions. It will also help everyone become more fully engaged. Be honest when responding to feedback, and always link your own answers to a business outcome. Make sure your superstars know you're not dismissing their inputs, even if you can't act on them. If your team genuinely feels heard, they will usually respect your choices.This article is an excerpt from Roadmap to Freedom, available from Entrepreneur Press.

/article/224513,"Obama, Romney Battle Over Immigration","It's a hot-button issue, and the Democrat and Republican candidates divide on the topic of illegal workers. The two come closer over foreign-born entrepreneurs.","image credit: ShutterstockEditor's Note: This 10-part series looks at issues critical to entrepreneurs this election season. Read installments on the economy, taxes, health care, capital, government contracting, net neutrality, the SBA and regulation. Small-business owners often depend on immigrant labor to run their companies, and many foreign-born entrepreneurs want to launch businesses here. That makes national immigration policy a prime concern for business owners in the coming election.It's also a charged and divisive political issue. When the unemployment rate is high, many Americans see immigrants as a threat to their ability to find a job. Of the 38 million immigrants in this country, almost one third are here illegally, according to the Brookings Institution, a nonpartisan Washington, D.C.-based think tank.When it comes to immigration, President Barack Obama and former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney divide over certain issues pertaining to workers, but converge over some policies related to foreign-born entrepreneurs.For instance, Obama recently pushed through an executive order that allows young undocumented immigrants to receive work permits   an order hailed by some business groups as protecting businesses that employ them. The action is a temporary stop-gap measure in lieu of a more permanent fix, called the DREAM Act, which Senate Republicans blocked. That, and other steps the president has taken, appears to have given the president a dominant lead among Hispanic voters, according to a USA Today/Gallup poll.Related: Entrepreneur Becomes Lightning Rod in 'We Built It' DebateRomney, in contrast, has suggested that immigration laws need to be improved and wants to toughen enforcement measure so that illegal immigrants are forced to leave the country, a process he calls ""self deportation."" Both he and Obama support using an e-verification system to identify workers as legal, which business groups say places too much of the burden on employers. ""If employers hire someone without a card, or without checking to see if it's been counterfeited, then those employers would be severely sanctioned,"" Romney said during a debate in January.Meanwhile, the candidates take more similar stances when it comes to foreign-born entrepreneurs. Both have called for changes to the EB-5 Visa program, which was enacted by Congress in 1990 to allow immigrant entrepreneurs to enter the U.S., provided they make investments and create or save at least 10 full time jobs within two years. In recent years, the EB-5 visa program has come under scrutiny for being abused: pseudo-entrepreneurs gain access to visas with shell business investments that either don't exist or fail miserably. Here is a look at where Obama and Romney stand on the immigration issues that affect entrepreneurship most directly: President Barack ObamaOne of the President's objectives is to encourage highly skilled immigrant entrepreneurs to enter the country. Innovation-leading companies like Intel, Google, Yahoo and eBay all have immigrant founders. The U.S. Department of Citizen and Immigrant Services is in the midst of an effort to improve the efficiency of the EB-5 immigrant entrepreneur application process. The agency has already committed to making changes to the program, and has proposed accelerating the processing for shovel-ready job-creating projects and convening specialized regional application review boards.Related: Democrats Nod to Entrepreneurs, Focus on WorkersAccording to Obama's Immigration Blueprint, a layout of his plans related to immigration policy, the administration supports the Startup Visa Act, which would grant visas to foreign entrepreneurs whose startups get investment from qualified U.S. investors. Further, those startups that create jobs and generate revenue would be able to apply for a permanent green card. The Startup Visa Act was proposed in both 2010 and 2011 in both the House of Representatives and the Senate but has not been passed. While Obama enjoys support among the Hispanic community, he has gotten some heat from the sector for not being able to pass comprehensive immigration reform, as he promised he would in back 2008. In an interview on Spanish-language network Univision last week, Obama called his broken promise his ""biggest failure.""Former Massachusetts Gov. RomneyWhile Obama and the Romney tend to go head to head over most issues, when it comes to bringing smart innovators and foreign-born entrepreneurs into this country, their viewpoints are similar: Let more of them in.In particular, Romney says he will ask Congress to raise the caps on the number of visas given out to highly skilled immigrants, both nationally and country by country. Also, Romney says that any foreign-born student that gets a math, science or engineering degree from a U.S. university should be given permanent residency. Related: Republicans Spotlight Entrepreneurs at ConventionWhen it comes to allowing immigrant laborers to come into the country temporarily for seasonal jobs, Romney, like Obama, wants to streamline the H-2B visa process. Many seasonal or agricultural business owners say H-2B visa workers are the lifeblood of their operations, but that sponsoring them is currently a regulatory nightmare.While Romney supports bringing skilled, talented and entrepreneurial immigrants into the country, he holds a hard-line stance against illegal immigration, including building a high-tech fence on the border with Mexico. The stance has hurt his stance with Hispanic voters, an important voting bloc when it comes to immigration, many polls suggest.What immigration policy affects you the most?

Here's what to do if you feel like you're watching your money go down the drain.,"Free Webinar | August 16thFind out how to optimize your website to give your customers experiences that will have the biggest ROI for your business.							Register Now  image credit: ShutterstockEntrepreneurs can be so enthusiastic about sailing toward the goal in front of them that they forget to take the time to be sure their ship isn t leaking. It s worth taking the time to check your hulls and see if you aren t missing an opportunity to save money.Every six months, small-business owners should do a review of their business plan, looking in every nook and cranny for hidden savings, says Deborah Sweeney, chief executive of online document-filing service MyCorporation. Twice a year, she has her top managers each come up with two ideas for cost-cutting, as well as two ideas for revenue generation.""Some of the [costs] that business owners don t think about are those expenses they pay daily,"" says Sweeney, whose Calabasis, Calif.-based company has 47 employees. After considering all the ideas her team comes up with, Sweeney decides which ideas are the most viable and prioritizes them. ""We say:  Which are the most important? Which can have the best impact on our business? And, which can we actually do in a relatively short period of time?' ""Related: 3 Belt-Tightening Mistakes to AvoidIf you are going to renegotiate rates with service providers, it can be tempting to put down an ultimatum: Give me better rates or I will hit the highway. But, often, that sort of tone will be met with resistance, says Sweeney. She recommends being team-oriented to get more productive results. ""Rather than come out with this negative approach, I say,  Look at all the great things we are doing as a team,' "" she says. It s not just polite, it s practical, too. Often, it is expensive and frustrating to have to switch your contract over to another provider.Here is Sweeney's list of the five hottest areas for cost-cutting opportunities:1. Shipping. Especially if you are a retail business that does a lot of shipping, you may be able to negotiate with FedEx or UPS for a lower rate. Generally, as the volume of goods that you ship increases, you gain leverage to bargain for a lower rate.2. Credit-card processing. Taking a close look at how much you are paying for your customer s credit cards to be processed each month is often worthwhile, says Sweeney. When you are just launching a business for the first time, it s very likely that you do not know how much is too much to pay for credit-card processing services. It s more than likely that you end up overpaying. With a bit of payment history under your belt to prove that you are a low-risk customer to the processors, you will likely be able to negotiate better rates.Related: 5 Questions You Must Ask Your Credit Card Processor3. Insurance costs. From business insurance to health insurance for you and your employees, it s important to review what you are spending on insurance to see whether what you are paying is appropriate and to be sure you are still buying the right kinds of insurance. ""Every year, I fill out my [insurance] forms. But I also have a call with my insurance providers,"" says Sweeney. ""Over time you can learn what kind of coverage that you are likely to need and what will be overkill for your business.""4. Overstaffing. While it can be one of the toughest areas of your business to consider trimming, it can also be one of the most important, particularly in a small business where each employee is so critical to the performance of the whole operation. ""Being a smart business person is evaluating whether you have the right people on your boat and whether they are all rowing in the same direction,"" says Sweeney.5. Marketing costs. Make sure that you are really getting a measurable return on your marketing investments. It can be easy to find yourself throwing money at the same marketing strategy month after month, rather than thinking critically and creatively about how to attract new customers. But, says Sweeney, if that marketing investment is not paying off, be honest about it and move on.Related: The Fiscal Cliff: 3 Tax Changes You Need to Know Are ComingWhere have you found potential savings lurking unexpectedly in your business budget?

/article/228836,How to Handle Problem Employees -- And Fire Them if Needed,No one envy's an entrepreneur when it's time to let problem employees go. Here's how to make the process as smooth as possible. ,"Your toughest job as an entrepreneur may well be letting someone know they're no longer part of your organization. Unlike laying people off -- which can obviously be painful -- when you fire someone, you are telling that person he or she has failed as an employee and you see no potential for redemption.Because this process is so hard, one of the biggest mistakes many entrepreneurs make is keeping someone on the payroll too long. Frankly, no entrepreneur -- let alone those just starting up -- can afford to do that. Unsatisfactory staffers can muddle your processes, offend your customers and make mistakes that are costlier than their salaries.Here's how to avoid letting problems escalate -- and, if need be, ensure that you're firing someone for the right reasons.Provide corrective feedback. When you perceive problems with an employee, it s easy to let them go unchecked. But if you don t address the specific behavior and explain your expectations nothing will change. Handle problems immediately, in private and with specific examples. Be sure to define the expected behavior changes. Be willing to listen to explanations, but don t tolerate excuses.Related: 5 Ways to Win the Hearts of EmployeesPay attention. Check up on problems regularly -- praising where you see improvement and providing corrective feedback when needed. Make sure your employee understands and has the skills needed to handle the requested improvements. You may want to ask another employee to mentor the problem person and give you feedback on whether or not the behavior changes are happening.Follow up. If there are no changes in the problem behavior, readdress the problem issues -- making sure to lay out the changes you expect to see. Be specific and give behavioral examples of both the inappropriate behavior and the corrections needed. Put everything in writing and give a deadline for the changes. Let your employee know that unsatisfactory behavior could lead to termination.Related: 8 Tips for Finding Focus and Nixing DistractionsFollow up again. Give one more warning if the behavior hasn t improved. Walk through the expectations again, one at a time. Ask to make sure your employee understands both the expectations and the deficiencies. Make it clear that a failure to improve will result in termination. Set this warning in writing also.Get ready to act. Have the employee s last paycheck and any severance pay out ready. Have a termination letter ready for your employee to use at the unemployment office. If possible, arrange for the termination at the end of the day so that other employees are gone. If this employee has access to confidential information, you may want to have another employee -- not a security escort, which could be disconcerting for remaining employees -- help this person gather his personal belongings. Make sure to have several boxes ready for this process. Finally, collect all keys or access cards, and plan to change any common passwords immediately after the employee leaves the building.Letting go. Once you ve decided to terminate someone, you don t owe them an explanation. Most people will ask for one, but it s really an attempt to change your mind. Any employee who reaches this point knows exactly why they re being fired. Make it simple and straightforward. Tell your employee they have been terminated, hand them the letter and, if necessary, a box of tissues. If you have a human resources staffer, have that person handle all the details such as the termination process, the final check and helping them pack.Related: Managing Older Workers? Be the BossSome people will cry, some will plead, some will yell and some may even threaten violence. Your best option to minimize this behavior is to provide absolutely no explanations. If you don t engage, the ex-employee has nothing to fight against. No matter what they say, this is not a surprise.Give yourself a break. Firing someone, no matter how deserved, is terribly hard. Understand that and give yourself a chance to recover. Take some time before driving, meeting with anyone or making any important decisions. Dinner out with friends or family may be a good idea.

/article/223976,Small Business Strategies for Managing Rising Health-Care Costs,"Ballooning premiums and shifting government regulations can make dealing with employee health insurance a nightmare, here's how to cope.","						This story appears in the August 2012 issue of Entrepreneur. Subscribe  Thanks to the congressional debate over healthcare reform and the upcoming presidential election, the future of health benefits for small businesses is uncertain. Experts predict that a verdict won't be clear until the latter half of 2013.But you can't afford to put things on hold until then. Health insurance costs continue to snowball. In 2011, the average annual premium for an employer-sponsored health plan was $5,429 per worker--an 8 percent increase over 2010, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation's 2011 Employer Health Benefits Survey. To compensate, more small businesses are passing these costs on to their employees.That's what Kenneth Wisnefski, CEO of WebiMax, a rapidly growing internet marketing business, has done. The Mount Laurel, N.J.-based company saw revenue jump from $2 million in 2010 to $10 million in 2011, while head count expanded from 58 to 150. Wisnefski expected that the larger staff would lead to a company discount on healthcare premiums. Instead, just the opposite happened: WebiMax's premiums for the same plan rose by nearly 12 percent, an expense that was not sustainable.Healthcare coverage is on the decline among small businesses: 59 percent of companies offered health benefits in 2011, down from 68 percent in 2010.Although he hated to do it, in December 2011 Wisnefski stopped fully subsidizing his employees' healthcare premiums, a benefit he'd offered since he founded the company in 2008. Today WebiMax employees contribute roughly $100 per month toward their own healthcare coverage. For employees with family coverage, the monthly contribution is approximately $150.""We would love to have them not pay for it at all,"" Wisnefski says, adding that he feels fortunate to be able to offer any subsidy. ""In this competitive environment, it is a small price to pay.""At small companies of three to 199 workers, employees contribute an average of 15 percent of their health insurance premiums, according to the Kaiser survey. For family coverage, that figure jumps to 36 percent.Embracing Higher Deductibles
Of course, passing the price of soaring premiums on to employees isn't the only option. A big trend is toward consumer-directed health plans (CDHP), primarily because they're more affordable, according to Mike Sullivan, executive vice president and chief marketing officer of Atlanta-based Digital Insurance, an employee benefits agency specializing in small and midsize businesses. CDHPs are ""the big industry buzzword for higher out-of-pocket expense plans,"" he says.A CDHP often consists of a health plan with a high annual deductible of $1,000 or more and a healthcare savings fund that an employee can use to pay permissible medical expenses. Small businesses are flocking to these plans like workers to the espresso machine. Last year, 23 percent of employees at small firms offering healthcare coverage were enrolled in a high-deductible plan with a savings option, according to Kaiser's 2011 survey. At firms of 200 or more workers, that number was just 15 percent.Jeffrey Ingalls, president of the Stratford Financial Group, an employee benefits firm in Wayne, N.J., switched his 20-person staff to a high-deductible health plan in 2008. By taking on more of the insurance risk, he has been able to cut the company's health insurance premiums in half.That doesn't mean Ingalls skimps on healthcare coverage. To pay out-of-pocket costs, each employee on the plan has a Health Reimbursement Account (HRA), which the company fully funds, providing $2,500 for individuals and $5,000 for families. Over the past four years, the company has typically paid 45 to 50 percent of all deductibles. ""You have to provide the money only when somebody has a claim,"" Ingalls explains. The company's contributions to HRAs are tax-deductible, just like insurance premium payments.This type of coverage won't suit all small businesses. Ingalls has seen this strategy work at companies insuring relatively healthy groups of two to 50 people, and at organizations that already had a comprehensive health insurance plan in place. Larger companies, less healthy groups and organizations switching from more bare-bones catastrophic health plans likely won't see the same results, he cautions. ""You want to save enough money to fund the deductibles,"" he explains.Rethinking Employer Responsibility
Despite such cost-cutting strategies, some small businesses are rethinking their role in the healthcare game. ""Companies are trying to understand,  What is our responsibility as an employer, and what's the responsibility of individuals and families?'"" says Digital Insurance's Sullivan. ""It's an interesting recruitment issue.""According to Kaiser's benefits survey, healthcare coverage is on the decline among small businesses: 59 percent of companies with less than 200 employees offered health benefits in 2011, down from 68 percent in 2010.Steve King, a partner at small-business consulting firm Emergent Research in Lafayette, Calif., says the rising costs and administration of health benefits is partly to blame for the nation's rapidly expanding contingent and freelance work force. (Nearly one in three American workers is an independent contractor, according to the Freelancers Union.) Companies that hire contingent workers are often driven to do so by spikes in workload and the desire to ""test-drive"" employees before making a permanent offer. ""But it also lets you avoid all the encumberments of hiring a full-time employee,"" King says, including healthcare overhead.Nick Balletta, CEO of TalkPoint, a New York webcasting technology company, provides his 100 employees with a comprehensive, fully subsidized PPO health plan. But because of the cost of that program, Balletta hasn't ruled out hiring contract workers in the future.""Everything's on the table,"" Balletta says. ""Maybe healthcare becomes the new bonus. You do well in 2013 or 2014, and you're going to get healthcare. Or maybe you give people raises and bonuses, and you don't provide healthcare. My bias is obviously to take care of my employees, but at some point, economics drive behavior. Somebody's going to blink first and cut healthcare. And then everybody's going to jump on the bandwagon.""Michelle GoodmanMichelle Goodman is a Seattle-based freelance journalist and author of The Anti 9-to-5 Guide.Read more",Growth Strategies,2012-08-27 04:00:00
/article/224249,5 Ways to Reward Employees When Raises Aren't an Option,"In these tough economic times, raises and bonus pay for deserving employees may be out of the question. Here are some alternative ways to keep your team happy and loyal.","image credit: Wow-Gift-BasketsMany workers are doing double duty these days because employers either can t afford to hire more staff or are reluctant to do so in this still shaky economy. That makes it increasingly important to provide incentives -- or risk losing your most valued employees. A lot of companies, especially small businesses, have staffers that need a morale boost, maybe following a round of layoffs, or because the company simply can t afford to give raises or bonuses that staff deserve,  says David Jacobson, founder of TrivWorks, a New York-based teambuilding company.  But I ve seen some interesting and creative alternative forms of reward that work well. Related: Can You Be a Tough Boss Without Being a Jerk?While you may not be able to give every deserving employee a raise or bonus, here are five ideas for rewarding your staff in meaningful ways that don t involve cash: 1.Side projects
Some employees enjoy working on projects that don t fall under their official job descriptions but could tap into a hobby or special interest. For instance, New York-based Employment Taxation Software Solutions recently began offering some employees  job mobility,  or the chance to spend some of their down time each week working on tasks in other departments such as marketing, video production or training.
 Most employees don't start their lives out looking to become sales reps or accountants,  says Cameron Keng, the firm s founder.  Giving them the opportunity to continue their current responsibilities and take on additional work on the side or within the company in different departments of their interest is a great incentive. They're still doing what they're required, yet providing more value by helping other areas on their free time. 2.Job swaps 
JCD Repair, a small chain of electronics repair shops based in Seattle, offers employees a  job exchange  reward, letting them swap positions with another worker at another location. The employees pay for their own travel and lodging but get the chance to spend time in a new city -- a sort of working vacation.
 This means one of the guys from our Chicago shop can take a working vacation to Seattle and at the same time, one of our Seattle guys can come to Chicago,  says Matt McCormick, owner of JCD Repair.  The only thing we ask is that they inform our store managers and that no shifts are left uncovered at either location.  For many companies, such exchanges would be logistically difficult. But McCormick says they work well for JCD Repair because all of the company s shops operate in basically the same way and employees don t have to learn anything new to switch to a different location.3.Training
Training and development programs can be a valuable incentive for employees of small businesses, who typically don t enjoy the same access to such opportunities as workers at larger companies. At Sammis & Ochoa, LLC, a public relations firm in San Antonio, Texas, the co-owners pay for high-performing employees to attend two industry or personal development events each year within the state of Texas.
 For example, two of our coordinators successfully met their goals for the first quarter of 2012, so we are sending them to Dallas to attend a blogger conference that they selected,  says co-owner Mario Ochoa.  I like this reward because you can reward a team member and fulfill your goal of continuing education. Related: Olympic Training Tips for Coaching Employees to Greatness4.Happy hours
Most employees savor a chance to unwind and let loose after a stressful day at work. Give them something to look forward to by occasionally hosting your own company happy hour. Jacobson says his clients have done this successfully in a communal area of their offices, bringing in music, pizza and a beer keg, as well as at nearby bars or restaurants.
 It s really a simple idea, but most companies don t realize that if you approach a local bar or restaurant and let them know you intend to bring 30 or so people on an off night, such as Monday or Tuesday, the venue will bend over backwards to accommodate you,  Jacobson says. For instance, the establishment might waive a private room rental fee or offer discounted food and drink specials.5. Personal perks 
Some entrepreneurs find that the best rewards vary based on an individual employee s personality.  You just have to know your team,  says Jonathan Robinson, founder and CEO of FreeTextbooks.com, an online college bookstore that rewards loyal customers with free textbooks, based in Birmingham, Ala.  We're pretty small so I have to stay in tune with the preferences and pulse of our employees. It's my job to recognize when they need an extra bump or something to recharge on. 
Robinson says the company finds that for Generation Y,  the perks are in the details.  For instance, all new hires complete a questionnaire that includes items about their favorite candy, music and local restaurants,  which gives us some ammo when rewards come up,  he says. Recently, an avid golfer was rewarded with a free round at the best local course. Another employee received a $100 gift card to the restaurant of a local celebrity chef, and another, IMAX tickets to the premiere of The Dark Knight Rises.Related: How to Create Your Own Dream Team in Business",Run a Better Business,2012-08-24 06:00:00
/article/224191,How to Hire the Right Employees for Your Startup,"When you're on a tight startup budget and timeline, it can be easy to make compromises on who you hire. Don't. Here's what to look for in an employee.","Here s something funny about first-time entrepreneurs. Even though they dream about making all the big decisions as boss of their own enterprise, when the time comes to recruit first teammates, they compromise. It s true. Instead of seeking out a fabulous fit for their organization, they settle for the first person who ""is available"" and expresses enthusiasm for the startup mission.The reason why startup entrepreneurs have a difficult time finding good people is they don t try that hard.Here are five considerations to help you hire the employee of your dreams.1. Hire desired skills. Startup entrepreneurs are prone to hire an unqualified employee because the job candidate claims to be a ""fast learner."" This kind of enthusiasm may work for larger companies with extensive training resources, but not for budget-starved startups.Employees who are asked to do something they ve never done before are likely to make beginner s mistakes that will cost your company precious capital and time. The best way to avoid avoidable problems is to hire employees who have already ""been there and done that.""If, for example, your company needs proposal writing assistance for a Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) government grant, don t just hire any kind of writer to do this important work. Search for a grant writer who has prepared several SBIR proposals in recent years. Then, favor applicants whose proposals turned into grant awards. I d always rather pay more to people who know what they are doing, than less to people who don t.2. Hire relevant experience. Desired work experience should be defined not in terms of years, but rather in terms of specific work achievements. Just because a biochemist has, for example, 10 years of work experience doesn t mean that the previous work accomplishments line up well with your company s operating needs.  Another way to define work experience is in terms of work environment. A marketing manager who managed promotion campaigns for a well-established, big-budget corporation may flounder when asked to conceive and implement promotional campaigns for a cash-poor startup. As you review candidates, pay attention to work histories in which applicants were required to perform with little managerial supervision and team assistance. I also like to hire compulsive organizers who are happy to create systems for an emerging enterprise.3. Hire competitive drive. Let s face it -- all startups have to compete aggressively for customers. So doesn t it make sense to hire employees who thrive in a competitive work environment? Great startup employees embrace competitive challenges, hate losing clients to competitors and are highly motivated to exceed work goals. During interviews with prospective employees, ask about sports interests and other personal and professional activities that involve achievement under pressure. Prospective employees who dislike fast-paced competition probably won t be happy working for your new company.4. Hire persistence. With hiring criteria that emphasize competitive drive, should entrepreneurs favor job applicants who say they ""have a long history of winning"" in everything they set out to do? Not necessarily. Great startup employees adapt well to shifting priorities and don t get easily discouraged from unexpected setbacks. Ask prospective employees how they handled career disappointments. Also, invest extra time into talking with prior bosses about a job candidate s ability to manage frustration in a work setting. Simply stated, all startups need determined problem-solvers, not toxic finger-pointers.5. Test performance. I m a fan of long probation periods for recent hires in small businesses. If a new employee doesn t fit in with the company rhythm or perform well during the first few months on the job, don t delay in discussing your dissatisfaction. Another low-risk way to test prospective employee abilities is to create a project that can be completed as an independent contractor.Here s one last tip. I find that the most productive way to quickly sort through resumes, online or offline, is to have your written job criteria list on hand. If a candidate doesn t meet your top three criteria for experience and expertise, then discard the person s resume and move on. Hiring decisions are easy.

/article/224208,4 Ways to Prevent Office Bullies,"From conflict resolution to a healthy workplace policy, these tips will help you create a positive work environment.","photo courtesy of FoxAs educators strive to prevent bullying in schools, business leaders face a similar problem in the workplace. According to a survey by the Workplace Bullying Institute, as of 2010, 35 percent of the U.S. workforce (an estimated 53.5 million Americans) reported being bullied at work, making bullying four times more prevalent than other forms of workplace harassment.Office bullying is verbal abuse, threatening behavior, intimidation, or humiliation that lasts for several months or more. High turnover is common in bully-friendly offices and targets often suffer from depression and low morale, hurting productivity and work quality. The environment has a lot to do with why someone bullies,  says Catherine Mattice, president of Civility Partners, an organization that promotes positive workplaces.  Bullies don t exist in a vacuum.  Heavily bureaucratic organizations promote bullying, as do fiercely competitive or rapidly changing ones. Weak leaders who don t take a stance on bullying can also allow it to thrive.  As a leader, you have the ability to craft a culture,  Mattice says. Here are four ways to prevent bullying before it starts:1. Emphasize behaviors you want to see. To prevent bullying, outline the positive behaviors you expect to see in the workplace.  Anti-bullying policies don t work,  Mattice says.  You ve got to focus on what you want from [your employees], not what you don t want. Of course, you have to follow through as well.  If someone is getting out of line, spend some time coaching them and help them engage in behavior that s more what you re looking for,  Mattice suggests.Related: 3 Personality Types That Can Harm Your Business2. Foster conflict resolution skills. If you notice that an employee struggles to resolve conflicts effectively, provide some extra support. If a conflict comes up, discuss it with them afterward. What approach did they take to resolve it? Why? How did it work out? Did they consider any other approaches? Tell them what they did well then suggest how their approach might improve in the future.You can ask potential hires the same questions, focusing on a past conflict.  You re looking for someone who is generally sensitive to the situation,  Mattice says.  You can typically hear whether they were being proactive and respectful. Related: The Real Cost of Workplace Conflict3. Clarify roles and responsibilities. Constant change can destabilize employees, a particular challenge for startups that are often in flux.  Change makes people uncomfortable,  Mattice says, making it a risk factor for bullying.To reduce the stress, make sure employees are fully informed about what the changes are and how they will each be affected.  The clearer you can make someone s responsibilities and your expectations, the less stressed they ll be,  Mattice adds. 4. Be available for feedback.  Targets often don t speak up because they re not sure how the organization will respond,  Mattice says.  You have to open the door.  Employees with a forum to speak up are much more likely to report problems before they escalate.At one company, where rampant rumor mills were causing unrest, Mattice helped the CEO set up an email address that employees could use to verify rumors they heard. He responded to each inquiry, an act of transparency that calmed employees and lowered the risk of bullying.Related: Telltale Signs You Have a Workplace BullyNadia GoodmanNadia Goodman is a freelance writer in Brooklyn, NY.

.simplemodal-container {position:absolute !important; height: 1150px !important; width: 900px; top:500px !important;}Are you more like Howard Schultz of Starbucks, the billionaire investor Warren Buffett, Richard Branson of Virgin, or Tony Hsieh of Zappos? Knowing the answer could help you become more successful in your business.Being aware of how your brain works can help you make better decisions as an entrepreneur, contend the authors of a new book, Heart, Smarts, Guts and Luck (Harvard Business Review Press, 2012). Business veterans Tony Tjan, Dick Harrington, and Tsun-yan Hsieh interviewed and researched more than 500 business leaders from young, upstart entrepreneurs to experienced CEOs and identified four character traits that define a business leaders' decision-making process.Here is a rundown of the four categories of entrepreneurs they found and the leaders that exemplify them:1. Heart. Howard Schultz of Starbucks. Hearts-dominated leaders are the passionate, big-picture, founding visionaries that may not necessarily have a rational, research-based business plan, but are fiercely committed to seeing their goal through.Related: Startup Must-Haves: Perseverance and Optimism (Infographic)2. Smarts. Billionaire investor Warren Buffett. The smarts-dominated leader is rational, makes decisions based on facts, sets goals, delegates responsibility and knows how to hold people accountable.3. Guts. Richard Branson of Virgin. Guts-dominated leaders actively seek out uncertain business ventures with the possibility for high reward (risk takers) or are capable at managing situations laden with heavy consequence (risk-tolerant).4. Luck. Tony Hsieh of Zappos. While almost every successful business venture owes some portion of its success to a lucky break, the luck-dominant business leaders strategically expose themselves to luck by developing organic, deep connections with a group of people and then having the open and optimistic outlook in life to be able to take advantage of opportunities when they present themselves.Related: What Venture Capitalists Are Investing in Right NowTo learn what kind of leader you are, take the authors' entrepreneur aptitude test at www.HSGL.com.

/article/224041,"Are You Surrounded by ""Yes"" People? 3 Steps to Straight Talk","Tips for making your team feel comfortable to tell you what you need to hear, instead of only what they think you want to hear.","After you've surrounded yourself with the best talent you can find, creating an environment that stifles open communication can render that investment useless.Perhaps your employees are afraid to give you honest answers about your business or feel like they need to agree with every idea you have (no matter how ill-advised). If that's the case, your business could be suffering because you're not getting the value of their expertise, creativity, and insight. Bruce Todd Strom, a Boise, Idaho business consultant, says there are a few ways to get your team comfortable with telling you what you need to hear instead of only what they think you want to hear. 1. Don't overreact. It's never fun to hear bad news or smile while someone is telling you that your latest idea--well, it's pretty bad. However, if you are argumentative or combative every time someone else delivers criticism, you're going to stifle honest feedback, Strom says. Pay attention when an employee is speaking to you and refrain from becoming defensive. If you feel like you can't respond favorably or even neutrally, thank the person for speaking up and say you'd like to discuss the matter more later. Taking a break before you respond will give you some time to calm down and be more objective about the feedback. Related: How to Start Conversations That Make Instant Connections2. Welcome criticism. Strom reminds business owners that it may seem obvious that you're open to suggestions, but you have to tell your people it's okay to be honest with you. During meetings, invite feedback in a general way and emphasize that employees are also welcome to give their opinions -- no matter how critical they are -- in private. Some may feel uncomfortable criticizing the boss in front of others.3. Be aware. Pay attention to what's going on around you and take your cues from the environment, says Strom, whose self-published book, Business Professionalism, was released in June. If no one has come to you with ideas or concerns lately or if you walk into a group and it suddenly goes silent, the problem could be you. Make sure you approach employees individually -- and in a nonthreatening way. Consider having coffee with one or a small group of employees every month to discuss ideas, which can create an informal and more comfortable atmosphere.Related: Telltale Signs You Have a Workplace BullyGwen MoranGWEN MORAN is a freelance writer and co-author of The Complete Idiot's Guide to Business Plans (Alpha, 2010).

/article/223516,How to Attract -- And Retain -- Staff When You Can't Pay Big Bucks,Here are the basics every entrepreneur needs to know about creating an employee benefits package.,"						This story appears in the May 2012 issue of Entrepreneur. Subscribe  Just one year after hiring their first employee, executives at online discount site FatWallet realized they needed more staffers to handle the company's rapid growth. ""We needed IT staff and programmers, and we knew that in our area, we'd have to take them from larger companies,"" says April Kunzelman, human resources director for the Beloit, Wis.-based company.Kunzelman also knew that to lure talent from more established companies, FatWallet would have to beef up its employee benefits package. ""We knew we couldn't compete if we didn't offer, at the very least, health insurance. So we immediately began putting an employee benefits plan in place,"" she says.Today, FatWallet boasts a progressive benefits package that includes health, dental and disability insurance, paid time off and a host of other amenities, including free daily lunches for its nearly 60 employees.As Kunzelman and her peers have found, a strong employee benefits package is a powerful tool for attracting and retaining the best workers. In a 2011 Harvard Business Review Analytic Services survey of human resource leaders, 60 percent said an attractive benefits package is ""very important"" in recruiting and retaining quality employees, vs. only 38 percent who said a high base salary is very important.Benefits play an integral role in employee satisfaction. In its most recent annual trends survey, MetLife found that roughly 49 percent of employees polled said benefits were an important reason they came to work for a company, while 60 percent said benefits are an important reason for staying.While the cost and compliance of crafting benefits packages may seem daunting for small-business owners, experts agree they pay dividends in terms of long-term success. There are no easy formulas, because each entrepreneur needs a program tailored to his or her company and employees. But there are some universal guidelines.Getting StartedChristopher Delorey, senior vice president at employee benefits consultancy Bostonian Group, says employers typically start looking to round out a basic compensation package with benefits when they have six to 10 employees they wish to retain, as well as when they want to attract new ones. ""You don't necessarily have to have health insurance the minute you open your doors,"" he says.Medical insurance tops the list of employee demands. According to The Principal Financial Group's benefits study for fourth-quarter 2011, health insurance is deemed the most important benefit by 90 percent of employees.Medical and retirement plans can take many shapes and sizes to meet the goals of any company, according to Lisa Wintersheimer Michel, a partner specializing in employee benefits at law firm Keating Muething & Klekamp in Cincinnati. ""From a fully insured health product to a flexible spending account to a 401(k) to a simplified employee pension plan, there are many different options and levels depending on what you're interested in providing, what you can pay and the size of your group,"" Michel says.Once the major benefits components are in place, it's fairly easy and cost-effective to include other popular programs such as vision insurance, life insurance and long- or short-term disability.One benefit that's growing in popularity, in part because it is so well-suited to small businesses and startups, is flexibility. ""With so many personal demands on workers today, a flexible work schedule is a big plus in a benefits package,"" Delorey says.In fact, a study by the New York-based Families and Work Institute found that the majority of professional and nonprofessional employees--87 percent--say having the flexibility they need to manage their work and personal lives would be ""extremely"" or ""very"" important if they were looking for a new job.FatWallet addresses that need with its so-called ""no miss"" guidelines, wherein employees are instructed to never miss important family or school events for work. ""It doesn't cost us any money, and people really appreciate it,"" Kunzelman says. ""Flexibility pays huge benefits for a small company like us.""Affordable AlternativesWhile some benefits may be out of reach for small businesses, a little creativity can lead to similar, less expensive options that can have just as big an impact on employee morale and loyalty.If you can't offer: tuition reimbursementTry: a compressed, four-day workweek that gives employees time to pursue a degree on their ownIf you can't offer: paid vacationTry: job sharing, in which two part-time employees share the same full-time position, or wellness programs that include sleep breaks and massagesIf you can't offer: on-site child careTry: negotiating with a nearby child-care center for a discounted group rateIf you can't offer: an on-site fitness facilityTry: a lunch-hour walking club or discounted local gym membershipsIf you can't offer: free parking or transportation reimbursementTry: allowing regular telecommuting daysIf you can't offer: counseling servicesTry: allowing employees to bring their pets to work, which has been shown to reduce stressOutside HelpNo matter what benefits you want to offer, there are many resources for small-business owners to educate themselves. While valuable information can be found at websites such as the National Association of Health Underwriters  and SCORE,most businesses enlist the aid of an insurance broker or employee benefits consultant to help them understand and evaluate various products, particularly as regulations and possibilities vary from state to state.""The options can be vastly different, so you're often comparing apples and oranges,"" Michel says. ""These professionals can help you compare different products and understand the costs as well as determine what makes sense for your organization.""To make sure they find the best options and providers, Michel says employers should ask questions about each product's cost, what it covers and how the benefit is delivered.""You need to understand exactly what you're getting and how it's going to work,"" she says. ""How is the benefit delivered? What resources are available to help both the employer and the employees? How and how quickly are claims going to get paid? And what happens if there's a claim dispute? It's important to understand the entire process.""It's also important for employers to ask about the legal obligations they incur by offering those benefits. ""When you set up these plans, there's a set of laws you're required to comply with, like [the Employee Retirement Income Security Act], that you must understand,"" Michel says.Of course, the most important questions to ask are the ones related to your specific business needs. For FatWallet, Kunzelman asked if she could speak to another client with the same health insurance provider to get a sense of its customer service. ""The thing that drives employees insane is not being able to get their claims processed correctly,"" she says. ""My decision was based on customer service, because if it's not good, the insurance is probably not going to work for us.""Employee ViewpointTo find the package that best fits your business, it's important to survey employees about what they really want, Michel says. ""Employee interests vary depending on company size, industry and demographics, and you don't want to offer something that no one will take advantage of,"" she says.That's exactly what online retailer Zappos does to help achieve its goal of happy and healthy employees, according to benefits manager Bhawna Provenzano. Based on surveys of employees throughout the year, Zappos determines which benefits are most meaningful to team members, which benefits they would like to see added and which are not being used or are no longer relevant.""We make sure we include any suggestions that have been brought to us by team members on the survey,"" Provenzano says. ""All of these things help us determine the direction our benefits plan needs to go.""Michel cautions that there are laws that prohibit employers from asking about health conditions, family histories and other topics that may relate to insurance. Any survey of employees should have questions that are general and related only to benefits, and should be reviewed by an attorney before being distributed.Once a benefits package is created, it must be communicated effectively to employees. According to the 2011 Aflac WorkForces Report, 46 percent of employees at small companies say their HR departments communicate too little about employee benefits plans.Michel says each business must determine the best way to get the word out. ""Whether you post it in the office, mail it to the employees' homes or have a companywide meeting to roll out a benefit, you need to be sure they understand the benefits and how they work,"" she says.Delorey emphasizes that the key to a high-performing benefits package is for employers to understand their people and their mission, and to align their benefits with both. He also urges employers to realize that the more time and education they invest in finding the right program, the better the payoff will be, in the form of lower costs and quality plans.""It's easy for employers to say, 'I have to go to this established insurer and take this off-the-shelf plan,'"" he says. ""But if you put a little more effort into it like you do some other aspects of your business, you will be rewarded.""Benefits BabbleEmployee benefits programs can be confusing--in fact, they often seem to operate with a language all their own. Here's a glossary of some key terms.Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA): A federal law that sets operating standards for employee benefits plans.Flexible spending account (FSA): Also known as healthcare/dependent-care reimbursement accounts, FSAs allow employees to save pretax dollars to pay healthcare and child-care expenses.High-deductible health plan (HDHP): A health insurance plan that offers lower premiums and a higher deductible than traditional health plans. HDHPs are typically used in conjunction with pretax health savings accounts (HSAs).Third Party Administrator (TPA): The person (or organization) responsible for providing administrative services, including processing claims, for employee benefits plans.Wellness program: A group of services or events offered by an employer designed to lower the number of claims and claim costs by promoting improved health among employees. Such programs may include health screenings, flu shots, smoking-cessation groups and discounts on exercise classes and diet plans.Paula AndrussCincinnati-based Paula Andruss has written for USA Today, Woman s Day and regularly writes for Entrepreneur.

/article/223834,Telltale Signs You Have a Workplace Bully,How to spot and stop an office bully from chasing away talent -- and damaging your small business.,"Workplace bullying affects 35 percent of employees, according to a 2010 survey by the Workplace Bullying Institute (WBI), a Bellingham, Wash.-based nonprofit organization. Gary Namie co-founded WBI with his wife, Ruth, after her first-hand experience with bullying. In an interview, he shared his best advice to entrepreneurs for managing this nefarious problem. What follows are edited excerpts of the interview.Entrepreneur: How can you recognize a bully in the workplace?Gary Namie: Bullying differs from tough management because it's driven by the perpetrator's personal agenda and has nothing to do with improving the bottom line or accomplishing a mission. You might see it in how people are speaking to or about each other. Listen for harsh, unfair feedback about some employees. If you sense team members are being ostracized or being given unfair tasks or deadlines, a bully might be behind it. Any time your gut tells you there's something wrong with how an employee is being treated, you need to address it because it's going to hurt productivity and cost you good people.Entrepreneur: Are there ""types"" of bullies?Namie: There are four, but a really competent bully will adopt several of them:The Screaming Mimi is the fist-pounding, vein-bulging maniac who publicly tries to make an example of others, using fear and humiliation as management tools.
 The Constant Critic gets employees behind closed doors and rips them to shreds. The irony is this bully targets people because of their competence.
 Jekyll and Hyde is the smarmy, passive-aggressive type. This bully has an ingratiating style that wins favor with management, and then uses rumor and gossip to destroy others' reputations.
 The Gatekeeper is a decision-maker who undermines you by denying what you need to succeed because it makes him or her feel powerful. She undermines important elements like budgets and deadlines, setting up others to fail.Entrepreneur: What should you do if you find a bully in your company? Namie: First, make sure you're sending the right message from the top: Intimidation is not acceptable. Develop a written code of conduct covering performance expectations and acceptable forms of behavior. It's fine to say, ""We're going to be hard-driving, hard-working, and profit-driven."" But you also need to say, ""We're not going to beat each other up in the process. We're going to treat each other fairly, or there will be consequences.""Employees need channels to report bullying when it happens, such as through a human resources contact or someone other than the manager who may be the problem. Spell out what happens if bullying is discovered: Warnings, impact on performance reviews and, in severe cases, termination. Apply those consequences consistently or they will be meaningless. As the company leader, you need to eradicate bullying when you find it because it's like a toxic gas in your company, killing employees and chasing away talent.Gwen MoranGWEN MORAN is a freelance writer and co-author of The Complete Idiot's Guide to Business Plans (Alpha, 2010).

/article/223536,A Lie-Detector Test for Resumes,"In a tough economy, job seekers can be tempted to fudge facts or outright lie on their resumes. Here's how to catch them in the act.","The furor over new Yahoo CEO Scott Thompson's inaccurate resume is shining a spotlight on inadequate employee vetting. Thompson, the third Yahoo CEO in the past year, claimed to have a computer science degree, which he doesn't, along with his actual degree in accounting.If Yahoo, one of the world's largest technology companies, with $1.22 billion in revenue in the first quarter of 2012, can be misled, what's to stop your potential hires from lying on their resumes?If your business doesn't have a dedicated human-resources department, you can still vet potential employees. What's key is to slow down and think through your choice of applicants, according to John Challenger, CEO of outplacement consulting firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.""Sometimes when you're in a hurry to make the decision, you're not thorough in your process,"" he says. Here's more advice on resume lie-detecting from Challenger:1. Conduct multiple interviews.
Interview multiple people for a single position, and call promising candidates back for a second, or even a third, interview. Although this is time-consuming for both of you, it's a valuable way to gain insight into the person you're thinking of hiring.And when you interview someone, try to have other managers in the room. It's important to get feedback from colleagues about potential hires. Another manager's gut instinct could save you from making a potentially costly mistake.2. Do a background check.
Internet search tools and social networks are good resources for checking on applicants. After all, Thompson's resume offense was caught by a Google search. But it's wise to do a background check on each new hire.Companies such as IntelliCorp provide employee-screening services for small and midsize businesses. IntelliCorp's packages range from $1,595 to $7,495, according to Kelly Ansboury, the company's director of business development and marketing.Decide first how wide and deep you want to go, and then choose a service that meets your needs. As a minimum measure, Challenger recommends checking potential employees' criminal records and citizenship status. Looking into their credit history or asking them to submit to a drug test are further steps you can take.3. Seek out employment and character references.
Challenger advises interviewing candidates who have been recommended by people you trust. But even then, you should still conduct your own background check on the person. With a candidate who doesn't have a personal recommendation, you should search out personal references. Go beyond those listed on his resume. Reach out to former co-workers or others who can verify the applicant's employment history and give you insight into the person's character.Although it's necessary to take precautions when adding someone to your company, Challenger said, lying on resumes is uncommon, especially in our age of information transparency.""With high unemployment, some people feel like their only way to find a job when they've been out of work for a long time is to take action they know is wrong,"" he said. ""But most people -- whether it's out of their sense of integrity or their fear of being caught -- they don't take the risk.""Brian Patrick EhaBrian Patrick Eha is a freelance journalist and former assistant editor at Entrepreneur.com.

/article/223389,What an End to the Health-Care Law Could Mean for Small Business,"The U.S. Supreme Court's decision on the Patient Protection and Affordable Health Care Act won't be known until June, but here are some of the potential effects small-business owners might want to consider now.","After hearing three days of oral arguments, the U.S. Supreme Court has now voted on the constitutionality of the Patient Protection and Affordable Health Care Act. While we wait to hear the court's decision in June, small-business owners might want to consider the potential effects.If the law is declared unconstitutional, the coverage provided by many insurance plans will undoubtedly change. For instance, the new law eliminates lifetime limits on coverage, and it allows parents to continue to cover their children until they reach age 26. It also keeps people from being denied health-care coverage because of preexisting conditions. Should the law be struck down, some insurers might eliminate these and other provisions. But exactly which coverage goes away and which stays will likely vary, depending on a small-business owner's particular insurance plan.At a more macro level, several important aspects of employee health-care coverage will remain the same even if the law is struck down. The number of small companies that provide health insurance to employees is unlikely to change much, health-care costs will continue to rise, and businesses will continue to require employees to pay for a greater share of their coverage. Moreover, uncertainty about the future of employer-provided health insurance will persist.Related: Without the Health Law, Reforms Could StickWhile some pundits have claimed that the number of small businesses providing insurance to their employees will drop if the law is struck down, that seems unlikely. True, the tax credits designed to encourage small businesses to provide coverage would go away, but few companies have been taking advantage of those credits. The Kaiser Family Foundation found that only one-third of businesses with fewer than 50 employees have even determined whether they are eligible for the tax credit, let alone actually taken advantage of it.In fact, it seems likely that fewer small businesses would drop health insurance if the law were struck down than if it were upheld. That's because many small businesses have an incentive to stop providing insurance under the law. The tax penalties small businesses would pay for failing to offer coverage are less than the cost of insuring employees.But even this effect would be limited because the number of small businesses likely to drop coverage under the new law is modest. A survey by Fidelity Investments, for instance, found that 22 percent of small-business owners planned to discontinue coverage in response to the law. Separate studies by the human-resource consulting firms Mercer and Towers Watson found that 8 percent and 9 percent of companies, respectively, were likely to drop health insurance under the new law. Health-care costs are unlikely to rise if the law is struck down. The law actually is expected to lead to a slight rise in costs. An analysis by researchers at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services showed that the new law would increase U.S. spending on health care by 0.2 percent per year and result in health-care accounting for an additional 0.3 percent of gross domestic product in 2019. Related: Six Mistakes to Avoid When Choosing Health-Care CoverageTo cope with rising health-care and insurance costs, companies have been passing a higher share of the premiums on to their employees. Regardless of what the Supreme Court decides, that trend is likely to continue. And even the general uncertainty about the future of employee health insurance is unlikely to diminish if the court fails to uphold the law.Although the primary source of uncertainty right now -- the question of the constitutionality of the law -- will be resolved, the Supreme Court's decision likely will cause Congress to revisit the issue. That, of course, means small-business owners would face a new uncertainty -- how Congress will shape the future of employee health insurance in light of the court's ruling.

/article/223333,Can't Afford Employee Training Programs? Think Again,"To attract and retain great employees, Fortune 1000 companies spend hundreds of millions of dollars a year on training. Small businesses can't afford not to compete.","During a period of rapid growth two years ago, principals at Modea, a digital advertising agency in Blacksburg, Virginia, realized that they needed a more effective employee onboarding program to get new recruits up to speed quickly. ""When you grow fast, you need people to come in and produce quickly,"" says Aaron Herrington, co-founder of Modea.That was the catalyst for Modea's current employee training program, which was started last year. With the guidance of a new professional who had prior experience with a robust training program, Modea implemented a 12-hour training course that ends with a team presentation to executive leadership.The training program has been a win-win for both the company and the employees. ""People are much more aligned and understand the direction and expectation of what everyone else does. That has made what we do and how we do it more efficient,"" says Herrington.Using training programs as a recruiting tool
For employees, the program has forced them to think about their careers, short-term goals and action plans to meet those goals. ""It's a recruiting tool because people are very excited about it -- but we've also had so many people grow and evolve with our career development plans,"" says Herrington.Too often, small-business owners fail to see the value in providing a formal training program. Running on tight budgets, entrepreneurs are focused on the bottom line and think they can do the training themselves. Bad idea.""[Formal] training gives individuals the opportunity to solve some business issues and find new ways of generating revenue,"" says Jeffrey Hull, director of learning services at Employers Group, a Los Angeles-based human resources consulting firm. Plus, employee performance improves with training. ""The more you know, the easier and faster you can do your job,"" says Dr. Tracey Wilen-Daugenti, managing director of the Apollo Research Institute, an organization that researches higher education and workforce issues.Just as important, training is a great retention tool. Unfortunately, there's a perception that if the company spends money on training professionals and then they leave, the company has lost its investment. ""You want to [train and] keep good performers instead of fearing they're going to leave,"" says Hull. That's why business owners should put thought into developing training programs that fit the company culture.Developing a training program
Training can be unstructured or structured. Unstructured and often free or low-cost programs can involve coaching, mentoring or the new hire shadowing more senior professionals. In many cases, these tend to take on the role of on-the-job training. Large companies often stumble in this area -- an arena where smaller companies can really shine, because their size allows employees to take on a variety of roles.There are many ways to set up these types of programs, from assigning a mentor or coach to new employees and arranging quarterly meetings for sharing and feedback, to just letting employees find their own mentors or coaches as needed.Businesses considering a more formal or structured training program, on the other hand, should bear in mind that it can start out small and doesn't have to be a huge expense. ""You don't have to be GE or a Fortune 500 company with a large training staff,"" says David Lewis, CEO of OperationsInc, a human resources outsourcing firm in Stamford, Connecticut.The Internet is a good place to start -- there are over 50,000 team-building training sites alone. Also, many professional associations, vendors and local chambers of commerce offer training sessions for specific industries and products. ""They're typically low cost, short in duration and more focused on business results,"" says Hull.Guest speakers, group wikis, internal YouTube videos, webinars and brown-bag lunches can also be an easy way to get started. Hull also suggests pooling resources with other businesses. ""You can probably find commonalities, and you can have a trainer come out and do training for all the businesses together,"" he says.A couple things to keep in mind before you get started:Business owners should be trained as well. Most business owners think they are good leaders by default. Not so. ""They need to look in the mirror and think about what is happening in the workplace,"" says Hull.Do assessments first. Make sure your time and resources are targeting areas where training is needed.Schedule a regular time for training. ""Short increments are fine -- it doesn't have to be the whole day,"" says Wilen-Daugenti.Define and measure metrics. You need to show progress over time and make evaluating group performance a goal.Bottom line: Training needs to be a well-thought-out priority -- for the growth of the employees as well as the business. ""If you put together a coherent training plan, you will get much more out of it,"" says Adrian Miller, president of Adrian Miller Sales Training.Toddi GutnerToddi is an award-winning journalist, writer and editor and currently is a contributing writer covering career management issues for The Wall Street Journal.Read more",Growth Strategies,2012-04-19 10:00:00

/article/223078,The Five Things Employees Really Want,The recent 'Undercover Boss' episode on Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen showed exactly what workers really want from their employer. Here's a hint: It's not a raise.,"I haven't managed to catch all the episodes of Undercover Boss this season, but there was one I knew I had to see -- Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen. Why? I am the hugest fan of their chicken and biscuits. If you haven't had the pleasure, this is fast food worth blowing your diet for.I almost didn't want to watch, because if they were going to show me that secretly the restaurants had rats or the food was made from something gross, I didn't want to know. But I had to check it out.Thankfully, the food seems to be just fine. The problems found by their undercover executive -- chief talent officer Lynne Zappone -- had to do with how employees were treated.This episode shows exactly what Popeyes's employees really want. Here's a hint, it's not a raise:1. A pleasant work environment. Zappone worked one store where the manager was yelling at the other workers -- including her -- in front of the customers. That's just not cool.2. Recognition. The janitor at one store impressed Zappone with his strong loyalty to the company. He even buys his own less-toxic cleaning products to use. ""I consider this my store,"" he tells her. He also sadly informs her that Popeyes has no employee-of-the-month award, like most fast-food chains do. 3. Perks. Zappone was shocked when a coworker asked if he could catch a ride with her for lunch -- to Taco Bell, where the food is cheaper than at Popeyes. He needed to go there because the employee discount on Popeyes food had been discontinued. A company picnic had also faded away over the years.4. Help when they need it. Many of Popeyes's workers were displaced and saw their families scattered after Hurricane Katrina. One 20-year employee was fired when she couldn't return to work fast enough, despite being an invaluable trainer. The janitor had lost everything in the hurricane and lived at his church for two years while he got back on his feet. Zappone realized Popeyes could have done more to reach out to displaced workers and help them stay with the company after the disaster.5. Mentoring. One line worker who had formerly been homeless was trying to attend a hospitality college despite lacking a car, while one manager hoped to become a regional trainer. In the show conclusion, Zappone helped both with scholarships and coaching to move their own professional goals forward.The show highlighted a basic fact so many employers don't get: Your employees are people -- people with problems, yes, but they also have a history and dreams. If you treat them as such, they will be more productive and better representatives of your brand.What do you think workers need most?

/article/222889,How to Build an SEO Team from Scratch,Here are the ways you can make sure search engine optimization is a top priority at your company.,"Free Webinar | August 16thFind out how to optimize your website to give your customers experiences that will have the biggest ROI for your business.							Register Now   As companies realize how valuable high search engine rankings can be for business, they often want to know how to develop their own search engine optimization (SEO) capabilities. The answer depends on the approach that's desired: train existing personnel, hire an outside consultant or build a new team of employees.But before deciding on an approach, it's important to understand the different functions of an SEO team and the skills needed for each part of the optimization process. A good SEO team requires all of the following:Project management: At least one person should develop measurable SEO goals, delegate tasks and follow up to be sure objectives are being achieved. Technical SEO and data analysis: Any SEO project requires data analysis in the form of keyword research, traffic measurement and goal evaluation. Someone should be able to draw conclusions from the data your SEO efforts produce. Content creation: In many cases, SEO activities require large amounts of new content in the form of articles, infographics and other images. So a creative mind is a must on your SEO team. Link building: Because back links can play a tremendous role in your website's rankings, SEO teams should have at least one person who will pursue link-building opportunities and solicit back links. Web development: In addition to back links, a number of other variables figure into SEO, including site speed, internal linking and navigation, and content indexing. You'll need someone who can modify your site according to the latest SEO standards.Here are the common ways you can add these skills to your organization:Train existing employees.Depending on the size of your company, you may already have employees with the necessary skills. For example, marketing or advertising employees may be familiar with SEO principles, while your IT staff may understand how to make necessary website modifications.Even if your employees are unfamiliar with SEO, they may have the right skills and mindset to be trained to perform SEO tasks. An accounting department employee, for example, may possess strong data analysis skills, which could be translated to SEO activities.Related: What You Need to Know About Brand Building vs. SEOThere are a number of free online tools available that employees can use to learn SEO. For example, online SEO communities SEOMoz and SEOBook offer free tutorials and trainings. Employees who require a more directed, in-depth approach might condsider the online training courses offered by Moorpark, Calif.-based Bruce Clay Inc. (prices start at $495 per course) or the University of San Francisco (prices vary).Most paid training options are relatively inexpensive compared to hiring a consultant or a full-time employee, but what you save in cost will be traded for time spent. Even the most driven employee can require several months to get up-to-speed on current SEO practices, with those working on complex projects or large websites needing even longer.Retain an SEO consultant.If you don't have employees with the right skills or the time to take on more responsibilities, you might consider hiring an SEO consultant. That way, you'll be able to launch your optimization campaigns as quickly as possible, using the latest techniques.Hiring an SEO consultant can be cheaper than recruiting new employees to do the same thing. Consultants typically bill on a per project basis, which allows you to purchase only as much of their services as you need, and their independent contractor status means you won't be responsible for payroll taxes.Related: Five Effective SEO Strategies to Optimize Your Business BlogThe majority of SEO projects are billed on a ""per project"" basis -- rather than ""per hour"" -- with average costs between $1,000 and $7,500, according to a survey conducted by SEOMoz of more than 600 SEO consultancies. Although this is no small investment, hiring an SEO consultant could enable you to perform necessary SEO tasks without the greater expenses associated with hiring a new full-time employee.Hire an SEO team.If your SEO needs are extensive, the costs of hiring a consultant can add up. If you anticipate needing a substantial amount of SEO work over a long period of time, it may be more cost-effective to bring in full-time or part-time employees with the specific skills you need. They can devote their full energy and time to your SEO tasks.On average, in-house SEO workers typically earn between $45,000 to $100,000 per year in salary, depending on the specific roles they fill and their experience within the industry. To find in-house workers for your SEO team, you can try searching SEO Jobs, SEO Jobs Finder and the SEO Consultant Directory.If you anticipate needing a substantial amount of SEO work over a long period of time, bringing in skilled employees with the specific talents described above may be the most cost-effective way to build your own SEO team.Related: A Six-Step Survival Guide for Search Engine UpdatesAJ KumarAJ Kumar is the founder of Limitless Publishing, a digital publishing agency based in Newport Beach, Calif.

/article/222640,The Risks of Betting on Sports in Your Office,Here's how office pools may earn your company a major-league penalty.,"						This story appears in the February 2012 issue of Entrepreneur. Subscribe  From March Madness brackets to pay-for-play fantasy football--in every season, there is an opportunity for employees to engage in good-natured sports wagering. There's no denying the popularity of office betting: A 2011 CareerBuilder.com survey found that one in five workers have participated in March Madness office pools alone.Trash-talking each other's favorite teams may seem like harmless workplace fun. Turns out, however, actually betting on those teams is illegal in most cases, according to attorney Michael J. Riccobono of Gibbons P.C. in Newark, N.J. Former currency broker John Bovery learned this the hard way when he was arrested in September 2010 at his Parlin, N.J., home for running a betting pool that reportedly raked in $850,000 per year.While it's unlikely that the feds or local authorities are monitoring your business, waiting to snag brackets hot off the copy machine, office betting does put your company at risk. The Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992 banned betting on professional and amateur sports in most states. Until 2009, it was a misdemeanor to run such pools in California, while in states like New Jersey, office pools are generally considered legal as long as the person or entity running the pool does not take a cut of proceeds.Penalties can range from fines to felony charges and possible imprisonment, depending on state statutes, the size of the pool and other factors, according to John M. Husband of Denver law firm Holland & Hart. Understanding your state's laws is the first step to evaluating your potential liability. Husband says companies should spell out official gambling policies in employee manuals. (""Don't allow it,"" he advises.)If you choose to look the other way, Riccobono says, you might limit your exposure to charges if you insist that staff keep wagers small and not take a cut of the proceeds for themselves. ""Employees would be wise to keep their contributions minimal--less than $10 or $20. When you're getting into pools that are thousands or tens of thousands of dollars, those are more likely to start drawing the eye of the authorities,"" he says.Avoid involving multiple offices in various states, particularly online or via e-mail. Riccobono warns that you'll be subject to compliance laws in each state involved. What's more, he says, ""sending out a mass e-mail or making phone calls across state lines might [invoke] some federal statutes along with individual state statutes that deal with gambling.""Corrections & Amplifications: An earlier version of this article misstated the month that John Bovery was arrested.

/article/222550,Labor Picture May Brighten in 2012,"Last year was bleak for many small businesses, but sales, along with hiring, appear to be on their way up. Here's a look at some of the factors that could affect staffing plans -- for betteror worse -- in 2012.","Editor's Note: This is the third installment in a four-part series analyzing the outlook for small businesses in the year ahead. Read the other installments on health care, financing and pricing.Despite the still uncertain economic outlook, small-business owners appear poised to recruit new employees this year.In November, the net share of owners who said they plan to create jobs over the next three months rose four points to 7 percent, the highest level in more than three years, according to the latest monthly survey from the National Federation of Independent Business. And among fast-growth companies, the majority of entrepreneurs who responded to a September survey said they plan to hire in 2012, with 41 percent expecting to add more than 20 employees, according to the Kauffman Foundation, a Kansas City, Mo., research organization focused on entrepreneurship.""Many small-business owners are thinking we're turning the corner on employment,"" says Rafael Pastor, the CEO of Vistage, an executive coaching firm that tracks CEO sentiment among small and midsize businesses.After receiving increased requests for new products, Icebreaker Entertainment co-founder Ted Scofield (on left) is planning to hire 10 new employees in 2012.The labor picture, while still subdued compared to pre-recession levels, has brightened thanks in large part to an uptick in sales projections, experts say. That's the case for Ted Scofield, co-founder of Icebreaker Entertainment, a New York maker of quirky consumer products, who is looking to hire 10 employees this year. He is encouraged by requests for new product designs this year from such retail customers as Wal-Mart, Kohl's and Dollar General.Related: Jobs Bill Breakup: What Will Entrepreneurs Push For?  His positive outlook represents a major shift from what Icebreaker's six-employee staff experienced during the recession and financial crisis. ""The downturn was like pushing a big pause button on our business,"" Scofield says, noting that purchase orders were repeatedly delayed.Still, risk factors such as the shaky housing market, the federal deficit and the European debt crisis could derail new hiring in 2012, says Mark A. Price, a labor economist at the Keystone Research Center, a think tank in Harrisburg, Pa. ""Any one thing wouldn't [necessarily] drive the U.S. back into recession, but it could slow a growing economy"" and crimp hiring plans.Uncertainty in Washington clearly isn't helping to inspire confidence and spur hiring. Congress may allow the tax cuts ushered in by President George W. Bush to expire at the end of 2012, increasing the top rates for individuals and small-business owners with incomes above $250,000.Related: Temporary Payroll Tax Extension Passes in Time for the Holidays Furthermore, Congress could vote against extending the payroll tax holiday, which currently reduces the 6.2 percent Social Security tax by two percentage points. If that provision isn't extended within two months, the rate will spring back up and trigger an annual income loss of $1,000 for the average household.
The higher Social Security tax could hurt consumer confidence, according to Alan Krueger, chairman of President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers. In a December speech in Charlotte, N.C., Krueger cautioned that if Congress doesn't extend the payroll tax holiday through 2012, job losses could result, breaking the economy's recent strides.Related: What a Payroll Tax Holiday Could Mean for Employers  In November, the U.S. unemployment rate fell to 8.6 percent from 9 percent in October. And businesses that employ fewer than 50 workers added 110,000 jobs in November, nearly double the 58,000 hired in October, according to payroll company Automatic Data Processing Inc. and consultancy Macroeconomic Advisers.Small companies are likely to continue adding jobs if they believe Americans will increase spending. Based on recent data, consumers may in fact be ready to open their wallets. They expressed the greatest confidence in eight months in December, partly because of the improving labor market, according to the Conference Board's consumer confidence index.""If you're optimistic about consumer spending, you can be optimistic about hiring,"" says Bill Dunkelberg, the chief economist for the National Federation of Independent Business.In the last six months, Kerry Ann Dame (second from left) says Posh Living's sales have jumped 20 percent. The boost helped her hire on a part-time installer.That's how interior designer Kerry Ann Dame of Surfside Beach, S.C., feels. After the economic meltdown, her company Posh Living saw demand plummet.

/answer/222493,What is a Business Owner's Relationship with Freelancers?,,"Normally, a freelancer is brought on board as a contractor under a professional services agreement. Essentially, you will be paying this individual to do specific work at a set rate per hour or per day because he or she has expertise that you need on a temporary basis. You are not his or her  employer.""It is advisable to have contracts in place with freelancers and to abide by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rules regarding these individuals. Otherwise, you might discover that they expect other non-standard considerations when their contracts end.For example, it is not uncommon for an independent worker such as a freelancer whose engagement period has ended to apply for unemployment insurance benefits with a state agency. Then, when officials do not find any earnings reported for the worker, an investigation ensues. For misclassifications, the payouts most often involve benefits and lost wages including unpaid overtime.Contractors should all have specific self-determining kinds of work to do, normally in a finite time period, with defined deliverables, using their own place of work and so forth. If you look at Section Two of the IRS Publication 15-A, you will see what the IRS considers when determining whether a worker is an employee or an independent contractor (i.e., 1099 worker).The IRS will help an organization free of charge to determine the appropriate classification for a worker or group of workers in the organization as regards federal law. To obtain that service, you complete and submit IRS Form SS-8 to the IRS. However, your state may have more or different requirements.Related: The 10 Best Things for Entrepreneurs to Outsource  Related: Sample Professional Services Agreement [Premium]

/article/220629,How to Uncover Exceptional Talent,Three ways business owners can spot the rare find when making that next important hire. Hint: Take the contrarian path.,"When hiring talent, many companies generally search for candidates with narrow, time-tested backgrounds. Hunting strictly in those familiar zones doesn't  nd everybody, however. When selectors apply such rules too tightly, lots of fascinating candidates on the fringe get overlooked. There's no mechanism for considering the 100-to-1 long shot, let alone the 1,000-to-1 candidate. On a one at-a-time basis, it's easy to say that such candidates aren't worth the time it would take to assess them. Yet ignoring all of these outsiders can mean squandering access to a vast amount of talent.Alert organizations are  nding clever ways to widen their net without wrecking the careful checks and balances involved in a conventional hiring system. Often the pioneering work can be done by a few explorers who approach the hunt for talent in a radically different manner.The key techniques are as follows:Break down barriers that restrict where you look. The talent universe is full of overlooked people, shunned for reasons of geography, status, or background. Sometimes all that's required is a willingness to consider Kansas when everyone is fussing over the same limited pool of candidates on the Eastern Seaboard. It may feel safer to stick with the pack. But scouting the same way everyone else does amounts to paying a huge ""conformity tax."" When you're exploring, ask: ""What can go right?"" Most conventional assessment is all about  nding candidates'  aws. That's appropriate in the  nal stages of selection, when top-tier candidates have already established their allure. But the outer fringes of talent work differently. Great discoveries happen only if assessors are willing to suspend their skepticism at  rst, so that the underdogs get a chance to show a spark of promise. Figure out how to take tiny chances--so you can take more of them. When it's expensive to consider candidates who might not work out, the long tail of talent becomes off limits. In many  elds, success is still so mysterious that everyone relies on hunches and patience. But the most successful talent spotters steal an edge anyway. Some of the most intriguing experiments in this direction are taking place in downtown San Francisco, at the advertising agency of Goodby, Silverstein & Partners. Yet Goodby's director of talent, Zach Can eld, spends barely half his time reviewing mainstream applications from mainstream candidates. The core of his job involves hunting for smart, high-intensity people who never knew they wanted to work in advertising until Canfield contacted them.Related Video: Foursquare's Dennis Crowley on Hiring TalentFor a while, Can eld scouted the world of stand-up comics. As he later explained, they are marvelous storytellers. They hone their material relentlessly, so that it connects with an audience. And they are keenly aware of audiences' short attention span, in ways that others often overlook. Can eld came back from that quest with several standout hires, including one ex-comedian, Andrew Bancroft, who became of one of Goodby's top creative talents on the ""Got Milk,"" H agen-Dazs, and Chevrolet accounts.Emboldened by that success, Can eld started talking to lawyers, police detectives, private investigators, and college debate champions. Nobody else regards those professions as feeder systems for ad agencies. But Can eld saw these unlikely specialties as hotbeds of superb researchers with a deep curiosity about what other people think and believe. Three of Can eld's four targeted professions turned out to be dead ends. Lawyers, detectives, and private eyes had already settled on steady careers. But with the college debaters, Can eld hit the jackpot. They liked Can eld's pitch. For at least some of them, advertising sounded a lot more exciting than their standard career option: heading off to three years of law school, followed by the highly constrained life of a corporate litigator. If Goodby needed research aces who could analyze the seventeen reasons why people buy the cars that they do--why, that was  ne stuff!Related: Avoid These Interview MistakesBringing in outsiders brings big spillover bene ts, Can eld argues. ""Our whole mission as an ad agency is to connect with people,"" he observes. That's best done if the  rm includes people with the full spectrum of skills, attitudes, and perspectives. Overload Goodby with too many people who came into advertising through the same paths, and blind spots start to occur. His conclusion: ""You have to dig in unknown places. You have to spend 50 percent of your time trying to  nd those wild cards.""For smaller companies, sheer economics may force them to concentrate on the long tail of talent. Realistically, they can't win the costly bidding wars to hire the obvious superstars. They need to adopt more of a guerrilla strategy, picking up non-obvious talent that larger rivals can't be bothered to pursue.Excerpted from The Rare Find: Spotting Exceptional Talent Before Everyone Else (Portfolio, 2011) by George Anders.

/article/220512,Beyond the Free Snacks: Spotlighting the Best Small Workplace Practices,A look at the innovative small-employer practices at the companies that made our annual list.,"Some companies give employees free snacks and beverages. Others offer on-site massage therapy or even dry-cleaning services. While those can be attractive perks, the companies on this year's Top Small Companies to Work For 2011 list go far above the standard when it comes to working environments.Compiled by the Great Place to Work Institute, our annual list showcases the top 25 successful small companies that have some of the most satisfied employees on the planet. The Great Place to Work Institute is a San Francisco-based research, consulting and training firm that works with organizations to identify, create and maintain great workplaces.The Top Small Companies to Work For 2011  How do they do it? Here are highlights of the creative ways that five companies on our list are solving common business problems, including reducing turnover, raising productivity and other workplace-related challenges.One of Snagajob.com's annual Office Olympics ""opening ceremonies"" events.Fostering community.
Ensuring that new hires acclimate quickly and smoothly into company culture is a priority at Snagajob (Ranked No. 1), a Richmond, Va.-based online community for hourly workers and employers. Founded in 2000, the company has created the ""Culture Squad,"" a team that meets monthly to discuss the pulse of the business and its 230 employees, who are referred to as ""snaggers."" Snagajob says the group's mission is to serve as advisors to employees in creating ""a positive, energizing and fun"" work environment.The Culture Squad must be doing something right. Snagajob says annual voluntary turnover among full-time employees is at five percent, and has stayed at that mark over the last several years.  Meanwhile, annual full-time job growth has soared to 88 percent. The squad also helps speed up bond-building with new hires by managing ""Snagger Confessions."" New employees are asked to share their unique talents and experiences in a brief questionnaire and the answers are shared among employees over the company's employee-only online network. When new hires are introduced at weekly company-wide meetings, employees are quizzed about the responses and get token rewards such as candy for each correct answer.""It's a fun way to hold our employees accountable for learning about our new 'snaggers,'"" says Betsy Kersey, whose title at Snagajob is director of people.Related: Why Your Business Should Be a Great WorkplaceThe squad also fosters community by staging Snagajob's annual week-long Office Olympics event in April. Employees form teams, choose different countries to represent and kick off the week by re-enacting an Olympics opening ceremony parade. Previous parades have included fire twirling, fake crocodile wrestling and colorful floats. The games -- held during the week during office hours -- have included relay races, paper basketball games and office-chair curling.""Everything we do cascades down from our core values: collaboration, accountability and passion,"" Kersey says.Part of AutomationDirect's DirectWellness program, employees participate in a company cycling club.Encouraging healthy lifestyles.
The management team at Cumming, Ga.-based AutomationDirect (Ranked No. 4) has developed its company culture around a ""Wheel of Life"" analogy. AutomationDirect's wheel has six spokes: family, career, social, financial, physical and spiritual. Each represents a goal the company's nearly 200 employees should, according to AutomationDirect, seek to achieve in their lives.""If these spokes are in balance, a person has a rounded 'wheel' that can handle the ups and downs of the road of life and business,"" says AutomationDirect founder Tim Hohmann. Started in 1994, AutomationDirect is a direct seller of automation controls for manufacturing machines. Hohmann started applying the ""Wheel of Life"" philosophy a year after the company launched. ""If our company could create an environment to facilitate and encourage all of us to balance our 'wheel,' we would have more motivation, more creativity and more positive energy,"" he says. ""After 15 years, we have achieved significant dividends for our customers, ourselves and our families' quality of life.""  One program is called Wake Up and Learn. Between 8 and 9 a.m. four times a year, the companyhosts a variety of speakers to discuss personal and professional development topics including budgeting, managing stress and healthy eating. Another program is DirectWellness, which offers employees access to on-site Weight Watchers meetings, yoga and Pilates sessions. There's also a smoking cessation program that awards employees with a $250 bonus after 90 days, $500 after six months and $1,000 after one year without smoking.Winners of one of McMurry's ""WOW Projects.""Inspiring innovation.
Employees are encouraged to come up with ways to cut costs, make more money and generally improve the working experience at Phoenix-based content marketing firm McMurry (Ranked No. 8), founded in 1984.Here's how it works. Employees submit their innovative ideas -- called ""WOW Projects"" -- through the company's internal computer network. Toward the end of the year, president and CEO Chris McMurry and several senior managers consider each of the hundreds of pitches that come in and award up to $10,000 for the best ideas.""Our business, and every business, needs to innovate constantly if it seeks an enduring future,"" McMurry says, explaining why the program got started.Related: Three Tips for Building a Great Workplace [Video]One winning pitch came from a group of three employees who pored over U.S. Post Office regulations and came up with a way for McMurry to re-sequence how it distributes mail on behalf of its clients, saving those clients millions of dollars, according to McMurry.Encouraging its staff of more than 170 people to dream up creative business ideas and solutions has ""cemented innovation into our culture,"" McMurry says. ""It's now part of what everyone does. It has put all my colleagues in a continuous improvement mode. There literally isn't a week that goes by where someone doesn't implement a better way of doing something.""McMurry says ""WOW Projects"" improve a swath of company functions, from billing accuracy to workflow to shipping procedures. All have improved the company's bottom line. Last year, McMurry's revenues were about $44 million.XPLANE employees collaborate during the company's Visual Thinking School.Enhancing workplace creativity.
At Portland, Ore.-based communications and design consulting firm XPLANE (Ranked No. 17), employees who think critically as well as visually are considered valuable assets. In 2005, the company created the Visual Thinking School as a collaborative lecture, enabling founder David Gray to connect with the company's new designers. The program has evolved to enhance the visual and communications skills among its 63-person workforce, and to offer a break from the daily grind.Twice a month for two hours, employees meet to discuss various topics of personal and professional interest and work on collaboration, storytelling and presentation skills. ""The Visual Learning School is about using pictures to help people better think about complex issues, solve problems and communicate more effectively,"" says XPLANE creative director Matt Adams. ""The most valued result is team building and the strengthening of relationships through learning, spontaneity and improvisation.""XPLANE, which was founded in 1993 and had $8.4 million in revenues last year, also has an ""Inspiration Wall"" -- a designated space in the office kitchen where employees can post anything they have created or want to share that inspires them. ""It helps us express new ideas and personal findings which foster surprising connections, creative collaborations and, at its simplest, helps us all know each other better,"" Adams says.Employees at Arlington, Va.-based Decision Lens gear up for a day of competitive go-kart racing.Building teams.
Before John Saaty and his brother Daniel founded Arlington, Va.-based Decision Lens (Ranked No. 25) in 2002, John worked at several large corporations and was turned off by what he called ""lame"" annual company barbeques or bowling excursions. He wanted to engage his employees with group activities and trips they otherwise may not be able to on their own.For example, Decision Lens paid for its 35-person staff to visit the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Goddard Space Flight Center about 20 miles northeast in Greenbelt, Md., where they listened to astronomers discuss how they've been using the Hubble Telescope. Last month, employees geared up for a day of competitive go-kart racing.""If you want to play paintball or go bowling, you can do that with your friends on your own time,"" says Saaty. ""The idea is to inspire people to do what they didn't think they could do. If an employee has a bad day or run of days, I want them to remember that these are the people that had his or her back and who shared an awesome, one-of-a-kind experience. That goes way beyond work.""Decision Lens sponsors the excursions twice annually during usual work hours. They are paid for in full by the company, which pulled in $6.7 million in revenue last year.Another fun perk: Decision Lens awards top-performing salespeople with custom-made action figures designed to resemble the employee. ""It's a humorous way to acknowledge the great efforts of our sales team, and something that's more memorable than the usual plaque or something like that,"" Saaty says.Jason FellJason Fell is director of native content for Entrepreneur, managing the Entrepreneur Partner Studio, which creates dynamic and compelling content for our partners.

/article/220513,Why Your Business Should Be a Great Workplace,"In their own words, seven leaders say what inspires them to strive to become a great workplace, despite the competing demands of business today.","Owners have a lot on their plate, so why add being a great workplace? Amidst the hundreds of decisions and discussions demanding attention daily, it seems natural that an owner's focus would fall solely on keeping the lights on, and not employees' experiences.Yet even in today's economic uncertainty, many owners still make it a priority.To find out why, we asked some of leaders of the companies that made our annual Top Small Companies to Work For 2011 list. Their motivations ranged widely, from outpacing the innovation curve to just creating a workplace they enjoy.The Top Small Companies to Work For 2011  Here's what they said:Happy employees, happy customers: ""It's hard to get your dream job. But most people can and do enjoy their work if they can get personal satisfaction from it and do it in a pleasant environment. So if we've created the best workplace possible, the natural result of that is happy employees making customers happy, which usually has a positive effect on the bottom line, making it easier to improve the work environment. That's a win all the way around, and it's exciting to keep that wheel turning."" -- Tim Hohmann, ""company captain,"" AutomationDirect
	 Internal brand excellence: ""We live and work in a very different environment than companies did even five years ago.  The pace of innovation and use of technology in business, especially with social media, means that a company's internal 'brand' for its employees is as important, if not more important, than its external brand image.  Word gets around very quickly about the company culture."" -- John Saaty, chief executive officer, Decision LensAvoiding the mistakes of others: ""I had worked for other people and other companies for 15 years before I started FatWallet, so I had plenty of experience and motivation to not do it that way."" -- Tim Storm, founder and CEO, FatWallet
	 Personal values: ""I like making people happy. It's one of the reasons I'm in the game business in the first place. What we do as a company is to provide millions of people with entertaining experiences. In other words, Insomniac makes gamers happy. But on a personal level, I feel even more fulfilled seeing the people on our team truly enjoying themselves."" -- Ted Price, president and CEO, Insomniac GamesRun a better business: ""Building trust through consistent two-way communication is at the heart of a great workplace. The bi-product of listening to your employees, soliciting their input on a regular and consistent basis is that we learn how to run the business better. They become the catalysts of great changes in our business."" -- Dwight Cooper, CEO, Professional Placement Resources
	 Maximize potential: ""Personally, I want to maximize life, and I want our organization to maximize its opportunity and life in its own right. The best way to ensure that any organization maximizes its potential is to get the right people on the bus and then to provide them with an incredible culture in which to thrive -- one in which they love coming to work every day, are getting better every day because of the people they're rubbing shoulders with, and one that they want to strongly recommend to other all-stars.  It doesn't guarantee success, but it gives you a heck of a lot better chance for it than if you don't have it."" -- Shawn Boyer, CEO, Snagajob.com
	 Being part of something great: ""Walking through the doors of Upshot every day and feeling the positive mojo that our great culture and happy, engaged people generate motivates me the most. You feel it immediately, that sense of something exceptional happening here. That's a great feeling that I want to perpetuate. I also believe that being a great place to work is the difference between being a good company and a great company. When a company truly cares about its people, nurtures the culture, defines the purpose, creates a great environment and offers challenging work, great things happen.

/article/220462,Employees' Facebook Posts Give Businesses Heartburn,Facebook posts about work may be protected speech -- giving small employers more of a reason to seek professional advice when crafting a social-media policy.,"Free Webinar | August 16thFind out how to optimize your website to give your customers experiences that will have the biggest ROI for your business.							Register Now  Ever since social networking took root in U.S. offices, disgruntled employees have lodged more than 100 complaints with the National Labor Relations Board claiming their bosses have stifled their online freedom of expression.What was once contained to gossip and gripes around the office water cooler has evolved into punitive postings by employees on their Facebook walls and elsewhere online. And these online musings pose a big problem for employers who feel handcuffed or confused by laws that limit their ability to quash such social networking shenanigans.But last week, in what might be perceived as a small victory for businesses plagued by negative employee commentary on the Internet, an NLRB administrative law judge supported a Lake Bluff, Ill., car dealership's firing of a salesman for the messages he posted on Facebook.In this case, Robert Becker, a salesman for Knauz BMW, chided his employer for serving inexpensive food at a customer event to launch a new model automobile. His Facebook post mockingly lauded the dealership for going ""all out"" by serving guests ""an overcooked wiener and a stale bun,"" as well as ""semi-fresh apples and oranges and the $2 cookie plate from Sam's Club.""On the same day, Becker posted photos on his Facebook wall of a Land Rover at an adjacent dealership also owned by his employer that was accidentally driven into a pond. In this case, Becker posted such comments as, ""This is your car: This is your car on drugs."" His fellow employees joined in, including a sales adviser who wrote, ""Finally, some action at our Land Rover store.""Unfortunately for Becker who had the offending Facebook wall, his manager was made aware of the posts. Becker was called into his manager's office, told to delete the offending posts -- which he did -- and was subsequently fired.As I reported in July of this year, Becker filed a complaint with the NLRB, and in a hearing before an administrative law judge, his commentary about the sales event was found to be protected speech because he was expressing his concerns about the terms and conditions of his job. The judge determined that Becker was worried about his commissions as a result of what he termed a shoddy meal for potential clients.However, the latest ruling found Becker's photos and commentary about the Land Rover accident were not protected because they had nothing to do with the conditions of his employment. If Becker's Facebook posts had been ""concerted"" activities -- which are activities by employees who are united in pursuit of a common goal -- he might have also been protected.The judge found Becker's former employer's handbook to have overly broad rules regarding employee participation in interviews or answering questions regarding employee issues. As a result, the judge ordered Karl Knauz Motors, Inc., to post a notice to all employees informing them of their right to engage in protected concerted activity.This latest NLRB decision only echoes my repeated suggestion that employers consult with legal counsel to create social media-related policies when setting up or revamping employee policies and guidelines. And that's because, as we've discovered, protected speech can be found in the strangest of places.How have you dealt with employees airing their gripes via social media?

/article/220377,How 'Working Spouse' Rules Can Save a Company Money -- And Headaches,Employers can save money by creating 'working-spouse carve-outs' encouraging employees to use their spouse's health-insurance plans.,"						This story appears in the October 2011 issue of Entrepreneur. Subscribe  A robust benefits package, with options that include spouses and other family members, can be an important tool in recruiting and retaining the best employees. But without clear policies that spell out your company's guidelines with regard to working spouses, divorce and other issues, your business could end up incurring needless expenses or damage employee relationships, says Matthew McDermott, an employee benefits consultant with Landmark Group of Brighton, a Rochester, N.Y., insurance agency and benefits consulting firm.One of the key areas where employers can save money is by creating working spouse ""carve-outs,"" says Jeffrey Kraut, an independent certified public accountant from Commack, N.Y. In other words, the company sets a policy that if a working spouse has the option of health insurance through his or her employer, he or she must take advantage of that plan rather than choose his or her spouse's plan.""At one company where I worked, we actually sent notices to all employees saying that if the spouse could provide proof that he or she was covered under another policy, we would give them a check each year the spouse was covered elsewhere for $1,000,"" Kraut says. Since coverage of a spouse could cost several thousand dollars a year beyond the employee's contribution, that hefty sum made financial sense, he says.Companies also need to have clear policies for adding and removing spouses and other dependents from policies, McDermott says, especially in emotionally charged situations like divorce. McDermott says he's seen situations in which an angry spouse wants an estranged husband or wife removed from a policy immediately. Those extreme reactions are not wise and could leave the business open to liability, especially if there is a legal provision that the spouse maintain coverage until a certain point, such as when the divorce is finalized.""In this type of situation, I've seen companies prohibit action until the next open enrollment period or until there is some type of legal document that outlines everyone's responsibilities regarding coverage,"" he says.Any policy or guideline must be in compliance with state and federal laws, McDermott says. Once the employer is sure that compliance requirements are met, Kraut says, the policies need to be put in writing and made available to all employees.

/article/220416,How to Recruit a Great Programmer as a Partner,Follow these three steps to land a top-notch software engineer for your tech startup.,"Free Webinar | August 16thFind out how to optimize your website to give your customers experiences that will have the biggest ROI for your business.							Register Now  So you have the next great technology business idea, but you don't have a background in programming. You'll need to recruit a programmer who not only can design, write and test online and mobile code, but also share your passion and bring your vision to life. Your initial idea might be to hire a consultant or outsource those duties, but you may want to consider bringing on a software developer as a partner.Hiring a software developer as an employee isn't always easy. Due to the proliferation of companies seeking web and mobile application developers, the best programmers are in high demand, says Amy Hoover, executive vice president and partner at Atlanta-based Talent Zoo, an advertising, marketing and technology recruitment service. And, if, like most startups, you don't have the resources to pay a great software engineer a salary on par with what a company like Google can pay, then you're probably at a disadvantage. Software engineer salaries in the U.S. can range from $53,000 to more than $140,000 per year, according to EngineerSalary.com. While some entrepreneurs opt to save money by outsourcing programming duties to companies overseas, Hoover says complications can outweigh benefits. ""These programmers sometimes disappear in the middle of a project, or right afterward, which leaves no safety net or ongoing support,"" she says. Language barriers and time differences can also present challenges, she says.Instead, startups are recruiting programmers by making them co-founders and partners. Having an equity stake and the freedom to shape the technical direction of the startup can be big incentives to landing a great, full-time programmer, Hoover says.Here are three steps to recruiting a top-notch software engineer for your startup:1. Network aggressively.(L to R) Elliot Kroo, Jessica Scorpio, and Sam Zaid of GetaroundPhoto courtesy of Charles Eshelman/Getty Images for AOLUnless you already have a cache of talented software engineers in your network, you'll need to start meeting some. Start by searching professional networking sites like LinkedIn or by making contacts at industry events.In 2009, while developing San Francisco-based Getaround, Sam Zaid and co-founder Jessica Scorpio were searching for a software engineer to build their web site and mobile app. The service allows people in need of a car to rent one from a community of car owners.Zaid and Scorpio attended an event for iPhone developers in San Francisco in hopes of finding a developer. The pair held two-minute group interviews with more than a 100 engineers. That's how they met their future programmer, Elliot Kroo, who was a software engineer with a company that was later acquired by Google.Related: The Hard Truth About Software LicensingThen there's Yaron Samid, who went directly to information-technology industry experts for hiring advice. In late 2009, Samid was starting New York-based BillGuard, a personal finance service that alerts users to hidden credit-card charges, billing errors and fraud. Samid says he asked a ""rock star chief technology officer, who was my blueprint for the person I wanted to build my company, who he would choose"" as a programmer if he was starting a tech business. He recommended Raphael Ouzan, a then 22-year-old programmer who Samid eventually recruited as his co-founder and chief technology officer.2. Ask programmers to create a prototype from scratch.BillGaurd co-founder and CEO Yaron SamidOnce you've met a software engineer you might want to work with, the next step is to assess his or her technical chops. One way is to ask him or her to write a program from scratch. ""Have them prototype your ideas to get a sense of their speed, accuracy, attention to detail, creativity and, perhaps most importantly, how well you work together,"" says Samid, who is 38. Samid says he and Ouzan brainstormed together for weeks and asked Ouzan to prototype their ideas. Samid liked the results. ""After this exercise, I knew Raphael was the ideal technologist to help me build BillGuard,"" he says.A simple interview usually won't suffice, Getaround's Zaid says. ""You can't simply ask questions because you probably wouldn't know the right answer,"" says Zaid, 32. ""It's kind of like talking to an architect and asking him or her about the best way to construct the foundation for a 50-story building. That wouldn't be a productive conversation for a nontechnical person in that industry.""Related: Mobile App or Mobile Website?Zaid and Scorpio asked a group of five programmers, including Kroo, to create a preliminary version of Getaround's iPhone app as an unpaid tryout. ""We did this not only to screen developers but also to find out what the app might eventually look like,"" he says.To help vet the programmers' work, Zaid recommends calling on someone you know with a technology background to serve as an advisor. In addition to providing you feedback, this advisor ""would ideally be someone an engineer can find commonality with and trust, perhaps more so than a nontech person who doesn't understand the details,"" he says.3. Offer to make him or her a partner. About a month after meeting Kroo, Zaid and Scorpio determined they wanted him to be their chief software engineer. He started working for them on a part-time basis. Kroo eventually left his full-time job to join Getaround after Zaid and Scorpio offered to bring him on full-time as co-founder and director of engineering.""Getaround is a huge opportunity with far greater challenges and a far greater potential impact than your traditional web startup,"" says Kroo. ""Joining and co-founding Getaround in this light was no-brainer.""Related: Camera+: An Apps to Riches StoryWhen courting a key engineer candidate, it's important to explain your business vision and roadmap to achieve it clearly, Zaid recommends. ""Sometimes, engineers might not understand the business side of it,"" he says. ""If you can explain [the business and his or her role] effectively, you're that much closer to being able to convince someone to give your idea all they have.""Zaid says negotiating how much equity to offer depends on a number of factors, including the programmer's experience. ""Bottom line, you want to make sure everyone involved is motivated,"" he says. ""If you bring an engineer on as a partner, you want him or her to feel invested, and the incentive is that they have control to lead the technical vision and execution.""Jason FellJason Fell is director of native content for Entrepreneur, managing the Entrepreneur Partner Studio, which creates dynamic and compelling content for our partners.

/article/220310,The High Cost of Sales Team Turnover,"Lost sales, time and money: High turnover in your sales department is a serious problem. Here's what to do about it.","Even during a time of high unemployment, top salespeople are always in demand, and their skills are easily portable from one sales environment to the next. Losing them to a higher bidder or a more lucrative sales opportunity is too easy to be taken lightly.The cost of hiring a new employee for any position is significant, whether an employee is fired or laid off or leaves voluntarily. The many formulas that calculate such costs vary widely, but can range upward of 200 percent of an employee's annual salary. That includes not only the obvious tangible costs of severance pay, vacation accrual, and job advertising and recruiting fees, but also indirect costs such as the staff time needed for paperwork, recruiting, resume reviews and interviews, and then new-hire orientation and training. Other hard to quantify costs can include customer dissatisfaction, poor employee morale and loss of revenue during transitions.Let's assume the average salary in a given company is $50,000 per year. If the cost of turnover is 150 percent of salary, then the cost would be $75,000 per departing employee. For a company of 100 employees with a 10 percent annual rate of turnover, the annual cost of turnover would be an estimated $750,000.Once you realize what it's costing, in both dollars and people assets, you'll want to seriously consider how to reduce your turnover rate. A first step for reducing turnover is understanding your turnover numbers and issues. Start by answering these four questions.What is your year-over-year average turnover rate?Can you tie significant changes in the rate to the workplace's physical environment?What is your turnover rate compared to your competition?Are there times during the year when people leave more frequently?Answering these questions will help you to begin to understand some aspects of turnover within your sales force and you can start to find ways to reduce turnover in your organization.Another important knowledge-gathering step is to conduct exit interviews and ask why your salespeople leave. While it can be difficult to get candid answers -- employees often realize there's nothing to be gained by saying anything negative -- asking exiting employees to rate factors on a scale of 1 to 5 can point to the problems in a more objective and equally productive manner. You can ask them, for example, to rate the level of sales support, management support, fairness of sales goals and fairness of compensation. Design your questions to determine whether you are creating an environment that salespeople can thrive in.Related: The Hidden Costs of Employee TurnoverIf you find those leaving feel that sales quotas are unattainable, that they can't live on their compensation between sales, or that they simply think they can make more money someplace else, you'll have a better understanding of what you can do to change the environment.A great deal of employee turnover can be attributed to mistakes made during the hiring process. The problem lies in the employee selection process. Simply put, when you hire people for the wrong job, they leave.There are hiring practices you can implement that will help reduce your turnover and increase retention of your best people. Here are a few:Make attracting high-performers part of your ongoing business practices so you are always ""hire ready.""Define your hiring criteria, including the job description, so that you hire the right people for the job.Learn how to screen resumes for top performers.Give your hiring managers the skills they need to do the job right.Gather the right kind of data to ensure your candidates have the requisite skills.Create a consistent and thorough interview and selection process.Hire salespeople by looking at three areas: experience, technical skills, and communication skills and problem-solving skills.Too often hiring managers glean valuable insights into employee preferences, strengths and weaknesses during the hiring process and then fail to use the information as a resource to help develop and retain the employee. So rather than focusing exclusively on hiring, you should also begin to think about how to develop sales staff immediately. All that you learn during hiring can be used to continually improve the job-person fit.Related: When to Set Sales Performance ReviewsCreating a development plan for your salespeople helps show them what they can do to grow and develop, to advance, to become more valued, and to be more satisfied in their work. Development plans also point out what kind of support and assistance they will need to get where they are going faster.You and your employee will work on the development plan together, but the more involved the employee is in determining the areas to work on, the more committed that individual will be to accomplishing the goals. The objective is to create an environment that encourages continuing feedback from managers, which will help employees advance more quickly, achieve more, avoid unnecessary problems and setbacks -- and stay with your company.This article is an excerpt from the book The Perfect Hire from Entrepreneur Press.Katherine Graham-LevissKatherine Graham-Leviss is the founder of XB Consulting, an executive coaching and business consulting firm based in Rhode Island.

/article/220254,The Hidden Costs of Employee Turnover,A revolving door of workers can take a toll on your company in surprising ways. Here are four that you might not notice.,"						This story appears in the September 2011 issue of Entrepreneur. Subscribe  Employee turnover has some obvious costs associated with it, including recruitment, training and salary. However, every time an employee leaves, there are a variety of hidden costs you might not have considered, says Toronto-based human resources consultant Tom Armour. While you might not be writing a check for these costs, here is how turnover can drain dollars:Slippage. When an employee is missing, the work that isn t getting done has a price attached to it, Armour says. Lost sales, production delays and lags in new product introductions all cost your company money.Ripple effect. Turnover has an impact on the peer group, as well as the management chain, making everyone less effective. Co-workers need to pick up the slack, distracting them from achieving their own performance goals while managers need to devote time to finding a new employee. ""One CEO I spoke with had his five-year growth plan turn into a six-year plan because of delays due to employee turnover,"" Armour says.Customer loss. When a knowledgeable employee leaves, taking experience and customer service ability with him or her, that can have an impact on customer satisfaction. ""Customer commitments are often not met, and the company loses important customers,"" Armour says. ""Dealing with trainees can be challenging. If you have a lot of unwanted turnover, customers can get annoyed or begin to lose interest in your business.""Lost credibility. Turnover is a cost to management in two ways, Armour says: Management can lose credibility when it creates an environment with excessive turnover, and existing employees can become demoralized and decide to move on.It s important for smaller businesses in particular to work on creating environments that retain employees. ""Too often, small-business owners don t consider how important it is to invest time and resources into their employees,"" he says. ""Either way, you pay.""

/article/220278,Are We on the Verge of a Small-Business Hiring Boom?,A new study shows 40 percent of small business owners plan to make a hire in the next six months. Could this be the start of a turnaround in unemployment?,"The unemployment picture has been unrelentingly gloomy for some time now. But one recent study shows that more than 40 percent of small businesses plan to hire in the next six months. Top jobs in demand? Sales and marketing -- nearly half of business owners making hires said they were looking for more staff in this category.Could this be the start of a turnaround in unemployment? We'll see. Beyond the glimmer of hope for jobs, the Pepperdine Private Capital Markets Project's fall 2011 study of more than 7,500 businesses with revenues of less than $5 million provides an interesting look at what's keeping other small businesses from bringing on more staff. It turns out that the list of initiatives for stimulating job creation being pitched by the White House, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and others only partly addresses entrepreneurs' most pressing problems.The business owners surveyed agreed that tax incentives would help -- 23 percent liked that idea. But the top response seems to be absent from many legislators' agendas.Nearly 35 percent of respondents said ""increased access to capital"" would be the change most likely to spur small-business job creation, with bank loans preferred by the vast majority. Loan stimulus and increased SBA guarantees intended to help small businesses tough out the recession expired more than a year ago -- likely far too soon.In the study, more than 1,600 business owners reported they sought a bank loan in the past year, but fewer than half were successful. The owners reported they contacted an average of 2.2 banks and spent between 16 and 24 hours of their time pursuing their loan, making borrowing fairly burdensome and a task with a dubious outcome. Many more owners have stopped trying to get a loan -- which is, in turn, stifling hiring.If you want to weigh in on the Pepperdine study, the survey is ongoing through Sept. 16.What would it take to enable your business to hire more workers?

/article/220236,How to Build a Stellar Team at a High-Potential Startup,Ready to add an employee or 12 to your roster? Put these recruiting and hiring strategies to work for your growing company.,"						This story appears in the September 2011 issue of Entrepreneur. Subscribe  Imagine trying to convince a Yankees star pitcher to join a new, unproven Major League Baseball franchise. An impossible task? Not necessarily. Corey Reese, co-founder and CEO of Ness Computing, took on the tech-world equivalent of the challenge--and succeeded.Reese wanted Apple engineer Scott Goodson, a member of the team that developed the iOS platform for the iPhone and the iPad, to decamp from Apple and join Ness as director of engineering. It was 11 months before Reese got a yes out of Goodson. What did it take?""It was a mutual respect and recognition of each other's situations,"" Reese says. Over many (many) conversations with Goodson, Reese made it clear that the engineer could really shine at Ness, and that he could help solve a problem that had never been tackled by a startup. ""It was more like,  Whenever you're ready to move, let's talk,'"" Reese says, ""and it was definitely worth the time to develop that relationship, because it really does start with hiring great people.""The Los Altos, Calif.-based startup, founded in October 2009, came out of stealth mode late this summer with the release of Ness, an iPhone app that makes personalized, on-the-go recommendations for restaurants (and soon, shopping, travel and night life) based on people's preferences and their friends' activity on social networks. They've raised money from Khosla Ventures, Alsop Louie Partners and the founders of Palantir Technologies, and they count the creators of FarmVille and Mint.com among their advisors. Reese, however, still spends between 30 and 50 percent of his time recruiting talent for his team, which numbers around 15.""If a CEO looks at his function as [finding the employees] to achieve business goals, spending a significant amount of time hiring the very best people for key positions is a great way to run a business,"" says Reese, who spends as much time searching for--and getting to know--potential interns and recent grads as he does looking for industry leaders. ""Great things come out of a culture that combines experience with youth and enthusiasm,"" he says, citing Bill Gates, who hired a similar mix of ""kids"" and ""veterans"" in the early days of Microsoft, as an example.As a former associate at a venture capital firm, Reese leveraged his existing networks at the University of California, Berkeley, and Stanford University--and now also MIT and the University of Texas at Austin--to pinpoint the brightest talent in the freshman and sophomore classes, before Silicon Valley's big guns start competing for their attention. ""Find where your target employees are, and evangelize,"" Reese says. He also established Ness's on-campus reputation by sponsoring engineering ""hackathon"" competitions and by focusing recruitment efforts at a small number of prestigious computer science programs, looking for students interested in ""building stuff,"" rather than just maintaining sky-high GPAs.Hackathons make it easy to spot the best candidates for internships: ""They're the ones everyone goes to when they run into programming problems,"" Reese says. His strategies have paid off. He met two of his three co-founders at a 2009 hackathon--one was the winner, the other an employee of another sponsor--and one of his intern hires built the first version of the Ness app. After the app's basic framework was developed, former Apple staffer Goodson stepped in to turn Ness into a market-ready app and, along the way, mentor the young employees.Reese takes a long-term view of the hiring process. ""Even if you're not looking to fill a specific position, you want to get to know people and build a reputation for when you do need to hire,"" he says, and that includes socializing at events that aren't directly related to recruiting. Ness holds barbecues regularly, inviting potential hires to meet the staff and advisors in an informal setting. People who already have jobs might not respond to an interview request--""but when you say,  Come hang out, bring your friends, have some food,' it's a good way to get people comfortable and talking--and interested in working for you,"" Reese says.Jared Hecht, co-founder of New York City-based GroupMe, says a company's core idea is one of its most valuable assets for recruiting--and retaining--talent. It doesn't matter how many great people you hire if you can't keep their attention, he says. Launched in July 2010, Hecht's mobile group-texting and conference-calling service has raised more than $11 million from investors, has partnerships with Bon Jovi and MTV and sends more than 100 million messages a month.""The biggest key to engaging employees is a great idea,"" Hecht says. ""It's also an excellent litmus test, to see if your idea is good enough to keep brilliant people interested.""GroupMe, which has 20 employees, offers potential hires an ""engineering-centric culture"" that allows them to have creative input, and, more important, to work with smart people who push each other to do better. The idea and the company culture both contributed to two of Hecht's hires, each of whom passed on offers to work for Square, a prestigious startup in the mobile payments space, after consulting with GroupMe for a few weeks: ""They fell in love with the service and ended up joining the team full time,"" Hecht says.The Matchmakers
While companies have long turned to sites like Monster and CareerBuilder to fill open jobs, they're not always the best options for startups--especially those in specialized fields or that require specific skill sets.""After money, the hardest thing to find is the talent,"" says Chris McCann, co-founder of NextDigest, which publishes the StartupDigest newsletters. But, when it comes to recruiting top talent, the employees you want rarely bother with job boards. Most are bombarded by recruiters every day.That's led to a boomlet of niche services for the tech industry, including networking sites like VentureLoop, StartUpers and Startuply, as well as services like Interviewstreet, which tests candidates' programming skills.McCann recently joined the fray with his StartupDigest VIP, which aims to help startups find engineers and designers. The service focuses on bringing together a small pool of startups with prescreened job candidates who specifically want to join a startup. In just the first month, two of 11 users received job offers, and two more were flown out for final interviews. The service is growing fast, and McCann says he'll probably partner with VC firms as he expands.Non-tech businesses have shiny new options, too. Bangalore, India-based Recruiterbox is streamlining the hiring management system for startups and companies with fewer than 30 employees. ""There's a big demand for this,"" says Raj Sheth, who co-founded the company late last year. ""Hiring at startups is often unstructured, and recruitment software is only available to big enterprises."" For a monthly fee of up to $200, depending on the number of job postings, customers get a one-stop spot to post, advertise and manage job listings and applications.The company's stable of paying clients includes Groupon China and Levi's India, and in the U.S., consulting firm 2ndWave. Sheth has also signed on tech startups like Blue Mountain Labs and Cloudscaling, but at least 70 percent of his clients are non-tech companies.Sheth advises founders to pay special attention when posting job ads, because often it's the first impression candidates get of a company. He recommends posting in relevant places, like a niche startup board or through an incubator like TechStars or Y Combinator, which will yield more responses from candidates who understand what to expect when signing on with a startup--more equity than salary, a big job footprint and a ton of risk.Next, spend as much time writing the job description as a motivated candidate would responding to it. ""You're not hiring for a normal job,"" Sheth says. Be articulate and communicate the expectations, but also make sure to introduce the company properly, so you can filter for candidates who are aligned with your culture.As historian and explorer Sir Walter Raleigh once noted, ""The employer generally gets the employees he deserves."" All the more reason to do it right at a startup, where every hire makes an exponential difference.Hire Traits[The Academic]
What happens to a great idea without a good team behind it? ""It goes nowhere,"" declares Teresa Amabile, Harvard Business School professor and author of The Progress Principle: Using Small Wins to Ignite Joy, Engagement, and Creativity at Work. While researching her book, Amabile asked 12,000 people to keep diaries of their thoughts at work, including their feelings about their co-workers and bosses. She found four essential elements for ""high-potential"" startups looking to assemble a stellar team.Diverse thinking styles. You need risk-takers who can create and move forward with lots of new ideas, as well as practical thinkers who can figure out how to implement those ideas on time and under budget.Complementary skills. A tech company that wants to delve into social media, for instance, might consider hiring someone with a psychology or communications background for a more well-rounded perspective. ""Redundancy,"" Amabile says, ""is a sure way to kill creativity.""A ""translator."" It's absolutely critical to find someone who can effectively communicate with both the risk-takers and the practical thinkers. Personality clashes and the time suck of office dramas arise when there's no bridge.Yourself. Time and resources are constrained at startups, so roll up your sleeves. Keep employees motivated by constantly communicating your goals. ""Create an environment where everybody understands where you're going, so people know what they need to make progress every day,"" Amabile says. ""Effective startups have to pivot and change, but the work will feel meaningful as long as people understand what their contribution is.""[The Entrepreneur]

""In a startup, you can get to bare metal after one mistake, and not everyone is suited for that environment."" But that doesn't mean you should hire only Type A players--you need leaders and followers, he says, as long as they are:Energetic.

/article/220287,Labor Ruling Is a Reminder to Revisit Social Media Policies,A recent decision suggests it's time to consult with counsel regarding the legality of your social media policies.,"Free Webinar | August 16thFind out how to optimize your website to give your customers experiences that will have the biggest ROI for your business.							Register Now  Providing guidelines on how employees should refer to work on social media sites is smart. But firing staffers for what they post about your company is a big no-no.
Employees who openly participate in a Facebook conversation about the terms and conditions of their employment -- including defending their job performance -- are protected under the Wagner Act (a.k.a. National Labor Relations Act). 
A National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) administrative law judge ordered Hispanics United of Buffalo to reinstate five employees -- with back pay -- asserting the workers were unlawfully fired by the Buffalo, N.Y.-based organization. The decision is the latest in an increasing number of charges (14 recent cases) involving social media policies that have been submitted to the NLRB for resolution.
In four of the cases involving Facebook, employees were found to have engaged in protected concerted activity. In five other cases involving either Facebook or Twitter, the employees received no such protection. And in another five instances, some portions of the employers  social media policies were determined to be too broad.
In the most recent case, Hispanics United of Buffalo, a provider of social services to Latinos living in western New York, was accused of unlawfully discharging five employees who defended their job performance online while being critical of the conditions under which they worked. The turmoil began when a co-worker -- an advocate for domestic violence victims -- was critical of another employee, claiming she wasn t doing enough to help clients.In response, the targeted employee asked four co-workers how they felt about the charge, and when they responded to her Facebook page posting, the employer fired those coworkers as well as the employee who sought the initial solicitation for comment. Hispanics United claimed those comments constituted harassment of the employee who first brought up the complaint about a fellow worker on her Facebook posting. That employee told the executive director that she considered her coworkers  Facebook comments to be ""cyber-bullying"" and harassing behavior.
And while there was swearing and sarcasm sprinkled among the various Facebook responses, the administrative law judge found the conversation to be objectively innocuous. The Sept. 2 decision determined the employees' online discussion was ""protected concerted activity"" because it involved conversations among coworkers about their terms and conditions of employment, and those conversations included their job performance and staffing levels.
The judge ordered the reinstatement of the five employees with back pay. He also required the organization to post a notice at its facility concerning employee rights under the National Labor Relations Act.
I ve written about several NLRB opinions and decisions regarding social media over the past year. This latest ruling further underscores my view that business owners and HR directors should keep pace with the NLRB when it comes to employee rights. If you still think you can limit what your employees say about your company through social media and user-generated content posted online, you are sorely mistaken.
Your best bet is to meet with your company's legal counsel and establish a set of sound and reasonable social media-related policies and guidelines. And since thinking about it is not an action, pick up the phone and get cracking -- before you find yourself in the same situation as the folks in Buffalo.What is the best way you've found to help keep work out of your employees' online commentary?

But there's something that can make your workers happy again that costs a lot less than free food or gifts.It's in the mirror, and it is you.I consult with businesses owners across the U.S. on improving worker morale, and I've seen bosses drain their employees' souls right out of their bodies.

Every business owner or workplace manager I have ever met has had room to improve.Entrepreneurs can be the worst because the very attributes that made them self-starters -- that short attention span, multitasking, risk-taking personality -- means there's little patience to set up procedures, or build trust with the employees who actually have the skills they don't.Can business owners still luck out and find success while being difficult bosses? Of course they can, but I would bet every time on the entrepreneur who has experienced failure and gained self-awareness as a result.Related: Four Ways to Foster Fairness in the WorkplaceHere are five questions entrepreneurs should ask themselves about their management styles, but often don't.1. How do you say thank you? I'm continually amazed by how many employers think just because a worker gets a paycheck, that's enough. At the same time, I'm also amazed by those business owners who demonstrate small acts of kindness. In this age of email and text messages, the power of the handwritten note is just outstanding. Tuck one of those in with the paycheck, and don't just say thank you. Specifically explain what it is that they do that you like.2. How do you communicate change? The human brain is geared toward loving the familiar. Change creates fear that becomes an impediment. Communicate a change in the company in an ask/assertive versus a tell/assertive way. I like the dialogue that comes with verbal communication. Explain why the change is needed, and then ask for input on the best ways to get from point A to point B.3. How often do you catch your employees doing something right? Most of us at work are like parents. We're expecting our employees to mess something up. It's little wonder then that the workers quickly start using the third word that children are most likely to learn after ""Mama"" and ""Dada,"" and that is, ""No."" Don't wait until a formal performance evaluation to tell an employee what he or she is doing well. Tell them now, and be specific.Related: Six Tips for Breaking Bad News4. How do you see your employees? I used to count the dandelions in my lawn every spring and try to kill every one of them, until my daughter asked if she could pick them and make a bouquet. That's when I stopped looking for dandelions. You should, too, with your businesses. If you keep on asking whether your workers are wasting time on Facebook or stealing office supplies, you will find proof, as surely as I used to find those silly flowers. Instead, look out for your employees doing something right, and tell them every once in a while. It will make their day.5. How do you structure and focus on action for your employees? I once had a client who owned a five-employee company and was confused why one of his workers couldn't handle customer calls on top of managing timekeeping and scheduling for the office. I persuaded him to take over the job for a day, and he was amazed at the number of customer calls coming in. He never knew. Study after study finds multitasking is inversely proportional to productivity. Put yourself in your workers' shoes and make sure various tasks are similar enough that they can find time to focus on each one and complete it.As a business owner, I've asked myself all these questions from time to time. I've hired high-quality workers over the years who know who's in charge but also aren't afraid to ask me why I'm not following the advice in one of my books. I try to foster a rewarding workplace, one you can have, too.Related: Seven Ways to Boost Employee Morale

/article/220175,Avoid These Interview Mistakes,Employees can make or break your success as a small business owner. Here's how to make better hires.,"One of the trickiest tasks you'll have as a small business owner is hiring employees. The interview process might seem straightforward enough, but business owners often slip up when talking to candidates.""Hiring people is the most important thing you can do by and large as far as negatively affecting your business,"" says Bill Driscoll, New England district president for Robert Half International, a specialized global staffing firm.Related: How to Give New Hires a Great StartThat means it s critical to prepare before interviewing for a job opening. Here are four common mistakes first-time business owners make when talking to job candidates   and how to fix them.Mistake No. 1: You get too personal. When it comes to questions you want to avoid during a job interview, anything that could be perceived as possibly discriminatory ought to be at the top of your list, according to Driscoll. While it s important to understand where a person is coming from, you never want to ask a job candidate's age, nationality, religion, or marital status, for example. Those questions can be perceived as discriminatory and put your business at risk, he says.And while it might seem obvious not to ask an interviewee's nationality, for example, some entrepreneurs don't realize questions that may come up in small talk can also be dangerous, says Vickie Causa, CEO of CausaAssociates, LLC, a New York-based HR consulting firm. For example, avoid asking seemingly innocuous questions like whether or not a candidate has kids or what organizations they belong to.Of course you'll want to know if there's anything stopping potential employees from coming into the office when you need them, but phrase those questions carefully. Rather than asking if someone has young kids or observes any holidays, ask if there are any restrictions that would stop that person from working on the weekends, Causa says. ""You can find anything out about someone if you ask the question the right way,"" she says.Related: Four Ways to Foster Fairness in the WorkplaceMistake No. 2: You ask canned questions.While it's important to avoid asking pointed questions about a candidate's personal background, staying too general is also a bad move, says Driscoll. ""Lots of people can do great for fifteen minutes to an hour in an interview, particularly if you're asking general interview questions,"" he says.Sticking to behavioral questions will help you get more candid and useful answers, says J.T. O'Donnell, founder of the career advice blog, Careerealism.com. Rather than asking interviewees to tell you about themselves, for example, she suggests asking about their greatest personal achievement and how they accomplished it. You can learn a lot about candidates' work ethic and level of commitment by focusing on their experiences rather than their family or the organizations they belong to, she says. Related Video: How to Find Dedicated EmployeesMistake No. 3: You gloss over the demands of the job.Many small business owners are afraid to tell job candidates about the long work hours required, afraid that might scare them away. ""It's amazing how many entrepreneurs don't want to be honest about how much they are expecting of their employees,"" O'Donnell says.Being open about how often new hires will need to be in the office is a detail every small business owner should make clear from the onset. If work hours seem too unreasonable to discuss, you probably need to reevaluate your expectations, she says. But not being forthright about the commitment is a big mistake, she says.Related: Do Your Employees Feel Overworked?Mistake No. 4: You're too open with rejected candidates.Once you've interviewed and turned a handful of people down for a position, chances are someone will call up asking why they didn't get the job. Often small business owners want to be helpful by offering constrictive criticism, but O'Donnell advises against it. Instead tell rejected candidates you found someone who was a better fit and leave it at that.""When you decide to pass on people, a good number of them are going to be convinced it was some sort of discrimination,"" says O'Donnell. ""They're just going to read between the lines and you don't want that."" Overall, the interview process is an opportunity for you to really get to know prospective employees and determine if they're a fit for your company. Remember to always be frank about your expectations and the company culture. ""You can't afford to make a mistake in a hire,"" says Causa. ""There's a lot of information you want to get about somebody but you have to be careful how you ask the questions."" Jane PorterJane Porter is a freelance writer and editor based in Brooklyn, NY.

/article/220155,Tips For Planning an Exit from Your Small Business,"If you're thinking about leaving your business behind, some careful planning up front can make it a smooth transition that ensures your company thrives after you're gone.","Sick of fighting for business in the down economy? For some business owners, hard times may force you to wonder whether it's time to cash in and move on -- or at least, sell a stake to someone who might eventually buy you out.
If you're thinking about leaving your business behind, some careful planning up front can make it a smooth transition that ensures your company thrives after you're gone. Here are five tips on how to make a graceful exit from Suzanne Bates, executive coach and author of the upcoming book Discover Your CEO Brand: Secrets to Embracing and Maximizing Your Unique Value as a Leader:Work on a succession plan. What do you want to happen after you leave? Write up a plan that spells out your wishes. If you're considering passing on or selling the business to a family member or employee, notify them of your intentions. Ensure that your plan answers questions about who will be in charge, how much of a stake they will acquire and at what cost. It should also offer a timeline for the transfer of power.
 Groom a successor. The world of family business is full of sad stories about owners who suddenly decide to retire and drop the business into the lap of a brother or daughter with little training or notice. Start teaching your heir apparent about the business's operations and finances now, and assume it may take many months or even a year or two to pass on all the knowledge. Notice their weak points and either train or hire professionals to help. If they have poor customer-service skills, for instance, you want to fix that before you hand off the baton.
 Create a great communicator. Your successor needs top-of-the-line communication skills to influence clients, vendors, employees and others. If you don't build this skill, Bates says, it's like the ""substitute-teacher"" phenomenon: the kids will act up, not listen and accomplish little until either the sub builds confidence, or the ""permanent teacher"" -- you -- return to clean up the mess.
 Show your faith. If you don't instill confidence in the proposed successor and demonstrate to workers that you trust this person to take over and keep the business growing, you're sowing the seeds of future problems. Make sure everyone knows who your choice is and that you're excited about how this new leader will approach the business.
 Let them be who they are. Your leader should not try to mimic your personal style or your management style. The new leader needs his or her own vision and approach. Leaders with their own strong brand will be better able to succeed as they take over the top role.My tip: Think of letting go in stages, if possible. Even if you're selling to an outsider, you may want to negotiate for a transitional consulting/training period where you're still on board.Are you thinking of selling your business?

/article/220112,How Checklists Can Save Lives -- and Your Business,Tips to use five-step procedures as a management tool to improve your business.,"If checklists with a simple mandate like ""wash your hands"" can keep scores of hospital patients from dying, imagine what they can do to improve your business outcomes.Scott Jacobson, president of Sightline Business Advisors and the architect of solution-driven business processes, says, ""Don t roll your eyes. I have yet to find any business that doesn t benefit by using checklists as a management tool.""The genius behind hospital checklists
A decade ago, Johns Hopkins critical care specialist Dr. Peter Pronovost adapted the lockstep process that aviators follow to land a plane into a five-step checklist for reducing infection when placing central venous catheters in intensive care patients.Explaining his groundbreaking work in a 2010 New York Times article by Claudia Dreifus, Pronovost said, ""It seemed to me that if you looked for the most important safety measures and found some way to make them routine, it could change the picture. The checklist we developed was simple.""In a New Yorker article titled ""The Checklist,"" Dr. Atul Gawande reported that to doctors, ""these steps are no-brainers."" Yet over a month-long observation, ""In more than a third of the patients, they skipped at least one."" Once the checklist was established and enforced, however, ""The ten-day line-infection rate went from 11 percent to zero,"" saving lives, saving money and earning Dr. Pronovost a 2008 MacArthur Fellowship, commonly known as a ""genius"" grant.Transplanting checklists into the business arena
""Whenever I see simple things that everyone agrees should be done but never seem to get done, I see an opportunity for a checklist,"" says Jacobson. ""For example, everyone generally agrees that getting testimonials is a good thing, but few actively ask for them. Making testimonials part of closing out a job guarantees the customer is asked.""Likewise:When an employee or small group has long performed an important role with little guidance, a checklist helps capture and preserve knowledge.When a project has to pass between departments, a checklist is the most basic form of agreement on what is important and how to communicate it.Checklists improve the outcome of infrequently conducted processes that otherwise may seem overwhelming or without a clear launch approach.Checklists establish regular patterns for communication, including meeting and sales-call preparation.As an example, Jacobson cites a pricing-change checklist. ""Pricing can be a very emotional process. A checklist forces consideration of all factors, including the subjective. For example: Determine average costs; estimate expected volume versus price; calculate price from costs and desired gross margin; determine breakeven point; rank price position (for instance, at least 30 percent over Competitor A and 10 percent under Competitor B); adjust for strategic objectives; compare prices and record reactions; set price.""Prescribing checklists to strengthen your businessStart by asking yourself these questions:Which processes contribute most significantly to your business success?Where are your most critical danger points?Where do mistakes most frequently occur?Use your answers to devise checklists that eliminate errors, improve outcomes, protect against staff turnover disruption, and -- the bonus outcome  -- create systems that add value to your business.In his white paper ""Use This Checklist or People Die!,"" Jacobson provides this checklist for creating a checklist:Target areas that are underperforming.Establish a benchmark for improvement.Document the sequence of tasks for each person involved.Prioritize each task and identify those that are essential.Identify every area where a decision is made or judgment is required.Implement a checklist and measure results.Create a checklist for future edits -- don't assume you will get it right the first time.""Start with a known problem area for guaranteed buy-in. Then keep it simple with a short list,"" Jacobson says, warning, ""Complexity kills checklists.""Finally, give every team member the right to intervene when a step is skipped. ""Wash your hands"" is, as the medical community knows, a ""no-brainer,"" but doing it without fail is pure genius.Barbara Findlay SchenckBarbara Findlay Schenck is a small-business strategist, the author of Small Business Marketing for Dummies and the co-author of Branding for Dummies, Selling Your Business for Dummies and Business Plans Kit for Dummies.Read more",Growth Strategies,2011-08-12 00:01:00
/article/220151,How To Smooth a Rejected Job Applicant's Feathers,Job seekers can hold a grudge if you reject them for a position. Here's how to avoid their fury.,"To follow-up on our recent post about do's and don'ts of using social media to screen new hires, when your company uses social media channels to both source and screen new talent, you must consider that your applicants can turn right around and use those same channels to your disadvantage. In other words, if you screw up the interview process or treat job seekers with disregard or disrespect, you could find yourself the target of a rash of unwanted publicity.
For this reason, it's most important to capture and promote good feedback from candidates who apply for a job with your company, says Lisa Chartier, U.S. head of resourcing communications for Alexander Mann Solutions, a provider of recruitment process outsourcing solutions. Her firm just published Candidates, Consumers and Your Global Brand, a white paper looking at the impact of the job candidate's experience on consumer perceptions of businesses and brands.
If a job candidate is treated poorly during the interview process, your company risks alienating a customer -- a potential evangelist of your product or service. The AMS white paper claims such ill-treated job candidates are more than willing to share their tale of woe online, and, as we know, social networking enables them to do so quickly, reaching a large number of people with the click of a button.Specifically, the report says that 77 percent of job seekers are likely to tell people either within their profession or friends (or both) if they have a negative experience when applying for a job. And 52 percent say a bad interview would likely influence their buying decisions from that organization in the future. Only 10 percent of job applicants say such an unpleasant experience would not affect their opinion of the company.
The best-of-all-worlds solution, of course, is to make sure applicants leave the hiring process with their heads held high to ensure continued loyalty or, at the very least, apathy toward your company and brand.
Chartier says organizations need to remember that positive feedback doesn't travel far on its own, so it's important to capture and promote good feedback from job candidates. For example, you could post quantitative data on the careers page of your website from candidate feedback surveys, developing statistics like ""95 percent of job candidates say the application process was positive and constructive.""
You should also coddle your applicants. ""Email the ones who aren't hired and tell them the position has been filled by someone who fits the role perfectly -- and then tell them why,"" says Chartier. She suggests letting them know what areas you'd like to see them improve, which gives the unsuccessful applicant a feeling that they're still connected to your organization and that you really were paying attention during the interview process.
And if you've narrowed the field down to two or three candidates, send the losing applicants sample products, a thank you note, and an invitation to stay in touch for future opportunities.How else can a business successfully deflect a job applicant's social media-fueled rant?

/article/220147,Do's and Don'ts of Using Social Media to Screen New Hires,"If your HR department or hiring manager is thinking about vetting job applicants via social media sites, consider these consequences.","Free Webinar | August 16thFind out how to optimize your website to give your customers experiences that will have the biggest ROI for your business.							Register Now  Using social media to find new employees is one thing, but making a prospect fork over their Facebook credentials as part of a background check is something else entirely.
More than one half of employers use social media sites to recruit potential candidates, up from just over a third in 2008, according to a June poll from the Society for Human Resource Management.More and more these days, however, employers are taking the practice one step further by asking applicants for their Facebook logins as part of the screening process. As recently as two years ago, the city of Bozeman, Mont., required job applicants to supply username and password information for their social media-related accounts. In this instance, public outrage quickly curtailed that policy.
While it's not illegal to ask job applicants for access to their password-protected accounts -- the day will come, I suspect, when a jobseeker sues a prospective employer for violating the Stored Communications Act. That law limits the compelled disclosure of stored wire and electronic communications and transactional records held by Internet-related service providers such as Facebook and Google.If you're not already cringing in your chair or your company is considering the use of social media when vetting job applicants, here are do's and don ts to be aware of:Do have someone other than the ultimate decision-maker conduct the background check, says Eric B. Myers, a partner in the Labor and Employment Group at Dilworth Paxson, LLP, and the author of The Employer Handbook Blog. He points out that if someone other than the hiring manager does the background check, the company may be able to insulate itself against claims of discrimination. Myers also suggests that if, for instance, a Facebook photo shows the applicant smoking marijuana, the background checker could mark  no  on a non-specific checklist that asks,  uses good judgment,  as doing so is less specific than jotting down  the applicant smokes dope,  which may in fact not even turn out to be true.
 Do let applicants know that you re going to be checking their social-media profiles -- and it doesn t hurt to mention it in your advertisement for the job opening.
 Do inform applicants if a third party will be conducting the background check. The Fair Credit Report Act requires applicants to signoff, regardless of whether a password or username is needed to access your profile, if a third party conducts the check. Fail to disclose to the applicant that someone other than an employee at your own firm is conducting the background check, and you open yourself up to a lawsuit, Myers points out.
 Don t compel a job applicant to break a website s terms or conditions of use. Many social-media utilities and websites prohibit their users from sharing login information with third parties. Do this and you and the applicant could face a lawsuit from Facebook and be found by federal authorities to be in violation of the Stored Communications Act.
 Don t rely on your company s social-media policy when it comes to job applicants because applicants aren t covered by the same policies as employees.
 Don t forget to check with your company s legal counsel before instituting a new hiring practice connected to social media. This remains a very fluid area with new rules and interpretations occurring at a rapid pace.How have you encountered other do's or don'ts when using social media to screen new hires?

/answer/222344,How Do I Chart a Path for Employee Growth?,,"																																	It is commendable that you are thinking ahead to be sure that individual contributors have the chance to advance on their respective career paths. Many companies fail to do that and discourage or lose great resources. Technically-capable professionals should be able to earn commensurate with their level of contribution to the company without having to risk losing their finely-honed skills by taking the management route.
To get started, you should have accurate job descriptions for your existing staff and develop an organizational plan -- including projected hiring dates -- for the future. Often, putting together a series of organization charts, for example, by quarter is helpful in planning out your company's future growth. 
As you have already identified the three ladders, you should develop job descriptions for the job families that will come into being as you continue to expand your staff.
Job families in large companies might look like: Scientist I (being the entry level job); Scientist II (requiring more education/experience/training); and Scientist III (being the most senior individual contributor job in this family reserved for the most expert.  
Just as with top management, there should be very few at the extremely senior level in any job family. The same kind of levels with job families can be used -- albeit with titles appropriate to the roles -- for the administrative and management arenas. 
Of course, as your company is not a large one, you can be more creative with the titles while still following the theme of a junior employee, a journeyman and a most senior level in each job family. And, there is nothing to preclude having more than three levels, if you need these.
Management of your career ladders will require that you adopt a sound job evaluation system that links to a salary grade chart so that you are paying properly for each position -- not only now, but as people progress within the same job and receive merit increases to their base pay or bonuses for their contributions and/or are promoted to higher levels in the organization. 
You should work with a compensation expert to help you construct your plans. Your employees will feel more confident knowing that you took the extra time and expense to do this in a meticulous manner.

/article/219833,Would You Give All Your Employees A Raise?,"Raises have been few and far between in the past few years, but here's why Google gave all its workers a 10 percent raise this year.","Raises have been few and far between in the past few years, but one company that broke from the pack recently is Google. The online-search giant gave all its workers a 10 percent raise this year.Crazy? That was the assessment of Stacey Carroll, director of professional services at the salary-data firm PayScale. Then she went to a presentation at a recent World at Work conference, where Google's human-resource team explained their reasoning.Google's team presented at a session called ""Using Statistical Research to Change Compensation Strategy."" Here's her report on how Google decided to give its universal raise:First, the company surveyed all of their employees, getting a 90 percent response rate. They asked about all the elements of the compensation package and how workers valued each one. Among the findings: Staff valued bonuses less than a boost in their base salary.Then, Google went out to benchmark its performance against similar companies in its industry. They arrived at figures for what would represent the 90th percentile of pay for each position. The raise was primarily about that -- not rewarding individual performance, but keeping the company a most-desired workplace in its sector and not losing top talent to competitors.""It was about raising all of their salaries to levels that exceed the competition's,"" Carroll wrote on the PayScale blog, Compensation Today.I know what you're thinking: What about the slackers? Why should they get raises? Underperformance is viewed at Google as a management problem, separate from compensation issues. Low performers are put on a performance-improvement plan. About one quarter improve their performance through this process, Carroll reports, while half end up being moved to a different role within the company that better suits them. The final quarter of underperformers ends up leaving -- usually on their own accord.The end result: loser employees depart, so they don't end up getting the raise anyway. The majority of problem staffers improve performance and end up earning their salary bump.Meanwhile, you can imagine the excitement and the retention gains reaped by instituting such a widespread salary raise. Some of that raise has to come back in recruiting-cost savings.Would you give your staff an across-the-board raise?

/article/219759,How Entrepreneurs Can Lure Top Talent from Big Business,Here are five ideas for how to find great hires for your small business.,"During the height of the downturn, many small business owners were too cash-strapped to hire workers, even if they saw the opportunity to grow with more staff. The economy is a bit less sluggish now so business is improving for some entrepreneurs. But a new study points to an irony: Apparently, the improved economy is making it hard to hire, too.The corporate-information portal Manta reports 57 percent of small-to-medium-size businesses plan to hire this year. But one in four of those entrepreneurs say they're having trouble recruiting quality candidates because they can't compete with big businesses. Top applicants are turning them down because they are holding out for the big corporate jobs.If this is you, here are five ideas for how to find great hires for your small business:1. Network. Rather than posting a Craigslist ad and getting 2,000 resumes to wade through from mostly unqualified candidates, let colleagues, family and friends know what you are looking for in a new hire. Maybe they know someone who'd prefer a small-business environment to that of a larger corporation. Nearly 60 percent of participants in the Manta study found their hires through their network contacts.
 2. Consider recent college graduates. Recent grads are often hot to find work and pay off student loans -- and it's one of the toughest hiring markets for grads in ages. If you have a position you could train someone for, you could nab someone with great potential.
  3. Allow telecommuting. This is an angle that attracts younger workers. A study from freelance marketplace Elance found more than half of Millenials consider telecommuting options important in selecting a job.
  4. Create a flextime position. Many workers need to work odd hours so they can pick up kids from school or attend classes themselves. If you offer some flexibility then you might improve your chances of getting a quality hire.
  5. Offer more responsibility and reward. What can you offer an employee that a giant company can't? At a large company, an employee often is a tiny cog in an enormous machine. Smaller companies can consider offering a small equity stake as well as the chance to have a greater say in company decisions. Both are things workers often can't get in ""corporate America.""Are you looking to hire this year?

When leaders at Radio Flyer, the Chicago-based maker of children's toys, wanted all 55 of its employees to better connect their individual efforts with the success of the company, they launched an initiative called ""Connect-the-Dots"" -- a three-part program geared toward educating employees about the business. One part consisted of an internal class, called ""Wagon U 102: Driving Our Economic Engine,"" which discussed how the company defines and measures financial success. Radio Flyer executives also broadly communicated the five company objectives for the year along with related metrics for each department. Upward communication was jointly employed as each department reported its impact to the business back to fellow employees.Related: How to Assess your Business's Goals and Objectives Reward employees who go beyond ""the norm.""
Nothing can quell people's desire to give extra than not feeling recognized. At Badger Mining Corp., a unique team approach ensures its 156 employees are rewarded for going above and beyond. Associates at this industrial mineral mining company belong to a ""core"" team, the one for which they were hired. In addition, they are encouraged to join cross functional teams, such as the ""Retirement Plan Team,"" ""Wellness Team"" or ""Safety Team."" All teams are open to anyone interested in joining. Work on these teams becomes part of the performance evaluation process with employees gaining ""extra credit"" for joining and active participation.Related: The Best Ways to Reward Employees Make decisions and debates transparent.
When employees have the full context about a decision and the options considered, they are more likely to support it regardless of whether they agree with it or not. At Bridgeway Capital Management, a Houston-based investment management firm that employs 33 people, leaders use an innovative meeting structure called ""Fish-Bowl."" The sessions are used to flesh out new proposals and educate staff on key decisions. A small group of employees sit in an inner circle to learn from one another on a controversial topic or idea. This group commits to ""inquiry"" on the subject as opposed to advocacy for or against the topic. Employees ask questions, explore the idea, flesh out any issues and learn about the subject. All remaining employees sit on the outside of the ""fish bowl"" and educate themselves on the idea while holding those on the inner circle accountable for listening, inquiring and being open and supportive to the new idea or issue. The result, they say, has been a quicker adoption of new and radical ideas.Related: Five Tips for Making Better DecisionsCollaborate on goals and decisions.
A highly participative workplace yields better buy-in for decisions as people more fully support ideas they help create. Decision-making at Bridgeway often involces a combination of voting, consensus and/or delegating. For example, its human resources committee will design and recommend HR-related proposals, which will then go to the entire company for a vote. Depending on the magnitude of the decision, the vote will either be a super-majority vote (85 percent or more), a majority vote (50 percent or more) or a consensus driven decision in which objections are asked for but no formal vote is required. This shared decision-making extends to the company's annual goals as well. Using a unique process, all employees provide ideas for goals for the year. This list is then narrowed and ultimately voted upon by all employees, with each person having 100 points to vote for the top 10 goals.In the workplaces that have achieved a workforce of owner-minded employees, those workers often habitually step outside their role for the sake of the business's objectives. These cultures adapt faster to change and develop innovative ideas that lead to new product and market opportunities. And let's not forget they allow business owners to rest a little easier at night.

/article/217866,Is It Time to Outsource Human Resources?,Professional employer organizations help free up business owners' time to focus on generating revenue.,"Most small-business owners know the frustration of spending more time than they want or should on non-revenue-generating activities. From payroll and human resource management to benefits and compensation, entrepreneurs can spend up to 40 percent of their precious day engaged in these necessary but time-sucking tasks.The answer for many growing companies may be to hire one of the 700 professional employer organizations (PEOs) in the U.S. These companies become the legal employer of your staff and handle all the payroll, benefits and HR functions.""Most small businesses are under 25 employees, and that means the owner is the most productive, is critical to the success of the business, and has to get out there and generate sales and products,"" says Milan Yager, president and CEO of the National Association of Professional Employer Organizations. When small businesses outsource non-core activities, ""they can focus on the business of their business,"" says Yager.But when does it make sense to hire a PEO? While PEOs aren't for every company, those that do use them can often offer better benefit packages and thus hire better talent, says Ed Vargas, senior vice president of health and benefits at Aon Consulting. ""We help them set up a Fortune 500 package of benefits,"" he says.In assessing whether or not you should hire a PEO, there are several questions to consider before you make a decision:How big is your company? Expert opinion varies on how large a company should be before it hires a PEO. A general rule of thumb is ""when administrative processes begin slowing down the productivity of the firm,"" says Dan Sheridan, president and chief operating officer of Extensis, a PEO. While it is different for every company, ""this typically occurs when a business reaches 10 to 15 employees a week,"" says Sheridan.Some PEOs won't work with companies that have fewer than 10 employees. ""Once a company gets very big, then it is easier to have an in-house HR department,"" says Janis Sweeney, owner of National Employee Management Resources, a PEO. The sweet spot for a PEO, she says, is between 16 and 80 people. The composition of your workforce is also important. Companies that only offer insurance to a few key executives wouldn't benefit from PEOs.How much does a PEO cost? Like all professional services, the way a PEO prices services varies depending on the company. Industry experts estimate that the cost ranges from about 2 percent to 11 percent of wages. Another way to look at the expense is per employee. With that measure, it would run between $500 and $1,500 per employee per year. For very small companies with only two to five employees, some PEOs might price their services at a flat fee of $150 per month.On the flip side, it is important to try and estimate the total cost of your HR functions. Truth is, most businesses ""have no idea what their true costs are, as they only think of wages but never add up all the other things,"" says Yager.How much control do you want over your HR functions? A PEO acts as a business partner to the client company. If a business owner wants to control all aspects of a business and is not open to suggestions or following through on recommendations a PEO makes, then a PEO may not make sense, says Jim Thibodeau, president of StaffScapes Inc.Businesses do lose a bit of flexibility in the coverage they can offer when they use a PEO. Related to the issue of control is the perception of your employees. ""Employees are used to seeing [your business name] on the check,"" and the PEO becomes the check signer, says Sweeney.What services do you need? ""Picking the right PEO is of paramount importance,"" says Sheridan. The PEO should be certified by the Employer Services Assurance Corporation, have experience in the client's industry and cover that company's territory, he says. Also bear in mind that some PEOs specialize in a Web-based high-tech approach, while others are focused on face-to-face support.Remember -- each PEO is different, and business owners would do well to read the fine print.Toddi GutnerToddi is an award-winning journalist, writer and editor and currently is a contributing writer covering career management issues for The Wall Street Journal.Read more",Growth Strategies,2011-01-14 16:54:00
/article/217848,Using Credit Checks to Help in Hiring,What you need to know before digging into an applicant's background.,"Before hiring new employees, Jeff Huckaby, chief executive at IT management firm rackAID LLC, runs various background checks on applicants. And for positions with responsibilities like handling clients' financial and other sensitive information, he runs a credit check. He can't risk hiring a liability.""When you hire someone for sensitive positions, you need to learn as much about them as you can,"" Huckaby says.In fact, 60 percent of employers now run credit checks on at least some applicants, an 18 percent increase from 2006, according to the Society for Human Resource Management, a trade group for human resources professionals. Some business owners who run credit checks say they provide foresight into a potential employee's traits and performance. Others say the practice is unfair. Some states, including Washington and Illinois, have recently made credit checks illegal during the hiring process, or at least limited their use.There are many nuances surrounding the use of financial information to make hiring decisions. Here's what you need to know about pre-employment credit screenings.The Pros and Cons 
Credit checks can be helpful in the hiring process because a person's financial wellness, particularly credit, can impact the company's bottom line, says Denise Winston, founder of financial education company Money Start Here. For instance, financial problems can affect an employee's immune system, requiring them to take more sick days than a financially healthy employee, according to research conducted at Ontario's Carleton University. Money issues also affect employees' personal relationships and that may lead to a lack of productivity at work, based on research published in the Journal of Family Issues. Financial problems also can be distracting and cause a worker to lose focus, according to the American Institute of Stress, a nonprofit organization.Credit problems are not always a sign of irresponsible behavior or self-inflicted personal problems, however. A person with bad credit may have excellent job skills but end up in circumstances out of their control, says Oakland, Calif.-based attorney Elizabeth Cohee.How to Use the Information
Because no credit report can tell the whole story, some experts recommend it only be used as part of a more detailed background check. For example, Brandon Scivolette, president of Elite Moving Labor LLC, says he often combines a credit report with references and information from social media activity for a rounded summary of an applicant.If you do run a credit report, always consider the reason behind negative marks, says Larry Lambeth, president of Employment Screening Services, Inc. He recommends discussing questionable marks with applicants.""If I see they've taken command of [a negative financial] situation, I may even favor them over someone who has not faced similar adversity,"" Huckaby says.Keeping It Legal
Remember to also adhere to the legal restrictions on credit checks. First, you can't run a report without the applicant's written permission -- and they have the right to receive a copy. It's also against the law to base a hiring decision solely on a credit report, according to the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act.""Not all positions should have credit checks pulled,"" adds Paul Dent, founder and chief executive of employment screening company Hirease Inc. ""Evaluating an applicant's credit should only be done if it is pertinent to the job."" For example, people responsible for advising clients on financial matters should have a background that shows evidence of handling finances effectively.When a credit report is needed, remember to ask for an Employment Credit Report. It differs from a traditional credit report in that it masks social security numbers and doesn't include or affect credit scores.Federal law also entitles employees to receive notice that a report has been requested and a written statement indicating that the information was not the basis for an employment decision. Business owners should consult an employment attorney on this, and consider drafting a waiver document for applicants that grants you the right to obtain their credit information, according to Steven Mitchell Sack, attorney and author of The Employee Rights Handbook: Effective Legal Strategies to Protect Your Job from Interview to Pink Slip (Legal Strategies Publications, 2010).""Such a document helps overcome [legal] problems, and provide indemnification and hold harmless protection in the event the applicant is denied the position as a result of poor credit,"" Sack says.

/article/217776,How to Budget Your Own Salary,Follow this guide to calculate how much to pay yourself.,"You're the business owner and you set the budget, so the size of your paycheck is entirely up to you. But while the freedom of setting your own salary sounds great in theory, in practice most business owners find it a tough call. Should you pay yourself what you need to cover expenses? What your business can afford? The salary you left behind to launch your business?Your best bet is to factor in all three, and more. For your business to succeed you might consider taking a temporary drop in income. On the other hand, paying yourself far less than you're worth, or nothing at all, paints an unrealistic picture of the viability of your business for you or potential investors.Here are the factors to consider before determining exactly how much to pay yourself.Calculate What You NeedYour salary will depend on your living expenses, financial situation and comfort level with drawing on personal savings. First, put together a comprehensive list of your expenses [see worksheet below]. Be sure to include all annual, quarterly and monthly expenses. These include everything you'll spend money on, such as your rent or mortgage, car payments, car insurance, credit cards with outstanding balances, gym membership and grocery bills. Underestimating personal expenses is one of the biggest mistakes a new business owner can make. If you slip into the red, chances are your business will, too.Annual ExpensesDownload This WorksheetMinimum Salary Range Worksheet 1.Rent/mortgage 2.Health insurance 3.Car payment 4.Other transportation 5.Car insurance 6.Recreation activities  (includes gym/club dues/restaurants) 7.Food 8.Utilities 9.Misc. living expenses 10.Credit card payments 11.Child care 12.Entertainment 13.Other expenses 14.Total Annual Expenses 15.Portion of personal savings allocated to  startup costs 16.Salary or other ongoing income 17.Sum of lines 15 and 16 18.Subtract line 17 from line 14 for Bare Minimum Annual Salary 19.Divide line 18 by 12 for Bare Minimum Monthly Salary 20.Total from line 14: Minimum Annual Salary 21.Divide line 20 by 12: Minimum Monthly Salary Lines 19 and 21 represent your Minimum Monthly Salary Range When you've added up your annual personal expenses, divide that number by 12 to come up with the monthly salary you'll need to receive. Next, decide what portion of your savings you'll feel comfortable drawing on during the early stages of your company. These must be separate savings from the funds you'll use to launch your business. If you plan to keep your job, add your annual salary to the personal savings figure. Subtract this number from your total annual personal expenses and divide by 12. This gives you the minimum monthly salary you'll need, even if you choose to supplement your startup salary with personal savings or employment income. Now you have a range that runs from the minimum salary needed to cover all your personal expenses to the bare minimum salary you can afford to take by supplementing your income. This is your minimum salary range.Determine What You're WorthNow you need to figure out what your salary should be given your knowledge and skills, the time you'll put in and the work you'll perform. There are two equally valid methods for computing your market worth:Open market value. Given your experience and skills, what would you be paid by an employer in today's market? While this salary won't take into account the additional time you'll put into a startup, the income you're sacrificing to start your business is a useful benchmark in setting your salary.Comparable companies. What do the owners of similarly sized firms in the same industry and geographic region pay themselves? To get comparable salaries, check with trade associations, other entrepreneurs in your industry or the local Small Business Development Center.Neither of these methods takes into account the additional work you'll be taking on as an owner, nor the risk you're taking in starting a business. Some entrepreneurs boost market-worth-based salaries by 3 percent to 5 percent to offset the added responsibilities and risk. Others look at the potential long-term advantage of owning a successful business as compensation for these factors.What Can Your Business Afford? Once you know the salary you need and the salary you deserve, it's time to balance that figure against your business's finances. You'll need to check the cash-flow projection in your business plan to ensure that you have enough money coming in to cover your own draw and other operating expenses.Ideally, your cash flow will have a surplus large enough to pay your market-worth salary, reinvest funds in the business and leave a little margin for error. Unfortunately, that's unlikely. Since most startups initially operate at a loss -- anywhere from six months to two years -- plan to start within the minimum salary range. You can ratchet up toward a market-worth salary as your business breaks even and continues to grow.Because your business income may ebb and flow initially, a base salary with a bonus structure that kicks in when your business reaches the break-even point is usually the best course for early-stage companies. You might, for example, decide that when your business moves into the black, you'll take a percentage of profits every fiscal quarter as a bonus. These bonus percentages range widely, depending on an owner's goals for the business, personal financial needs and philosophy on reinvesting business earnings. But while your aim may be to reach your market-worth salary rapidly, it's a good idea to leave some profits in your business as a safety net and to fund future growth.When your business is consistently profitable, it's time to re-evaluate your salary. Typically, this means taking a salary increase equal in percentage to the business's annual growth rate, then reinvesting the remaining profit in your business. But as with your bonus structure, there is no silver bullet equation for determining the appropriate salary hike. You'll want to factor in the nature of your industry and your business goals. For example, if you're in a turbulent or cyclical industry, you may want to retain the quarterly bonus structure and the flexibility it affords. Or, if your business has the potential for rapid growth, you may want to forego the salary boost and use the extra capital to fund new products, expansion plans or marketing initiatives.Whatever you decide in the early phase of your business, reassess your compensation every six months. As your business evolves, its cash-flow model and capital needs may change dramatically -- as may your own. A regular assessment enables you to adjust accordingly.

/answer/222214,A New Hire is Sick and Can No Longer Work. Help!,,"																																	If you have more than 15 employees, you are subject to the Americans with Disabilities Act or ADA Amendment Act. If this individual's malady is of a potentially long-term nature, she might qualify for ""reasonable accommodation"" under the ADA or ADAAA. 
This does not mean that you cannot fire a newly hired individual who is not capable of performing the duties of the job. It does mean, however, that you must be prepared to prove, if necessary, that you could not reasonably accommodate the absences/part-time attendance precipitated by her malady.  
Many businesses cannot accommodate extensive absenteeism -- and yours may be one of these. If so, you should simply call her in and let her know that this is the case, terminate her employment and wish her well.    
It appears that you have genuinely tried to treat her fairly and give her a chance to recover to the degree whereby she could perform her job duties. On the other hand, I have seen individuals claim discrimination and/or sue employers who have been more than fair regarding treatment of them when they had a disability -- even when the disability had nothing whatsoever to do with the termination of employment.  
So, you should be prepared to deal with that possibility. Offering her a severance package of a couple of weeks of pay in return for her signing a separation agreement that contains language protecting your company from any kind of legal action would be advisable.

/answer/222212,How can I recruit quality employees?,,"																																	Without any information on what kind of business you operate, I can only respond in the most general of terms. You should start by putting together a functional organization chart of the areas of work that need to be done (e.g., finance, production, customer services, marketing, sales) 
Identify the responsibilities in each area and what is required to fulfill what must be done in each area: education, knowledge and skills, e.g., bookkeeping, computer usage capability (what hardware/software?), communicating (writing, speaking, making presentations), leading/supervising.
For each area of responsibility determine the personal characteristics required for each job -- e.g., attention to detail, organized, personable, persuasive, insightful, able to work independently).
Prepare comprehensive job descriptions that include the title, purpose of the job (e.g., ""to ensure xxx is properly done...), major responsibilities and specifics which you identified above (experience, knowledge, skills, characteristics). Don't forget to include requirements such as travel, transportation, etc.  
Then identify why anyone would want to work for you doing each job: competitive pay, good benefits, convenient location (i.e., free parking), nice co-workers. Put together an enticing job ad and post it on a major or niche website.
Look for people who are interested in doing the job that you have to offer at the pay/benefits you can provide and who meet all of the criteria that you have established.

It is highly advisable to plan carefully and communicate as much in advance of the changes as possible so that people know what is coming in time for them to allow for the changes in their lives. 
It is also a good idea to be prepared to clearly and concisely share comprehendible reasons for making these changes. If doing this type of thing will save jobs, for example, most people will understand. 
If top management may consider adding back in some benefits being cut at this time once the economic climate is better, that knowledge will also make it more palatable to employees.

A good employee handbook conveys what kind of employer the company is -- what's important to top management and what kinds of behaviors are most desirable. A well-written handbook establishes clear ""rules of the road"" so that all employees can most easily understand the parameters of their department, their eligibility for company benefits, proper use of technology equipment, what kinds of behaviors may result in termination, how to resolve problems (think: harassment or other legal entanglements that might be avoided)
The list goes on and on regarding why having an employee handbook is a good idea. Your question is similar to, ""Is it necessary to have laws in a civilizd society?"" Again, no, it is not necessary -- but it is highly advisable.

/answer/222199,What's the best way to fire an employee?,,"																																	Based on your desire to be most kind, I am going to assume that you are terminating someone's employment because you have no other choice, likely for one of these reasons"" 
1. A lack of work to be done
2. A lack of skills on the part of the employee to do the work
3. Economic factors beyond your control
So, the best thing to do is to plan ahead about all aspects of terminating the employee so that it is a well organized meeting. Have a checklist that you can go through with the employee with items such as:
- Does the employee have accrued/unused vacation time? If so, will she receive pay for that?
- Are their expense report reimbursements due to the employee?
- Will the employee be able to collect on unemployment benefits?
- What's the process for receiving the final paycheck?
It's important to make a list of the items to be returned by the employee prior to issuing her final paycheck, including:
- Keys - office, file cabinets, cars
- Office/other access cards
- Company credit cards
- Cell Phone, service plan
- E-mail account, internet access or passwords                                     
- Company equipment                             
Once you have all of the above matters defined, call the person into your office (or another place that is private) and have a disinterested person with you as a witness, if you can. It should be someone who the employee likes, respects or at least does not actively dislike. If you have someone who handles payroll, it might be that person. 
Then, get straight to the point. Explain that due to 1, 2 or 3 (above) the decision has been made to terminate her employment, effective immediately -- which is usually best for all concerned. Say clearly that this is nothing personal and that the employee's contributions to the company have been much appreciated. Her termination is simply a necessary business decision. Then go through the checklist with the employee or have the disinterested witness do this.
If you can provide severance pay, that is a nice thing to do. Be sure that if you do that, you have a legally compliant separation agreement for the employee to sign. Kindness is as much in the manner the message is delivered as anything I've mentioned above. 
Through good planning, you can make the meeting go quickly and it will be as painless as such a circumstance can allow. A haphazard termination leaves the employee with the impression that she was not important enough to be treated with respect.

/answer/222198,Do employee reward programs really increase motivation and productivity?,,"My best advice is that you read Daniel Pink's book, ""Drive."" Pink has done extensive research into the area of motivation in the workplace. He says that there are three forms of motivation:
1. Extrinsic or External Motivation -- which is the type you are talking about -- motivation using rewards and punishment.
2. Internal or Creative Motivation, a form of self-motivation driven by an internal desire to create, like an artist.
3. Purpose-Driven Motivation, which Pink says is the most powerful motivation.
If your staff understands and is connected to the purpose of their work they will be motivated and will not need any extrinsic rewards. However, if your staff doesn't feel their work is part of a greater purpose, motivation will always be an issue.Elinor RobinElinor Robin, ""The Relationship Mediator,"" has more than 18 years of experience in mediation while working within the public and private sectors.Read more",Growth Strategies,2010-11-24 00:00:00
/article/217562,How to Keep Cold and Flu Out of the Office,Cold and flu season is here. How do you keep sick employees from becoming a drain on productivity?,"Seasonal illness is rearing its ugly head at Socialcast Inc., a San Francisco company that creates business collaboration software. One of the company's 30 employees was out recently with a bad cold and sinus headache. Another employee went home with a stomach bug. Yet another stayed home with cold symptoms. ""In the last couple of weeks, we've definitely seen a pickup [in illness],"" says founder and chief executive Tim Young.Nathan Reis is also seeing more sickness among the 100 sales and customer-service employees at his 4-year-old Scottsdale, Ariz., payment-processing company Entrust Bankcard LLC. Even Reis, the company's founder and chief executive officer, isn't immune. ""I just got over strep throat,"" he admits.The threat cold-and-flu season poses to companies isn t something to sneeze at. According to the Centers for Disease Control, the flu alone costs U.S. companies $10.4 billion in direct costs including hospitalizations and outpatient visits. The CDC also estimates up to one-fifth of the U.S. population will get the flu in a given flu season, and more than 200,000 Americans will be hospitalized with seasonal, flu-related complications.This year's flu is already making the rounds. ""What we see circulating is H3N2 and the pandemic H1N1 primarily, with some Influenza B,"" says Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.Despite warnings from public health officials, many Americans aren't rushing to get their flu shots. A recent Consumer Reports survey of 1,500 U.S. adults found that only 37 percent plan to be vaccinated.In the sickly economy, many employees are hesitant to take sick days. A survey conducted by Staples Advantage, the business-to-business arm of office products retailer Staples Inc., found 65 percent of employees are coming to work sick. Only 80 percent are cleaning their work areas once a week or less, making any work area a potential hot zone for germs.Put it all together, and employers could face one pesky pathogen after another this winter. Small firms are even more vulnerable to productivity losses due to seasonal illness. The ""absenteeism calculator"" at Healthyworkplaceproject.com, estimates a 25-employee company loses $33,000 every year to lost productivity, sick days and temporary workers brought in to replace sick employees. Healthyworkplaceprojet.com is a website run by business health products supplier Kimberly-Clark Worldwide Inc. that educates employers and employees about germs in the workplace and how to reduce workplace absences due to illness.Reis points out that, just like taxes, the flu has a season. ""The beauty about the flu season is that it's predictable, and there are simple things you can do that are not expensive,"" he says.Keeping sick employees from becoming a drain on productivity often requires strong policies, good management and a healthy dose of leadership. The CDC's employer-planning guides can be a good place to start.Here are 10 things both you and your employees can do to keep cold and flu from sapping productivity this winter.Encourage employee vaccinations. At Socialcast, employees receive reminders about local flu-shot clinics and a nurse stopped by last month to offer flu shots. The company's third-party human-resources provider, Kingwood, Texas-based Administaff Inc., arranged that. Young estimates that three-fourths of the company's employees will receive vaccinations. ""Encouraging that kind of preventative care is really key,"" Young says.
But requiring the flu shot as a condition of employment is a potential minefield for employers. What if an employee has a bad reaction to an employer-mandated immunization, or someone claims exemption for religious or medical reasons? Given the Pandora's box of potential problems, it's best to simply encourage employees to get vaccinated but stop far short of requiring it.Set an example. Don't contradict your own sick policies. If employees see the boss powering through a bad cold instead of staying home, they'll think they should do the same thing. Reis came to work last year with flu symptoms, and the company s president told him to go home. ""He [said], 'You're setting a bad example,' and I was thinking, 'I'm a trouper,' "" Reis says. He lost nine days at the office to swine flu. ""It was nice to have someone say, 'Get out of here,' "" Reis says. ""What I needed to do was stay home.""Wash your hands. Studies show hand washing is still one of the most effective ways to stop illness. Encourage employees to wash their hands, but don't sound like their mom when you're doing it. Socialcast posts humorous reminders about hand washing in the break rooms and restrooms. ""They're funny signs, so it doesn't feel like we're telling people what to do,"" Young says. Use your elbow. Who wants to shake the hand of someone who has just sneezed all over it? Teach employees to cough into their elbows instead.Provide sanitizing products. Provide hand sanitizer, wipes, disinfecting sprays and towels for employees to clean their desks and keyboards a few times a week, if not daily. Reis estimates Entrust Bankcard spends $40 a month on hand sanitizer. Tell sick employees to stay home. Do employees feel comfortable taking sick days when they're really sick? It's your job as a leader to make sure employees know they should stay home when they're contagious. ""People who are sick should not go to work,"" says Michael Osterholm.Plan for seasonal increased sick days. Prepare telecommuting options for contagious employees. At Socialcast, sick employees are set up to work from home if they're feeling up to it. Unless they're laid low by a bad flu, most employees can work a little bit from home. Ask the employee what sounds reasonable. Promote personal space. ""Social distancing"" techniques such as refraining from handshakes and standing at least 3-feet apart can slow the spread of cold and flu during peak season. Go hands-free. Moving toward hands-free appliances such as automatic sinks and toilets, automatic soap and paper towel dispensers and airflow hand-dryers could pay off down the line in saved sick days.Vaccinate your children. Schools can be virtual petri dishes. Your kids get sick, then you get sick and, before you can say, ""Ah-choo,"" you've lost a week's worth of productivity. Vaccines are a matter of parental debate, but the flu shot (or flu mist) is still the best bet for maintaining wellness at home.The little things employers do also can send a big message. For example, Socialcast sent a pizza to the employee who was out with a bad cold and sinus headache. This ""get well"" gesture was ""kind of an odd thing to do, but we wanted him to know that we care,"" Young says.

That is, they can change their minds, for example, if they get a better offer, take a permanent job, or whatever.
An agreement that includes consideration might give you more leverage. For example, pay them an amount in return for their pledge of allegiance.

If I am correct, you are clearly in a difficult position with limited options.  
Depending on your relationship with your boss, you may be able to ask him how you can step up to the plate and be more helpful. However, he may not take your offer graciously. Do you think he would take that question as an affront?   
It is critical for every business to have a succession plan in place. An 80-year-old business owner who does not have a succession plan in place is unrealistic.  
However, it may not serve you well to be the voice of reality--the one who asks the boss what his plans are for ensuring that the company will move through a future transition.

In fact, I often recommend this course of action to my clients when they are firing someone for poor performance or for some other reason such as not being quite as capable in the role as desired.  
If you are firing someone for other than egregious behavior (such as a truly terrible attendance record or for stealing, for example) you would most likely not prevail if you did ""fight"" the terminated employee collecting unemployment.  
So, why not defuse the situation and just say that the company will acquiesce to the terminated employee being paid her unemployment benefits? It is also a kind thing to do, as long as it is true.

/answer/222160,How do I attract top performers to my company?,,"																																	I do entire seminars on how to effectively recruit and build a great team.  It is not a one-sentence or one-paragraph subject.  But here are the basic steps involved:
Step 1: 
Start by really defining the position and creating a set of comprehensive job specifications. Include skills needed to do the work and information regarding personality and behavioral traits that are being sought and consider compensation, work environment, work hours, travel required, and benefits to be provided     
Step 2: 
Develop a search strategy to find the particular type and level of talent needed. Tactics may include job postings, social media contact, print ads, and/or proactively pursuing candidates through your industry contacts.
Step 3: 
Using key words when reviewing resumes, select those of the most qualified and that live within a reasonable commute to the work place. 
Step 4: 
Conduct extremely thorough standardized phone interviews gathering information on employability factors such as the reason the individual is on the job market, the work record and compensation history.
Step 5: 
When sensible, use online testing and/or assessing of candidates. These are inexpensive and easy to administer with instant reporting. They provide objective data to help you select the best candidates.
Step 6: 
Interview the finalists using standardized interview forms and selection worksheets to ensure that your interviews go most smoothly and are most effective. 
Step 7: 
Use professional materials to extend the offer and conduct background checks. Drug screens are also an excellent idea.
Step 8: 
Make sure that your on-boarding or orientation process is in good order. Don't lose a great person in whom you have invested so much time by using the sink-or-swim methodology of ""Welcome to the Company.""

/answer/222158,Is it legal to fill a newly created position without posting it publicly?,,"																																	There are only three scenarios that would require you to post or publicly advertise a job opening:
1. If you are a governmental agency required to publicly advertise job openings.
2. If you are unionized and your contract with your union requires you to post and/or publicly advertise job openings.
3. If your policy manual strictly requires that all job openings be posted and/or publicly advertised.
If your situaiton is number three, I urge you to have that policy changed to give your management team the right to determine when a job may be filled without being posted or publicly advertised.  
Criteria should be included so that no abuse results (e.g., the management team stops posting or advertising most or all job openings). Your management team should be able to make these kinds of determinations based on the business needs of the company within the bounds of the criteria set in the policy.  
Hopefully, the person you hired meets all of the job criteria (required qualifications: education, knowledge, experience, skills) so that you can defend your hiring decision without hesitation.

/answer/222153,How should I tell a qualified applicant that we can't hire him after a background check?,,"																																	If the person was convicted of a sex offense, you can tell him the truth.  After all, he knows that he was convicted and is a registered sex offender. You have a right to let them know that for bona fide business reasons--i.e. retention of a valued customer--you cannot hire them. 
This does not mean that such a situation should be handled unkindly or that the person's dignity should be disrespected. Confidentiality should be maintained and the applicant should be informed in a matter-of-fact and considerate manner.  
You could say something like this: ""It simply is not possible for us to hire you because we have discovered in conducting our routine background check that you are a registered sex offender. If that information is not correct, please tell us so."" 
It might be a good idea to pause and give the person a moment to respond, if he wishes to do so. Errors do occur--although very rarely. If the person says that the record you received is in error, you should give him the chance to prove that to be the case giving him a definite deadline to produce documentation that proves his contention.  
Otherwise, you could conclude with: ""We do not sit in judgment here. But I am sure that you can understand that due to the nature of our business and valued customer relationships we must maintain to remain in business, we cannot have someone on our staff with this kind of a conviction on his record. We are sorry that this did not work out differently. We appreciate your interest in working with us and sincerely wish you the best.

/answer/222149,What are my obligations to an employee who I'm converting from full-time to part-time?,,"																																	The best way to do this is to simply be prepared for the meeting and then to be straightforward but in a kindly fashion.
Being prepared means having the reason for the cutback clearly defined and that you are ready to articulate the reason with authority. If the company is spending like a ""drunken sailor"" in other ways, cutting someone's time/pay may be harder to defend than if you have been reducing expenses steadily in other ways.
Take a careful look at all aspects of how this cutback in hours will affect the employee. For example, will this cutback in hours mean that the person is not responsible for precisely the same work load? Will some aspects of the job change--be lessened in volume or level of responsibility?  
Look through the person's job description and figure out ahead of time what aspects of the job may be off loaded or otherwise accounted for when the hours are cut back. The worker is sure to have questions about how certain things that she does will now be done and by whom. You need to have answers.
You mentioned that the position is administrative, so I am assuming that it is non-exempt (paid by the hour and subject to overtime rules under the Fair Labor Standards Act). So, the simplest thing pay-wise for you to do is to calculate the hourly rate and pay the person for 20 hours a week.  
The question you might ask yourself, however, is whether that is 100 percent fair. For instance, is it really 20 hours a week right away or could you ratchet it down from 40 hours to 30 hours (say for a month or so) and then go to the 25 hours a week and then 20.  
This would give the worker time to adjust. Or can you pay a bit more for the 20 hours than simply the straight hourly rate to ensure that the worker does not quit and leave you needing to hire and train someone else? It can be harder to find dependable part-time workers than full-time workers.
Also, I assume that the person will receive a reduced amount of vacation and sick time and only be paid for half a day on paid holidays. Does this change mean that the person will lose other benefits (health insurance, etc.)? If so, that may be a worse blow than the reduced salary. Know the answers to how the company wants to handle this.
Be ready and receptive to discuss the matters that will concern the employee. Being prepared shows that you really have thought this matter through and that you care about the worker.

/answer/222144,What's the best way to handle an insubordinate employee?,,"																																	This employee is acting out an emotional reaction with behavior that is inappropriate for the workplace. 
He is attempting to transmit a strong non-verbal message. Unfortunately, you are unable to decipher the underlying meaning in his message. Someone who is able to discuss the situation without further triggering his emotions should meet with him in a non-threatening manner and get the rest of the story.  
The employee s anger may be justified, but perhaps misdirected. Or he may be a ticking time bomb. Someone objective, who is trained in de-escalation techniques, needs to be the one who determines which scenario it is.

/answer/222138,What's the best way to fire one of my employees?,,"																																	Not knowing in what state your company does business, I cannot unequivocally tell you precisely whether you can simply terminate ""for any reason or no reason"" as is the case in Florida (at-will work state). 
Also, one always needs to carefully consider whether one is firing someone for sufficient cause/good business reasons and that one is not discriminating--consciously or not--in any way. 
Are you making this decision based on facts or conjecture/impressions/insufficient data? If it is the latter, you will regret it. So, think it through carefully. 
If after careful analysis you believe that you have an employee whose behavior is disruptive or otherwise consuming company time and energy disproportionate to his value as a producer, you can terminate his employment. 
If you have a performance review process, you should use that process and form to record your impressions of this employee's behaviors that are objectionable in an organized way. Regardless, you should prepare for a meeting with this employee by itemizing for yourself the issues that are bothering you. Including dates of infractions/incidents will help you to put together a chronological account of the myriad of ways in which this employee has brought you to the point of being ready to dismiss him. 
Arrange to speak with him in private at a time of day when you will not be disturbed. It is a good idea to have someone else in the room with you when you talk with the employee. Tell him what your impressions are of his work record and then do one of two things: terminate him immediately or give him a period of time to improve his behavior. 
If it is the former, be prepared to collect company property and get him on his way. Be sure to pay him for all time worked in a prompt fashion. If it is the latter, be sure that he understands exactly how to improve in order to keep his job--and meet with him at least weekly for a while to discuss how he is doing and to reinforce the necessity of good job performance and good work place behavior.
With any employee action you should document what you did, why you did it, when you did it and so forth. A few months--or even weeks--later it may be very hard to remember exactly what transpired.

/answer/222132,What are my options if my employee was dishonest about being physical fit for his job?,,"																																	If you have more than 15 employees, you are subject to the Americans with Disabilities Act and Amendment Act. These laws require you to offer reasonable accommodation to someone who is disabled.  
Reasonable accommodation may range from placement into a job that allows the worker to provide value in a different way than originally planned when he was hired to providing assistance for aspects of the job that the disabled person cannot perform due to his disability.  
If this person is qualified for a job in your organization that does not require the same level of physical capability as the one for which he was hired, you could consider placing him in that job for a trial period to see how he does.     
On the other hand, you may simply be feeling that you cannot trust this person because he misrepresented his physical capabilities. So, if your worker is a new hire (still in the probationary period) and you honestly believe that he misled you regarding his capability to do the job for which he was hired, termination may be the way to go.  
If you want to be certain that you are on solid ground regarding termination, you should contact a reputable employment attorney. Be sure that you talk with an attorney who specializes in employment law, as others may not really be helpful in these regards.
Does your job requirements page state that the employee being hired check each physical requirement and sign off attesting that he can do what the page says is required to safely do the job?  If not, that might be a way to go in the future.

/answer/222129,"What does ""The waiting period is 30 days for all insurance plans"" refer to?",,"																																	In most cases, the actual verbiage turns out to be that the insurance for which you choose to enroll starts the first day of the month after your first 30 days of employment. However, it does not mean 30 work days, it means 30 calendar days.  
So, if you start a new job on July 6, for example, you actually would not be eligible for insurance until September 1. Most companies like to start the new insurance at the beginning of a month, versus mid-month.
Just so you know, insurance companies (carriers) recommend a waiting period to employers because enrolling new participants takes a bit of time to do and costs money in administration. So, a waiting period ensures that the new employee has time to select what coverage she can afford and wants to have and that the new employee lasts in the job for at least the waiting period.  
First-day coverage is just about unheard of these days. Many companies actually have a 60 or 90 day waiting period for benefits--so this sounds like a good company/employer.

/answer/222114,"Should I offer our younger, healthier employees a higher salary since they don't utilize their healthcare benefits too much?",,"																																	Group health insurance premiums are calculated for each company on the basis of the demographics of the workforce and eligible dependents (age, location, etc.) and the history of claims made by your workforce and their covered dependents.  
The goal of insurance is for the ""risk"" to be spread across the entire group. You cannot decide that different types of people (age and health) must pay different premiums.  
Some companies now offer employees reduced health insurance premiums if they do not smoke or stop smoking, live a healthy lifestyle (as determined by set criteria) or who join weight loss programs.  
However, these must be well-devised programs put together by experts and be administered very carefully to ensure fair-handed treatment. 
Age and health, in general, cannot be used as a criteria for how much anyone pays for his/her health insurance in a company's group plan.

/answer/222100,Can I cover a subcontractor on my company's workers comp insurance?,,"																																	Most well-prepared contracts/agreements made by companies with contract workers include a requirement that the contractor carry sufficient insurance to cover him/herself and all of their subcontractors (if any are involved) to relieve the company from this obligation.  
So, I would say first and foremost, do you have good contracts/agreements in place? Also, you need to be sure that the people you are calling ""contractors"" are really contractors. 
That is, you must be very careful to abide by the IRS rules regarding ""contractors"" (i.e., 1099 workers). Contractors should all have specific self-determining kinds of work to do, normally in a finite time period, with defined deliverables, using their own place of work, and so forth. 
If you look at section two of the IRS publication 15-A, you will see exactly what the IRS considers when determining whether a worker is an employee or an independent contractor (i.e., 1099 worker). 
In addition, the IRS will help an organization free of charge to determine the appropriate classification for a worker or group of workers in the organization in regards to federal law. To obtain that service, you simply complete and submit IRS Form SS-8. However, your state may have different requirements. 
Some P&C brokers will let you insure your contractors on your workers compensation policy.  You will need to ask yours to see how she handles such requests.

/answer/222087,What should I know about terminating an employee due to medical problems?,,"																																	Legally, as your company is so small, you are not obligated to adhere to the Americans with Disabilities Act (15 or more employees). So, you do not have to provide reasonable accommodation for this worker. 
Plus, if she is unable to do her work due to sight limitations, it would be difficult to determine what a reasonable accommodation might be--especially if she is also unable to report to work due to medical treatments such as a series of eye surgeries.
You also are not legally bound by the Family and Medical Leave Act (50 or more employees). So, you do not have to provide a specific amount of unpaid time off work. 
Your choices are:
1. Offer her a personal, unpaid leave of absence for a specific period of time (e.g., 30 days), clearly indicating in writing that she must submit medical documentation at explicit intervals to receive consideration for the continuation of the leave (e.g., every 30 days). You need to make it clear that there is no guarantee her job--or any job with the company--will be available for her if/when she is able to return to work. 
In this instance, you would also want to specify that in order to return to work, you will need a fairly detailed statement from her primary physician that she can return to work and what her restrictions will be, if any. 
With a personal leave of absence, the employee should also be informed that in order to keep her health insurance coverage (if same is offered through the company), she must pay the full cost of the premiums by the first of each month. Otherwise, she may receive 30 days notice of her health insurance coverage being canceled for non-payment of premiums. 
2. Terminate her employment and simply say that if/when she is able to return to work, you will be happy to consider her for any job available for which she is qualified. 
No promises, but not exactly a tightly closed door, either. Again, as you have less than 20 employees, you are not legally required to offer COBRA. But in some states mini-COBRA is offered, so she could continue her health coverage through that type of program if it's available.
3. Continue doing what you have been doing about this matter, which appears to be coping somehow with no one doing her work or others picking up the extra work as they can.
I think that the ethical question may not be as much about her job but whether she will lose access to health insurance coverage if she loses her job. 
Without knowing more about what you can and/or are willing to do for her in these regards, the ethical question is best left to you, as only your own conscience and the fiscal realities of the enterprise can help you determine what you choose to do.

/answer/222076,Is it legal to fire one employee but not another for the same breech of company policy?,,"																																	What you describe is legal in an employment-at-will state, but not advisable. That is, the employer may terminate employees for any reason or for no reason in an employment-at-will state and most certainly for offenses that are against a company policy that is stated as such in the employee manual or for violating a standardized practice (i.e., the company has consistently fired individuals doing a certain thing, even though it is not specifically mentioned in the employee manual or otherwise promulgated as a written rule).
Firing some but not all employees committing the same offense is risky because the employees who were terminated may have grounds for claiming the company discriminated against them in some way. 
For example, if the employee not terminated is male, but those fired were all females; or if the employee not fired is young, but those fired were over the age of 40; or if the employee not fired is one ethnic or racial background or religion, while those fired are all of an another background.
So to answer your question, laws against discrimination may have been broken or may at least appear to have been. In that case, the employees fired can bring a claim against the company either severally or jointly if they wish to do so through the EEOC.
What this really is, regardless, is a very poor management practice. Employees want to be in an environment in which they are certain that fair treatment is the general rule. In this situation, morale is negatively affected, I am sure, by this course of action.

/answer/222064,How do you know it's the right time to hire your first employee?,,"																																	Having started businesses of my own, I really understand how you feel.  
From my perspective, you and your husband need to do some strategic planning to set ambitious but realistic goals of what you want/need for the business to provide for you and your family--both short-term and long-term. 
Include the objectives that will allow you to reach your goals and break down the objectives into activities with timelines for achieving each. 
Then, I suggest that you each prepare an honest assessment of what you are bringing to the company regarding skill sets--list and evaluate how you both contribute to the business regarding how you spend your time each day/week/month.
Each of you should be able to identify what items on your usual to-do lists could be delegated with a modicum of training and which responsibilities must remain in your own hands. 
If you can find ways in which to increase your income or profitability by delegating bookkeeping, for example, so that you can produce more product or chargeable services, that would make sense. 
What you don't want to do is create a point of diminishing returns by hiring someone to do something that you could do in a much more cost-effective way or create overhead with no discernible improvement to the business' bottom line.
A good way to go might be to hire someone on a part-time basis and/or someone who can work virtually (having his/her own home office, for example) to keep your overhead down while you assess the benefits the person can bring. 
The good news for you is that in this job market, you can find some outstanding talent to help you with your business. 
In addition, you should look around at your competition and see what is developing in that arena. For example, it is possible that a merger might resolve your issues regarding employing anyone. A competitor may need the skills you have and vice versa.

/answer/222061,How can I motivate my employees?,,"																																	In my opinion, the greatest motivator is a feeling of being valued. When an employee believes that she is valued by her employer, the employee values the employer in return.
Additionally, you may want to find ways to incorporate these 13 tips for employee loyalty into your management practices. 
1. Set a good example. Show your employees that you take work seriously. If you are out shopping or busy making plans for the weekend, your employees will follow suit.
2. Create clear boundaries. Your employees can have many friends, but only one employer. Yes, you want to be friendly but not at the cost of establishing your unique role and position. Most employees will be delighted to have a boss that can be depended upon to make difficult decisions, call the shots and resolve awkward or burdensome problems--tasks they would never present to a friend or co-worker.
3. Outline each employees' sphere of influence. Each staff member should be clear about where his/her own domain starts and stops. This kind of definition fosters a sense of pride while preventing boundary overstepping and turf wars between employees.
4. Show your employees that you are loyal to them. Never belittle or criticize an employee in public. Avoid threats or any action that might give an employee a reason to question your commitment to him/her. Instead, carefully present your criticisms and see ""mistakes"" as opportunities for learning.
5. Give your employees something to be proud of. Strive to make your organization the best it can be. Whether you are the CEO of a large corporation, a supervisor in a governmental organization, or running a mom-and-pop shop, you want your product and service to shine so that everyone involved has a sense of pride and accomplishment.
6. Do good deeds. Have an outreach plan that gives both you and your employees a chance to interact with, and give back to, the larger community in a positive way.
7. Reward your employees. Money cannot buy loyalty but money does serve as a metaphor--telling your employees how much you value them. Fair wages, appropriate raises and an occasional unexpected treat can go a long way in building loyal employees.
8. Cultivate peak performance. Provide your employees with training and development opportunities so that they can learn and grow. And, as they develop, challenge them to set and meet high expectations.
9. Foster a team mentality. Encourage your employees to communicate their ideas and allow them to influence company practices and policies. Likewise, share your own vision for the future and your thoughts as to how you will all get there together.
10. Recognize and respond. Everyone appreciates positive feedback. And, once it becomes clear that you are willing and able to provide it, most employees will go the extra mile in order to get it.
11. Build solid relationships. Find common ground, share life experiences, prove your trustworthiness, and be patient as strong relationships blossom over time.
12. The Platinum Rule. There is no blueprint for fostering employee loyalty. As you go about your business, remember that each employee must be seen as an individual - what works in some cases will bring disaster in another. Forget the golden rule--don't treat your employees, as you want to be treated. Instead, find out what each of them needs and wants and proceed with that in mind.
13. Be yourself. Find your own management style. Somewhere between surrogate mother, who is more caretaker then boss and the Leona Helmsley stereotype, who responds to employees with contempt and ridicule, each of us can find our own happy medium.

/answer/222060,Can I confront an employee about interviewing for another job?,,"																																	I cannot see any benefit you would derive from confronting this employee. What the employee did was not illegal or immoral. S/he is just doing what s/he believes is in his/her best interest.  
What would you do if this employee admitted or denied the interview? 
From my perspective, your best action is to acknowledge--to yourself--the emotional charge that this incident triggers. Do you feel betrayed? Abandoned? Dupped?  
Now, put this emotion aside and focus on your next logical step. Start preparing for this employee's departure. You will get much more by staying quiet--and preparing--then you will by any confrontation.   
Your employee has one foot out the door. Get ready for the move. How can you quietly get ready? Is it possible to promote cross training so that someone else knows this employee's job? 
Often in life, we have much more power when we do not let someone else know what we are thinking or what we know.

/answer/222053,How do you handle an employee who posted a potentially threatening comment on a social media site?,,"																																	Here is my advice: Put a policy into effect on all of these types of issues and FAST.  
- Personal Use of Cell Phones 
- Computers, and PDAs At Work
- Video or Audio Recording Devices
- Use of Organization E-Mail/Instant Messaging/Internet
- Acceptable Use for Organization-Owned Computer Equipment
Ignoring such matters will only result in more problems of an even more serious nature and sooner versus later. You are running the risk of the potentially threatened employee seeking redress for a hostile work environment. Why go there? It is totally unnecessary. Employees are supposed to help the company, not hinder it. 
Regarding the employee who posted a potentially threatening comment about another employee--do not hesitate to call him in and tell him in no uncertain terms that such behavior is unprofessional and will NOT be tolerated.  
The company cannot and will not allow any employee to act inappropriately toward another . . . EVER. Tell the employee that he is making you regret the great review and raise you gave to him by acting in such a childish manner.   
Let him know that cell phones at work are to be used only on unpaid time (e.g., lunch breaks) or for legitimate emergencies (sick child). 
From the policy I provide to my clients:  
""Personal calls, personal instant messaging, personal text messaging or twittering during the work day--regardless of whether the equipment used is organization-provided or not--interferes with employee productivity and is distracting to others. Employees are at work essentially to provide value to the organization. They are expected to limit personal interactions during work time and make personal calls and/or send personal text messages, twitter or IM messages on non-work time and to ensure that friends and family members are aware of this organization policy.""

/answer/222046,Is HR allowed to ask me what was discussed during an unpaid break?,,"																																	From a conflict management perspective I can tell you that this situation is loaded with potential conflict.  
Asking an employee about any private conversation puts up a bunch of red flags. Even if the question was simply asked in conversation it is just about guaranteed to put an employee on the defensive. And, a defensive employee is never going to be operating at maximum productivity or loyalty. 
My advice is that you remain calm, sit down with the questioner and voice your concerns. 
Here is my 10-step plan for holding a difficult conversation. 
1. Prepare. Make some notes about the situation and your feelings. Write about where you are, where you want to be and how you might get there.
2. Come to the table and stay there. The other side will come if your message is ""I truly want to find a solution that works for both of us."" If you cannot carry the message, find someone who can intervene on your behalf and get you both to the table.
3. Set the stage. Sit down at a time when you are both clear headed and able to give this important conversation the time and energy it deserves.  Make sure that the environment is private. 
4. Speak from the heart. Do not point fingers of blame. Instead focus on finding a solution that works for both of you. This is collaboration.
5. Listen, listen, listen. Listen as if you are an outside observer with no prior knowledge of the situation. Twenty years in the mediation business has taught me that there are at least two sides to every story. You may be very surprised when you hear the rest of the story.
6. Give yourselves time to think, process the information, and cool down.
7. Define the emotions. Under almost every human conflict someone feels dismissed, discounted, disenfranchised or disrespected. Sometimes, just defining that emotion and realizing that both of us feel the same way--devalued--is enough to resolve the dispute.
8. Be willing to apologize. The closer the relationship, the more likely you are to have stepped on each other's toes. If you cannot bring yourself to apologize for anything specific at least apologize for the distress that the other side has been living with and anything s/he believes you did to contribute to it.
9. Don't leave conflicts unresolved. An agreement to disagree is resolution. Leaving the conflict open sets you up for future fights.
10. If all else fails, hire a professional to help you. Often an outside opinion sheds light on your blind spots and helps reach an agreement. Consider bringing in a mediator when the relationship is important.

/answer/222039,Are employees required to clock-out when going to doctors' appointments?,,"																																	Workers compensation laws vary by state, so I cannot answer your question definitively. Though, most states have a website from which you can obtain information on what your state's workers compensation laws require. 
I can say that some companies do pay injured workers for the time that they spend at doctor's offices for treatment of work-related injuries. But, not because it is a legal requirement--more of a moral obligation in the cases of which I am aware.  
Many states would require that the company's workers compensation insurance pay the worker for this time. 
So, the first thing you probably should do is talk with your workers compensation insurance broker/agent/carrier and ask them what they cover in these regards.

/answer/222036,"If an employee quits unexpectedly, can he be denied unemployment benefits?",,"																																	Nothing definitive can be said such as whether something is possible or not when a state agency is involved in administering a program. 
Without knowing more facts, it does appear that this employee ""quit"" versus was ""fired."" So be careful not to use the word ""fired"" unless you want to ""muddy the waters"" with the state.  
Employees who are fired for reasons other than ""cause"" are normally able to file for and collect unemployment benefits. ""Cause"" normally is especially egregious behavior such as dishonesty (e.g., stealing or having a history of falsifying time records), behaving in a violent or threatening fashion, etc. In other words not simply poor performance. 
Often, employees who are fired for valid reasons such as constantly being late for work or being insubordinate file for unemploymen. And even though the employer well responds to the state's inquiry and justifies firing the employee, the state may still determine in their infinite wisdom that the employee is entitled to unemployment benefits.  
Employers often appeal those decisions, and sometimes they win--but it can be time-consuming and frustrating. 
You have to decide what risk you are willing to take in this situation. Do you want to ""accept the employee's resignation"" (submitted via leaving his workstation and/or the premises without notice or explanation) and risk paying for his unemployment benefits or do you give him another chance?  
If it is the former, document the incident and be prepared for the state to ask for your rendition of what occurred.  Remember not to use the word ""fired"" when you do that. Good luck.

/answer/222035,Is a sick employee eligible for unemployment while he gets treatment?,,"																																	The quick answer is no.
I am assuming that this person was given all of his accrued/unused paid time off work prior to leaving your workforce, as that would have been the right thing to do.  
I am also assuming that you either offered no disability insurance coverage through your company or that this employee did not opt for that coverage. If he had that, he would qualify to be paid at least some portion of his normal compensation while he is disabled due to serious illness for whatever period of time the disability policy allowed.
If you employ 50 or more people, you may want to refer to the FMLA regulations, as if the employee worked the requisite 1,250 hours in the preceding 12-month period, he is entitled to 12 weeks of unpaid leave and his job back. In this instance, he could not collect unemployment as he is off work due to being disabled. 
If you do not employ 50 or more employees, the answer would be that in order to legally collect unemployment benefits, the person is supposed to be capable of seeking employment and commencing a job if/when one is offered. An individual in cancer treatment would not qualify.  
He may be eligible for some kind of social security or other assistance (such as food stamps) while he is unable to work.

/answer/222034,Should I reimburse my employees who deny their company-provided health benefits?,,"																																	There really is no normal (or customary and usual) practice for these matters.  
Legally, you are not required to do anything.  In fact, some companies actually require that employees who have access to coverage through their spouses obtain their medical insurance coverage that way--versus using the insurance offered by their own employer.
Having said that, many employers do offer an offset to employees who either choose to buy their own health insurance coverage or who access health insurance coverage through their spouse's employer's coverage.  
You may want to pay people who do what this employee is doing an amount equal to say 50 percent of what you would be paying for her coverage if she were to stay on the insurance that you offer.  
But, again, this is just a suggested amount. You can do anything you wish--including doing nothing at all.

First, you need to figure out what is going on in your factory.  I suggest you start out by holding brief, individual interviews with each employee.  
At the end of those interviews you will have a different picture of the situation and lots of feedback regarding how you can improve things. Then you can start implementing the most reasonable ideas.

A faux hawk hairstyle can easily be brushed back at work so that the employee would still have the option of gelling up after work.  
On the other hand, I would not pick this fight with a good employee. Our hairstyles are a big part of our self-expression and identity. This is especially true for younger people.  
So, unless there is a really good reason why the employee should not have the faux hawk I would focus on his positive attributes and leave his hair style to him.

/answer/222029,How can I monitor my employees' time on social networking sites and personal phone calls?,,"																																	There are one of two real issues here:  
1. Is the employee accomplishing sufficient amounts or high enough quality in his work efforts?  
If not, deal with this situation on that level as a performance matter--advise him of his shortcomings, counsel and discipline (up to and including termination of employment).  
2. The employee is doing a great job but you are annoyed by him breaking a company policy (showing at the very least some level of dishonesty).  
If this is the case, presumably the employee has a supervisor. So, the old-fashioned but effect use of observation comes to mind. I would not go further than that.

/answer/222028,Can an employee be let go after returning from a workers' compensation claim?,,"																																	Not knowing in what state you do business, I cannot respond as knowledgeably as I would be able to do otherwise.  Workers compensation laws are different in each state.
You should not return the person to her job without a return to work certificate or letter from the employee s primary physician indicating that the employee may return to work and any work restrictions that the doctor advises.  
This should also include the length of time these restrictions apply.  If restrictions are involved, the employee s visits to see if the restrictions can be removed should be at least as frequently as monthly. Insist on that.  A good way to do this is to supply the primary physician with a job description that includes the physical requirements of the job so that the physician has that information on which to base his/her advice regarding restrictions.
If no restrictions are recommended by the primary physician, you can insist on the employee returning to work on a full-time basis--but be prepared for resistance on her part.
If restrictions are recommended by the primary physician, you must determine if you can reasonably accommodate the restrictions. If you have 15 or more employees, you must abide by the Americans with Disabilities Act and/or the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendment Act in these regards.
If your assessment indicates that you cannot accommodate the restrictions advised by the primary physician, you can terminate the employee. But be aware that the best course of action is to consult with an attorney who specializes in employment law in your state before taking that step.  
There will be exposure to a claim of age discrimination and/or discrimination under the ADA/ADAAA if the employee is so inclined to take umbrage at being fired because she was hurt on the job.
A more prudent course of action might be to find a way to accommodate this individual for the time being and see if she is able to do her full job within a reasonable period of time.  
You might hire a temporary part-time employee to pick up the slack, for example, instead of continuing to overburden other regular employees indefinitely.

/article/204184,Human Capital Predictions for 2010,Three strategies for riding the crest of the economic recovery,"Free Webinar | August 16thFind out how to optimize your website to give your customers experiences that will have the biggest ROI for your business.							Register Now  As the economy glides into something that vaguely resembles a recovery, the workplace isn't the battleground that it was at this time last year, but employees are nonetheless bruised and exhausted. There's no escaping that a marginal economic recovery brings with it a brand new set of human capital challenges. In addition, carryover issues from 2009 have continued to increase in importance. Here represents what I think are key human capital strategies as we head into 2010:Maximize Productivity Without Fatigue
Indicators all point to a jobless recovery. That means small businesses will not be inclined to hire many new employees in 2010.That makes sense from a business standpoint, but the people who have survived layoffs and sputtering business output are suffering from the corporate equivalent of post-traumatic stress disorder. They're thankful to have jobs, but are dissatisfied with managers who've been pumping productivity out of them in order to compensate for the relative lack of manpower.It will be paramount for executives and managers to communicate to employees that even if staffing ratios remain low for the time being, there are opportunities for greater responsibilities, career advancement and financial rewards down the line. Employees who have managers that help them understand their own stake in the business are more likely to be engaged in their projects and therefore offer maximum productivity. Implement the best possible performance management solutions, and train managers on how to use them. This will help managers find the right balance on their teams between an increased workload and issues of fatigue.Make Sure Hiring Doesn't Start Behind the Curve
The economic recovery may be jobless, but only for now. The months ahead present a tremendous opportunity for opportunistic executives to begin hiring in the first half of 2010, even if doing so bumps up against their need to conserve cash.The start of 2010 presents a chance to ensure that your organization gets star players before it becomes a candidates' market again.A robust talent acquisition system can support this initiative. That team should use technology to hone efficiency; from keeping onboarding costs down to the ability to target passive candidates. And the hiring strategy should leverage social media as well as traditional recruiting sources.Only key hires should be made during this time, with a special focus on unique or hard-to-get skill sets. These players will be the most in demand as the economic engine recovers.Social Media Gets Even More Socialized
Speaking of social media, its importance to the business landscape will continue to grow, and executives who ignore it do so at their peril. Social media offers significant advantages--such as the afore-mentioned recruiting tool--as well as providing a community for your employees to engage with one another.But social media also carries significant dangers. Disgruntled employees can ""tweet"" their dissatisfactions, and ex-employees have been known to band together and form Facebook groups designed to smear their former employer's reputation.The most obvious first step is to ensure that your organization has a social media policy. But it's also important to actively intervene in your company's social media presence. It's not possible to control the conversation, but by being an active participant--building a Facebook community or LinkedIn group, updating your company's Twitter page--you can guide and influence that conversation.Doing so will help you tell the right story when people encounter your company online, and go a long way toward building your employer brand as human, engaged and responsive.And finally, I suggest that you remain as agile as possible. As economic conditions continue to fluctuate, and health care reform becomes something tangible and actionable, small businesses that can seamlessly adjust their plans accordingly will be best positioned to thrive in the new year. Stretching those corporate muscles and staying limber may turn out to be the best human capital strategy for 2010.

/answer/222012,"Can an HR director ask me if I ""need"" the money when discussing a raise?",,"																																	Compensation should be based on the market value of the work being done--value to the enterprise provided. Quantifiable factors such as education, experience, amount and type of supervision required and abilities required should also play a role. 
Even trying to base what people are paid on such factors opens the door to claims of discrimination in pay practices in the U.S. 
It is very unfortunate if you were promised a salary increase for passing boards or obtaining specific certifications and then were not given the raise.  
If the practice of giving a standard kind of increase to salary is a standard past practice for passing specific tests, it is possible that you have a legitimate claim of discrimination. But without knowing more, I cannot fully advise you on that.
To answer your actual question, it may be legal for the HR director to ask such a question. But it does show extremely poor judgment, as the question is totally irrelevant regarding how much you should be paid for the work that you do and the value that you provide to the hospital.  
Asking questions like this also opens the door to a claim of discriminatory pay practices, as I mentioned above.

""We wanted to pull it all together.""Today, Denver-based Thought Equity Motion works with content partners and clients including Paramount, National Geographic, the NCAA, Saturday Night Live, 30 Rock, and Mad Men. ""You can't watch T.V. for 30 minutes and not see our product,"" Schaff says. The company's sales exceed $15 million a year.Does he ever wish he could hit the fast forward button during job interviews to see which applicants would be the best employees? ""Oh yeah,"" he says. ""People are by far the most expensive mistake we make.""Entrepreneurs Still Struggle With Hiring
Small businesses need ambitious employees who can take initiative to get the job done. And small employers now have an opportunity to upgrade their workforce since the number of available job candidates has grown.There's evidence that small employers are putting more emphasis on soft skills: 50 percent of small business owners in an October Intuit Payroll survey say they would rather hire a flexible ""people person"" or a ""jack of all trades"" instead of a highly-specialized ""creative genius"" or ""math whiz.""The recession also has employees rethinking what they want in a job. An August CareerBuilder report found nearly 60 percent of workers surveyed were interested to work for a small business, and 20 percent of workers laid off from fulltime jobs over the last year had found jobs at small businesses.These numbers are compelling for two reasons, says Jason Ferrara, CareerBuilder's vice president of corporate marketing. First, they show the relevance of small businesses in a poor economy. Second, they say something about job seekers. ""Not everyone wants to work for a large, multi-national company,"" Ferrara says.The good news? Small employers have a very large, interested applicant pool at their fingertips. The bad news? Small business hiring is up only 1.9 percent so far this year while salaries are down 6.5 percent, according to data from online small business payroll company SurePayroll. Many small businesses have trimmed workweeks to avoid layoffs--something that's not always a great selling point with the most sought-after applicants. ""What we're seeing right now is a very strong level of underemployment,"" says SurePayroll President Michael Alter.Ferrara still sees small employers struggling to define their ""employment brand,"" or the company's purpose and the type of workers it needs, while grappling with a resume deluge. When small companies do pinpoint the very best applicants, they can fall short in selling them on future opportunities for advancement. ""Large companies do a better job at this,"" Ferrara says. ""As an entrepreneur, you're more concerned about communicating the financial [aspects] of the company.""Attracting the Best and Brightest
Kara Goldin, founder and CEO of Hint , a San Francisco company that produces a line of naturally sweetened water products, says finding referrals is the ticket to attracting the best people in the recession. ""If there's a reference from somebody in the beverage industry who has worked with this person--or even a grocery chain that has worked with this person--it definitely helps,"" says Goldin, whose company generates more than $1 million in sales annually.Applicants have approached Hint with a great resume in hand, but Goldin, 42, still wants to know they've done their research. She remembers being impressed when Hint current head of sales contacted the company to say it was on his short list of desirable employers, and went on to explain why. ""He's terrific, and he could have gone to a lot of [companies],"" she says. ""He was really selling us on why he loved the product, and what he said made a ton of sense to us.""Thought Equity has pulled its employees into the recruitment process by paying them a bonus for referring talented applicants who get hired. Encouraging employees to recruit their new coworkers has been very effective, says Schaff, who estimates 90 percent of the company's new hires are coming to the company via referral.The company still receives about 100 resumes every day--mainly from younger applicants. Jobs in technology and development can still be very tough to fill. The company must also constantly re-recruit its best employees as competitors try to upgrade their workforces. ""Good people are always being recruited, and you always have to focus on making sure that you can retain them,"" Schaff says.Ultimately, attracting talented, self-directed employees requires great positioning, great messaging and a great understanding of what they want in a job. Financial incentives don't hurt, either: Hint offers its 25 employees equity in the company, something Goldin sees as a big motivator for the most talented, ambitious employees.Alter predicts Main Street's recovery will be slow as small business owners get their existing employees back up to full employment plus overtime before they start hiring new people. Still, he's encouraged that small business wages have been declining at a shallower pace in recent months. ""This tells me that we're hitting bottom, and as we start to hit bottom we will recover,"" he says. ""I just don't see a big, robust recovery.""Strong recovery or not, Goldin plans to increase Hint's headcount in 2010. ""As we open with stores across the country, we'll definitely need salespeople to manage those accounts,"" she says.Exceptional talent is out there, provided entrepreneurs can sell them on the opportunity and turn them loose on the job. Says Ferrara: ""You should be hiring people who are smarter than you.""Chris Penttila is a freelance journalist whose work has also appeared in The Costco Connection, Oregon Business magazine, QSR Magazine, TheStreet.com and other publications.

/article/203770,Retirement: What's That?,"Though you may never stop working, here are 5 tips to ensure financial stability.","When your employed friends talk about retirement, do you have a hard time relating? When you think about growing older, do you picture yourself happily still working? As an entrepreneur, you're not alone.After spending years building businesses they're passionate about, many entrepreneurs say they'll never stop working. ""I may be running a car wash and not a financial software company [after reaching retirement age], but I'll be doing something,"" says Mark Hoffman, president of LifeYield and a serial entrepreneur. ""Most of us see retirement as working less hard and having less stress. But because it's difficult to hedge inflation, I always plan to have something that brings in cash.""In addition to the financial rational for continuing to work, some entrepreneurs believe their quality of life and health would be diminished if they stopped doing the work they love. ""Life is growth,"" says Francois Gadenne, a serial entrepreneur and executive director of the Retirement Income Industry Association, who says he plans to always stay productive. ""When growth stops, life withers away.""But even if you plan to never completely stop working, a backup plan can be important. ""Most entrepreneurs don't plan on retiring but when they reach a certain time in their lives, they want options,"" says Robert Cadena, Jr., of Retirement Solutions in San Antonio, Texas. ""I tell all my business owner [clients] not to put all their eggs in one basket, i.e., their business.""The Retirement-Planning ConundrumIn some ways, planning and saving for retirement runs contrary to the typical characteristics of successful entrepreneurs. For instance, does planning for retirement make you a pessimist who assumes your business will never grow big enough to be sold for millions of dollars, making retirement savings irrelevant? Does relying on a retirement nest egg mean you've lost the entrepreneurial confidence you once had?Not according to Gadenne. ""It's nice to do the high-wire act, but would you be interested in buying a net?"" he says.""It's great if you're that positive person who loves what you're doing and can't imagine ever not working,"" says Marcia Mantell, owner of Mantell Retirement Consulting in Needham, Mass. ""Keep marching down that path. But still, there's got to be a plan B, which is retirement savings. You don't know what's going to happen. It might not be you; you might stay healthy but maybe the market changes and your business is no longer viable. The market doesn't always cooperate with your dreams.""While staying busy late into your golden years may be ideal, experts say the wisest entrepreneurs will give themselves another option. ""The entrepreneurs who say they're never going to retire are usually on two tracks,"" says Stephen Dobrow, president of Burlingame, Calif.-based Primark Benefits. ""There are those who want to work because they always have and they want the mental activity. And there are those who have to work because they didn't set things up so that they could accumulate a large amount of cash to retire.""Planning That Works
Three-quarters of the entrepreneurs Dobrow works with wait until they're five or 10 years away from retirement to begin planning for it aggressively. In many cases, business owners are too busy with their businesses to think about retirement planning, or they spend years investing any extra money back into their businesses rather than into retirement funds. While an early start can yield greater returns, experts say it's better to start saving late than to never save at all.And because every entrepreneur and every business is different, the right plan for each situation varies. Retirement planning experts recommend considering some of the following choices, and possibly pursuing more than one.Zero coupon bonds
A rarely-discussed retirement option, zero coupon bonds are ideal for entrepreneurs, Gadenne says. Rather than receiving interest coupons twice a year as with regular bonds, zero coupon bonds pay no interest until maturity. Investors buy the bonds at deep discounts and at maturity they receive a lump sum equaling the initial investment plus the interest over the life of the bond. While zero coupon bonds usually don't mature for 10 or 15 years after the purchase, it allows you to have an income floor, Gadenne says. ""You know there's a pile of money coming in that will allow you to live for [awhile].""Cash-balance pension plans
Another little-known option for retirement planning, cash-balance pension plans allow high-earning entrepreneurs to avoid some taxes while providing an extra benefit to their employees. ""Business owners call me all the time saying they've put everything they have into their business and they're still making money even in the recession, but they are getting killed with taxes,"" Dobrow says. For these business owners, he designs a cash balance pension plan, which includes a component for helping employees save, as with a 401(k), but allows entrepreneurs to invest much more pretax income than a 401(k). For instance, if an owner would normally pay $300,000 per year in taxes, he can put that amount into a cash balance plan; about $240,000 could go into the owner's account and the rest could go to employees' accounts.
""It's good for the government because they'll eventually get the taxes anyway, it's good for the owner because he builds a good retirement, and it's good for employees because they're getting a good contribution from the owner that would normally go to pay his taxes,"" Dobrow says. ""It's the best-kept secret in retirement planning. Even CPAs don't know about it.""Business valuation, design or transferMany business owners assume their business will be their retirement plan, says Stephen Mitchell, a consultant and chief operating officer of the Retirement Income Industry Association. While that plan doesn't work out for many entrepreneurs, some are able to build their businesses and sell them to the highest bidder, a plan that can result in much lower tax rates. For instance, Hoffman, who plans to build his company for five to 10 years and then sell it, owns stock in his company and ""when the purchase occurs, I'll only have to pay capital gains tax on the stock [15 percent] as opposed to regular income tax [sometimes up to 50 percent].""
Others set up the business so it continues to generate cash flow with minimal management required, Mitchell says, citing a friend who built a commercial real estate business that now continues to provide him with an income during retirement through rental fees.
Some business owners also transfer their companies to family members, who are able to pay the original owner a salary for life. However, Dobrow says believing that ""my kids will take over my business successfully and be able to pay me a salary"" is a myth that often proves to be false.Individual Retirement AccountsWhile IRAs and Roth IRAs are available to entrepreneurs just as they are to anyone else, Mantell says the Simplified Employee Pension plan, known as the SEP-IRA or the Simple IRA, is ""hands down, by far the best investment product for any self-employed individual."" The exceptions are those entrepreneurs who have many employees, because if the business owner makes contributions for himself, he must make contributions for everyone in the company. For solo entrepreneurs or those with just a few employees, the SEP-IRA is ""completely flexible and free to set up if you go through a retail channel,"" Mantell says. This year, entrepreneurs can save up to $49,000 in a SEP-IRA. To find a financial advisor who can set up the plan, Mantell recommends the Financial Planning Association or the National Association of Personal Financial Advisors.401(k) plansFor entrepreneurs who have very steady, quite high revenue streams, the Self-Employed 401(k), also known as the Solo K, is a good option for retirement planning. ""You can sock away more than you can with a SEP-IRA, but it's a qualified plan so you have to contribute the same amount every year and you have to have a very rigorous audit trail,"" Mantell says.Nancy Mann Jackson is a freelance writer who writes frequently about small business issues.

/answer/222001,Can your employer request to know where you are on off days?,,"																																	Whether nonexempt employees must be paid for their on-call time depends on whether they are ""waiting to be engaged"" or are ""engaged to wait"" as defined by the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) Wage and Hour Division.
When an on-call employee is required to stay at the workplace or is so near the workplace that he cannot use his time freely, he is engaged to wait (on duty). In such cases, the employee must be compensated for this time.
If an on-call employee must carry a paging device, such as a beeper or cellular phone, and the employee is relieved of his or her duties, the time is unpaid unless the employer has an on-call policy that specifically requires pay during such times. 
Federal court decisions have held that on-call employees are not overly constrained by a paging device. Therefore, the unpaid, waiting to be engaged status could apply to those employees who are not required to wait near or at the work site.
As with any nonexempt employee, federal law requires that on-call nonexempt employees still must be compensated at or above the minimum wage and must be paid overtime for all hours worked in excess of 40 in any given workweek. Also, employers should make sure to check state laws on minimum wage and overtime. 
So what does this mean? Basically, if you cannot freely enjoy your time off work, you are ""engaged to wait"" and are on duty and entitled to compensation.  
If your employer does not want to pay you for this time, s/he should not require the 30-minute response time to calls and should not be requiring you to be in any particular proximity to the workplace during your time off work.

/answer/221998,Can my manager try to get me to quit?,,"																																	To answer your actual question, yes your manager can try to get you to quit.  
He knows that if you quit, you will have difficulty collecting unemployment benefits whereas if he fires you, you will have no difficulty collecting unemployment benefits. That is most likely his strategy. 
You are right to resist resigning. Simply keep doing your job to the very best of your ability. Write down when he calls you and so forth so that you have a record of what has transpired in case it becomes necessary to be able to recall your situation later.  Do not let him intimidate you to quit until you find a better job. 
However, no one enjoys being in a workplace where one is not wanted.  So, it does make good sense to be checking the major job boards (Monster and CareerBuilder) as well as sites such as LinkedIn and Craigslist at least once a day and submitting your resume to any job that interests you.  
Do not apply to other jobs using a company computer or on company time. He can use that kind of misuse of company resources/time as justification to fire you for ""cause"".  That could affect how quickly you will be able to collect unemployment compensation.

/answer/221994,Can I be forced to babysit the bosses kids as a condition of my employment?,,"																																	Wow. Talk about a no-win situation. There is no easy answer for your dilemma. Is this a privately held company? Does your boss have a boss?  How much do you want to keep your job? 
You know the serenity prayer--the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can and the wisdom to know the difference--well, you need it now. There is a cost in either action--having the difficult dialogue with your boss or continuing to babysit. Which cost are you more willing to pay?    
If you choose to hold a difficult discussion with your boss you should first consider:
- What is the best location for holding the discussion? (Help establish a positive tone by meeting in a comfortable, neutral location.)
- Does any one else need to be involved in the discussion and/or the implementation of a possible resolution?
- What are the possible consequences of admitting a mistake, losing emotional control or exposing a personal vulnerability?
- What level of confidentiality is reasonable to expect?
- Are any topics or solutions off limits?
- How can the topic be framed as a mutual problem?
Once you are ready for the difficult discussion, make sure that your attitude reflects the fact that you see the situation as an opportunity to work together. 
Additionally, you will want to consider the following concepts and strategies. Use these questions as a guide:
- Where are we now?
- Were do we need to be?
- How will we get there?
- What do each of us need to do?
- How can I help you? 
 Be prepared for confrontation. Expect some level of venting and strong emotion. If you are prepared you will be able to keep your cool and model the attitudes and behaviors you want from her. Uncontrolled emotions can harm your image, no matter how much you are provoked.
Seek commonalities, such as a shared experience (feeling dismissed or overwhelmed) to define the problem.  
- Listen and get the whole story. Active listening takes practice and an open, unbiased and uncluttered mind. The active listener is actively engaged in the communication process and pays strict attention to all speakers, asking appropriate, open-ended questions (how, what, when, where, who?) to probe for underlying interests and clarifying questions to verify understanding. The active listening skills of empathizing, paraphrasing, reframing, summarizing and picking-up on non-verbal clues are worth cultivating.
- Focus on solving the problem, not placing blame. Fault-finding is looking backward, resolution requires moving forward.
- Your tone of voice and body language must be in agreement with your words. She will believe your voice and other non-verbal messages as opposed to your words if there is inconsistency between them.
- Don't expect to find a flawless solution. A solution that can be revisited and readjusted may be a great first step.
- If you are stuck, suggest that each of you write down your perspectives and some recommended remedies. Then read each other s writings.
- If you choose not to hold the difficult discussion, that's okay too. But, then you are going to have to work hard to make sure that resentment does not pollute your work and attitude.

/answer/221993,Should my employer compensate me for denying their health-care benefits?,,"																																	Your company has no obligation whatsoever to compensate you for using your wife's health insurance plan.  
Most spouses who are both eligible for medical insurance through their employers determine which plan is most cost-effective for them and/or which coverage is most beneficial to them.  
If your wife's health-care coverage is what you want for any reason, that is fine. But, again, your employer is not obligated to pay you for making that decision, even though it saves your employer money.  
Keep in mind that more and more often, employers that offer medical insurance require workers to opt for their spouse's coverage if their spouse is eligible at another company. 
Some employers do pay some offset to employees who opt to buy their own medical insurance coverage through other sources. Usually it is a standard amount based on how much they pay for their portion of the cost of single coverage for their employees.  
However, this is totally an option that the employer decides to do in the spirit of employee relations. It is not legally required nor an industry standard practice.

/answer/221987,Can an employee be forced to take sick time?,,"																																	Based on the fact that the company consists of first responders, I believe that this policy is legitimate. That is, it was not designed to save the organization money or otherwise take advantage of the employees. It was designed to protect the people served by the organization.  
What you don't say is for how long your husband was sent home and/or if there is testing or otherwise a way for him to be proven well and able to return to work. If he was sent home for a very short period, it would be a different burden than if he was sent home for a longer period of time. 
The company should include in its policy requiring exposed individuals to leave work whether these people may/may not/should/should not apply sick time to be paid for absences caused by this circumstance as well as clear guidelines for returning to work.  
Remember, too, that normally paid sick time is a gift from the company to the employee. That is, it is not actually earned nor does the law require that a company pay people when they are not working.
If your husband is in a unionized environment, that would be a different matter and the union would weigh in on the situation. If he is an exempt employee under the Fair Labor Standards Act, he should be paid for the entire day if he works any part of it, as a general rule. Hope this is helpful.

/answer/221986,How much maternity leave am I required to give my employees?,,"																																	I will answer your question in the hopes that you live in one of the majority of states in the U.S. Back in the 1970s the law changed and required employers to treat pregnancy the same as any other temporary disability. So, you need to comply with what her doctor says this woman needs regarding time off work to have her baby. 
Sometimes, a woman is given restrictions during her pregnancy (i.e., activities that her job entails that she cannot do while she is pregnant) or she is told by her doctor to stop working at a certain point in her pregnancy for health reasons.  If either of these happen, you must abide by whatever the doctor says. 
Regarding restrictions, you need to understand what she can do and what she cannot do and provide her with work within her restrictions, if you can. If you cannot--as some small businesses cannot--send her home until she either is given restrictions you can accommodate or her doctor removes the restrictions.
Normally, a woman who has a baby has a checkup about six weeks after giving birth. At that time, her doctor usually provides her with a release saying that she can return to work. Sometimes it takes longer for the woman to recover (e.g., cesarean birth).  She should let you know about her projected return to work date as soon as she knows it.
While many employers do carry disability coverage or offer it to their employees at employee-expense, you are not required to carry or offer disability insurance for your employees.  
If you do and if she enrolled in the plan, she can collect disability payments while she is required to be off work by her doctor. You are not required to pay her any salary while she is out due to pregnancy/giving birth except for whatever your employee manual specifies for accrued vacation/sick leave. Most women save up all the paid time off work they can to use when they leave work to have their babies. 
Your company is too small to be covered by the Family Medical and Leave Act; so technically, you do not have to give her more time off work than the doctor says she needs for health reasons. And if you must, you can replace her, as well. 
If you offer medical insurance coverage, be sure that she knows her responsibility to pay the premiums for her coverage and how and when to do this before she goes out on her leave.  Many employers do pay their usual portion of the premium for the employee while she is having her baby--but it is not required.

/answer/221985,Can an employer request that married employees waive their healthcare coverage?,,"																																	The answer to this question is yes, they can do this. And no, they don't have to pay the employee anything extra for having waived coverage.
This is a fairly new practice--devised by insurance brokers, by the way.  It may not seem at all fair; but it is legal to do. 
While benefits are considered part of the compensation package when employers calculate the total cost of each employee, and while an employer is obligated to pay workers fairly for doing the same work, there is no specific legal requirement that the employer pay the employee anything extra for waiving insurance coverage, even though the employer required that the employee do it.
Now having said all of this, who knows what the future will hold? Laws may be passed to stop this practice at some point. But as of right now, there is no legal reason for an employer not to do this.

/answer/221978,Can my job description be changed without notice?,,"																																	Your employer has the right to make this change. Organizations evolve.  While the company may have needed a UPS clerk and/or a UPS clerk II at one time, your manager has determined that the work is similar enough in nature to reduce the job title/classifications to one.  
While there may be differences in what you do each day compared to the mail room clerks, the types of responsibilities, types and levels of skills required to do the work, the knowledge and/or accountability involved and so forth may be so similar in nature that the manager felt that it just made good sense to eliminate a job title that was no longer justified. 
Without more information about the differences as well as the similarities of the UPS clerk versus the mail room clerk job, it is difficult to speculate.
An employer may hire someone for a particular job and then the job is eliminated or changed over time. Just because the employer hired someone into a specific job does not mean that the employer is obligated to maintain that specific job no matter what transpires regarding technology, for example, and other factors that affect company operations.  
The employee always has the right to leave if the changes in the job title, job requirements or responsibilities are not acceptable to him/her.  But employers have the right to determine what workforce they need to run the company efficiently and effectively--and profitably. In fact, that is one of their principal responsibilities.

/answer/221974,Can an employer pay two employees with the same job differently?,,"																																	In a word, yes. Your employer can determine that the starting rate for a job will be lower going forward--that is for people new in the job versus those who have been doing it for a while.  
Without knowing more information, it is difficult for me to understand on what basis the employer made this decision. I speculate that in the current job market and economy, the employer may just feel that s/he does not have to pay as much at this time for the work to be done as s/he formerly did when times were booming and good people were scarce.
It could be that there are other skills or knowledge that the more senior typists have regarding the job responsibilities. Regardless, the employer determines what rates s/he wants to pay for work to be done. 
Hopefully, s/he uses actual pay market data and treats employees fairly; but this is not always the case. Have you asked the employer why you are being paid so much less than the others? You have told me what it is not (e.g., longevity); but the employer may have a good business reason.  
I would want to know how I can earn more; and knowing why I am being paid less would help me determine that.

/answer/221973,Can an employer choose to deny exempt employees' holiday pay?,,"																																	In a word, yes. That is, holidays, like other paid time off work is a gift from employers. If the employer determines that s/he cannot afford this gift or that the employee(s) does not deserve this gift, s/he can withdraw the gift.  
Now having said that, exempt employees are required by the Fair Labor Standards Act to be paid for any day in which they perform their work--even if they work less than 8 hours. 
Employers should also be careful about deducting pay for time taken off work for jury duty, witness appearances, temporary military leave, disciplinary infractions or lack of available work unless the deduction extends through an entire pay period.
Department of Labor regulations specifically allow daily deductions from exempt employee wages only for sickness, disability and personal leave (including vacations).
It is certainly not a good employer practice to refuse to pay exempt employees for defined company holidays. Morale must be affected in such an environment.

/answer/221962,Can I ask for a copy of the background check that apparently lost me a job?,,"																																	Something else may have happened between the offer being made contingent on a satisfactory background check information and now; but you do have rights concerning the background check if your credit history is the reason for the problem.
Under the Federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), you must be told if information in your credit report or other type of consumer report has been used against you. 
Anyone who uses such a report to deny you employment must tell you, and must give you the name, address and phone number of the agency that provided the information. You have a right to know what is in your file. You should be given the report by the offending agency free of charge.
States may enforce the FCRA and many states have their own consumer reporting laws. In some cases, you may have more rights under state law. For more information, contact your state or local Consumer Protection Agency or your state's attorney general.
Remember, however, that much of the information gathered by background checking companies is contained in public records (e.g., criminal convictions). If what was uncovered during the background check was something of this nature, you still need to know about it and make sure that there is no case of mistaken identity involved.
Next step? Politely ask the employer why you have not received the formal offer of employment. If you have any reason to believe from the answer provided that the background check is the reason, ask for a copy of it. If they resist, tell them that you really have no choice but to contact the office of the state attorney general, as you need to find out what could possibly be in a report of any kind that would preclude you from being offered a job. Otherwise, how can you get the record corrected?

Most companies have their own guidelines for such matters. If you do not have an agreement with your employee in this regard and it is not covered in your employee manual, then you should use your best judgment to be fair.  
What you determine should be based on the normal sales cycle. How long does it take to close a sale, as a general rule? Being fair may mean paying out the entire commission if the sale is closed within 30 days and 50 percent if the sale takes 60 days to close.  
It may mean paying a percentage if the sales closes within 30 days and no commission if it takes more than 30 days. What you want to do is set a precedent with which you can live for the long-term and avoid making the ex-employee feel exploited enough to file a claim with the Department of Labor for non-payment of wages. While such a claim may not prevail, it can be time-consuming to take on that kind of dispute.
You need to pay them with a paycheck if they were an employee.

/answer/221954,Do I have to give every employee the same work hours?,,"																																	Yes. You can customize work schedules to suit your specific situations--if you want to do that and it does not negatively impact the productivity of the operations at hand. 
What you have to remember is that other employees may feel that their personal situations also warrant special treatment (i.e. unique/altered work hours).  
So to some people, doing this for one employee would be perceived as ""a slippery slope."" Still, it is your decision as the owner/manager of the enterprise.

/article/202518,4 Business Lessons from NASCAR,"You're the driver, the car's your business--now learn how to finish first.","NASCAR racing provides a good model for business success--you're the driver, the car is your business. It takes a lot to build and keep that car running, and even more to put it into the winner's slot.We don't succeed in business by beating the competition. Unlike racers, businesses win by serving. It's crucial to keep your focus on serving your customers and improving your business.
Still, there are several good lessons to be learned from the NASCAR race track--especially in tough economic times, when the difference between going forward and going under is that extra edge:Appreciate the differences. Admire what each team member and vendor has to offer. Your business wins when the team does every job right. The engine, transmission, electrical system, chassis and aerodynamics all figure into a great race car. Dozens of people build several cars for every driver. At the race, the pit crew is there to keep the car running. The shop focuses on excellence, while the pit crew focuses on speed.The lesson: Take care of all parts of your business. Hire team members who focus on their job--then you're ready to race!
Thank your team and your suppliers. Be specific. Tell them that what they do well helps your business. Make your staff feel good about contributing to the overall cause. Then, when an employee does something wrong, you can steer them back in the right direction.Drive your business. I know one highly successful businessman who took too much time off having fun--and lost everything. Instead, be like Roger Penske, the most successful businessman in racing--he sits in with the pit crew during the race.
Talk to everyone on your team each week and really listen to each one of them. Give your team what they need to succeed--after all, 94 percent of all workplace errors are caused by management. That means that 19 out of 20 times, when an employee makes a mistake, it's because you didn't set things up right. Is every job well-defined? Is every task assigned? Does every person have the right tools to do the job, and are all those tools working? Can you help your business by training your team?The lesson: People naturally enjoy succeeding and contributing. Build a business where everyone knows their part, then keep clearing away barriers so your team can do good work.
A great NASCAR team owner draws in and pleases corporate sponsors and picks great crew chiefs. In turn, a great crew chief chooses the best crew and works well with everyone. In the same way, you need to go out and find funding, build relationships and then build a great team of managers and workers to support your hard work.Success is 99 percent preparation . Sure, in the end, it all comes down to the driver. But that's only after 99 percent of the work is done.The lesson: Prepare so the sale is easy when the time comes.
In NASCAR, a bad tire can ruin a driver's day. Of the 43 cars that start a NASCAR race, 30 likely out of the race from the start due to mechanical flaws. It's the same in business. If you run events or deliver projects, one mistake can cause a customer to walk away and not come back.Pay attention to the details. Staying in business requires more than making money--it requires making more money than we spend. That margin, called net revenue or profit, comes from attention to detail.
Sometimes, a car makes it around the race track, but just can't win. These days, our businesses keep grinding on, but can't seem to make much money.
During the race, atmospheric changes require constant tweaking of the aerodynamics at each pit stop, and an error of judgment about where to put the weight can take the car out of contention.The lesson: Your business might require tweaking all day long. Are there napkins and ketchup at the condiments counter? Are shelves near the front restocked? Miss a person's favorite item, and they'll buy it somewhere else--and they might not come back.This column commemorates my late brother, Paul Kemp, former owner of Pique Performance, who provided these details and confirming that NASCAR is a great place to learn business lessons, and who was an example of service and kindness in business, family and community.

/answer/221949,Can I ask my employees to take a temporary hourly pay cut in lieu of furloughs?,,"																																	When you say ""hourly pay cut,"" I have to assume that all of your employees are non-exempt. So, the answer is that unless you have contracts in place promising to pay an explicit hourly rate for a specified period of time, you can do an across-the-board pay cut instead of implementing a furlough. 
The things to consider are to plan carefully and communicate clearly. If you have a budget figure as a target, that will help you to cut pay only to the degree necessary and for only the duration necessary. 
If you are on an anniversary-day-in-job pay review plan, you need to take into consideration when workers were given their last annual pay increase so that no one is inadvertently more adversely affected by a pay cut than others. If this would be the case, you may need to calculate the pay cuts on a prorated basis to be most fair.
If you have exempt employees, you must make sure that the pay cut you implement does not take them below the minimums for their exemption classification under the federal Fair Labor Standards Act. If it does, you must change their status accordingly and pay them time and one-half for hours worked over 40 in a week (or eight in a day required by some states).

/article/202472,5 Ways to Protect Yourself During Layoffs,"Implementing structured hiring, training and review processes can prevent a lawsuit.","With unemployment at a quarter-century high and uncertainty one of the few constants in today's economy, companies across the country face the possibility--or the reality--of layoffs.
Terminating employees either for cause or financial reasons is a difficult task often exacerbated by the specter of legal liability. There are, however, a number of preventive measures employers can take well before it becomes necessary to dismiss an employee--and before deciding to hire a job applicant--that both enhance employee performance and better enable the organization to make rational business decisions when problems arise.
The following are proactive practices for avoiding the employment law courthouse:""There is No Such Thing as a Wrongful Discharge, Only a Wrongful Hire."" Employers who thoroughly review job applicants and take care in making hiring decisions are better able to select qualified individuals who believe in the company's cultural values and will work hard and stay for the long haul. This involves not only a thoughtful review and analysis of the potential employee's prior work history and educational background, but also to ascertain whether an applicant has the ability to make the commitment the company is looking for. Spending time on the ""intake"" reduces time spent on the ""outtake"" while minimizing liability and maximizing productivity.Double Check Your Documents. Much of the paperwork setting forth both the employer's and employee's responsibilities is completed early on in the hiring process. The employment contract, for example, describes whether the relationship is ""at-will"" or for a definite period of time. These documents are more than just boilerplate and will almost always come into play if there is an employment dispute. If applicable, the parties should negotiate and sign a legally compliant trade-secret, non-compete, and/or non-solicitation agreement. Companies may also consider asking employees to sign a legally enforceable pre-employment arbitration agreement. Employee handbooks should be reviewed periodically to ensure they are up-to-date and accurately reflect the company's policies and expectations.Provide an Orientation . Employees who understand their role in an organization and have an open chain of communication with management are more likely to succeed. Regardless of how much communication takes place during the interview process, the company's expectations for a particular employee should be reiterated and clarified during orientation. During an initial orientation program, companies should also make sure employees understand the employer's Equal Employment Opportunity policy and are aware of internal complaint resolution procedures. Employees are less likely to talk to lawyers or go to the EEOC if an issue arises when they know there is an internal procedure for reporting complaints and expressing concerns.Train Your Management. Managers and supervisors are often hired based on their ability to do a particular job rather than their ability to motivate others to do that job. Anyone in an organization cloaked with managerial authority, however, needs to understand the company's fundamental principles and learn to manage effectively. Companies should remind managers that offering positive reinforcement, respecting employees' opinions, and treating everyone with respect goes a long way in motivating workers to be productive and committed to the company.Be Honest, Be Consistent . Documents are crucial in litigation. If an employer terminates an employee who never received a negative evaluation for poor performance, it is going to have a lot of explaining to do when faced with a discrimination lawsuit. Though it is often difficult to be critical, evaluations that do not accurately reflect employee performance can doom a company later on. It is also important for companies to consistently follow progressive discipline policies for all employees.Many business owners and corporate executives--particularly in small companies without complex human resource systems--often delay implementing structured hiring, training and review processes, thinking, ""I won't get sued if I treat my employees right. It won't happen to me."" It is only after the company gets hit with a lawsuit that it begins to proactively protect itself for the future. Planning, however, can save a great deal of time and money and prevent unwanted business distractions. ",Growth Strategies,2009-07-06 00:00:00
/article/202466,Build a Social Media Hiring Strategy,Use your online network to lure quality talent.,"Jon Jordan got a weird feeling recently when he interviewed a candidate for a sales and marketing position.
The applicant's claim of double-digit sales at another company didn't parallel with that company's turbulent history. ""It didn't match up,"" says Jordan, founder of Atlantic Business Technologies, a Raleigh, N.C. web development and marketing firm with 30 employees.
He went on LinkedIn and found a connection in the applicant's network to verify his suspicions. The claim ""was completely false,"" says Jordan, 30. The applicant didn't get the job.
Jordan's not the only one cruising social networking sites during the hiring process. A June Jump Start Social Media survey of 100 hiring managers at small, mid-size and large companies found 75 percent go to LinkedIn to research job candidates before making a job offer, while 48 percent check out Facebook and 26 percent go to Twitter. When asked where they find talent for job openings, 66 percent said LinkedIn, 23 percent said Facebook and 16 percent said Twitter.Social media sites have become an integral piece of the hiring puzzle; it's how to leverage these sites most effectively as a recruiting tool that has companies scrambling. These sites are low-cost or free to join, but it takes time and effort to make them truly useful.
""Most companies aren't doing enough,"" says Veronica Fielding, president of Jump Start Social Media. ""They think there's an ROI that's got to be associated with it immediately.""
Other companies are still trying to wrap their heads about the whole idea of social media. When Oklahoma City-based HR consultant Jessica Miller-Merrell gave a talk about social media at an HR conference this spring, some people asked her how to use ""Tweeter,"" while others believed social media was the domain of marketing and Generation Y, not the HR department.
""Most of the HR people there [were] not seeing the value yet,"" says Miller-Merrell, who blogs about the social media/HR axis on her site, BloggingForJobs.blogspot.com.
On the other end of the spectrum are entrepreneurial firms like New York City's 5W Public Relations, which is seeing a big payoff from its social media recruiting efforts. The 75-employee firm has a LinkedIn profile, a company Facebook page, a blog and a Twitter account with hundreds of followers. Founder Ronn Torossian, 34, posts job openings to Twitter and recently recruited a great hire with way. He's recruited other employees through Facebook. ""I think social media absolutely does work to help recruit [new hires],"" he says.
Atlantic Business Technologies posts job openings on Twitter that direct applicants to the company website and the company's Facebook page. Its LinkedIn profile offers a company overview and employee profiles. Jordan likes taking the company's job openings viral on Twitter by ""re-tweeting""-- that is, having his followers spread the word to their followers. ""Many times it just takes a couple of 're-tweets' to get potential candidates to review the job description,"" he says. ""Facebook and LinkedIn are great for networking and Twitter is better for broadcasting.""
Twitter is more than a form of microblogging; it's also a real-time search engine. Miller-Merrell suggests using hash tags that designate a topic (i.e. #jobs) and simplify Twitter searches. ""You can actually search for '#jobs' and use advanced options to sort or narrow it down by zip code,"" she says. Sites like TweetMyJobs.com and Jobshouts.com will let you post job openings that are fed over to Twitter. For best results, balance your marketing with links and trendy insights that position your brand as a valuable part of the Twitter community, Fielding says.How to Build a Social Media Strategy
This downturn is a great time to develop a social media recruiting strategy if your company doesn't have one yet. Here are some basic tips for getting started:Analyze your staffing needs. What kinds of jobs will you fill over the next year, and which social media sites will get you in front of your target applicants? If you run a small grocery, your potential workers are on the more casual Myspace and Facebook. If you need a director of sales, LinkedIn is a better bet.Start where you're comfortable . Some sites will feel more intuitive to you, and that's fine. Dedicate 15 minutes to your favorite social media site a few times a week until you've got it down, and then branch out. Learn how other entrepreneurs use social media sites for recruiting, and don't be embarrassed to ask other members on these sites for shortcuts as you're learning them.Remember your manners. Would you walk into a networking event full of people you don't know and tell them to find the perfect applicant for you ASAP? Of course not; that would be rude. The same manners apply in cyberspace. Join some groups on social media sites and participate actively for awhile before you ask members to forward your job listings and so on. Good manners and common sense give people a good vibe about you, and your company.Don't do too little, but don't do too much. Some candidates might think your company is in the dark ages if its social profile is too low, while others might get intimidated--even suspicious--if your company seems to be everywhere, all the time. Ponder the right level of exposure as you position your company.Be consistent and responsive. Make sure employees have a uniform way of describing the company on these sites so job seekers aren't confused, Fielding says. Designate an employee to check the company's social media pages daily, too. If a customer posts a message to your company's Facebook page saying the company is unresponsive, you'll only further this perception if the complaint goes unanswered for weeks.Realize that it's a long-term commitment. Don't expect a quick ROI from your social media efforts. It takes six months minimum to build relationships with people on social media sites ""and that's if you are hardcore,"" Miller-Merrell says. Be patient, stick with it and be prepared to make a few mistakes as you poke around these sites.What you do now will put you miles ahead of your main competitors in finding the right hires when the economy picks up. ""If you don't have good people, you don't have a good product,"" Jordan says. These days, you can't have a good recruiting strategy without a good grasp of social media, either.Chris PenttilaChris Penttila is a Washington, DC-based freelance journalist who covers workplace issues on her blog, Workplacediva.blogspot.com.Read more",Growth Strategies,2009-07-01 00:00:00
/article/202406,Find Your Purpose,Roy Spence explains why entrepreneurs are the key to our economic future.,"Roy Spence had two choices when he launched his advertising agency many years ago: He could build something he thought would make him a lot of money, or he could build something that would enrich his life. He chose the latter--eventually, economic success followed.
""Every time I'm around someone who's in the business of improving people's lives verses making money, I'm enriched and I say 'I want to be more like them,'"" Spence says.
When times are good, Spence says, people can make money with average products. But under trying economic conditions, when wallets are shut, entrepreneurs must show that their businesses have value. ""Today, if you can't prove to your customers that your product or service improves their life, they don't have time for you,"" Spence says.
In Spence's recently released book, It's Not What You Sell, It's What You Stand For, he guides leaders through their own journies of understanding how their companies make a difference and how to harness that purpose for greater success.
Spence recently spoke with Entrepreneur.com about his new book, how he found his own purpose and why entrepreneurs are the lifeline of our economy.How did you find your purpose?The key on my road to purpose: Realizing that people who are in business to make a positive difference in the world are the people I want to be around. At some point when you start a business, you have this entrepreneurial spirit of creating something that was not there before.
I have found if your business purpose goes beyond just making money, you will actually make more money--not all the time, not everyday, but at least you're in the business of making a difference so you have a purpose.
My purpose in life is to inspire and help people find their purpose--that's what I do.In this economy, why is it important for entrepreneurs to find their purpose?I think it's more important than ever before to know your purpose and to be able to articulate it, put it in writing and then live it. Some people say, ""I don't have time for purpose now, I need to go make a sale."" Let me tell you something, you can be out there trying to make a sale, but unless your customer believes you are in the business to help them, if your products and services are just commodities, you're not going to make it, because people aren't going to spend money right now on things that aren't going to make a difference.
If you're not necessary in people's life, they're not going to care--nice is gone. Purpose is necessary.How should entrepreneurs go about finding their purpose?A friend of mine said recently, ""Once you've realized that you've dug yourself in a hole, the first thing you have to do is stop digging."" Take a deep breath and say, ""OK, I can't dig myself out of this."" I've been lost so many times, I get off the road of purpose and I try to be something I'm not. I gasp for air.
In Jim Collins' book Good to Great he mentions three questions that you need to ask yourself:What am I most passionate about?What can I be the best in the world at?Now, how can I make money? As T.S. Elliot said, ""Arrive where we started and know the place for the first time."" Why did you build this business? Think about the difference you were trying to make.In your book you discuss ""Stewards of Purpose."" What does this mean?
If you're a purpose-based leader, you're the steward of the company's purpose. For example, Southwest Airlines was founded on the premise that they were going to ""serve the underserved."" That's not some sort of social movement--it was simply recognizing that only 15 percent of the population had ever flown. So, Herb Kelleher (co-founder, Southwest Airlines) was an entrepreneur in 1971 who said to me, ""I think I'll niche myself at 85 percent of the business.""
Entrepreneurs do this instinctively--if you build a business, you don't go out and serve the people who have already been served, you find the underserved market or a market that needs you.
As a steward of purpose you have to intimately know your company's purpose so you can champion it and not violate it. I've seen many companies that start out with great purpose, and then they get a new leader who says, ""I think I'll just tweak this purpose thing."" Don't tweak it. When you tweak it, you destroy it.
Think of your business as your land or your family--always protect it at all costs.Excitement often gets lost in the daily grind. How can entrepreneurs ignite that passion again?
There are a couple great ways to ignite the passion back into your business. Herb Kelleher of Southwest once said to me, ""Roy, I want you to remember one thing: Take the competition seriously, but not yourself.""
When you think, ""Woe is me and woe is everything I do""--get the hell over it, take some yeast and lighten up. It's only business. Business is a game of life--it's tough, it's up, it's down. When things go wrong, you've got to understand that this is not the end of the world. It might be the end of a cycle, you might lose a little money, you might have to lay some people off, but this is the time to take a deep breath and reignite your passion.
Life is here to be enjoyed. We start believing that making money is why you make a difference. Go back to making a difference and you'll be more thrilled than you've ever been.Why did you start your advertising agency Idea City?
We started the business at the University of Texas a long time ago--we had three goals:Stay togetherStay in Austin, TexasMake a difference.Now, that doesn't give my adverting clients much validation of our talent. The thing is, when we built Idea City, we decided that we were going to make a difference. In the process of this journey, we've done whatever it takes to build our clients' businesses so they can fulfill their purpose--we're being the best in the world at purpose-based branding.
When you enter Idea City, it's like a Willy Wonka Factory for ideas--it's eclectic, it's come-as-you-are, it's the idea that nobody's too good and everyone's good enough. We're in the business of creating things that weren't there before. Idea City charges you when you walk in--it's full of young ideas and young people. At the end of the day, when we're at our best, we help people fulfill their purpose--and we get paid for it. We get paid for making a difference. When we're fulfilling our purpose, money comes and so does self-gratification. Going forward, what role do you think entrepreneurs will play in the rebuilding of our economy?For entrepreneurs right now, there is light at the end of the tunnel--it's not a train. I believe that when the dust settles on this economic Armageddon, there's going to be a revolution of entrepreneurs building organizations based on purpose.
Millennials are going to lead the way and say, ""I no longer want a job, but there is work to do."" I think it's going to be the greatest renaissance--if the federal government doesn't spend all the money fertilizing dead trees. At some point entrepreneurs, young and old, will be in full bloom when spring arrives.
But, it will be different because there will be companies and leaders who are actually in the business of making a difference--that's the renaissance. It will be the new age of entrepreneurship based on purpose.Kara Ohngren PriorKara Ohngren is a freelance writer and part-time editor at YoungEntrepreneur.

/answer/221939,How do I calculate a pay increase for an exceptional employee?,,"																																	Not knowing more about your business or situation, this is a tad tricky.  That is, calculating appropriate pay increases for a large organization is done using standard compensation tools such as job descriptions, salary grades, merit matrices and so forth. From your question, I am having to assume that you have none of this structure at your disposal.
If your business is small, you are essentially determining the value of the employee to your organization. One way to do this is to do some research. 
How much would it cost for you to replace this individual, taking into consideration all that s/he does for your enterprise? You can get a feel for this by visiting websites such as www.Salary.com, www.payscale.com, www.Salary.search.com, www.Paycheckcity.com and inputting the necessary information to see what the various ranges are for the kind of job the person is assigned. These sites also offer information on average salary increases and so forth. You need to remember that often the data for these sites is provided by people in the jobs versus by compensation managers, so its accuracy may not be 100 percent. But it will give you an idea of the value of the job on the market in which you do business.
Salary is satisfies versus motivates, so keep that in mind. You want to be sure to give enough of an increase to reward the person sufficiently and let him/her know that s/he is valued in proportion to his/her contribution to the success of the company.

/answer/221938,Can we offer paid insurance benefits to only exempt salaried employees?,,"																																	Most insurance carriers do not want to only offer health insurance, for example, to the higher-level employees for some good business reasons.  
For one thing, it spreads the risk across fewer people. So, your rates may be very high, if you can find a carrier interested in your business.  You are not legally prohibited from doing this if you can find a carrier interested in your business.
In my opinion, it would be better to offer health insurance, for example, to all employees and pay a set amount toward the cost (say 50 percent of the cost of single coverage). Then, pay exempt employees the amount you wish to in order to offset the remaining cost for their coverage.
You can offer benefits such as life insurance, disability insurance, etc. to only a portion of your workforce.But, again, the rates will be affected by the limited number of individuals being insured.

/article/202352,5 Employee Motivation Myths Debunked,Recognition--not money--is the real motivator in a down economy.,"Business owners need to ensure that their employees are productive and eager to do the best job possible--this is especially true during today's challenging economic times. Yet every industry and every organization has people who simply do not produce work in the quality that they are capable of providing. That can create costly problems for a manager.
Leaders often miss the mark when trying to ramp up employee productivity. Let's debunk some motivational myths. Money motivates. Of course, if you pay some enough money, they will do almost any job. And when you give bonuses to reward past behavior, the recipients are usually very happy (unless they were expecting a larger bonus). The staff does a better job following the glow that accompanies added money.
However, studies find this happiness is short-lived. Within six months, individuals have difficulty recalling that bonus and it does not seem to have the same impact it did within the first few weeks or months of receiving it. That's because money, in and of itself, will not continuously motivate individuals.
It's the recognition and status that are the true motivators for the increased output. Take for example, the high tech salesperson who sold more product than anyone else in the department. The boss rewards that employee with a bonus. Everyone knows who the bonus recipient is, and she is proud of her accomplishments--the high earner gains recognition from colleagues and clients. Recognition and status are two key sources of motivation. So while money can serve to motivate, its effects are often short term at best.
What should you do? Set up situations that allow the employee to feel a sense of accomplishment. Employees respond most to opportunities for achievement, recognition, growth, job enrichment and job enlargement. Just keep them happy. Employers often go to great lengths to keep their employees happy--some offer game rooms; others have phones with free long-distance access. The theory here is that if we can keep the employees happy during their break time, it will translate into increased motivation and productivity. Unfortunately, this is not very effective.
Employees actually enjoy their break times, look forward to them, and may even linger during them. But the satisfaction found during the break times does not necessarily translate into better or higher quality job performance. Ignore Conflict. Few people, especially in the professional world, enjoy conflict. Most bosses and employees alike would rather ""let something go"" or ""sweep it under the rug"" than make an issue out of it. Too many managers are concerned about being liked that they don't fulfill their responsibilities to catch problems quickly. Not addressing an employee's problematic behavior doesn't help any one. Some people just aren't motivated. This is a very common misconception. Everyone is motivated--but for different reasons. Walking through the offices, the manager may see someone playing computer games or sending personal email, this could be seen as the individual is not motivated because he's not attending to the job tasks. But that may not be entirely correct. At that moment, the ""aimless"" employee is motivated, perhaps even highly motivated. But that motivation is not work directed, nor is it productive for the company.
The challenge here is for the leader to discover what actually motivates that employee and match up those elements with the worker's job description. (This point also assumes that the employee is worth keeping.) Smart employees don't need to be motivated. Being ""smart"" carries an important cachet in American society. Everyone wants to have smart people working for them because these people are quick to learn, adapt and produce. Employers may erroneously believe that they don't need to spend much time or attention on these staffers.
Unfortunately, intelligence and self-motivation do not necessarily go hand-in-hand. There are plenty of smart employees who haven't been able to find out just what motivates them personally; they tend to get bored or frustrated easily. The result is a lack of interest and a lack of productivity.
So what does an employer do? A smart employer creates the atmosphere that allows and encourages the employee to be motivated. That employer also gets to know what his staff is interested in doing to advance company goals and what parts of the job description are interesting or exciting verses boring. 10 Quick Ways to Motivate Praise the employee for a job well done--or even partially well done.If an employee is bored, involve that individual in a discussion about ways to create a more satisfying career path, including promotions based on concrete outcomes.State your clear expectations for task accomplishment.Ensure that the job description involves a variety of tasks.Ensure that the employee sees that what she's doing impacts the whole process or task that others will also be part of.Make sure that the employee feels that what he/she is doing is meaningful.Provide feedback along the way, pointing out both positive and negative aspects.Allow for an appropriate amount of autonomy for the employee based on previous and anticipated accomplishment.Increase the depth and breadth of what the employee is currently doing.Provide the employee with adequate opportunity to succeed.Dr. David G.

/answer/221937,Should I individually meet with employees who are having issues?,,"																																	I believe that the best practice is to first meet separately with each employee.  
As part of those separate meetings you should ask each employee if he or she is willing to have a joint meeting with the goal of finding solutions that work for everyone.  
Avoid a fact finding mission with the goal of placing blame. You do NOT need to ""get to the root of the problem."" Instead simply acknowledge that there are issues that need to be resolved and then focus on solutions.

/article/202070,What to Know Before Hiring a Freelancer,Use these 6 tips to get the most from temporary talent.,"						This story appears in the June 2009 issue of Startups. Subscribe   Want to build a successful company--and pull it off without any employees? Brad Chase, 28, is living proof that it can be done. He started Progressivehealth.com, a Boise, Idaho-based retailer of health supplements, in 2003; he projects year-end sales to reach $800,000 to $900,000; and he has almost solely relied on the skills of freelancers. It may sound impossible, but with abundant layoffs, shrinking retirement funds and a growing number of resources that connect businesses with freelancers, accessing a qualified work force is easier than ever.In search of freelancers?

According to Kelly Services Inc., a temporary-services staffing firm, about a quarter (26 percent) of the U.S. working population is now working as free agents, up from 19 percent in 2006. But before you tap in to this growing talent pool, consider these tips from Chase and Leslie Stoner, director of product development at Kelly Services.Create a list of your needs, your goals, the skill set required, the education and experience you desire, and whether you want to pay the individual by the hour or by the deliverable.Determine a fair rate of pay by reviewing job boards along with the rates at which people are accepting projects.Know the difference between an independent contractor and an employee. ""Just because someone says, 'I'm an independent contractor,' don't say, 'Great. Sign the contract, and we're good to go,' because you're putting your organization at unnecessary risk,"" Stoner warns. For more information on the differences between a contractor and an employee, visit the IRS website and consult an attorney.If you prefer to find freelancers on your own rather than through a temporary-staffing firm, pay careful attention to reviews left by others, advises Chase, who believes one bad review is enough cause for concern.Don't always use the same talent. ""If you have a new job and you liked an old provider, post the job and invite them to it,"" Chase says. ""This keeps their price competitive, because others are bidding on the job.""Be cautious about paying freelancers directly through PayPal. In some cases, the freelancer is no longer accountable, Chase cautions, because this eliminates the possibility of writing a review.",Growth Strategies,2009-06-04 00:00:00
/answer/221927,Is it required for companies of a certain size to have an HR person?,,"																																	No, there are no requirements for any company to have a qualified human resource professional on staff or even to use the expertise of an outside employment expert such as me.  
Many companies assign human resource responsibilities to controllers or CFOs. Some of these professionals take the responsibilities very seriously and do their utmost to become experts to the degree that they can while juggling all of their financial/accounting work. 
Others do not bother and that is unfortunate, as much damage can be done. Many businesses choose to think that what they don't know can't hurt them regarding employment laws and/or treatment of employees to maximize productivity and, thus, their return on the investment that they make in their workers.

/answer/221925,How do I avoid laying off any more of my employees?,,"																																	This is a tough situation, as it appears that you are trying to do a good thing by getting through the downturn and keeping everyone employed to the degree you can. 
Not knowing in what state you do business, I cannot say unequivocally that the following applies; but in most states, unless the individual is fired ""for cause"" s/he collects the same unemployment benefits as if s/he were laid off work; and your unemployment taxes will be affected the same as if you laid him off work. (""For cause"" normally means egregious behavior such as stealing, threatening someone, etc., versus just poor performance).  
So, whether you lay off more employees or fire them, they would be able to collect unemployment and for a good long time with the prevailing laws. 
I would not be inclined to cooperate with his request, if I were you.  I would tell him that I am doing the best to do the right thing by keeping people employed during the economic downturn and that you appreciate everyone understanding that fact and doing their best work until times get better for all. 
Document his request to be laid off work (date, time, when, where, how it occurred) and your response--via email or otherwise in writing is best. 
Then, keep track of his attendance and job performance. If he begins performing very poorly or not showing up for work or completing his shifts at work, you should document properly and, if it continues, give him an unpaid suspension documenting that you are giving him this time to draw his own conclusion about whether he still wants a job or not. 
When he returns from the suspension, have him document his decision in this regard. You may have to do this more than once, but it lays the proper groundwork for claiming ""self-termination"" (or resignation) on his part which would make a decent case for him not to be classified as having been fired and immediately eligible for unemployment benefits.

/article/201786,5 Ways to Ease the Pain of Layoffs,Handle cuts gracefully and your remaining team will respect you.,"In January, David Johnson realized that all of his budget cuts weren't going to be enough to keep his business profitable. As CEO, he had no choice but to lay off a third of his workforce at Summitville Tiles, an Ohio-based tile factory that Johnson's family has owned for nearly a century. To make the announcement, he gathered all of his employees on the factory floor and blasted the news through a bullhorn.While this may sound more like a cattle call than a human resources success, at the time, Johnson thought the companywide meeting was the best way to deliver the news.""The key was for me to have direct eye contact with the entire workforce and to demonstrate that we had a plan of action that, while painful, was important to the longer-term viability of the company,"" he says.No entrepreneur wants to lay off staff, but sometimes it's the only answer--especially during a recession. According to estimates by payroll processor ADP, small businesses employing less than 50 people have collectively shed 1.4 million jobs in the past six months. When a layoff is the only option, the employees who leave--and the ones who are left--will feel much better if the boss handles the situation respectfully and humanely.""Nothing can poison employees' morale faster than watching their former colleagues be shown the door abruptly and disrespectfully,"" says Michael J. Canavan, a labor and employment attorney in the law firm of Pepper Hamilton LLP. ""In a small company, layoffs can be a much more personal thing. There's often not a corporate HR department to handle it. Generally, the people doing the layoffs work with those who are being laid off.""The road of layoff history is littered with bad examples. Some of the worst stories, Canavan says, are from employees who were notified of their job loss via e-mail or text message. Dealing with a layoff is difficult for both employer and employee, but it doesn't have to be unbearable. You can soften the blow with some of the following strategies.1. Go one-on-one
Canavan recommends notifying affected workers of the decision in private before the word is out. ""They should be told in a respectful manner, behind closed doors,"" he says. ""Allow them to take the news and figure out what they're going to do with it before they have to face their co-workers.""After the companywide announcement at Summitville Tiles, the plant manager and human resources director held individual meetings with each affected employee to discuss unemployment benefits and COBRA health insurance. ""We did our best to personalize something that would otherwise have been impersonal and even traumatic,"" Johnson says.2. Communicate openly
Rather than simply instructing folks to pack their things and leave, respectful employers explain the reasons behind the layoffs. At Shuqualak Lumber in Shuqualak, Miss., owner Charlie Thomas called a meeting of all employees and prepared a speech so he could remember exactly what he wanted to say. But as he began telling employees that a layoff was unavoidable due to the housing crisis, Thomas choked up and couldn't get the words out. ""I felt so guilty for having to lay them off; I felt like I had personally failed them,"" he says.After retreating to his office to regain composure, Thomas returned to finish his announcement. Sharing his decision process--and his emotions--with workers seemed to make the layoff a little more bearable. ""Employees knew that I had done everything in my power to keep us from getting to the point of laying employees off,"" he says.3. Allow for goodbyes
Standard layoff policy seems to require terminated workers to leave the building immediately, but Canavan says that's often not necessary. ""In most cases, we recommend that folks be permitted a chance to say goodbye to coworkers,"" he says.Keep in mind that terminated workers are recent employees, not second-class citizens. When possible, it's even better to allow workers to transfer their responsibilities in an orderly way, perhaps training others who will take over their former jobs.4. Ease the transition
Small businesses may not have access to job placement services available through some larger companies, but they can still ease workers' transition to other employment. Shuqualak Lumber, for instance, worked with Mississippi's Rapid Response team, which immediately provided resources to help laid off workers find jobs, register for unemployment benefits or return to school.By providing outplacement services, you're helping folks in your community and generating goodwill with the people being let go and those remaining, Canavan says. ""You're also lessening the likelihood that a terminated employee will have issues against you that they'll want to turn into litigation.""5. Remember remaining workers
With fewer employees, it's more important than ever to maintain productivity and keep your company going. That's why you can't neglect the workers who are left behind--often with high levels of anxiety about their own job security and new tasks they may be asked to undertake. After the layoff at Shuqualak Lumber, productivity quickly declined. ""We all worked harder than we had ever before, but we were using employees that had to be trained to do new jobs and it took some time for them to become familiar with their new responsibilities,"" Thomas says.Ongoing communication with remaining employees can tamp down anxiety and rebuild productivity. ""The only thing [you] can do to ease anxiety among a workforce that has experienced cutbacks is to keep everybody informed as to how the business is holding up,"" Johnson says. ""The more information you share with employees, the better understanding they will have of the situation, and the more supportive they will be.""Communicate clearly about job duties and expectations, especially if workers will be asked to take on tasks previously handled by others. Also, talk about each employee's work and what led to decisions about who to keep and who to let go. These discussions help people understand what they can do to keep their jobs, Canavan says. And if there's a chance there will be future layoffs, it's fair to let employees know you will continually evaluate the situation. ""That's just treating employees as an important part of the business and as responsible individuals who can help move the company forward,"" Canavan says.Nancy Mann Jackson is a freelance writer who writes frequently about small business issues.

/article/201626,Salary Envy,"Even in a tight job market of layoffs, pay cuts and raise freezes, employees still seek fair compensation.","						This story appears in the June 2009 issue of Entrepreneur. Subscribe  																							I make enough money to live a relatively comfortable life. I don't need the finer things to make me happy. So why is it that I often find myself obsessing over my salary? Why am I dying to know how much money my co-workers make? I'd like to think it has less to do with my greediness and more to do with my sense of fairness.
At each job I've quit, my salary has left me feeling cheated to some extent. In my first job out of college, I made a little more than $30,000 and was thrilled about my steady income. I loved my job: the people, the laid-back atmosphere, the work I was doing. However, my excitement quickly began to fade after checking a salary comparison website. I realized that workers in my position and location were making twice as much as I was. And apparently I wasn't the only one being underpaid, as other disgruntled employees ""joked"" about how little our company paid. Soon, a couple of co-workers left the company and reported back that they were earning tens of thousands of dollars more to do the same work. I knew then that as comfortable as I was at that job, I really was getting played for a fool.
So I was determined to get a good salary bump with my next job. After the recruiter assured me that raises were common and the stock options were going to be worth a lot, I accepted an offer that was only slightly higher than my previous salary. Still, I couldn't help but feel bitter from Day One. It only got worse as rumors spread that newer hires were getting paid a lot more than the veterans. I reached my breaking point when I learned that a co-worker I trained and supervised (and was honestly not a great employee) was making about $20,000 more than me.
At my current job, I finally get paid what I feel is fair compensation. Others get paid more than I do, but it doesn't bother me because they actually deserve it. Even in this tight job market of layoffs, pay cuts and raise freezes, employees still seek fairness. Employers should not give huge salaries to some and low salaries to others without justification. With all the available information out there--whether it's office rumors, friends in the industry or websites disclosing salary information--if employees are grossly underpaid, they'll find out. And if they feel slighted, it won't be long before they look somewhere else for some fairness.

/article/201630,Knowledge is Power,"Ensure that important company clients, projects and processes aren't lost when an employee walks out the door.","						This story appears in the June 2009 issue of Entrepreneur. Subscribe  																							Four years ago, Cliff Smeed and Paul West learned all about the importance of capturing company history before it walks out the door. The business they worked for had fired a remote worker whose company laptop was so damaged nothing could be retrieved from the hard drive. The details of an important project were lost. ""Getting a hold of the person wasn't an option,"" Smeed says. ""Corporate just had to stitch the project back together again.""
Today, Smeed, 46, and West, 33, are the co-founders of SharePoint360, a 3-year-old San Diego company that hosts Microsoft's SharePoint collaboration software for various Fortune 500 companies, government agencies and small enterprises. Perhaps not surprisingly, they've taken steps to ensure the same thing doesn't happen to their business.
You just don't know what you've got until it's gone, especially when you're dealing with an ex-employee who holds the keys to a client, project or process. It's hard to know the exact cost of lost employee knowledge, but experts put it in the millions. ""Some people call it the cost of stupidity,"" says Tom Davenport, a knowledge management expert and the co-author of Working Knowledge: How Organizations Manage What They Know. Unfortunately, companies that haven't picked employees' brains may find it's too late to start. ""If you're on the verge of layoffs,"" Davenport says, ""you've blown it.""
David DeLong, author of Lost Knowledge: Confronting the Threat of an Aging Workforce, sees a paradox: As the need for knowledge retention grows in this recession, the resources put into it are likely to be cut back. ""The risks of knowledge loss [are being] hidden by the sudden preoccupation with economic survival,"" he says. A February business survey by the Institute for Corporate Productivity found that only 20 percent of the companies surveyed thought they were retaining knowledge well.
West and Smeed haven't forgotten just how much lost knowledge can hurt productivity. The 34 employees at SharePoint360 upload reports and messages to a centralized portal, and online collaboration has become a big part of the culture. Company history is at employees' fingertips. ""We don't push work around; we come to the work,"" West says. SharePoint360 projects sales of $5 million in 2009.
Portals and collaboration software aren't the answer for every company, of course. Weekly meetings and brown bag lunches are easy, low-tech ways for employees to share what they've learned. If you want employees to document what they're doing, you'll have more success if the documentation is central to the work instead of an afterthought that feels like a waste of time. For example, you might have your salespeople write short, periodic status reports for clients that are also filed away for reference by future employees.
As the economy picks up, many companies will start paying for what they've lost. ""Leaders are going to suddenly realize that they've let go [of] people and knowledge that's critical to their future,"" DeLong says.

/answer/221913,Should complaints about an employee be discussed before it goes into the employee's file?,,"																																	I cannot offer legal advice, however, I can address the question from the perspective of conflict analysis and conflict management.  
I am curious as to what your HR manager has to say about the situation.  What was his/her reasoning for keeping this complaint under wraps? Is it possible that the complaining party requested that the complaint not be disclosed? I can see how HR could be caught in a bind between the interests of the two employees.
From my perspective, openness and honesty are best when dealing with conflict in the workplace. It is best to bring conflicts safely into the open and seek resolution. Since this employee was not aware of the complaint, he had no way of knowing that his behavior was offensive. Without this knowledge he was set up for a repeat performance.  
It would have been better to address the complaint, even if the complaining employee was not involved in the discussion, in order to avoid future issues. 
Without that kind of dialogue your employee may perceive that HR was documenting with the intention of building a ""case"" against him.  And, this perception (along with the feeling of being betrayed and persecuted) can push an employees to the extreme -- workplace violence.

/answer/221906,Can I ask a new employee's previous employer the reason of separation?,,"																																	Oh, yes, you may certainly ask -- but don t expect an answer. I estimate that 95 percent of all employers will only provide you with the dates of employment and title of past employees; and then they will confirm a salary level if authorized in writing by the employee to do that.
Savvy employers are aware that employees who lost out on job opportunities when a reference check revealed their poor performance or bad behavior, etc. will sue the past employer if they can for ruining their chances of gainful new employment.  It does not matter if what the past employer said is true or not, as often ""truth"" can be conveyed in a variety of ways and -- is like beauty -- somewhat in the eyes of the beholder.
About the only way to obtain an honest assessment about a potential employee from a past employer is to know someone well enough that works at that company who is willing to talk with you on an assured confidential basis because they trust you.

/article/201510,How to Find the 'Hidden Paycheck',Fringe benefit statements highlight employees' true compensation.,"Five years ago, SV Life Sciences was in growth mode, going from just a few U.S. employees to its current staff of 24. The Boston-based venture capital advisor and manager company was looking for the right hiring tool, something to help with recruiting and retention, something that would remind current employees how good their benefits were and show recruits the true value of working for the company. That's when management discovered fringe benefit statements, according to CFO and partner Denise Marks.Whether Marks knew it at the time, she was uncovering one of the most important weapons in the small-business arsenal: the hidden paycheck. It's the combination of salary and every other benefit offered--costs that run the gamut from health insurance, vacation and Social Security to disability insurance, 401(k) matching contributions and free turkeys at Thanksgiving. It all adds up. Employers can tell their workers, ""We spend an additional 25 percent to 40 percent beyond what you see in your paycheck."" But until those benefits and dollar amounts are presented in an organized, understandable fashion, the impact is lost.""Benefit statements show an employee's true compensation,"" says Romy Wightman, owner and president of Scottsdale, Ariz.-based RW Benefit Communications, a provider of benefit statements to employers of all sizes for more than 10 years. ""Benefits are a really large part of compensation. A benefit statement can show a worker his true compensation may be $60,000, not $40,000.""Benefit statements can be one-page or multipage documents packaged much like an annual report; they can even be presented online. The objective is to communicate value to workers. And there may be no better time than now to show your employees the value of their benefits. The latest MetLife Study of Employee Benefit Trends shows that, after salary and wages, employee loyalty hinges on health benefits, retirement benefits and all other insurance benefits.A good benefit statement will look like a company-created marketing brochure, because, Wightman says, you should use it to ""advertise to employees a benefit package that you maybe spend $1 million on."" Obviously that number will change based on a company's size, but on a percentage-basis the impact is the same. While huge corporations may be able to offer glossy, multipage documents with nice photographs and personalized letters from the CEO, small companies can absolutely benefit from the smaller, simpler statements that providers have created for just that segment of employers.Included on any persuasive statement will be the obvious candidates: health insurance, dental, vision, short- and long-term disability, life insurance, federally-mandated withholdings and retirement contributions. However, some employers forget to include other items as benefits.Richard Rosenberg, principal owner of New York City-based Atlantic Benefits, says he goes through an inventory of more than 150 benefits with his employer clients, bringing to the fore many employer-provided benefits that get lost to oversight. The list includes items like parking passes, vacation days, adoption services, concierge services, after-school care and pet insurance.""We even include things we may not be able to put a price tag on,"" Rosenberg adds, because they may have a perceived value to the employee, which only makes the benefit package look stronger, especially in a small-business environment.Wightman points to a few other costs that get missed: flu shots, automobile allowance, tuition reimbursement and company parties. ""We like to take into account all of these things."" She adds that rounding up all of these costs can be a burden, which is why she encourages small-business owners to find every benefit cost they can easily get their hands on. A good benefits broker should be able to help in this situation, too, and many of them provide a benefit statement as part of their comprehensive service. They often rely, however, on companies like RW Benefit Communications and Atlantic Benefits for the software and expertise.Is it Worth it?Granted providing these statements seems like a good idea on a feel-good level: Employees get to see the value of their benefits and maybe see their employer in a new light. But does that measure up to any real value for the business, especially at a time when every expense is scrutinized? Well, if you're looking for an ROI that can be measured financially, you may be disappointed. Though if you manage to hang on to a couple of employees and not have to hire and train new ones, that must be worth something, especially if the training staff is you, the owner. Your time is better spent running the business.""Employers shouldn't expect a line of people at the HR office raving about them,"" Wightman says. ""Most satisfied employees won't say anything. It's when you stop doing statements that people speak up.""The real value here is a more qualitative measure. ""People love them,"" Marks says of the employees at SV Life Sciences, which has $1.6 billion in assets under management. ""We started using them five years ago. Now, if they're not out [by the end of March] people start asking for them.""Company management was hoping to get employees to recognize that benefits are an important part of their overall package, especially for the rank-and-file. She says the ROI has exceeded expectations--if for no other reason than there has never been any negative feedback.""If people said, 'Oh, I just throw mine away,' then we'd probably not use them,"" Marks says. ""I know that people read them, use them and rely on them.""She adds that her vendor makes it easy; minimizing the time it takes for SV Life Science's staff to gather the necessary data. And that is a positive ROI before the statements are even created, especially for a small company with little or no HR staff.Benefit statement providers like Wightman and Rosenberg point to the statements' usefulness in recruiting and retention, and Marks' experience echoes that. She has anonymous statements created for use during the interview process, so qualified candidates get a glimpse of the overall compensation they can expect at the company. Marks also uses the statements with recruiters.""We give them a statement that has the standard benefits and a made-up salary for someone in an administrative support role,"" she says. ""Everyone is bowled over by them.""Wightman points to another use for the statements, one that unfortunately, many employers have to consider these days. She worked with a group that had just experienced a large layoff. The employer wanted to avert a panic and didn't want the remaining employees looking elsewhere out of fear. So they put together a benefit statement for the remaining employees that showed how strong the benefits package was and exhibited the company's commitment to keeping the package strong. It worked.Expose the hidden paycheck and don't lose a valuable employee who, Rosenberg says, may see $5,000 more in salary at another place but lose $8,000 in benefits.Mike WerlingMike Werling, the managing editor of Sea Magazine, has written for Entrepreneur.com, Senior Market Advisor, Boomer Market Advisor and Broadmoor magazines.Read more",Growth Strategies,2009-05-06 00:00:00
/answer/221890,If you lay-off someone who is on disability do you have to lay-off everyone on disability?,,"																																	Normally, when a company reduces its workforce, job elimination decisions are based on what work (the nature of the work) and how much work (the amount of work) that will be needed in order to optimize the chances of the company surviving the economic downturn.  
What this means is that the management looks at the work that will need to be done in order to run the company efficiently and effectively. Then, they eliminate jobs by redistributing tasks/combining jobs or determining that certain work is ""nice to have"" versus ""necessary"" to the company operations. So, the management cuts jobs--not the people in the jobs--although the effect to individuals feels like the latter, versus the former.  Your job must have been one that the company management felt they could accomplish through other means.   
The common denominator in the jobs eliminated should be that the work can be accomplished through redistribution or that the work need not be done going forward, not the ability or disability of people in the job(s).

Translation: one that earns points toward airlines and hotels. Says Schukraft, ""You can save big in places like Paris, where hotels can cost 300 euros or more a night.""Sleep when you can. Traveling internationally--and all the time--can take its toll on your sleep schedule. So Schukraft advises using an eye mask, flying in first class with fully reclining seats (if it's in your budget) and not staying awake for the complimentary meal. --L.H.  Best Hotel Chain ValueHyatt Place
Here's a great example of a new hotel concept (launched in 2006) that actually lives up to its hype. The chain was named ""Top Mid-Scale Full Service Brand"" in the J.D. Power and Associates ""2008 North America Hotel Guest Satisfaction Index""--a remarkably fast ascent to the top of the list. So what's to like? Attractive d cor, down-to-earth pricing and thoughtful amenities: a 42-inch flat panel TV; comfortable, functional work areas; cushy sleeper sofas and insanely comfortable beds. There's even free Starbucks coffee in the lobby.Best Airline ValueVirgin America
The 21-month-old Virgin America only has a handful of routes so far, mostly linking Boston, New York City and Washington, DC, to the West Coast. But already there's a lot to like. Besides low fares, there's high comfort on brand-new Airbus A320s: Every seat has a power outlet, and the interactive in-flight entertainment system lets you watch films, listen to thousands of MP3s and watch TV on demand. You can even use the system to order food and drinks, which you can charge to a credit card. (It's a cash-free cabin.) The carrier now offers Gogo in-flight internet service, too.Best Frequent Flier ProgramAlaska Airlines' Mileage Plan
It's always heartening when an airline that rates high in customer satisfaction also has a terrific frequency program. That's the case with Alaska Airlines, which scores well in consumer surveys. Plus, its Mileage Plan won a Freddie Award for ""Program of the Year"" for the fourth time. (It also won first place in the ""Best Website"" and ""Best Elite-Level Program"" categories for 2007.) We like the program's flexibility: Members can give their points to friends or family, and companies can purchase miles to give to employees as an incentive reward. We also like that there are more than a dozen airlines to choose from for mileage earning and award travel.Best Rental Car ValueZipcar
Zipcar is growing in popularity as a cost-effective, convenient alternative to traditional car rental companies that have yet to match the nifty Zipcard, which acts not only as a key to the car but also as a way to charge gasoline purchases directly to Zipcar. So far, there are locations in 52 cities across North America and the United Kingdom, and a fleet of 5,500 cars including BMWs, Volvos, Mini Coopers, Priuses, pickups and various SUVs. There are no obnoxious hidden fees, and frequent individual and corporate users get discounts on hourly and daily weekday rates, which start as low as $6 per hour and $50 per day. Rates include fuel, parking, insurance and maintenance.Best Site for Travel DealsAirfare Watchdog
Because many business travelers fly on short notice, using a travel website that features time-sensitive deals makes plenty of sense. Unlike its rivals, Airfare Watchdog relies on real people--not computers--to identify deals, which are often unadvertised or unannounced. The team researches the fares before posting them, ensuring seats are available at the sale price. They can even search for fares on Southwest Airlines and JetBlue, which don't load their fares on any online reservations system except their own.

/article/201152,Hiring Temporary Talent,Temporary employment is expanding beyond the typical clerical assignment.\r\n,"						This story appears in the May 2009 issue of Entrepreneur. Subscribe  Jack Longinotti has been a full-time CFO at three companies. But he also moonlights as a ""temporary"" CFO. These gigs have been full- and part-time, and have ranged from three months to two years.
""I tend to work at companies that are either very fast-growing and in their formative stages or have a special circumstance that needs expertise,"" Longinotti says. ""The engagement can be very intense.""
When it comes to temporary employment, most of us envision the clerical worker who answers phones, not the marketing director who parachutes in for six weeks to help launch a new product. It's hard to know how many interim executives are among the approximately 2 million Americans currently temping or employed on staff at temporary agencies. ""We've never tracked that [statistic],"" says Gary Steinberg, press officer for the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But they're out there, and a bad economy could encourage more top-level people to temp their talents.
Crist Kolder Associates, a firm that places permanent CFOs, receives 50 unsolicited resumes daily from outplacement service firms and job hunters. ""There is just so much churn out there right now, it's amazing,"" says Scott Simmons, a partner at Crist Kolder.
Year-over-year business is up more than 47 percent at Business Talent Group, a firm that places interim CEOs, CFOs, marketing directors and other C-level talent. The 1,500 people on BTG's roster have helped clients launch products, devise new pricing strategies and enter new markets. Even in a recession, ""companies still have businesses to run,"" says BTG co-founder Jody Miller. ""[We] offer the ability to have really targeted expertise when you need it. It's kind of a talent-on-demand notion.""
Last summer, Craig Snyder was CEO of 18-employee Houston internet media company Internet Reit, which had let go its CFO and urgently needed someone with high-tech and CFO experience to help the company through an audit and appraisal process. Internet Reit approached BTG, and a week later, Longinotti was on board. He stayed through December. The cost was ""very similar to what we'd pay a full-time person,"" says Snyder, 45. ""And we were able to wind down the contract pretty effectively without having to deal with severance.""
Be prepared to discuss the scope of the role, payment terms and confidentiality agreements. Interim executives want to make an impact, so share your company's shortcomings and inner workings. ""You have to allow interim executives to become insiders,"" says Bob Stegmann, a managing partner for Tatum LLC, which sends its nearly 1,000 C-level specialists on interim assignments.
Longinotti expects to do more interim CFO work for both troubled and growing companies this year: ""There are lots of opportunities.""Chris Penttila is a freelance journalist whose work has also appeared in The Costco Connection, Oregon Business magazine, QSR Magazine, TheStreet.com and other publications.

/article/201180,Go Virtual With Your Work Force,Outsourcing and virtual hiring can give you lower costs and enables you to work with talented employees all over the world.,"						This story appears in the May 2009 issue of Entrepreneur. Subscribe  College entrepreneurs are often judged by their revenue, profits and work force headcounts. But while financial metrics are a logical benchmark for success, employment numbers are not. Outsourcing and virtual hiring can give you lower costs and the ability to work with talented employees around the world.When Jordan Goldman launched Unigo last September to provide student-generated college reviews, he needed a way to quickly engage students from hundreds of schools. Instead of hiring employees and deploying them to campuses nationwide, he built a team of virtual interns--300 of them, to be exact.""It would have taken us many years and millions of dollars to do what we did in three months, and on a tight budget,"" says Goldman, 26. ""The interns knew their school ecosystems much better than we ever could, and this helped us spread the word quickly and economically.""In less than three months, Unigo amassed more than 40,000 student reviews, and the site was off and running thanks to Goldman's army of virtual interns. But effectively harnessing the power of virtual employees takes careful planning and execution.""It can be hard when you have an external work force because you can't look these people in the eyes or take them out for drinks,"" Goldman says. ""To compensate, you have to implement a structured system with clear goals and objectives. It's important that your virtual employees feel they're part of something real.""Tim Ferriss, author of The 4-Hour Workweek and an avid proponent of virtual operations, has built a career around advising companies on the effective use of outsourcing to save money and stay focused on core competencies. ""The two most important things to a business are creating product and selling product,"" Ferriss says. ""If a repetitive task is not related to one of your core capabilities, you should look at using a service like Elance.com that, for a percentage of your hourly income, can do these tasks for you.""To further focus goals and eliminate clutter, Ferriss recommends that college startups hire a virtual assistant from a company such as AskSunday.com. ""If you hire a virtual assistant, it'll very clearly show you how undefined or ambiguous many of your objectives are, because you'll be forced to put down criteria, deadlines and milestones,"" he says.For both Goldman and Ferriss, running a successful virtual company--especially in college--revolves around allocating time and money to the most important tasks, and minimizing or outsourcing the rest. ""When in doubt,"" Ferriss says, ""focus on elimination.""Joel HollandJoel Holland, 25, is the founder and CEO of Footage Firm in Reston, Va. Read more",worth-knowing,2009-04-09 00:00:00
/article/201114,Why Employees Need a Break,"Checking personal e-mail, the latest news headlines or making personal phone calls does not a slacker make.\r\n","						This story appears in the May 2009 issue of Entrepreneur. Subscribe  Here's a news flash for all you employers (in case you didn't already know): We employees do not work a full eight hours a day. Between periods of doing our actual jobs, we're checking our personal e-mail, reading the latest news headlines, making personal phone calls, shopping online and even leaving the office to run errands. And no, that does not make us slackers.
Of course, there are those workers who seem to be all play and no work. But for the majority of workers who take short breaks from work throughout the day, it's not fair to be treated like criminals. I hate that guilty feeling I get every time I check my personal e-mail and my boss happens to walk by my desk. It's gotten to the point that every time I open a web browser window, I get paranoid that someone is looking over my shoulder. The bottom line should be that my work is complete by the end of the day.
Every company I've worked for has had a different approach for cracking down on employees. At one company, HR would periodically send out company-wide e-mails reminding us of the ""no internet for personal use"" policy. We'd be extra careful for about a week or two after the e-mail was sent, then eventually go back to web browsing as usual. At another company, we were told our internet usage was being tracked and reported to managers. This scared us a bit, but we never really heard of anyone getting reprimanded for it, so it didn't cross our minds too often.
I have a few friends whose internet access is partially blocked at work. That just seems way too Big Brother for my tastes. I would never accept a job if I knew that policy was in place. And with the popularity of smartphones, this restriction seems obsolete now.
Don't get me wrong: I understand why companies frown upon this behavior. Every minute spent doing personal business is a minute not working. However, I believe giving employees this freedom is actually a good thing as long as they don't abuse the privilege. A quick chat with a friend online or a short conversation with a significant other on the phone helps us feel as though we're not so separated from our loved ones. A scan of the news headlines makes us feel connected to the outside world. Doing some online browsing or shopping is a nice break from the stress of a busy workday. In essence, this all contributes to the feeling that we're not prisoners at work. As long as the job is getting done and the employee isn't spending too much time doing personal stuff on company time, a hands-off approach is best.If you're an employee or know an employee who wants to vent about or praise an employer anonymously, e-mail us at employeex@entrepreneur.com.",Growth Strategies,2009-04-08 00:00:00
/article/200934,Become Versed in Reading Faces ,"Facial expressions expert Paul Ekman, Ph.D., reveals how to read the posturing and poker faces commonly seen when doing business.","In business and in life, it doesn't matter what language you speak, where you live, what you do for a living--the facial expressions you show for anger, fear, sadness, disgust, surprise, contempt and happiness will be the same. You share these expressions with all human beings, and many of them with the great apes.
Each emotion has a family of related expressions. For example, the anger family differs in intensity from annoyance to rage, and also contains such variations as indignation, vengefulness and sulking. These members of the anger family of emotions are reflected in variations in the anger expressions, all revolving around one prototypical expression.
Most facial expressions of emotion are on the face for just a few seconds, long enough to recognize easily if you aren't distracted by your own thoughts, or figuring out what you're going to say next. We don't have to be taught how to recognize the seven universal emotions, but we do need to learn how to recognize the micro expressions.
When people try to conceal how they're feeling, the expression is reduced in time from a few seconds to a fraction of a second--one-twenty-fifth of a second--so brief you can miss it if you blink. Most people don't recognize the emotions shown in these micro expressions. But people can learn to see them. Learning to read facial expressions gives you an edge in business because it allows you to communicate more effectively with business partners.
The Micro Expression Training Tool (METT), developed by The Paul Ekman Group, teaches people in about one hour how to spot micro expressions. A demo of the difference between the expressions anger and disgust can be watched here. A variety of people have begun to use METT, including corporate executives, claims adjusters, sales persons, medical students, TSA, Special Forces and law enforcement.In one recently published study by Tamara Russell of London University, Russell was able to bring schizophrenics up to a normal level of recognizing emotion after a half-hour of METT training. In another study, my colleague David Matsumoto, Ph.D., and I provided less than 40 minutes of METT training to some sales personnel, while others were instructed about emotion but not given the training. Their supervisors, who didn't know who'd received METT training, rated those trained with METT as more successful in sales, and easier to get along with than the people who were not trained.Once you recognize micro expressions, you have to decide how to use that concealed information. It depends in part on why you think the other person was concealing her feelings. Was it embarrassment--or some darker motive? In bargaining, we don't expect to be told how the other person is feeling about an offer, but it can be valuable to find that out, just as it is in sales. A law enforcement interrogation is a very different situation, however, in which those intending to break the law, or those suspected of having already committed a crime, claim to be honest but are not.Consider the intended future of your relationship with the person who's showing the micro expression. Obviously, your consideration differs depending on whether that person is your child, intimate partner, sales prospect, witness or insurance claimant. Your response when you recognize a micro expression might simply be to take note of it in planning what you do next. You might want to say, ""Is there something else you're feeling that you haven't told me yet?"" Or, ""I had a sense you were upset about something that just happened."" Or you might be more exact and name the emotion: ""Are you worried about something?"" In my book, Emotions Revealed, I give examples of how to use the information derived from micro expressions in family life, the workplace and friendship.You might have noticed that I left off my list of universal facial expressions a number of other emotions: embarrassment, guilt, shame, envy, jealousy and pride. As best we can tell, these emotions don't have a universal expression, even though the emotions themselves are universal.One warning: You may not always be pleased by what you'll see if you use METT. You may not want to know that your guests didn't really think your joke was funny, your children are hiding how they feel about something, your spouse is not being forthright, or the actor wasn't doing such a good job in that performance. But once learned you can't turn it off. You'll always be aware of the emotions others are trying to conceal from you.I believe in the long run, in most cases, we're better off knowing how people are feeling, if we're careful not to confront them, and not to use that knowledge for exploitive purposes.Paul Ekman, Ph.D.,  has been studying facial expression, body movement, emotion and deception for more than 40 years. He is professor emeritus of psychology at the University of California, San Francisco. He has authored or edited 15 books, most recently Emotions Revealed, and co-authored with the Dalai Lama Emotional Awareness. Ekman and his associates provide online training on how to recognize concealed emotions in micro expressions. Currently he is the scientific adviser to a dramatic television series on FoxTV's Lie To Me, which is based largely on his research.",Starting a Business,2009-03-26 00:00:00
/article/200852,Unemployed (or Preparing to Be)?,These sites could be your best friends.,"We found a battery of new sites and services--such as LinkedIn JobsInsider, Recessionwire, and Uberi.com--dedicated to providing the kind of cost-cutting, job-search, and moral-support tools that can be invaluable during lean times.As the economy continues to suffer, many people are cutting their budgets, looking for work, or preparing a plan of action in case a layoff comes. Fortunately, the Web offers some powerful new tools to help with those tasks. After asking some experts and a number of unemployed friends for recommendations, I put together a list of sites that can truly make a difference, whether you're conducting or anticipating a job search, or just trying to tighten the purse strings during these bad economic times.Quicken Online
If your job does go away, a smart first step is to declare martial law on your budget, paring down or eliminating all but the most essential expenses. I've never (seriously) maintained a personal budget, but doing so will likely be one of the new experiences this downturn introduces me to. Since I'm unlikely to cut my broadband connection until I'm literally starving, I looked for a solid (and free) online budgeting tool--one that could pull information from elsewhere on the Web, and that was accessible from anywhere.I settled on Intuit's basic and free Quicken Online service. The setup took all of 3 minutes, and before I knew it the service was pulling my income and expense information from the last nine months from my online bank account. The service reads every line item and intelligently applies a category to each (rent, food, entertainment, income, and so on), and then it charts where your money is going and gives you ideas on what you can cut back or eliminate. Quicken miscategorized a few of my entries, but correcting them was a snap. The service also sets up a series of alarms and reminders for when your bills are due, so that you never incur another late charge. You can have the reminders sent to your e-mail or to your cell phone--and yes, there's an iPhone app. (Also recommended: Mint.)LinkedIn JobsInsider
One of the greatest comforts if you are unemployed (or if you're anticipating that you will be soon) is having a strong network of professional and social friends. Networking on sites such as LinkedIn, which focuses on career-related social networking, can be a powerful way to spread the word that you are looking for work, to advertise your expertise, to get difference-making recommendations from friends, and to find out about job opportunities.But you already know that. What's new is that LinkedIn is developing some cool tools to help you while you're hunting for job opportunities. The company has introduced a downloadable browser add-on called LinkedIn JobsInsider that tells you, in a pane at the left side of your browser window, when you have a LinkedIn contact who might be able to help you with specific jobs you've found while searching on job boards (like Monster, for example). Whether you have an ""in"" with a particular employer can make the difference between expending effort in pursuing the opportunity or spending time looking for something better.""In fact, one LinkedIn contact can make all the difference in the world,"" says Julie Erich, an insurance industry recruiter based in San Francisco. ""Put yourself in the shoes of the hiring manager who has 200 resumes on her desk. She is busy and is looking for ways to reduce that pile to set of solid finalists who will make it to the second round."" The mention of a mutual friend, in the real world or on LinkedIn, can cause the hiring manager to move your resume to the top of the pile, Erich says. ""It can get you an interview, [whereas] without that mutual friend you might have been lost in the stack.""As you might imagine, LinkedIn and sites like it have seen a dramatic uptick in popularity since the economy took a nosedive. A spokesperson told me that LinkedIn has seen a 65 percent increase in recommendations (your friends/contacts saying nice things about you at your profile page) since December 2008. Meanwhile, she says, the number of applicants per job listing on LinkedIn has doubled over the last 6 months, while the number of job listings has plummeted. These days, a new member is signing up with LinkedIn at a rate of one per second.SimplyHired
You've already heard about the large employment sites, such as CareerBuilder, HotJobs, and Monster. I'm not a big believer in such sites, and I don't often hear people talking about how wonderful any one of them is. Instead I recommend a relative newcomer called SimplyHired, a startup with financial backing from News Corporation, which owns Fox Networks.SimplyHired does for (to?) job sites what Kayak does for travel sites: It aggregates job listings from all over the Web, including from the big sites. SimplyHired now lists about 4 million jobs. I did a few sample searches on the site for marketing positions, and saw openings from perhaps ten different job boards, along with postings that came directly from the hiring companies. The listings give the basic information about the opportunity, and then link you out to the listing at the hiring company's site or at the job board.I like the fact that SimplyHired takes advantage of the job data it aggregates to benefit its users. For instance, the site mines the data to produce both salary averages and employment trends (the number of opportunities listed month-to-month, for instance) for the type of job you're looking for. SimplyHired also offers a couple of tools that seem to be more than window dressing. One is a Google Maps mashup where you can plot out various commutes to the same job--pretty useful, since the commute is an obvious factor in deciding whether to pursue a particular job listing.DesperateDollars
DesperateDollars is filled with ideas for making money if you find yourself in really dire straits--things like getting tattoos for money, growing and selling your own food, doing for-pay surveys and secret-shopping assignments, volunteering for paid clinical tests, or donating sperm, blood, or hair. The site isn't the prettiest thing in the world to look at, but I found the assortment of money-making ideas entertaining, as well as somewhat of a comfort: It's a reminder that the world doesn't end if you lose your job. With a little creativity, in times of desperation you can still go out and bring home the bacon.Free Napkin
FreeNapkin is like an eBay for free stuff. The site is a magnet for two types of people: folks looking for an easy way to recycle stuff they don't need by finding a new home for it, and those who are trying to cut costs by getting used stuff for free instead of going out and buying it. The ""givers"" post pictures and information about the items they want to dump, and the first FreeNapkin ""claimer"" to call dibs on the item wins it. The claimer pays the shipping on the item, or picks it up in person (the site filters the donations by city).People have given away everything from dogs to farm equipment on FreeNapkin. I've never donated or claimed anything on FreeNapkin; but judging by the number of listings, the site seems to work well. FreeNapkin is no marvel of fancy Web design, but it gets bonus points for hitting squarely on the need to conserve and reuse things in tough economic times.Uberi.com
If your income is threatened or interrupted, putting a tight grip on your outgoing cash is essential. Many deal sites have popped up on the Web in the last year, each with a slightly different product focus and approach. Uberi spends about half its time looking for consumer tech deals (TVs, printers, and the like), and the rest gathering listings for things important to families and small businesses, such as food, paper, and clothing. The deals appear in random order, not categorized, so you must scan through them; the link in each one leads out to the product page at the corresponding retailer's site.The site tracks deals at many large retailers such as Amazon and Wal-Mart, which offer discounts on various things every day. Amazon has so many that Uberi presents a ""discount table"" linking you directly to listings of on-sale products by category and by discount level (10 percent to 90 percent).If you are the official (or unofficial) purchasing agent for a business or a large household, checking the listings at Uberi to see if they match your needs has the potential to make a real difference when you tally up your costs at the end of the month. (Also recommended: RetailMeNot.)Meetup
The Internet is a great place to start the process of finding a job, but getting hired happens as a result of direct, face-to-face contact with other people. Meetup provides a platform where anyone, regardless of where they live, can find or set up groups of local, like-minded people with specific shared interests or goals.More and more employment-related groups are forming on Meetup, as a quick group search on the site reveals. I searched Meetup for groups in my neighborhood (using my zip code), and found several nearby. In such groups you can learn about job opportunities that aren't advertised, about job fairs and other events, and about people inside or outside of the group who can help you (directly or indirectly) get your foot in the door somewhere.SmartyPig
With the economy on the wane, Americans are getting serious about saving money again--savings deposits were up 5 percent in January. It's a good time to consider SmartyPig, a savings Web site backed by a real FDIC-insured bank that attempts to make saving money more fun (and more successful) by adding social networking elements and Web widgets.Say you're saving up for a trip, a wedding, or a down payment on a house. You tell the Pig when you want to meet your goal, and the Pig suggests an automatic monthly payment amount that will allow you to reach it. You make payments into your account as you would with any online bank. You can then install a SmartyPig widget at your Facebook or MySpace page; this gets your friends involved, which might make you more feel more accountable to your savings goal. SmartyPig even provides an easy way for your friends to donate cash to your cause.Recessionwire.com
Here's a cool new site that falls under the ""moral support"" heading. Recessionwire was founded by three journalists--a couple of Conde Naste Portfolio online editors and a freelancer--who found themselves, uh, underemployed. The three decided to vent their frustration by starting what they termed a ""user's guide to the recession.""The site offers news and analysis on the economy (""Recession Briefing""), perspectives, work (or out-of-work) advice, spending tips (""Recession Concessions""), inspiration (spotlights on people who see opportunity in this economy), and insights.While the site offers a lot of serious news and information, perhaps its best quality is its ability to give you a laugh or two during rough times. Recessionwire takes a decidedly humorous and irreverent approach to the economy and its effects on people. Here's a quick excerpt from Joe the Trader's blog: ""The jury may still be out on broad societal shifts, but the public quickly volunteered to be judge, jury, and executioner for the Wall Street fat cats. Even in the halcyon days of 2006, Wall Street guys were called douchebags.""Wise Bread
Wise Bread is just one of a whole new wave of frugality sites. It's essentially a group of blogs with a discussion forum attached. The blogs cover ideas and advice on personal finance, career, frugal buying, green living, and ways to do everyday things more easily and cheaply (""lifehacks""). For instance, when I checked today I saw a blog about how the bailout package might affect your mortgage, a piece on cutting down your use of plastic bags, and a bit titled ""Beware the Pretty Things: Four Reasons I'm Keeping My Ugly, Old Stuff"". Every day the site features deals from around the Web, as well as advice from an expert on retirement planning and other money matters.
While the site offers many creative ways to simplify your lifestyle and save money, it also makes a big deal out of finding ways to keep some of the luxuries you enjoy, by paying less for them. That makes sense to me; simply removing all the fun things from your life can make you feel morally defeated by your financial woes.More than anything, I like the cumulative message of Wise Bread--that there is nothing wrong (and a lot right) with living within your means. At a time when debt, both personal and institutional, is wreaking so much havoc on so many people's budgets, it seems appropriate to ditch the idea that buying new and on credit is the proper thing to do, and that those ""pretty things"" we think we want will lead to happiness.Whether you are employed, underemployed, or unemployed, I hope you will check out some of these ten sites. All have something to offer regardless of your employment status, even if it's just a quick laugh or a little inspiration. And, as always, I invite you to let me know about sites that have helped you manage money, find a job, or keep your mind right during these hard economic times.",Growth Strategies,2009-03-19 00:00:00

/article/200748,Set the Model for Office Behavior,Even seemingly trivial acts of incivility can lead to reduced employee productivity and loyalty.\r\n,"						This story appears in the April 2009 issue of Entrepreneur. Subscribe  Any workplace is an eclectic group of personalities, and co-workers can rub each other the wrong way with the things they say and do. Some days, it's easy to annoy a co-worker without even trying.But what about the subtle, petty slights that are meant to offend? Maybe it's an eye roll, a sarcastic reply or an exasperated sigh. These seemingly trivial acts of incivility speak volumes to employees on the receiving end who become less productive and less loyal.""We found that 1 in 8 people will leave an organization because of [incivility] and not report it,"" says Christine Porath, a management professor at the University of Southern California and co-author of The Cost of Bad Behavior: How Incivility Damages Your Business and What You Can Do About It. Porath collaborated on one survey that found that 80 percent of participants who experienced impoliteness lost work time worrying about the incident, while 48 percent deliberately decreased their work efforts. ""People performed a lot worse when they experienced incivility,"" she says.A poor economy increases the chances of hostility on the job, says P.M. Forni, author of The Civility Solution: What to Do When People Are Rude and founder of the Civility Initiative at Johns Hopkins University, which has studied civility for more than a decade. In uncertain times, Forni says employees feel more insecure and get more territorial over their expertise, their tasks and even their physical work space. At the same time, they're looking for the hidden meaning behind every gesture, conversation and decision. ""Adversity makes thinkers out of us,"" Forni says. ""We start asking ourselves questions [like], 'OK, the boss didn't say hello to me today. What does that mean?'""Of course, you can't spend all day psychoanalyzing your staff, and some conflict is inevitable. Rachel Thebault, founder of New York City confectionary shop Tribeca Treats, once had a new employee walk out in the middle of a busy workday after a manager offered some constructive criticism. For Thebault, 33, it was the icing on the cake after repeated problems, and she parted ways with that employee.

Subscribe  For decades, leaving a job to raise kids meant kissing your career goodbye. Now, employers are embracing employees who took a parenting detour. Goldman Sachs launched a ""returnship"" program last September--the first of its kind--that lets women return to explore a new field for eight weeks with pay but without guarantee of employment. Eleven professionals took part in the initial launch, and job offers were extended to five of them. Sara Lee also offers part-time paid internships through its own program for parents and others who have taken time off, such as military personnel. Honeywell and UBS have developed their own programs for returning parents, too.There's been explosive growth in career reentry programs, says Carol Fishman Cohen, co-author of Back on the Career Track: A Guide for Stay-at-Home Moms Who Want to Return to Work and co-founder of iRelaunch, a career reentry strategy firm that compiles a list of reentry programs worldwide. Of the 57 programs iRelaunch has identified, ""only nine of those programs--16 percent--existed before 2004,"" says Cohen, who credits media and research attention for driving the trend.Evolving employers also view these workers as a valuable pool of talent--one that plans to return eventually: According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, between 70 percent and 93 percent of the United States' 2.3 million stay-at-home moms age 25 to 54 with kids under 18 and a bachelor's degree or higher want to reenter the work force.

/article/200704,How to Interview for Integrity,"Background checks are great, but skilled interviewing is even more essential.","						This story appears in the April 2009 issue of Entrepreneur. Subscribe  Jay Meschke recalls the case well: ""We had an unethical CEO candidate who actually used his wife as a reference,"" says the president of Overland Park, Kansas, search firm EFL Associates, a CBIZ company. The pair had different last names and used an international phone number to confuse matters.The deception failed when a recruiter called to check references, then later visited with the candidate's wife and recognized her voice from the reference call. ""We uncovered it only through sheer luck,"" Meschke admits.Luck is great, but you can't count on it. And that's troublesome when scarce jobs and a volatile economy can pressure candidates to embellish and outright lie just to be considered for a position. ""This is a rampant problem now,"" Meschke says. ""And it's gotten worse over the years.""Background checks, whether done professionally by an outside service or informally through a scan of search engines, comprise a key part of exposing falsities. But background checks work best when combined with skilled interviewing. And a well-done interview can trip up even an accomplished liar.Wise interviewers use resumes only as starting points for reading between the lines of a candidate's work history. ""One pretty easy thing a lot of people don't do is ask about jobs not listed on resumes,"" Meschke says. This simple question puts candidates on the spot to either admit or deny leaving out past jobs that may not support the image they want to portray.Next, get details of start and end dates for past employment. ""People will omit things,"" Meschke says. ""Once you can check out their background more thoroughly, you can find out whether the truth matches.""While you're at it, delve into specifics about claimed past job titles. For example, if someone says on a resume that he was CFO of General Electric Co., it's possible he was only a junior finance officer in a much smaller entity, Meschke says.Also inquire about previous supervisors. Ask for the name and title of the person to which the applicant reported directly. ""Get the names of people, so you can go back and get the best reference,"" he says.Thus, armed with reference and background checks, you bear a better chance of turning up accurate and informative data. But interviewers can still do more, simply by listening for signs of evasiveness. If you ask a very specific question and receive an overly general reply, for example, take care. ""That's a huge red flag,"" Meschke says.Another technique consists of scheduling multiple meetings with different interviewers, individually and in teams, then comparing notes. ""That's to make sure the candidate is being consistent in answers,"" Meschke says. ""The habitual liar can't keep everything straight over and over again.""If evidence reveals a lack of integrity, think twice before doing anything. For instance, you may be legally required to disclose that a background check provided information leading you to reject a candidate. And even if your best efforts at interviewing leave the interviewee smelling like a rose, don't assume all is completely well. ""The best liars are very good,"" Meschke warns. ""Nothing is ironclad.""Mark Henricks writes on business and technology for leading publications and is author of Not Just a Living.",Growth Strategies,2009-03-12 00:00:00

However, to achieve your greatest success, you need to tap the knowledge and experience of colleagues. Whether it's dealing with taxes or tech, or generating additional sales, working with people who have experience and alternative perspectives will improve your chances for success.Consultants, sales professionals or part-time assistants can help you move beyond personal limitations. Here's how to stay open to new and varied viewpoints to stimulate your creativity and refocus your energy on different ways to kick-start your business.Define the challenges you face, not the position you need to fill. Clearly define the skills and experience you need to resolve your current challenges and what outcomes you expect. Providing a clear and compelling purpose establishes a solid springboard for ideas and encourages people to take action toward the same goal. It will also ensure that the people you decide to work with have the skills necessary to expand your business.Challenge the notion of ""this is how it's always been done."" You are continually faced with situations that can provide both opportunity and challenges. When interviewing potential team members, gain insight into their work ethics by stating your challenge and asking how they would resolve it. Seek team members who have similar values but provide unique perspectives on growing your business. They will offer solutions and strategies that you may have never thought of.Get out of your office and obtain referrals. Many people hire out of desperation. It's not until after they've worked with these quick hires that they discover it's not the right fit.

Providing continual feedback keeps your team moving forward, and it enables you to gain a better understanding of how to improve your business and better serve your customers.Maintain momentum by building loyalty. It takes time to get new team members familiar with your business and its customers.

Under the federal Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA), you also don't get paid, but your job is held for you. The FMLA applies to companies that have more than 50 employees; you can be entitled to 12 workweeks of unpaid leave during any 12-month period in connection with the birth of a child. 
What's unclear though -- and a possible pitfall for you -- is that you refer to yourself as self-employed, but mention that you receive W-2 forms (instead of 1099 forms for independent contractors) from your clients. Are your clients deducting the proper amounts in withholding on your behalf? Look carefully at any agreements you have with your clients (they may treat you as a W-2 employee for tax withholding purposes, but not for the purpose of any other benefits).

/answer/221867,Should I tell my employer about my part-time business?,,"																																	In this economy, it's wise to have five income streams. However, juggling the political and legal aspects of these income streams is no easy task.   Needless to say, the juggling can also create a time management nightmare.   
Why to tell? Why not to tell? Please consider the following:
Do you work under a contract that specifies that you must divulge any other income streams?
What will the consequences be if you fail to divulge this additional income?
What will the consequences be if you do divulge this additional income?
What are the chances that your boss will find out anyway? For instance, he attends an event you are DJing or another employee tells him what is going on.
Is there any way to drop a subtle hint? For instance on Friday when people are discussing their weekend plans you could say ""I am going to DJ a birthday party on Saturday night."" 
Finally, if you believe that there may be legal ramifications, you should discuss the specifics with an attorney who specializes in labor and employment.

/answer/221854,Can I ask health-related questions during an interview?,,"																																	The right way to address this issue is to have identified ahead of time specifically what the physical requirements for each job are. Then, show the physical requirements to the individual you are interviewing and ask him if he feels confident that he can do the job. You may still encounter some people who think that they can do the work required -- but actually cannot. However, having new hires sign-off on the physical requirements before coming on board will help to prevent this from happening very often.    
Using the following criteria as a template may help:
PHYSICAL REQUIREMENTS:

But how do you get them to work well together?","						This story appears in the March 2009 issue of Entrepreneur. Subscribe  The 25 employees at Lumen Legal use e-mail and IM to communicate with each other. But last year, there was a communication breakdown. The company's twentysomething Gen Yers kept trying to IM their Gen X and baby boomer co-workers, who weren't always logging on to IM. It was becoming a source of irritation at the Royal Oak, Mich., attorney outsourcing firm, where 25 percent of the staffers are Gen Yers, 40 percent are Gen Xers and 35 percent are boomers. For the company's twentysomethings, ""there's this frustration, like, 'Well, I was going to try to IM you, but you're not logged on--and why aren't you logged on?'"" says founder and CEO David Galbenski, 39.In November, the $10 million company set up employees' computers so that IM would automatically log them on at bootup. Lumen is also pondering some new ""rules of communication"" that let its employees know when it's best to IM instead of e-mail and vice versa. Galbenski chalks the problem up to a generational divide over how to communicate.Welcome to one of the many challenges facing entrepreneurs with multigenerational work forces, in which highly experienced baby boomers are working alongside tech-savvy twentysomethings who have high expectations but little experience. Caught in the middle are knowledgeable Gen Xers in their 30s and early 40s who are struggling for work/life balance as they bear the brunt of managing multigenerational work teams. Throw in the modern workplace with its disappearing hierarchy, and you have a recipe for generational conflict.Generational red flags
You might have a generational conflict brewing if you're noticing these problems in your workplace:

Cliques are forming.You see competing ringleaders emerging with different viewpoints on how to get the work done.Employees come into your office to complain about their colleagues.You have employees who don't want to work with each other on various projects.You're seeing stops, starts and dead ends in projects.Workers complain that they aren't getting what they need from each other.Work quality is suffering.Employees argue openly.There are uncomfortable silences or facial gestures when someone from another generation speaks.Tips courtesy of Bruce Tulgan, founder of generational training firm RainmakerThinking and author of Not Everyone Gets a Trophy: How to Manage Generation Y
""The old seniority system did a lot of the work of managing people,"" says Bruce Tulgan, founder of generational training firm RainmakerThinking and author of Not Everyone Gets a Trophy: How to Manage Generation Y. ""That system has broken down."" Leaders have to balance the interpersonal dynamics and the power relations at work, he adds, ""or there's likely to be a lot of conflict.""The conflicts go far beyond technology. Robin Throckmorton, co-author of Bridging the Generation Gap: How to Get Radio Babies, Boomers, Gen Xers and Gen Yers to Work Together and Achieve More, sees communication and work ethic as the main sources of tension between the generations. Older employees are getting annoyed with Gen Yers who are continually asking for more, whether it's raises, telecommuting or time off that Gen Xers and boomers had to earn. Gen Yers roll their eyes at Gen Xers and boomers who hold on to hierarchy and hold back change.The unspoken rules of the workplace are creating problems, too. Jennifer Deal, author of Retiring the Generation Gap: How Employees Young and Old Can Find Common Ground, tells the story of an older manager who asked a new 25-year-old employee to get something to him as soon as possible. The employee left at 5 p.m. without finishing the task. The manager ""was horrified that this person had left,"" says Deal, who asked the manager if he had clarified that ASAP meant by the end of the day. ""The [manager] said, 'No, I shouldn't have to. I told him ASAP. That means before you leave.'"" Deal told the manager that younger employees don't know the rules unless they're taught. ""They have to learn it,"" Deal says. ""The question is, do you want to fix the problem, or do you want to be annoyed?""Inner City Enterprises is a multimillion-dollar Atlanta holding company that runs apparel line WheatBread, the foundation Change The Game, and GTM, a guerrilla marketing firm best known for the anti-tobacco ""Truth"" campaign. Depending on the campaign, the company could be managing up to 100 people. Its 15 core employees range from their 20s to 40s, but co-founder Karl Carter, 36, spends a lot of time coaching the Gen Yers. Because corporate environments can seem backward to younger employees, ""you really have to let them know that this is when to turn it on and this is when to turn it off,"" says co-founder Kembo Tom, 36. ""It's not something that's intuitive.""The firm's Gen Xers, meanwhile, want to know they're appreciated. They also want stability and the opportunity to keep growing professionally. ""A lot of [Xers] are cycling out of corporate America because they've gone that route,"" Carter says. ""They're not happy, they're burned out, they don't feel appreciated or they want to do their own thing."" He sees older Gen Xers contemplating the end of their careers, too. ""[They're saying], 'This may be one of the last three jobs I have,' depending on their age,"" Carter says. ""'So what's in it for me?'""The Struggle for Power
Power over who gets to make the rules is at the heart of today's generational conflicts, Deal says. This year's presidential election highlighted the simmering generational power struggle. McCain focused on experience, while Obama talked about change. ""What [McCain] said--and what's generally said in the work force--is that [experience] trumps other things,"" Deal says. But for younger people who don't have as much experience, ""it's in their best interest to say, 'No, good ideas trump experience.'""Galbenski says Lumen's boomers are more into process, replication and revisiting past experiences. The company's Gen Yers, however, prefer brainstorming new ideas in teams. ""There's a constant push and pull between innovation and systemization,"" Galbenski says. ""Gen Xers and boomers might think of a solution to the problem first and then involve the team.""Thinking about how different generations solve problems and approach their work can make a difference. ""If you understand it, you can optimize it and communicate effectively,"" Galbenski says. ""It's how you create a structure around moving things ahead when conflicts do arise.""Throckmorton's research has found that every generation wants one thing above all: respect. Gen Yers and millennials want respect for their ideas. Gen Xers want respect for their professionalism. Boomers want respect for their experience.Tulgan says managing generational conflict requires keeping everyone focused on the work. ""If you're 65 or 25, you may have a lot of things that separate you perspective-wise,"" Tulgan says. ""But if you're [all] really focused on the same work, that's what you have in common.""

/article/200110,Free Lunches do Exist,Employee X explains why company-sponsored lunches are so valuable.\r\n,"						This story appears in the March 2009 issue of Entrepreneur. Subscribe  When people ask me what my favorite thing about my job is, I don't hesitate to answer: the free lunches. Yes, I completely love that I get a free lunch every day. In fact, at the very moment the company recruiter revealed this perk to me, I probably subconsciously decided to accept this job offer over other higher salaried offers. Sure, it defies logic, but my stomach has a mind of its own.The most obvious benefit to these free lunches is the money that stays in my pocket. I'd say the average lunch at my office would cost about $8. That would come out to $40 per week, or more than $2,000 per year. That's a nice chunk of change to stash away (or spend) at the end of the year.Another not-so-obvious benefit to providing free daily lunches is the team bonding it creates. Most of us rush to the kitchen at the same time to get our food and then sit together in the cafeteria or at tables outside the office. It really is an easy way to get to know each other or vent frustrations and solve work problems in an informal setting.Although the free lunches are hyped as a desirable employee benefit, I realize our company doesn't do this simply to be nice. In fact, the company probably saves just as much money providing lunch for me as I do. If all employees were to go out for lunch, I bet the average lunch hour would be more like an hour and a half. Add to that the amount of time before lunch spent chatting with co-workers about where to eat and the time spent after lunch settling back into work mode, and going out to lunch may cost our employer an extra hour of lost productivity per employee. Also, it's not uncommon for me to work through my lunch hour while eating at my desk during busy times.One drawback for the company in providing free lunches is that we're totally spoiled. If the company ever decided to follow in Google New York's footsteps and cut back the free food perk, employee morale would probably drop. I'd figure the company wasn't doing so well and wonder what it would cut next. I'd probably be kind of bummed, but not bummed enough to want to leave the company. Sure, I'd miss the ribs, honey walnut shrimp, fresh salads and fruits, and trays of brownies. But just thinking back to the hundreds of free meals I've already eaten makes me feel fondly about my company--and that's the kind of goodwill I'm sure employers crave.If you're an employee or know an employee who wants to vent about or praise anemployer anonymously, e-mail us at employeex@entrepreneur.com.",Growth Strategies,2009-02-13 00:00:00

Subscribe  The other day, my wife and I were shopping for a new car. We stopped by the Cadillac dealership because we wanted to see the new Escalade Hybrid. The lot was filled with new cars. There were at least 10 salespeople ready to help us, but there were only two customers: us. I felt bad for those salespeople and the staff. I wish I could say we purchased a new car, but we didn't.Many people blame the automakers for the problems that they are facing--and they are to blame, but not completely. As entrepreneurs, we can all learn at least three big lessons from the auto industry mess:Leaders should be on the same compensation plan as the sales staff. If Detroit's leaders were paid only for the number of cars sold, they might be better businesspeople. Instead, the leaders have megasalaries, private jets, midweek golf outings and benefits suited for royalty--all unrelated to sales or company health. These corporate leaders have been stealing from the company, workers and investors who gave them so much. To be a great entrepreneur, be a leader who works for those who work for you. As the head of my company, I work for my customers and my workers. If my company is not profitable, I should not get paid.Leaders listen to the customer. Never forget: It was the customer that wanted the big SUVs and trucks. An entrepreneur needs to have a crystal ball and prepare for changes in the customer before the customer changes. As my company's leader, I have been preparing for this economic downturn for years. As some of you know, I have spoken out against the financial planning industry, mutual funds and the financial gurus who recommend them. Instead, I have been an advocate of personal financial education and have built my company around it. Today, my company's sales have increased as more and more people realize that a well-diversified portfolio of mutual funds is not a safe investment and investing in a financial education might offer a better return.Politicians reward incompetence. Many of the politicians the Big Three automakers were begging for money are the very politicians who protected the inefficient industry. It was the politicians who protected the unions and high wages. Most entrepreneurs do not have the benefits of high-paid lobbyists and friends in high places. I realize President Obama promises change. But never forget: He is a politician, not an entrepreneur. Getting elected takes more than just money.

/answer/221850,How can I motivate my employees?,,"																																	Remember the old proverb ""A fish rots from its head."" Motivate your employees with your own motivation. If you are positive, committed, hard-working and focused -- your employees will follow suit. 
Make sure that your employees know how much you value them. If you value them, they will value you. If you disrespect them, they will disrespect you.
Each of us is unique, with a different set of circumstances, needs and desires. Find out what makes each of your employees tick. Identify their individual interests/desires. If you know what motivates an employee it will be easier to give her what she wants/needs most. Find out what motivates your employees by getting to know them.

/article/200038,Feeding the Anti-Tipping Movement,Do tip jars have you crying uncle? Some restaurants are testing the no-tipping waters.,"						This story appears in the March 2009 issue of Entrepreneur. Subscribe  Ever feel like tipping has lost its charm? Tip jars are plentiful, and everyone from the bellboy to the barista expects a little something. Now some restaurant heavyweights are weighing in. Chefs Thomas Keller and Alice Waters have discouraged tipping by implementing a fixed service charge at their restaurants. Meanwhile, Jay Porter is taking it one step further at his San Diego farm-to-table restaurant, The Linkery. Not only did he set a service charge of 18 percent, but he also started an ""anti-tipping laboratory,"" outright banning tips after observing that they were creating negative competition among his staff. ""Within six weeks of making the switch, the e-mail feedback from our guests regarding service had a 180-degree change in tone,"" says Porter, 38, who started the experiment in 2006 and reports that sales have increased fivefold since then.But will anti-tipping ever go mainstream? Michael Lynn, professor of consumer behavior at the Cornell University School of Hotel Administration, is doubtful. ""There will always be some people who want to be generous and help the server or perhaps show off, so they'll leave tips,"" he says. ""That's going to put social pressure on others. It just feeds on itself so you're [always] going to have tipping.""Want to try your own anti-tipping experiment?Discuss your thoughts with your employees. It's crucial that everyone believes in the cause.Equip your employees with an effective response to customers who are concerned about the set service charge.Have a thick skin. Employees and customers might be openly critical at first.Start with a staff that is committed to excellence. If your servers understand that they can deliver better service without tips, it won't be a matter of imposing the new system, but adopting it, says Jay Porter, who has successfully banned tips in his restaurant.Have a set policy regarding what to do with tips left by customers.",Growth Strategies,2009-02-11 00:00:00
/answer/221840,Can I pay an employee a monthly medical reimbursement?,,"																																	What you are essentially asking is, ""May I pay my employees more money?"" And, of course, the answer is, ""Yes, you can.""
If you are going to pay full-time employees who have been on board X days a stipend that they may use to purchase medical insurance coverage, it should be a program that is clearly communicated and fairly administered. You might want to establish a couple of levels based on job grade (e.g. a higher monthly stipend for top management). But an employee-by-employee basis may put you into a difficult situation (defending your criteria/rationale).  
Will you pay more to people with bigger families? More to males than females? You may get into that dangerous area called ""discrimination,"" as this is essentially compensation, it should reflect the credo of equal pay for equal work.
You will need to state in your policy that these stipends are only given at management discretion and may be discontinued at any time with or without notice. Also, be sure that you state that these monies are not to be used when calculating overtime rates for non-exempt employees. But be prepared that this latter contention may be challenged at some time.
Lastly, you cannot require employees to use the extra monies to buy medical insurance.
I would recommend that you talk with a few insurance brokers to find a medical plan for which you could pay 50 percent of the cost for each employee so that a decent plan is offered to everyone on board. It may end up costing you less than giving everyone a monthly medical reimbursement and everyone will have access to coverage that way.

/article/199774,What Else Besides Termination?,"Layoffs may seem like the easiest fix to boost your profit margins, but the repercussions will have dire effects. Discover some better options to keep your business afloat.","Every day, you read in the papers that the U.S. recession is deepening with repercussions felt throughout the world. Large and small organizations are affected. Old, well-established companies in the auto and banking industries are bleeding. Bankruptcies and corporate closures are becoming commonplace. Stock and bond markets are down, and credit is increasingly more difficult to obtain, despite previous positive corporate financial statements. Unemployment is reaching record levels.Do you want to be a victim of those events?Decision time: In your own company, costs are mounting, credit lines are disappearing and revenues are decreasing. You have to make some serious decisions regarding the enormous expense generated by staff salaries and benefits. Do you terminate some and lay off others? Or do you risk bankruptcy, serious negative financial status or closure? What will you do?One easy way to approach this complicated set of conditions is to fire enough employees to help turn around your profit and loss statements. However, there are serious costs to this move. Morale will plummet, productivity will decrease, the remaining employees will feel threatened--angry that they have to do the job of the terminated employees, and quality will inevitably decrease.So what else can you do? Plenty. But, it takes creativity, flexibility and an ability to have effective, two-way communication with your staff.The first step is to meet with your employees. If you have a large company, you can meet with all of them at once or in small groups. I suggest the latter. The advantage to meeting in one large group is that everyone will hear the same message at the same time--no room for the rumor mill to be activated. The clear disadvantage to working with a large group is that they feel depersonalized--the rage, disappointment or shock felt by some can easily be spread to many. When that happens, the next step may be increased and continued anger, bickering, and a loss of control and direction of the meeting.That is why meeting in departments, sections, units or small groups can be preferable. Working with a more manageable number of employees, you can create more of a constructive, interpersonal atmosphere that leads to positive interaction with your employees. They will feel that they can relate to you on a personal level and ask key questions. This will usually be done without the anger or yelling of larger settings. However, the clear disadvantage is that this process takes a long time to reach the entire company; the message may be slightly different and not all of the information generated by employees in one session may come up in other sessions.Whichever format you use, the process of delivering your message should follow these basic steps:Describe the dire financial situation faced by the country, the region and your own company.Share with them the crucial fact that you need to face some very critical challenges that threaten the very existence of your enterprise.Honestly state that the actions you need to take, in some cases difficult for you, the individuals and the overall company, are being made to ensure the survival of the company.Present some options that you and your senior team have created. Ask for participant feedback on these options. Then, encourage them to create other options. Employees who feel like they're part of the process are far more likely to carry out the results than employees who are simply told to implement the options.Announce what the changes are and when they'll occur.State that you and others will be available to hear their reactions, and yes, their complaints.Above all, your employees need to understand that you're trying to spread the burden of cutting back or giving back to everyone rather than firing a certain number of employees.Here are some moves employers and employees can make to avoid outright terminations or layoffs:Take a percentage decrease in salary for a given period of time. This action begins with executives.Offer voluntary retirements with an incentive to resign early.Institute a policy of nonreplacement for retirements.Implement a non-paid day or week, per month if necessary.Mandate a decrease in number of hours worked.Ask for overtime work at no pay or reduced pay.Move to part-time status.Pay a greater share of benefits such as health care costs or insurance policies.Make it known sick leave can be uncompensated up to a limit of days off.Layoffs and terminations can have a devastating impact on a company, with repercussions lasting a long time. A cohesive organization that's concerned for the well-being of others is often willing to sacrifice something of its own to help ensure the viability of the company. An entrepreneur interested in alternatives to outright firing can enlist employees to help ensure the continuing success of the entity. In that way, all employees can feel a little pain rather than a few employees feeling a great deal of pain.Dr. David G. JavitchDr. David G.

/article/199672,Hire Better: Recruiting 2.0,"How entrepreneurs are using social networking, blogging and other internet tools to hire the best employees\r\n","						This story appears in the February 2009 issue of Entrepreneur. Subscribe  While searching Twitter for comments about his clients, San Francisco PR entrepreneur Jason Throckmorton noticed a post from a University of Oregon undergraduate. Searching further, he found a blog from the same student discussing how the PR industry was evolving. ""We said, 'This is the kind of person we're interested in,'"" says Throckmorton, 34. The co-founder of $5 million LaunchSquad contacted the student, invited her to visit and wound up adding her to his staff of 35.Throckmorton isn't the only entrepreneur using social networking, blogging and other Web 2.0 tools to recruit employees. Ben Swartz, co-founder and president of Chicago-based interactive marketing advisory firm Marcel Media, estimates he's hired three-quarters of his 21-person staff using Web 2.0 resources. Swartz, 34, is particularly enthusiastic about using LinkedIn and Facebook to learn about candidates in depth. ""In a typical resume, you might get a line on interests,"" he says. ""On LinkedIn, you can find out who they associate with. On Facebook, you might find some groups and associations and even pictures. It gives us more dimensions than a static resume can offer.""In addition to these well-established general-purpose services, the staffing industry is beginning to offer Web 2.0-style functionality for staffing-specific websites. InsidersReferral.com Inc.'s job site Jobirn (jobirn.com) hooks up candidates, employers and recruiters via IM rather than conventional but slower e-mail. ""A lot of deals should be done interactively,"" says Bruce Ge, founder and CEO of the company. ""Instead of sending e-mails, they should send instant messages.""TheCareerMole.com sets up a channel for current employees to mentor candidates and provide information about company culture and jobs. ""Opening new lines of communication between potential candidates and small companies has a significant impact on candidate experience and conversion rates,"" says director Oliver Perry. Candidates who know what's expected of them and what life in the company might really be like tend to be easier to hire and perform better.The mushrooming of Web 2.0 technologies coupled with employers' heightened understanding of how to use these tools to find and hire attractive employees promises to radically reshape the recruiting landscape, say fans like Throckmorton. ""There's never been a better way to proactively go out and find and hire people you think are a good fit for your position.""Cost represents a major attraction. ""You really can't get any more cost-effective than web recruiting,"" says Caren Goldberg, an American University HR researcher. During its introductory phase, Jobirn charges nothing, and LinkedIn only charges for sending e-mails to candidates. Many other sites, such as Twitter, are ad-supported.The prices are especially compelling compared to recruiters' fees for successful placements. ""Facebook and LinkedIn don't charge 20 to 30 percent fees if you hire someone,"" Swartz says. ""Some recruiters may hunt me down for saying this, but in this economy, everybody needs to be watching the bottom line.""The ability to search through resume-like job histories on LinkedIn, blogs, social networking sites and other Web 2.0 resources offers employers some appealing new communication and research channels, to be sure. But Web 2.0 recruiting has a few rough edges, as well. For one thing, Ge reports that his initial plan to emphasize employee referrals on Jobirn suffered when he realized that more recruiters were joining than employees. ""When we launched the site, we thought there ought to be a lot of employees signing up for referrals,"" Ge says. ""But it turns out we got more recruiters.""Referrals can work if employers encourage employees to post information about job duties and corporate culture, says Perry. ""If your employees are your biggest assets, why not leverage them to help you differentiate your company and attract and recruit future talent?"" That's what Swartz does, urging employees to create blog entries about Marcel Media, which earns more than $3 million in annual sales, plastering the company website with employee comments and even placing podcasts of company news on the website.Another problem is that popular sites like Facebook, LinkedIn and MySpace are designed for person-to-person networking, not job recruiting. These sites rely on e-mail, which is slower and less interactive than IM, Ge says. ""Even though Twitter offers [real-time] messaging, people get a lot of noise. On Jobirn, everything is about the job.""Relying heavily on Web 2.0 recruiting can also hamstring efforts to recruit a diverse work force. For instance, notes Goldberg, if you use Web 2.0 technologies to recruit minority or older workers, their lower rates of computer ownership and internet usage will make them harder to find, not easier. Likewise, top executives are probably not best recruited using a Web 2.0 strategy. ""If it's a vice president or senior vice president, the likelihood we're going to find someone who's a good fit isn't as high when you're using these social networking tools,"" Throckmorton says.Ultimately, no one sees Web 2.0 as a substitute for human recruiters and interviewers. ""It cannot and will not ever replace face-to-face conversation,"" Swartz says. ""It should and can only be used to cast the net wider to find more qualified individuals who have a better understanding of what you're looking for and to get a better understanding of who they are.""As various services enter the world of Web 2.0 recruiting, including some that were never designed for that kind of work, Swartz is excited about the concept of ""cloud recruiting."" ""That's the ability to leverage all Web 2.0 opportunities at the same time,"" he says.Until then, the Web 2.0 recruiting pioneers will find a slightly clunky but, according to fans, highly effective and little-populated world of recruitment strategies. But it may not be thinly peopled for long. Says Goldberg, ""Given that it comes at a very low cost and does have such a strong influence on attitudes toward the organization and intentions to pursue employment, organizations would be foolish not to make this part of their recruiting package.""Mark Henricks writes on business and technology for leading publications and is author of Not Just a Living.",Growth Strategies,2009-01-21 00:00:00
/article/199676,You Lost Me at Hello,"You may be in the interviewer's seat, but keep in mind that you need to make a good first impression, too.","						This story appears in the February 2009 issue of Entrepreneur. Subscribe  I hate interviewing, so much so that I stayed at my previous dead-end job too long just to avoid the trauma. I hate being judged so intimately--from every word I speak to the outfit I'm wearing. However, through my now-numerous interviewing experiences, I've come to realize that I can just as easily be the judge of my interviewer and what the interview says about the company.First, there are the seemingly small things. When I come in for an interview and a company doesn't validate my parking, it usually indicates to me that it's not very financially stable. When they don't offer me a drink or bathroom break during a lengthy interview or series of interviews, I get the impression they don't care or provide for their employees. If my interviewer is late to interview me and seems to be looking at my resume for the first time, it's a clue that the company is somewhat hectic and unorganized. And if the interviewer isn't enthused about the company mission or work responsibilities, then how can I be?A big red flag is if an interview is too easy. This is usually a sign that the company doesn't have a high standard for its employees--that almost anyone walking in off the street could get the job--and that my coworkers wouldn't be able to teach me anything I didn't already know. The extreme example for me was an interviewer who spent most of the time trying to convince me the company was legit, followed by a few questions such as, ""What do your parents do for a living?"" and ""How many brothers and sisters do you have?"" At the end of the short interview, I was offered a job on the spot. The level of desperation was obvious.On the opposite end of the spectrum, brutal interviews also make a bad impression. I've had one too many situations where interviewers seemed out to prove they were smarter than me. They appeared to take pleasure in stumping me with questions that I'm pretty sure I wouldn't need to know to be successful at my job. It's also a big turnoff realizing I would have to work with these competitive egomaniacs.For my current job, the interviewer asked me a lot of difficult questions, but none that were unfair. While I couldn't answer many of his questions, the manner in which he asked them gave me the impression he wasn't trying to stump me; instead, he was just trying to get an idea of my skill level. I was also convinced that he was very knowledgeable and I could learn a lot by working with him. In the end, this positive interview experience convinced me to accept this job over other competitive offers, and I've been happy with my decision ever since.If you're an employee or know an employee who wants to vent about or praise anemployer anonymously, e-mail us at employeex@entrepreneur.com.",Growth Strategies,2009-01-21 00:00:00
/article/199680,CEO Salaries in the Crosshairs,Pay-for-performance structures are enjoying a resurgence.\r\n,"						This story appears in the February 2009 issue of Entrepreneur. Subscribe  Last September, Mission Research formed a compensation committee to discuss capping executive pay and by how much.Charlie Crystle, co-founder of the 35-employee Lancaster, Pennsylvania, software company, would like to see executive pay limited to seven times the company's median salary, which hovers around $60,000. Mission Research generated $3 million in revenue last year. ""We're trying to figure out the right mix of goals and bonuses for our executive team,"" says Crystle, 41. ""It's part of our growing up and becoming a real company."" Mission Research plans to implement a new compensation structure early this year.It's a timely move given recent public rage over executive pay. Anger has been simmering for years, but it boiled over last fall amid the taxpayer-funded bailout of the financial sector. Watching CEOs glide away from failed companies with multimillion-dollar severance packages has the public questioning with renewed vigor whether corporate executives are worth what they're paid.In 2007, the salaries of S&P 500 CEOs averaged $10.5 million--that's 344 times the pay of the average U.S. worker, according to the 2008 CEO compensation report from United for a Fair Economy. Congress is considering a variety of measures, including pay caps on public companies and ""say on pay"" legislation that lets shareholders vote on executive pay packages.""The pressure on improving pay for performance will be immense over the next couple of years,"" says Paul Hodgson, a senior research associate at governance research firm The Corporate Library. Topping its most recent CEO pay survey is Oracle CEO Larry Ellison, who made almost $193 million last year and incited shareholder anger when he received a 38 percent pay increase.Some CEOs are voluntarily limiting their pay. Since 2004, at least 62 CEOs have signed agreements accepting cuts in pay or forgoing severance packages when times get tough, according to The Corporate Library. The list includes H&R Block CEO Russ Smyth, who has agreed to a pay cut if the company hits tough times. JetBlue Airways CEO David Barger, meanwhile, accepted half pay last summer when the company instituted a hiring freeze.Mike Lapham, the project director of the Responsible Wealth project, suggests entrepreneurs link their pay clearly to stock price, sales, net income or other performance measures. These ""golden parachutes"" of financial protection could be off limits, though: An October Syzygy Consulting Group survey found that median total cash compensation and stock option holdings for CEOs at private companies fell 8.7 percent and 4.2 percent, respectively, in 2008, but there's been no change in their severance packages.Crystle is glad Mission Research decided to revamp its compensation structure: ""It's good to get stuff in place now because it can easily get away from you.""Chris Penttila is a freelance journalist whose work has also appeared in The Costco Connection, Oregon Business magazine, QSR Magazine, TheStreet.com and other publications.

Subscribe  When you're a startup entrepreneur, the people you work with are some of your most valuable assets. Your team motivates you when you're down, shares their experiences when you need new strategies and partners with you when you're looking to open new markets.Your challenge is to motivate and inspire all your workers, many of whom may not be full-time employees. You also need independent contractors and consultants to meet your clients' expectations. Your success depends on how well you focus their attention on your requirements and leverage their limited time and resources to benefit your business.People invest more in their work when they believe that their contributions are valued and they share in the reward of a job well done. It's vital that your team members feel as though their opinions matter and they have a stake in your company's success. Keep them motivated by discovering what's truly important to them and incorporating that into your business plan. Here's how:1. Set specific expectations with the input of team members. You'll achieve the best results when people have a clear understanding of what's expected of them. Motivate team members by giving them a sense of importance; encourage them to provide input on decisions that directly affect them. Ask them to define their expected outcomes and come up with an action plan to achieve them. Their participation will improve your business and increase their commitment level. When workers ""own"" a specific project, they're often galvanized to go the extra mile to make sure it succeeds.2. Encourage collaboration. Promote teamwork by fostering communication. All business models and strategies are unproven until they're tested. Your team members are experts in their areas. Allow them to collectively improve your business acumen by sharing success stories and new strategies. Developing and testing unique solutions bands people together and makes your team stronger.3. Provide space to innovate. People get excited when they learn new skills or methods to achieve success. Arrange a luncheon so your team can connect with each other and discuss how best to achieve your company's goals. This sets a solid foundation for your team to approach new challenges together. Let your team have creative time without you; your strong personality could stifle originality. When people are part of a solution, they're more inspired to make sure it works.4. Share information when you know it. People feel they're an important part of your business and vested in its success when they're kept in the loop. Let them know, as specifically as possible, how their actions, industry trends and outside events affect your business. The more upfront you are, the more they'll feel committed to your success.

/answer/221832,Can I withhold a final check from an employee who quit with no notice?,,"																																	No you may not legally do this. Federal law requires you to pay every employee for all hours worked. Regarding state employment laws, even if you do not live in an employment-at-will state, no law requires employees to give you notice when they want to quit.
The most you can do to reduce the possibility of this occurring is to have promulgated policies in place that specify that accrued, unused vacation/sick time that might otherwise be paid upon termination may be withheld if proper working notice is not given by the departing employee.

/answer/221828,How do I choose the best health insurance provider for a company of 50 employees?,,"																																	The best thing to do is ask other human resource professionals for referrals to insurance brokers who have served their companies well. Do you belong to a local chapter of the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM)? If not, visit www.SHRM.org to find a local chapter.  There will be human resource professionals in the local chapter who know the best local brokers for companies your size. If this isn't possible, talk with the financial managers at other companies and ask them for referrals.
Ask the first broker you contact for what he needs on an employee census in order to put together his recommendations for you--it's all very standard information, such as employees' age, sex, ZIP code, family vs.  single coverage, etc. It isn't necessary to provide names on this census. The carriers use the data to determine how many of each category you will most likely be insuring so that they can quote rates on the different medical coverage plans that they offer. Most carriers offer a PPO, a POS, and many also offer high-deductible plans with a health savings plan option, and HMOs. So the broker should  provide you with a spreadsheet showing the various plans and carrier choices available.
I recommend that you ask three brokers for their quotes and do a comparison between the spreadsheets they present to you. Ask plenty of questions and check references. Talk with clients that are a similar size to your company so that you know the kind of service the broker gives. The odds are that you will find the best plans and services using this methodology.

You hired highly skilled employees. They are your most essential assets and are fundamental to the profitability and viability of your company. You need to enlist their help to succeed.Accordingly, one of the crucial questions to ask yourself, especially during these times of significant economic distress, is: ""How can I maximize employees' contributions to the achievement of our company goals?""In addition to undertaking an annual--or better yet, a semi-annual--review of their progress and performance, meet with your employees and encourage them to discuss the next year's resolutions. The goal of this process is to encourage employees to reflect upon their performance and find ways to integrate themselves more fully into the success of the business, which then generally evolves into their success, too.So here they are: 10 employee management resolutions and discussion topics--suggestions you can offer your staff to guide them toward a higher level of productivity:I will work smarter. Can you identify three things you can do to be more efficient and effective in your current job? Is your staff spending too much time on e-mail, for example? Too much time returning phone calls? Does it interrupt their work too frequently? Sometimes, those job inefficiencies are not very obvious. However, if they can specifically identify them, then those inefficiencies can be eliminated and staff can become more productive. This can increase work satisfaction as well.I will increase my working network in and out of my immediate area and inside and outside my company. Can you encourage your staff to get to know more people? Can you meet more people not just to say hello, but to find out what they do, how they do it and what skills they use to be productive? Let them know about your traits, abilities and interests, too. Ask yourself if you can you interact with them to mutually benefit both your jobs. Can you include them in your circle of contacts so that you can call on them when you need a favor, a contact, or a reference? The reverse should be true as well.I will find three things that I can do to make myself irreplaceable. Why should the company continue to employ you? Why are you good at what you do? Does the company know this? What else should the company know about you? In times of layoffs or terminations, why should the company keep you while dismissing others? If you cannot answer these questions during economic hard times, in particular, your name could easily be included in any ""termination group.""I will find ways to get along better with my boss and colleagues. Manage upward. If your boss is not managing you well enough or to your liking, then find positive, non-complaining ways to change this situation so that you are able to share your views with him or her. Do you need more (or less) direction, supervision, freedom, responsibility or authority? What can colleagues be doing more of, less of or doing differently to create a more positive working environment that meets organizational goals? Speak up and make sure your voice is heard.I will join at least one company-wide task force or committee. Do people outside of your immediate group, team or unit know your capabilities, interests and skills? Do you know what is happening in other sectors of our company? Do you know the challenges and opportunities faced by people elsewhere in our organization? By joining committees, you not only gain a broader view of the company's goals and issues, you also challenge your own skills, abilities, and knowledge and increase your networking impact.I will join a professional organization in my area. Life and work are about growing and developing yourself. What have you done for yourself lately? Have you met like-minded colleagues who share some of your hopes, dreams, and goals? Do not miss this important opportunity to learn more about your profession while increasing the breadth and depth of your networking circle.I will take a job-related self-improvement seminar. Are there new techniques, tools and concepts that you need to know about to constantly make yourself into a more important and irreplaceable employee? When is the last time you stimulated your own thinking and gained new perspectives on your job and future? A seminar may very well be the stimulus you need to re-energize yourself and increase your job satisfaction.I will develop four goals to help me grow and develop as a more achievement-oriented employee. Stagnation is the kiss of death in today's corporate economy, where layoffs and downsizing occur daily. So, think seriously about what you can do to be more achievement-oriented in addition to taking a seminar and joining a professional group. Do you want to assume more responsibility in your job? Form or chair a taskforce? Rethink and improve a product, policy, or procedure? Create monthly, open-door meetings with the boss. Be creative.I will evaluate my personal contribution to this organization. List three strengths and three limitations to your overall progress. Identify ways to improve on all six, including what you will need from your direct supervisor or other administrators to help move you along the roadway to success.I will try to improve my relationship with at least one person with whom I do not get along. Take the initiative; meet with him or her and discuss the issues, whether overt or subtle, that prevent you from having positive interactions. Remember that your goal as an employee is to make the best of your talents, create synergies with colleagues and increase the productivity and effectiveness of the company.

/answer/221797,How can I improve my interview skills with HR?,,"																																	There are a lot of people right now in a similar situation--and more will be facing it in the coming months. First off, there are plenty of books, resources, tapes and materials out there for people who don't interview well. Find them and read them. 
Very simply, some people don't interview well, while other people simply aren't the right fit for a company's particular culture. 
A bigger issue for you is knowing how you actually come across in interviews. You might want to go back and simply ask what wasn't right or how you can improve--because if you don't get that feedback or don't know what is ""off""--you'll never truly learn how to fix or correct it.
Know also that people at the top are constantly looking for feedback and ways to strengthen their weaknesses and learn better techniques and strategies to communicate better--because better communication leads to better results. And if the pros can do that--you can, too.													Brad SugarsBrad Sugars is the founder and chairman of ActionCOACH.

/answer/221779,"In a week where a holiday falls on a Thursday, and that Friday is not available for work, should overtime be paid for hours worked over 32, since that was all that was available to work that week?",,"																																	In responding to your question, I am assuming that your company is not unionized and that you have no contract in effect with your workforce that requires you to do more than follow prevailing labor laws.  
The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) specifies that hours worked over 40 in any one workweek must be paid at time and one-half. While some states have more stringent pay laws in effect (e.g., time and one-half paid for hours worked over eight in a day), neither federal or state laws require that an employer pay overtime for hours worked over 32 in a workweek regardless of the amount of time otherwise available in that workweek.
Paying overtime kicks in after 40 hours in one workweek have been worked.

/answer/221774,"I pay my employees for the holiday, but do I have to pay them for the day after the holiday if we are closed?",,"																																	My guess is that you do not have a legal obligation. However, Penny Morey, our Human Resources Consultant, and/or Nina Kaufman, our Business Attorney, can give you the facts about your legal obligation. With that said, I still want to answer your question because I think that there are factors beyond your legal obligation that should be considered before you decide whether or not to pay for the days off.
Conflict is my area of expertise and I know that underneath almost every human conflict someone feels dismissed, discounted, disenfranchised or disrespected. What you do and what you say will be quickly forgotten. What others will remember is how your actions and your words made them feel. If there is a way for you to avoid paying your employees without instilling dismissed, discounted, disenfranchised or disrespected feelings, that would be great. I just don't know if that is possible.  
In a perfect world, each employee would simply be grateful for having both a job and a day off. But, the world is not perfect. Your employees are likely living pay-check-to-pay-check, budgeting themselves for 40-hour paychecks. And, the holiday season is probably their most challenging and expensive time of year.  
Before you decide what to do, please ask yourself the following questions: How much will a potential conflict cost you? How much does it cost to buy employee loyalty? How much will a disgruntled employee cost you in customer service? Are you prepared for the repercussions of failing to pay for the holiday? How much time will staff members spend sitting around grumbling about the missed pay?
If you decide to pay the employees, please make sure to take advantage of this ""PR"" opportunity. Let the employees know that you value each of them and that even though the extra pay is a sacrifice for this young business you are committed to them and so you are going to go the extra mile to make their holidays better.  
So, what will you do?  Please let me know													Elinor RobinElinor Robin, ""The Relationship Mediator,"" has more than 18 years of experience in mediation while working within the public and private sectors.Read more",Growth Strategies,2008-12-03 18:48:00
/answer/221769,"As a salaried employee, am I obligated to start working weekends and holidays with no comp time?",,"																																	Your employer and you are using the word ""salaried"" as meaning the same as ""exempt,"" under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). Many employers (and employees) do not differentiate between these two terms and pay errors result.  
A salaried employee can be non-exempt (i.e., covered by the FLSA). This might be the case with you. Without knowing what your job entails, I cannot say; but here is some help in this regard.
If you visit the Department of Labor website (www.DOL.gov), you can see definitions of what constitutes exempt and non-exempt under the FLSA. Click on ""Frequently Asked Questions,"" which should make you feel comfortable because it means that this confusion is widespread.
If your job legitimately is exempt, it is true that you can be expected to work some holidays and/or weekends--if doing so is necessary to accomplish the fundamental job objectives.  
But it sounds to me as though your employer is trying to cover two jobs by requiring you to work in excess of 40 hours all the time and now weekends and holidays, as well.  
Requiring an exempt worker to work specific hours may negate the classification of the job and make it non-exempt. That is, what makes a job exempt from the FLSA is primarily the nature of the work being done and the amount of control the job incumbent has in accomplishing his/her duties. An exempt classification is bestowed to jobs that allow the workers to control their productivity and, therefore, the time devoted to completing their assignments.  
Some examples of types of exempt workers are: executives, administrative employees who exercise independent judgment in carrying out their responsibilities, professionals and employees engaged in certain computer jobs or in outside sales.
If you feel that you should be re-classified and paid overtime for hours worked over 40 in a week (or 8 hours in a day, depending on in what State you work), contact the Department of Labor and report the situation.  They will help you resolve it.

/article/199002,Virtual Office Management Means Effective Communication,Try these helpful strategies and software to better manage employees from afar.,"Bob Dylan had it right when he penned his lyrics ""The times, they are a-changing."" In today's highly competitive world, if entrepreneurs don't catch up or keep up with the latest advances in technology and management, they're doomed to fall behind.A smart move that can save entrepreneurs money--and at the same time implement the latest in technology and management resources--is the virtual office. Very simply, a virtual office is one where employees may no longer be housed on site; in fact, they could be spread across the U.S. or even the world.The term ""virtual conversations"" illustrates the idea perfectly--conversations that take place via instant messaging or on social networking sites such as Facebook, MySpace and chat rooms.In a virtual office, employees work out of their own homes, a rented office space or a larger, shared office building.The virtual office contains a computer, printer and fax machine, among other equipment. Often the computers have webcams which allow video conferencing.For meetings, many employees use software such as GoToMeeting that enables them to see each others' computer screens without leaving their own desks, even if the meeting is taking place thousands of miles away. This way, an individual can work with others and actually share their screen. This helps members linked in to the meeting to view slides or software from various sites. Webinars use this process to reach out to a large number of participants at the same time. In Webinars, meeting attendees can also use their telephones to talk to the presenter or moderator and sometimes to each other. The cost of this equipment is more than offset by the savings realized by not having to pay travel expenses, site rentals or office space rent.What do virtual employees like about this system? Sharyn Katz, accounting manager for Boston Software Systems Inc., in Sherborn, Mass., says, ""I enjoy the independence and freedom of being able to set my own workflow based on the company's needs and priorities.""Certainly, she must be prepared to ""deliver the goods"" when her boss needs them, but she has a great deal of leeway when creating her own schedule. Others say they enjoy not having to report to an office on a regular basis. They can work from their own home or another space. In fact, they can be wherever they like--a client's office, the library, the coffee shop, the beach--wherever they feel content and most productive.Other employees say they enjoy being almost totally responsible for themselves with no boss or supervisor hanging around their desk, looking over their shoulder or pressuring them for work results. Many employees who prefer the independence of working alone in a virtual environment say they're spared the bother, distraction and negative office politics found in the traditional office setting.Deb Beck and Dave Linde, principals of Studio 18 Group in Wellesley, Mass., both say they've benefited from gaining strategic management clients from throughout the U.S. They've accomplished this not through face-to-face business development meetings, but rather by using electronic tools to increase their client base. Finally, virtual employees are spared the expense, frustrations and time loss commuting to a traditional office location.Along with these positive features obviously come negative ones. The chief complaint most virtual employees mention is social isolation. There's no water cooler or ""coffee klatch"" for a casual exchange of comments, work-related or not. They can't simply walk down the corridor to chat with a colleague, even for a few minutes.For these staff members, seeing other employees on a computer or video conferencing screen simply does not replace personal contact. As for time off, those without firm personal or professional boundaries can end up spending much of their non-work hours back at their desk, pounding out more work and forgetting about the importance of work-life balance.Another drawback is that it's too easy to start work late, run an errand or find a distraction rather than doing one's work. Frequently, these behaviors are a means of compensating for the lack of having other people to interact with.A further disadvantage of a virtual office when compared to a traditional one is that in a conventional office, if employees need additional guidance or direction on a project or task, they can simply walk down the hall to speak with someone. In the virtual office, it sometimes takes more time to get information, especially when the key person, or an alternate, isn't available.Given these positive and negative factors, what caveats exist for the effective entrepreneur who wants to create a virtual office?First, hire the right people. This is true in any company, but even more so in the virtual one. Deb Beck of Studio 18 Group says that successful virtual employees are ""self-starters and self-disciplined--it's definitely lonely working in a vacuum, and they need to be able to deal with this."" Katz echoes Beck, saying that effective virtual employees, ""need to connect with other outside communities,"" not just the virtual work environment they're in.The virtual leader needs to have the utmost trust in new hires. The leader will not physically see or interact with employees as easily as in a traditional company. Therefore, business owners in these settings must have an extremely high level of confidence in their employees. Employees need to be exceedingly self-reliant and committed to the task and the organization; self-motivated to work independently and without much supervision; and dedicated to the success of their work. Productivity, self-efficiency and autonomy are essential.Even though virtual employees need to be self-reliant and self-directed, the effective virtual entrepreneur needs to set realistic benchmarks and check-in times. To be able to manage someone from a remote location you must have some type of criteria to measure progress and success; e.g., total contacts made or total widgets produced. Some leaders reserve a particular time of the day or week for call-ins or staff meetings, using GoToMeeting or video-conferencing products.Communication needs to be sufficient, frequent and intense enough to satisfy both the employer and the employee. Many set interim deadlines for projects so there are no surprises or gaps. Some, like Boston Software Systems, Inc., organize regional or national retreats once or twice a year. The purpose of these get-togethers is varied: opportunities for social interaction with employees who may never have met or who need to get to know each other; management and productivity purposes to discuss and improve processes, policies and procedures; information sharing; and creating a sense of unity, team building and esprit de corps.A virtual office in this era of cost-cutting can save you a great deal of money. However, the prospective virtual entrepreneur needs to enter into this state-of-the-art management concept with goals of hiring the most appropriate employees and creating a fail-safe process.Dr. David G.

/answer/221731,Can I ask for details regarding an employee's note from a doctor?,,"																																	Are you capable of understanding medical terms to use a more detailed doctor's note for anything substantive. or will you will only create accusations of unfair treatment when you ask one employee for more details but not another?
Your outdated policy puts you in the position of deciding whose reasons for absence are legitimate. When an employee is out frequently enough, he or she cannot do his or her job adequately to meet the needs of the company. Update to a no-fault absenteeism policy which allows each employee to miss a specific amount of time for illness or personal reasons each fiscal year.
While you may still require the doctor's note when three or more consecutive days are missed for purported illness, you will also have a set limit in place. When an employee consumes his or her allotted time off at such a rate as to indicate that he or she likely will exceed the number of days allowed or when a certain percentage of allotted time off is taken, issue a warning.
Then, terminate those employees who surpass the number of days allowed. This will most likely rid you of the employees with chronic attendance issues sooner vs. later.
If an employee has a serious, legitimate illness, he or she will most likely provide much more detailed information without prompting, and you can determine how to deal with him or her most fairly utilizing family medical leave or personal unpaid leave of absence, or whatever applies to your size and type of business.

Without knowing in which state your company operates, I cannot answer your question with absolute certainty. However, I can say that in most states, if he has been returned to work by his primary physician or specialist without restrictions that would preclude him from safely doing his former job (i.e., without likely re-injury to himself or injury to others), the answer would be yes, you are required to give him his original job back--or to give him a job with the same pay level as he was earning before his injury occurred.

/article/198178,Entrepreneurs Need Social Networking,"Dan Schawbel, a leading expert in social networking and a Gen-Y branding expert, explains what business owners need to know about the trend.","Free Webinar | August 16thFind out how to optimize your website to give your customers experiences that will have the biggest ROI for your business.							Register Now  Business people across industries and up and down organizational charts are buzzing about the merits of social networking. To gather state-of- the-art information about this timely topic, I interviewed an expert in the field. Dan Schawbel is a leading personal branding expert for Gen-Y and the author of the upcoming book Me 2.0: Build a Powerful Brand to Achieve Career Success. His Personal Branding Blog is ranked among the top 50 marketing blogs in the world by AdAge. Dan is currently a social media specialist for EMC Corp.David Javitch: Can you tell me about the trend that has employers hiring employees to take on social networking duties?Dan Schawbel: It's a major trend that's been growing significantly, especially in the past three years. Conversations are happening and they'll happen with or without you; your choice is whether to participate or ignore this technological tidal wave. Due to the current economy, there are clear restraints on marketing budgets, so free social marketing is the best alternative. As companies grow and social networking continues to expand, the entrepreneurial boss simply cannot devote all of the time needed for a successful effort. He or she needs to hire someone else dedicated to assume this responsibility. This person will be the internal community manager who will create, monitor and transfer information about the company between and among employees who have a voice and can influence or build the corporate brand.Externally, the community manager will reach out to current and potential customers. This person will spark interactive conversations, market products or services, and invite responses. In terms of public relations, this social media maven will protect and promote the company's brand with customers and future employees, and help with the corporate blog and social network strategy.Javitch: What's the benefit of hiring an employee who manages the business's Facebook, MySpace, LinkedIn and other social networking accounts?Schawbel: When it comes to social networks, readers have a high expectation that sites will be refreshed and updated often and on a regular basis. As I said, the entrepreneur doesn't have time for this, yet the responsibility is overwhelming, so someone needs to do this. This employee needs to be a content producer, presenting current data, information, or video for weekly visitors to the site. The community manager does more than simply create a site; he or she needs to work hard to make it an attractive, interactive community where readers will consistently go and encourage their friends, social groups, and networks to go as well. The major benefit here is that this network employee will reach out and interactively communicate with various communities; the business owner simply will not have time to do this successfully.Javitch: Can you list what social networking a small business should be doing now?Schawbel: Small businesses should at least be involved in the largest social networks, belong to forums and have at least one blog. Each of these websites is a way of positioning yourself and your company to the world. You can create a video, respond to questions or problems or start a discussion. For instance, when someone joins your Facebook group, the word spreads virally through that person's newsfeed. Remember, people want to join groups; they want to meet people and buy products or services based on their friends' recommendations.Setting a Google Alert for your name and company's name is highly encouraged. When someone blogs about you, your company, or your products and services, you'll be notified immediately through either e-mail or RSS [feed]. Then you can use their name to get back to them for further interactive communication.You also need a profile page on Facebook. It will tell readers about your company, people, service or product. Remember, people are searching for information; give them what they're asking for. And above all, the process is free; the only cost is your time.Javitch: Do the different sites require one ""community networking"" employee to manage? Or does it also work to spread out such duties among many employees?Schawbel: If you're Coca-Cola, then you need a team. If you're a sole practitioner, you have to do it yourself. However, whether you have five or 50 employees, delegate the responsibilities. Let's say you have three people you trust as social networkers; you can have individuals responsible for specific sites. But you have to make sure you don't dilute the message or cause repetition of effort with several people creating different versions of the same data. This delegation of responsibilities needs to be properly coordinated.Javitch: What ""bare bones"" networking should small-business owners be doing on their own (if they can't hire someone to do it for them) that will help them market their business?Schawbel: Small-business owners should get involved in social sites like LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube or Friendfeed. They need to go where the people are to promote themselves, recruit and maintain a relationship with specific communities, while obtaining new customers and building bigger communities. They need to draw accounts into their world. Above all, the owner must have specific goals in mind in order to strategize about what he or she wants to get out of these efforts. Is it to increase business by 500 more customers? Increase visibility? Sell more products or services? Without specific goals, the owner won't be able to determine if the social networking process was a success or a failure.While getting on these social sites, business owners must protect their name so no one else can use it. This includes claiming your identity on social sites before competitors do or people with the same name do. These sites have a high Google PageRankT, which means they'll appear in the top results when someone Googles your name or your company's name.Javitch: Can you break down which blogs, FaceBook, Twitter, MySpace, etc., are most popular to the separate generations? Business owners who target a certain age market need to know which social network to invest time in.Schawbel: MySpace has over 185 million users, split evenly between men and women 14 to 34 years old. Twenty-five percent of them are in the U.S. FaceBook has over 110 million readers, more women than men. The majority of these users--80 percent--are under 30 years old and half of all FaceBookers are located in the U.S., Great Britain and Canada.LinkedIn has over 26 million readers, with the average age being 41. Men make up 64 percent of the audience. Their average household income is $109,000. Twitter has 3 million readers, two-thirds of whom are men 18 to 34 years old.Armed with this information, marketers can more effectively target specific age, income and geographic groups.Dr. David G.

/answer/221706,We're software developers. We've just hired a contractor at a generous hourly rate. He wants paid lunches.,,"																																	I agree with your take on this request 100 percent, and I have personally used dozens of highly skilled technical contractors over the years, worked with a wide variety of contactors and even served as a contractor. It is NOT the norm for a contractor to be paid for his/her lunch or break times.
You are paying this individual to do specific work at a set rate per hour because he has expertise that you need on a temporary basis. You are not his employer. He is asking for a non-industry-standard perk that is not in line with users of contract labor.
It is possible that he is new to being a contractor and does not really understand what the role is and what it is not. I hope you have a solid contract in place with him and are careful to abide by the IRS rules regarding this individual.
Otherwise, you might discover that he expects other non-standard considerations when his contract ends. (For example, it is not uncommon for a worker whose contract period has ended to apply for nemployment insurance benefits with a state agency. Then, when officials do not find any earnings reported for the worker, an investigation ensues. For misclassifications, the payouts most often involve benefits and lost wages including unpaid overtime.)
Contractors should all have specific self-determining kinds of work to do, normally in a finite time period, with defined deliverables, using their own place of work, and so forth. If you look at Section Two of the IRS Publication 15-A, you will see exactly what the IRS considers when determining whether a worker is an employee or an independent contractor (i.e., 1099 worker).
In addition, the IRS will help an organization free of charge to determine the appropriate classification for a worker or group of workers in the organization as regards federal law. To obtain that service, you simply complete and submit IRS Form SS-8 to the IRS. However, your state may have more or different requirements.

/answer/221705,Do you have the right to ask a manager to give you a reason for calling you in to have a private meeting?,,"																																	You can always ask why; but the real question I think is whether management is required to respond to your query in order to require your cooperation. And unless you are covered under a union contract that specifies differently, the answer to that question is: No, it is not. 
That is, management has a right to demand your cooperation regarding a meeting at any time for any reason during hours for which you are being paid your normal rate. Management is not required to provide you with a reason for taking away your hours or for your attendance at a meeting.
Good management practices might indicate that it SHOULD tell you why your hours were given to someone else and the reason you are being told to report to a private meeting.

""Gas is an expense that is really eating away at a lot of their incomes,"" says Long, 43.Responding to the gas price crisis is important to employers, as the Society for Human Resource Management discovered in its recent survey: Forty-two percent of the survey respondents said they have raised their mileage reimbursement policies to the IRS maximum, and 26 percent now offer a flexible work schedule.Carefully determine the best options to offer your employees, says David Lewis, president of OperationsInc, an HR outsourcing and consulting firm.

So we encourage those things that will help not only [employees physical health, but their emotional well-being, too.""For one employee, the incentive was indeed a pair of cowboy boots; other rewards have included anything from guitar or yoga lessons to time with a personal trainer and even paid time off to build orphanages in Central America.

Seventy percent of employees age 18 and older believe incentives such as cash, gifts and extra vacation days would motivate them to participate in their companies' wellness programs and adopt healthier lifestyles, according to a 2007 survey of nearly 500 employees by The Guardian Life Insurance Company of America.That equates to big savings for U.S. employers, according to The Conference Board, a business research organization.

/article/198084,Board Relations,"When investors ask for a board seat, weigh your options before pulling out the leather chair.","						This story appears in the November 2008 issue of Entrepreneur. Subscribe  Being your own boss may be the essence of entrepreneurship, but that concept is not always compatible with raising money for a growing business. Julia Stamberger, co-founder and president of GoPicnic, knows that from experience: A recent round of capital spurred growth at her fledgling Chicago food-service business, but it also created a board of directors to whom Stamberger, 34, and co-founder Pam Volpe Jelaca, 39, must now look for guidance.GoPicnic sells snack boxes and packaged meals to airlines, corporate clients, school fundraisers, hotels and event planners. The company's gourmet, shelf-stable cuisine and portfolio of high-flying customers attracted several investor groups, including angels. Stamberger says that from the start, the investors insisted on board seats, even though the company did not yet have a board.A board seat is a common investor request, says private equity attorney Sandy Presant, national chairman of the Private Equity Fund Practice and partner at DLA Piper. ""As an investor, I want the right to control how my money is used,"" he says. ""I want financial reporting on a real-time basis, and I want to be consulted for changes in the business plan."" Presant helps entrepreneurs and investors negotiate the tricky business of board formation and seat allocation. He says land mines exist for both parties: Investors may shy away from the liability associated with board seats (an important issue that should be adequately addressed by the company's insurance), and entrepreneurs naturally scoff at giving up too much control.""The entrepreneur has to be concerned about paralyzing his company,"" says Presant. ""The [level of] control you give to an investor should not [exceed] day-to-day decisions. We call this 'paperclip approval.'"" Having to seek investor approval for every decision is not good for the business and is ultimately dangerous for both the investor and the entrepreneur.If granting a board seat does not suit the situation, Presant recommends more flexible alternatives: Investors could get the information they need as ""board observers"" without assuming any actual liability for decision making. Nervous entrepreneurs might also avoid the whole board experience by entering into simpler contractual relationships with investors. Says Presant, ""A joint venture or partnership agreement can accomplish many of the same things.""At GoPicnic, the founders accepted their investors' terms and granted them two board seats. While there are certainly drawbacks, Stamberger says she now sees the benefits of having a board to report to each quarter: It keeps her focused on key metrics. ""The financial reporting they look for [is] not mandated by any other part of your business,"" she says. ""It's great to have the discipline [of briefing a board]. It prioritizes things that are essential for your business.""Beyond the discipline, Stamberger says her board contributes advice and experience. Because board members are compensated by the gains on their investments--rather than salaries or fees--she says they are her best source for cost-effective help and insight.The most effective boards include a mix of investors, founders and outside directors. Three, five or seven total members helps avoid deadlocked decisions. A small, balanced board provides the agility and skill set needed to contribute to a growing company.Along with balance, flexibility is the hallmark of a good board/entrepreneur relationship. Stamberger notes that as her business grows, she hopes to tap into the experience and expertise of the new board members. ""A board is useful structurally,"" she says. ""If you have good relationships, and they are aligned in helping you run the company, then it's to everyone's advantage.""",Growth Strategies,2008-10-15 00:00:00
/article/198112,Pay for Performance,Variable pay plans can save you money--and your employees may prefer them.,"						This story appears in the November 2008 issue of Entrepreneur. Subscribe  When David Hayes offered employees the chance to take lower salaries in exchange for potentially higher bonuses based on performance, he wasn't sure how they'd take it. But when 75 percent of the eligible workers at Skyline Construction in San Francisco opted for the lowest salary combined with the highest bonus, Hayes had his answer. ""It was incredibly well-received,"" says the 44-year-old founder and CEO. It helped Skyline, too: After two years, sales had climbed from $36 million to $71 million, while costs as a percentage of sales shrank. This year, the company projects sales of more than $100 million.Pay for performance is a growing phenomenon, according to a Hewitt Associates study that found employee pay raises inching up an average of 3.8 percent in 2008, maintaining the tepid growth of the last few years. Bonuses based on performance, meanwhile, were set to hit a record high this year of 12 percent, as a percentage of payroll, up from 8.8 percent in 2003. Ninety percent of companies offer at least one broad-based variable pay plan, Hewitt found, up from 80 percent in 2006 and 51 percent in 1991.Cash-strapped companies unable to afford big raises can use pay for performance to single out their most valuable workers so they can be recognized, rewarded, motivated and retained, explains Manny Avramidis, senior vice president of global human resources at the American Management Association. ""It is truly a differentiator in tight times to recognize individuals and pay them a little more than the average. The attention goes a long way, and it's really a cheap way to show that you care.""If you don't do pay for performance correctly, however, it can work against you. Entrepreneurs must make sure they don't inadvertently reward employees for the wrong thing. For instance, if you base bonuses on annual sales, employees may push sales into this year at the expense of next year. ""You run the risk that they're selling the future,"" Avramidis says. You may also alienate employees who feel their bonuses are endangered because other members aren't pulling their weight.To avoid problems, make sure your plan fits your goals and that you carefully define performance. Team-based companies, for instance, should reward teams rather than individuals. To keep employees from selling the future, consider dual programs that reward for one-, two- or three-year periods. Monitor results and tweak plans as you go. Hayes spent most of the first two years modifying various details before he got big dividends.Next, Hayes hopes to expand pay for performance beyond sales and project management employees to operations personnel. That will require new ways to measure performance, but he's anxious to get the rest of his 67 employees on a similar pay schedule. Says Hayes, ""We're hoping to capture that same lightning in a bottle on the operational side.""Mark Henricks writes on business and technology for leading publications and is author of Not Just a Living.",Growth Strategies,2008-10-15 00:00:00
/answer/221678,Am I legally bound to give employees an annual review?,,"																																	First, we should clarify your terms. I think you are using the term ""annual review"" to mean salary increase--versus an evaluation of an individual's job performance. 
While you must at least pay minimum wage pursuant to the federal Fair Labor Standards Act or your own state's minimum-wage law--whichever is higher--unless you have a contract with an employee specifically stating that he or she will be given a salary increase on specific dates or at designated intervals, you have no legal obligation to bump up anyone's salary.
However, if the company cannot afford to give salary increases, it is still important to conduct performance evaluations on time so that employees know where they stand concerning their job accomplishments and that their efforts are appreciated. 
It is prudent to proactively develop and communicate information about the ""salary freeze"" as soon as management realizes it is necessary. Even major companies have instituted such measures when times are hard. 
Sometimes they push annual merit or cost of living increases from 12 months to 18 months. Sometimes, they simply announce that the salary freeze will be in effect until further notice. 
It is important for everyone to understand the situation and to be assured that the salary freeze policy is being fairly administered across the board. In bad times, clear communication is even more vital than during a favorable business climate.

/answer/221675,Can an employer require a doctor's note with a diagnosis on it?,,"																																	An employer can require a doctor's note with a diagnosis if there is a good business reason for doing so. Are there written rules concerning breaks for smoking or eating concerning frequency and/or duration? If so, he is within his rights to expect you to follow the rules. After all, he needs waiters who are serving his customers.
Perception is the issue here, I suspect. He may not notice the smokers. Maybe they are outside the building or otherwise not within his range of vision as much as you are when you eat your snacks. 
If there are no hard and fast rules about breaks and your employer has written you up for snacking, did you and he have a meeting of the minds? That is, did he tell you what it is about your snacking that makes him so upset? Is it the time(s) of day that you snack (e.g., busiest time at the restaurant)? Is it the amount of time you take to consume your snacks? Is it the kind of snacks that you bring to work (e.g., messy, malodorous, from a competitor's eatery)? 
Understanding his point of view might help you figure out a way to minimize his frustration with you and work out a compromise. It sounds to me as though you have told him that you are hypoglycemic--which may be true. But you don't really know, as you have not been diagnosed.
Maybe you should try telling your employer that you cannot afford the clinical testing necessary to provide him with a diagnosis; but you do know from life experience that you need a snack every two hours in order to feel energetic and focused--similar to smokers needing a cigarette every two hours. Ask him if you take no longer than five minutes twice a shift at agreed-upon times to snack, can he accommodate that?
The bottom line is that--depending to some degree on your state's employment laws--if you are not effective in your job, you can be fired. Asking for a doctor's note to substantiate your illness is really giving you a chance to be allowed to break or bend the rules to some degree.

/answer/221674,We don't have an HR professional in our office and we really should. Can you advise on these issues?,,"																																	You are literally between a rock and a hard place. Even if you had an HR professional on board, if the owner of the company does not care to deal with controversy or other matters that might involve confrontation, the HR professional would probably be as frustrated as you obviously are. 
Ethics and good business practices start at the top of any organization; and when the top guy is a coward, his management team will most often be comprised of bullies, which is just another name for mean-spirited cowards.
You can really only govern your own behavior. You might try responding to the manager with whom you have lingering issues with remarks or e-mails that focus on proper professional behavior. You could point out that there might be a better way to instruct, a kinder way to correct, a more polite way to make a request or how nice it would be for her to express appreciation more often, etc. 
But most likely she will not accept such suggestions in a positive way and will likely just target you (the messenger) for even more strident rudeness.
If other employees feel as you do about the current state of affairs, you might ask them to accompany you to present your case to the owner asking for a defined way for the employees to deal with matters that affect morale or effectiveness on the job. 
Gather their ideas, too. Choose a time to present your ideas when the owner is most likely to listen. Have your thoughts in good order regarding what you specifically want to see done differently than in the past. Generalizations will not help the owner understand what you want. 
For example, you might ask if a team could be put together comprising one or two managers plus one or two employees that would meet monthly to address suggestions and/or complaints raised by the general employee population. The make-up of this team could change every six months or so. 
Be as upbeat as you can, versus ultra critical. And do your utmost to leave individual names out of the mix. (He would be superhuman not to be defensive about his girlfriend, for example.)
Be prepared for your co-workers to be apathetic and/or fearful. Jobs are hard to find in these challenging economic times. You might want to consider confidentially looking for a new career spot for yourself. 
Owners--especially those who have their girlfriends running departments in their companies--are not likely to take risks and/or change their way of operating to make the general employee population happier or to make it feel more valued.

Despite such restrictions, employers may still use Social Security numbers in the collection, use or retention of information for verification and administrative reasons. Applications sent by regular mail may include a request for Social Security numbers.

/answer/221668,We need medical benefits for a family of three.,,"																																	There are a number of carriers who are writing medical coverage for people not covered by their employers or who are seeking coverage options for other reasons. 
Some that come to mind are Humana, Aetna, United Health and Blue Cross, but there are others, too. If you do a search on Google, you will see many options pop up. 
As to which is best for you and your family, you have some homework to do unless you know and trust a specific agent who can gather your family information (including statistics such as you provided in the query above) and do the research for you. Even then, he or she will present you with a number of options regarding the types of coverage available (point of service, preferred provider organization, health maintenance organization, high deductible plan coupled with a health savings account), monthly premiums, co-pays, deductibles, and so forth. Plus, if there are doctors you already use and like, check that you will be able to use them without penalty with the specific plan(s) you choose.
Even with COBRA, you may want to look at various options to see if you can reduce the monthly premiums, if that is a factor for you and your family right now. Keep in mind that you only have a specific time in which to opt for COBRA, so based on the age of your son, you need to make your decision relatively soon or lose that opportunity.

/answer/221662,How can we capture our managers' heart and soul in our remote business?,,"																																	No, it's not a great idea--and here s why. What you are doing is giving away dollars to overcome a lack of systems and an absence of company culture in your business. 
First, you should find ways to systemize what you do, which means you need to have an outline of day-to-day activities for each job, as well as expectations and measures of accountability. These metrics, or KPIs
(key performance indicators), serve as a guide and a bonus system for performance--and people only get paid if they perform.
Next, you need to get very clear about the kinds of people you want to hire. Hire for the person and not necessarily the skill. Also, realize that a lack of overall company direction and company culture can be fatal for a business--because if you don't define what your company culture is, your employees or hires will do it for you.
Our company has been very successful in implementing company culture through our ""14 Points of Culture,"" a list of values that help us run our company. Some people leave or are asked to leave because they don't like one or more points of our company culture, but that is fine. 
Our teams all know what is expected of them from both a performance and behavioral standpoint, and it allows us to more fully focus on the tasks at hand, rather than personnel issues.
All the best.

The free speech clause of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution protects people from government regulation of their speech. The same rules don t necessarily apply in the private sector. 
Where the general, constitutional rules of free speech fall can depend on whether your employer is considered a government agency. In addition, you want to look carefully at any employment manual that may have been provided to you. Such manuals tend to set the parameters on what is considered ""political activity."" 
In addition, you'll want to give some thought to whether it really is prudent to disclose your political preferences.

However, seeing as how this person sounds like a potentially problematic type of individual, I think you would be wise to have a human resource professional or a neutral member of management sit in on the review.

/answer/221626,Does my employer have the right to know what I do when I am clocked out?,,"																																	It seems strange if you were the one who reported this past employee's pilfering that they would still see you as potentially untrustworthy. Not very sensible of them if this is true. Are you sure that you are dealing with the facts?
If HR has been informed that you are spending non-work hours with a known thief, it would be right to question your judgment. If the job to which you might be promoted requires good judgment, then officials might see that as a reason not to promote you. 
Unless you are in a unionized environment that has specific seniority guidelines for promotions, the company management can promote whomever it chooses. What you are really asking is not whether your
employer has the right to know what you do when you are clocked out,  but whether management should depend on a rumor in making a decision that affects your career and pay. And the answer to that is that it should not.
Have you told your employer your perspective on this matter? If not, do so calmly and showing that you are sincere. Tell them that you have not been fraternizing with the person in question and that you feel that you have earned their trust and deserve the opportunity for advancement.

/answer/221625,My company refuses to pay for time worked during lunch.,,"																																	If you punch a time clock, I am assuming that you are a nonexempt employee. That means the federal Fair Labor Standards Act and state wage and hour laws also apply to you.
Therefore, you are entitled to be paid for all time worked. You can report not being properly paid to the Department of Labor (DOL). You can obtain the information that you need to do this through a DOL website in most states. Normally, the DOL will see to it that you are promptly and properly paid.
However, a couple of things to consider: Does your company handbook specify that only pre-approved overtime will be paid or that all non-exempt employees must clock out and take a full X minutes for a lunch break? If either is the case, it does not mean that you are not entitled to be paid for the lunch time that you worked. But it does mean that your company management may feel that it has a legitimate reason not to pay you for this ""unauthorized"" work time.
So rather than report the affront to the DOL, you may want to check your employee manual. If you did violate a defined policy, approach this differently. Go to your company management and admit that you did not know about the rule but will abide by it going forward. In the meantime, tell management that you would appreciate being paid for the time that you already worked instead of taking time off for lunch for the days in question.
Keep in mind that determining work hours is the responsibility of company management. You were being unreasonable in thinking that you have the right to simply decide to work more hours and expect management to pay you without prior approval.

/answer/221593,Can we choose to hire a younger person for a bartending position?,,"																																	Unless your union contract states differently (e.g., promotions must be based on seniority), you can select anyone you like for any job for which you feel he or she is qualified. 
However, you do have to be cognizant that people 40 and over are protected underThe Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA). If you employ more than 20 workers, you are subject to the ADEA, which protects individuals who are 40 years of age or older from employment discrimination based on age. 
The ADEA's protections apply to both employees and job applicants. Under the ADEA, it is unlawful to discriminate against a person because of his or her age with respect to any term, condition or privilege of employment--including, but not limited to, hiring, firing, promotion, layoff, compensation, benefits, job assignments and training.
An exception to the above would be allowed if you cite a legitimate, bona fide reason why only someone younger could do the job. This is not likely to be the case in a job in which many workers in this kind of job are older than 40.

/article/196172,What to Do When an Employee Leaves,Use these steps to achieve a smooth transition during employee turnover.,"For the entrepreneur, employee turnover always raises challenges, questions and issues. Employees, of course, leave for many reasons. They're promoted, take a new or ""better"" position, retire--and, yes, sometimes they're terminated.Whatever the cause--even if an employee is asked to leave before the end of the day--it's crucial for you and the direct supervisor to gain as much accurate information as possible about the current status of that employee's plans, activities, communications, upcoming events and obligations.That way, the transition to and startup for the replacement employee or employees avoid many of the obstacles often associated with turnover.1. You'll need to know the answers to at least these three questions:What are the typical tasks and obligations the current employee fulfilled?What are the interactions and outcomes of working with internal and external clients?What are the responsibilities on a daily, weekly, monthly, semi-annual or annual basis?Typical examples are periodic updates, reports, performance appraisals, meetings and phone calls.2. Understand the tasks that the employee performed. Certainly, many of these will be stated in the job description. Often, however, these documents often are not kept up-to-date and may not be informative or helpful. You'll need to know how the employee performs tasks, with whom, with what degree of exactness and with what standard of quality. Additionally, you ought to know who needs to be copied on memos, e-mails, summaries or ""FYIs"" regarding those tasks.3. Identify the key people the employee interacts with. Who are the people who can be trusted or counted on? Who are the ""go to"" individuals or groups, at what level and for what topics, purposes or activities? Whom does the employee go to for permission, input, insight, details, guidance, action or even a strong shoulder to lean on? What are the teams, task forces, committees and other organizations that the departing employee belongs to, leads or needs feedback from? Who relies on the departing employee for advice, input, approval or direction?4. Know how the employee evaluates peers, subordinates and superiors. This will help the replacement employee identify whom to go to for what purposes; whom to trust with what kinds of issues, tasks, and responsibilities; whom to rely on to work on their own without providing structure; whom to provide brief or minimal amounts of structure, follow-up and guidance; whom to offer more structure, follow-up and guidance; and finally, whom to provide considerable amounts of structure, follow-up and guidance.Clearly and understandably, there will be holes in what gets accomplished after the current employee leaves. Ideally, the outgoing employee will have provided sufficient lead time for you and others to deal with the issues that need to be addressed until a replacement is hired.Under the best circumstances, the current employee will remain long enough for the new person to be hired and trained, allowing for a smoother transition. Nonetheless, some degree of uncertainty, lack of effectiveness, efficiency and productivity is unavoidable. The idea, of course, is to minimize these negative effects.Answering the questions and challenges created when an employee leaves your organization will help you tie up loose ends, resolve outstanding issues and prevent gaps in your organization's ongoing productivity. However, these answers should not be used as a ""written in cement"" recipe for the replacement employee's job performance and success. Instead, this information should serve as a roadmap for effectiveness that allows the replacement employee to apply skills, knowledge and experiences to current and future actions.Change brings with it the potential for new opportunities and innovation. You want your new employee to be successful, but you really don't want or expect a clone of the departing individual. This is especially true when it comes to the issue of trust. Each person brings individual abilities, insights and approaches to issues and people. Simply because the departing employee trusted a peer, subordinate or superior doesn't imply or guarantee that the new employee will either trust or distrust a specific individual. Expecting the same behavior can spell defeat of the employee and dissatisfaction for you.The more positively you and others view this change process, and the more you address the challenges inherent in the turnover, the more satisfied and productive the transition will be.Dr. David G.

/answer/221555,Can I request and receive all information in my employee file?,,"																																	Yes. It is well within your rights to see your entire set of employee records. Of course, it is still best to make the request politely. 
Most organizations will let you make an appointment to sit down and review everything in the file, as long as someone is present to ascertain that you do not remove or change anything. Most will also make you a copy of anything in the file that you ask for. 
Some organizations will only make you a copy if you pay for that to be done (e.g., 5 cents per page).
The following items should be kept in a basic personnel file:
employment application and resume; agreements such as confidentiality, noncompete, nondisclosure; college transcripts; job descriptions; hiring, promotion, demotion, transfer, layoff, rates of pay, other forms of compensation, and education and training records; employee handbook receipt; receipts for other employment policies (e.g., e-mail usage, internet usage, etc.); letters of recognition; disciplinary notices or documents; performance evaluations; test documents used

/answer/221533,How does one deal with a stepson in the family business who is dating an employee?,,"																																	This is not an atypical situation when family members work together. It is human nature for offspring and other relatives of the owner or higher-level management to receive preferential treatment and, in turn, to bestow favors on their friends. 
Most business owners and top managers who allow this to happen have no idea how much damage it causes in the fabric of the enterprise. When good management practices are not adhered to, and when conscientious employees feel that rules that directly impact them are not being followed (e.g., work schedules), an atmosphere is created in which productivity, quality and profitability suffer. That is, there is no genuine impetus for otherwise industrious employees to work hard to excel when/if the cards are already stacked against them being treated fairly and rewarded properly. 
I always recommend a specific policy prohibiting people who are related or dating to report to one another. But it is probably a bit late to put that practice into place where you work. You neglect to say what your position is in the company; perhaps it would put your own job at risk to follow this advice. But what needs to be done is for you to put this same question to ""stepmom."" That is, how does she feel about her stepson's lackadaisical approach to his job and giving preferential scheduling treatment to his current girlfriend? 
She may be too busy to really notice her stepson's behavior and/or the fact that he is skirting established work scheduling guidelines because of his personal involvement. She may even be prompted to tell him to find a job on his own--and take his girlfriend with him.

/answer/221532,Where can we find a health plan for an independent worker who will be working in China?,,"																																	Well, first of all, it is not precisely clear to me whether you are going to ""hire"" this person as a consultant or if, in fact, he will be a W-9 (1099) independent consultant providing professional services to your company. 
If he will be an employee, the first thing to do is ask your current employee medical insurance broker what it can do to help you with this quest. If the broker writes for a variety of carriers, it should be relatively easy for the broker to find you a policy for the consultant. 
Another viable source may be to log onto www.healthcareinternational.com. While I have not personally used this company's services, it appears to be a good fit for what you are seeking.
If your ""young contractor"" is really supposed to be a W-9 (1099) independent contractor, you should not necessarily provide him with health coverage, as most independent contractors are required to provide their own insurance coverage in order to meet the test of legitimately being independent contractors. From Section Two of the IRS Publication 15-A, which explains the difference between employees and independent contractors, one of the criteria for an independent contractor is ""Whether or not the business provides the worker with employee-type benefits, such as insurance, pension plan, vacation pay, or sick pay."" If the company does, the individual may not be deemed an independent contractor under the IRS rules. 
In this case, you might help him find a carrier/policy and adjust how much you are paying him in order to cover his increased costs of doing business by assuming responsibility for this contractual relationship with you.

/answer/221515,Should I reimburse virtual employees for mileage to the main office?,,"																																	Employers are not legally required to reimburse regular mileage for commuting to and from work--unless the employer has a contract in place
stating otherwise. So, this is a judgment call. 
With gas prices what they are, if you are now requiring someone who has not previously been frequenting the main office to do so on a regular basis, it seems as though the fair thing to do would be to devise some offset so that telecommuting employees are not taking what to them is essentially a pay cut. This is especially true if you want to keep these ""long distance virtual employees"" happy and working effectively for your company. (The company must have a good business reason for having these telecommuting employees in the first place--e.g., specific and unique skill sets and capabilities). 
If you do decide to reimburse officially designated ""virtual employees"" for their trips to the main office, you should create and disseminate a policy to all those so affected and communicate it to potential new telecommuting employees, too.  You might want to specify that mileage over 40 miles each way will be reimbursed for employees officially designated as ""virtual employees"" who use their personal vehicles when
they are required by management to be at the main office. Or you may want to say that the company will reimburse all mileage for employees officially designated as ""virtual employees"" when they are required by management to be at the main office. It's up to you.
You can look up the government mileage reimbursement rate by going online. Input ""CONUS rates"" to your search engine and it will take you to www.gsa.gov. Then click on ""Policy."" Here's a quote from that site: ""On June 23, 2008, the Internal Revenue Service announced an increase in the mileage reimbursement rate for privately owned automobiles to 58.5 cents per mile.""

/answer/221513,How do I advertise employment for 18-to-23-year-olds without discriminating?,,"																																	In limited situations, discrimination based on age, sex or some other protected factor is permissible if the employer can demonstrate a truly compelling reason to discriminate. 
For example, a religious organization may refuse to hire or promote someone not embracing the same religious beliefs; an employer can refuse to hire a man as an attendant in a women's locker room; or a person with an extremely heavy accent, originally from a non-English speaking country, can be denied a job requiring excellent English communication skills. Employers are advised, however, that courts are reluctant to permit such forms of discrimination. 
You would be on safer ground describing the rigors of the position (e.g., ""need to be able to lift 200 lb. boxes and store them at a height of 6 feet"") and focusing on the needs of the position, rather than describing the kind of person you want to apply for the position.

/answer/221490,"How do we encourage retirement for a ""Peter Principle"" employee?",,"																																	Not knowing more about your company and its track record in this kind of situation, how many more of these kinds of situations you may have to face in the coming months or years, or what kind of retirement program you have in place, I am at somewhat of a disadvantage in determining your best course of action.
However, as I see it, you should structure a bona fide job description for the job you need done. Carefully craft the qualifications necessary, including the level of proficiency with the technology that anyone must use effectively to do the job. Follow this by calculating measurable productivity and quality standards for a good worker doing the job using the technology required.
Meet with the employee and explain that this is what the business needs done (methodology/technology, amount, rate, accuracy, etc.). Tell her that unless she can meet the job requirements and productivity goals set, she cannot remain on board in her current capacity. 
If she responds that she can meet the job requirements, give her a fair chance (minimum of 30 days) to prove that claim. There are inexpensive online skills tests that can measure her ability to use the technology required if you do not have a validated test of your own.
If she does well coming up to speed, great. Otherwise, offer her a separation agreement protecting your company from any kind of legal claim after the fact and a severance package (as consideration) to ease her on her way. You must make it about the job and not about her.
When you fill the job, be very careful to ascertain that the individual you hire meets every single qualification you have included in the job description.

/answer/221489,Do I have to pay an employee who quit without notice for days worked previously?,,"																																	Unfortunately, you do owe him for all the hours he worked. It may not seem fair, but it's the law under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA).
Employees are entitled to be paid for all hours worked at the rate agreed upon. If you fail to pay him, he can obtain assistance from the Department of Labor to enforce his claim. 
An argument might be made if you had a written contract with him to complete a specific project or task that he failed to do; but even in that instance, he might make a good case that he should be paid for the effort he expended in your employ. 
For seasonal workers, sometimes it's a good idea to offer a lower wage with the commitment of a sizable bonus upon them completing the season.

/article/195252,Top 7 Hiring Mistakes for Startups,Avoid these pitfalls and build a team of talented employees.,"Building great teams is never easy.A quick look at the sports world confirms this. Coaches come and go, players are free to seek new teams and owners are free to sign players who fit certain roles within the limits of payroll.In business, it's equally difficult. Even established businesses suffer from hiring and team-building mistakes. Unlike a startup, however, those companies can afford to make a hiring mistake without significantly impacting their overall operations.
Unfortunately, startups don't have that cushion of profit to cover up a hiring mistake. That's especially true in a small company, where one person who is not the right fit could mean that 25 or up to 50 percent of your work force is now a big problem.The good thing is there are some hard and fast hiring rules startups should follow. Most hiring issues occur as a result of looking to keep costs down or not having a clear vision about what the business is and where it's going.However, my experience has shown me that cutting corners in the hiring process now can mean trouble for the business later. To avoid trouble, here are the top seven hiring mistakes many startups make:Hiring someone just because you know them. This means friends, former co-workers, family members or your own children. For a husband, this means hiring your wife. For a wife, this means hiring your husband. Even part-time. There needs to be a certain sense of objectivity and accountability in the workplace. Friends and family expect to be treated to a different standard--and they should. Away from your business, but never in it.Hiring someone to ""help them out."" Some owners have loads of empathy for workers on the rebound, or people in trouble. Being a ""savior"" to help someone may not help your business. Instead, hire someone who can add value to the company and its operations. Those are people who are eager and willing to go the extra mile. They also won't be in trouble or looking to take advantage of what always turns into a bad situation.Taking someone on as a partner because you can't afford to hire him. Business can be hard enough as a sole proprietor, but don't think it's an advantage to bring on a partner, especially if you can't afford to hire him as an employee.
If you do, you give up 50 percent of your company to someone who may or may not thrive in an entrepreneurial setting.
An alternative is to outsource projects or work on a fee basis. Better yet, work out an arrangement at an advisory or coaching level. Then 100 percent of your company remains yours. Plus, it's easier to walk away if something goes wrong.Hiring someone to do a bit of everything. A ""jack of all trades"" approach is fine--for the owner. But the specific functions of a business need to be staffed with people who are specialists.
Instead of hiring one person to do the accounting and administrative work, think of this as two jobs for two different people.
The reality is most people simply don't have the skills or expertise to do a variety of jobs. The key is to find people with skills that complement your own, and put those people in specific jobs with specific roles.Top-down hiring vs. bottom-up hiring. This method of hiring also leads to getting people on the team who are generalists vs. someone who's the right fit for a single job.
Hiring from the bottom up means filling specific roles with specific skill sets with people who will be doing jobs that are typically lower paying but take up large amounts of time. This frees you from having to do time-consuming tasks. It also gives people an opportunity to add value and expand their roles, which ultimately helps grow the company.Not knowing what job you want to hire for. Just hiring for the sake of hiring, or hiring a generalist to bring some order to your internal chaos, is not a hiring strategy--it's just more chaos.
Clearly define roles for any new hires. Not only will you avoid hiring a non-productive person in an ill-defined role, you'll start attracting people who'll add real value to their role and your operation.Hiring for the job you hate. Earlier I said you should hire people with complementary skills. This doesn't mean you should hire someone to avoid doing what you may do best. In short, don't hire a bookkeeper when you know how to do the numbers--especially when your top line sales may be suffering.In this case, you do the accounting and be on the lookout for a really great sales person. The growth in sales will fund the accounting position soon enough. But you won't get there having two people in-house skilled at crunching numbers.Hiring is all about finding the right skills, personalities and attitudes to fit your overall vision and mission for your company. Having those two guideposts in place will make it easier to make good hires that will benefit your business in the long run.Then you can own one of the few big businesses that doesn't make as many hiring blunders as your competition.Brad SugarsBrad Sugars is the founder and chairman of ActionCOACH.

/article/195140,Don't Hire People Just Like You,"'Mirror-hiring' has its positives, but a diverse work force can enhance innovation and productivity.","When you recruit and hire new employees, do you often find that you're searching for people just like you? Similar in mannerisms, appearance, intelligence and culture? Perhaps also possessing the same educational background, experiences and maybe even gender, race and religion?If you do hire employees this way, then rest assured that you're not alone. At the same time, however, you're also just like many bosses who are selling themselves and their companies short.You are doing what I call ""hiring by looking in the mirror.""Let's examine these ""mirror-hiring"" decisions more closely. There are several very positive reasons to hire ""clones."" Clearly, you know what you want in a good recruit. You know what works in your company in terms of knowledge, skills, attitudes, outlooks and behaviors.In addition, you've noted that your mirror-hires possess proven attributes that have been practical and effective for your organization. You employed people with like personal and professional qualities, throwing away the failures, but keeping the successes. Those policies have led to satisfaction, achievement and profitability.In brief, you know what leads to top-notch performance and victory. Therefore, it's easy to believe, if you take that philosophy one step further, that the more candidates you hire with your specific set of skills, the more successful you and your company will be. They'll have fewer arguments and need less time to understand each other. They'll communicate better and achieve more. Moreover, they'll probably have similar interests, want to interact more and either work more independently or collaboratively, depending on the culture you've established.On the other hand, by hiring a clone, you may be missing out on a number of opportunities that may prove difficult and problematic. That's because for the sake of conformity, you might be rejecting people with skills both complementary and supplemental to your company that would permit its culture to grow and expand with outcomes that could create a more productive, innovative, challenging and rewarding environment.When you adhere strictly to a narrow hiring profile, too much ""likeness"" can lead to corporate ""in-breeding."" The inevitable result is that the new hires look like, think like and act like you, the boss. This ""group think"" situation results in employees not challenging each other, not asking enough ""why"" questions, settling for agreement where disagreement would conceivably produce more options, perspectives, opinions and viewpoints. Often, people reject good but ""different"" ideas, or worse, they never voice divergent opinions because they would appear ""dissimilar"" and therefore unacceptable.Though ""mirror hiring"" may help you resolve an issue or take action more quickly, with all this uniformity, what happens to innovation and creativity? And what happens to risk-taking? Who becomes the ""devil's advocate"" who can propose alternate lines of reasoning or different goals?This is a crucial suggestion that you, the successful entrepreneur, might use to avoid too much in-breeding and conformity that can hinder productivity, innovation and profitability.Consider being open to diversity, not just in terms of race, gender or sexual orientation, but also in terms of skills, attitudes, interests, backgrounds and experiences. Appreciate that each person can bring a unique--yes, sometimes individually different--approach to the workplace.Employees with differences can appropriately challenge each other more often and quite effectively. Differences can cause people to think, act and feel in new and different ways. Innovation, productivity, morale and satisfaction can increase when diversity exists in a collaborative atmosphere. The key words here are ""collaboration"" and ""innovation.""Differing opinions can spark new thoughts and ideas for processes, procedures, products and services, but everyone still needs to work toward a common goal. And, if you, the entrepreneurial boss, are willing to take the chance to try something new in your hiring, many competitive bottom-line opportunities can unfold.As Apple's motto used to say, ""Think Different.""Dr. David G.

/answer/221471,What are the options for paying part-time employees when there is no set schedule/hours week to week?,,"																																	There is no maximum limit on how much you pay using a ""spot pay"" system, but you do have to be sure you are not shortchanging the employee for hours actually worked.  
That is, if the nature of the work done by the part-time employee is nonexempt in nature under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), you have to be sure you are paying the worker at least the minimum wage per hour worked according to federal law (or state law if the minimum wage in your state is higher than the federal minimum wage) and that you are paying overtime if the employee is working more than 40 hours in any one workweek to accomplish your assignments. 
As a general rule, how you pay part-time employees depends on the kind of work the part-time employee is required to do. The first step will be to properly classify the job under the FLSA as either exempt from the FLSA (e.g., executive, professional, etc.) such as a controller; or nonexempt (e.g., non-key-decision-making role without licensing or advanced knowledge/education requirements) such as an accounts-payable clerk. If you know how to do this accurately, great. If not, obtain input from a human resource expert to help you do it correctly. 
It is conceivable that you might employ a part-time executive or professional--for example, a controller. If so, that person is exempt under the FLSA. So in this kind of scenario, you might make an agreement to pay him/her a set amount per week with the stated understanding that he/she will accomplish the tasks agreed upon on an ongoing basis to complete the job responsibilities. Especially with the popularity of teleworking (virtual situations/working from home), this type of arrangement is being used frequently.
However, if the nature of the work is nonexempt from the FLSA--for example, an accounts-receivable clerk--you must be sure to have the person report his/her hours each week and pay him/her for the actual hours worked.  Sometimes even part-time workers work more than 40 hours during peak periods, or when other employees are ill or on vacation.  In those cases, under federal law, nonexempt employees must be paid time and a half for the hours worked in excess of 40 in any one workweek. 
If you are contemplating designating the part-time employee as a contractor, I urge you to carefully review Section Two of IRS Publication 15-A (http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p15a.pdf) You'll see exactly what the IRS considers when determining whether a worker is an employee or an independent contractor (i.e., 1099 worker). In addition, the IRS will help an organization determine the appropriate classification for a worker or group of workers free of charge as regards federal law.  
To obtain that service, you simply complete and submit to the IRS Form SS-8 (http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fss8.pdf). However, your state may have more or different requirements.

/answer/221468,What interview tips could you offer for a customer service position where heavy interaction with the customer is required?,,"																																	Face-to-face interviewing is the most time-consuming aspect of hiring.  So using a process that results in face-to-face interviewing of only the few ""best of the best"" applicants makes good sense. Using a phone interview to determine basic employability factors with likely looking candidates is a big time saver; and whether the employee customer interactions will be in person or by phone, you can most objectively assess each individual s communications skills by phone--especially if you listen carefully (i.e., no physical distractions). A few examples of basic employability questions are:
1.  Tell me about yourself--current situation and why you are interested in leaving your current employer. Tell me why you are seeking a change. What are you looking for?
2.  Tell me about your past job(s): type of company, size, revenue, your duties, etc. (Ask why s/he left each past position.)
3.  Tell me about your interfaces with ""customers."" 
     a.  Give an example of an outstanding outcome.
     b.  Give an example of a less-than-outstanding outcome. 
4. Tell me about your experience/training in or exposure to (actual job responsibilities or requirements from the position. Specifications should be inserted here).
Another huge timesaver is doing skills and personality testing. Keep in mind that objective, quantifiable data handily trump the observational acumen of most interviewers. Inexpensive but comprehensive online tests are readily available (e.g., ProveIt.com offers more than 800 tests; each takes about 20 minutes to complete, and results in detailed reports). If a great number of your hires need to have the same kinds or levels of skills, you might want to buy testing programs to run at your site.
Following are a few generic questions you might want to include when you meet in person with a potential finalist. Be sure to include questions focused on the actual qualifications required, and the skills and characteristics that will most likely result in the new hire s success.  Prepare a standard interview for each job for which you hire, and use the appropriate standardized interview with everyone. Keep copious notes.  Make your determination as quickly as possible. Otherwise, days or weeks later, you may not be able to sort out which candidate most impressed you.
1.  In what area would you say your strongest professional knowledge and expertise lie? Why do you feel this way?
2.  What are your least positive traits or professional weaknesses?
3.  What is your typical way of dealing with conflict?
4.  Cite a realistic situation that could arise in the actual job and ask:  ""How would you solve this problem?"" 
5.  What type(s) of thing(s) in the work place make(s) you angry? Why?
6.  Tell me about your flexibility.  Give me an example or two.
7.  Give me an example or two of your resourcefulness.
I hope this is helpful to you in selecting the best customer-service professionals.  Good luck!

/answer/221425,How do I pay employees who worked on a paid holiday? We are paying all employees whether they worked or not.,,"																																	I am assuming that you do not have an employee manual (published policies) and are not unionized. From the Department of Labor website,  The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) does not require payment for time not worked, such as vacations or holidays (federal or otherwise). These benefits are generally a matter of agreement between an employer and an employee (or the employee's representative). 
Most companies do have a policy for non-exempt (hourly) employees and many do for exempt (salaried) employees as well, such as:  Employees required to work on an authorized Company Holiday are paid 8 hours of holiday pay in addition to the hours that they work on the holiday at their regular hourly pay. 
Another tactic that you could use would be to offer employees compensatory time off (i.e., they can take another day as a floating/paid holiday if they were required to work on a company-paid holiday).
Whatever you do, be consistent in the administration of practices that you establish. Otherwise, you will open yourself to claims of discrimination. Hope this is helpful.

/answer/221424,What criteria should I use for employee recognition?,,"																																	Developing safety and work ethics incentive programs is a great idea. The first step is to establish the specific goals you wish to achieve so you can determine what behaviors should be rewarded. This is extremely important, as it will be the basis for all of the other aspects that follow.
Next, you need to formulate how to measure the desired behaviors. Only quantifiable activities can be included in a production employee incentive program.
I recommend that you not develop this program by yourself. Instead, put together a small committee composed of a representative or two each from the supervisor, manager, and line worker ranks. Share the goals you have set and let them propose ideas on how to achieve those
goals, how objectives can be set and measured, and the nomination criteria and process. You can work with them to ensure that they stay on track and so that you hear their reasoning and understand how to maximize the success of the programs.
This group is probably the best source of information on what kinds of recognition will be most welcome and appreciated. You can set the parameters by sharing the budget for these programs and including the frequency that you want to promulgate rewards. We are flooded with catalogs and programs touted to make employees feel valued--pins, plaques, trophies, gift catalog items, etc. And there are literally hundreds of low-cost and even free ways to reward employees for desired behaviors, too: movie tickets, cafeteria vouchers, restaurant gift
cards, choice parking spaces, etc. 
But to make your programs meaningful and successful, you want to know what would make the people in your work force feel most valued. The best people to tell you that are the people who can earn these rewards.

/answer/221415,How do I know when to hire?,,"																																	Many companies simply hire when there is more work to do than the current staff can get done. You are wise to think that there is more to it than that. Your chief financial officer should work with your line management to develop the company s staffing plan along with the budget
for staffing based on your revenue, productivity, and profit goals.
Timing for hiring is normally based on what the company needs and can afford to do versus what the company wants but may not be able to afford to do. 
What is the expected ROI for each type of employee you bring on board? Some employees are overhead, but necessary to maintain momentum, while others help to expand revenue growth. 
Good planning is the key to success. You can begin by looking at how you are organized now and what your organization will need to look like to achieve your business, revenue, and market share growth goals. Then you can put together a plan for adding to head count. 
Adding full-time, regular employees includes many of the following costs, although not all will apply to you: recruiting fees, wages, workers' compensation contributions, Social Security tax, unemployment tax, training, office/worksite space and associated overhead, equipment (telephones, computers, copiers, fax machines, kitchen/break facilities), supplies (paper, pens, markers, folders, files, etc.), insurance coverage (health, dental, vision, life insurance, etc.), short-/long-term disability, retirement plan contributions, profit sharing, bonus/incentives, paid time off (vacation, sick, holiday, personal leave).
So when you are budgeting to add to head count, be sure to consider all of the costs associated with hiring. Many companies are looking at more virtual employees in the mix to keep overhead down and/or outsourcing some of the work to contractors for shorter-term contributions or to help the company keep up with demand during crunch periods. Perhaps one of options might be worthwhile for you.

/answer/221414,Can I pick and choose which employees I offer health insurance to?,,"																																	It's not illegal to offer health benefits to just the top echelon of your company, but it may be difficult to find a broker/carrier who wants your business. That is, with fewer than 10 employees to begin with, to seek health insurance for only a very few will not make you a particularly attractive client for most health insurance brokers/carriers; and it will probably be pretty expensive for you, too.
Also, insurance brokers/carriers like to spread the risk across as many
eligible employees as possible. A better way to go might be to select the plan you think is a good one and offset the cost for the more valuable employees while not doing so for the lower-paid employees.
It's still not ideal, but it is legal. While the lower-paid employees might not be able to afford the good coverage, this would at least allow them the opportunity to obtain health insurance if they really want and need it.
A PEO (professional employer organization) might be an option for you at your size, too. That way, you could get the cost benefits of a larger group that offers a wide variety of health insurance programs. Your higher-paid employees can opt for a richer plan, while the lower-paid employees can obtain what they can afford. Also, with a PEO, an HSA (health savings account) option would likely be available, which might be advantageous to a segment of your work force as you continue to grow.
You can design other benefits to attract highly skilled employees, such as bonus programs, more vacation, free life insurance, paid parking, car allowances, seminars, professional memberships, education assistance,
free financial/retirement planning assistance, laptops, PDAs, etc. And you can look into programs that allow you to put aside more for their retirement than standard 401(k) or simple IRAs. These latter suggestions can also keep your highly skilled talent on board longer.

/answer/221397,How do I evaluate a PEO?,,"																																	This can be very challenging! Hence, this very long response: Originally, when Professional Employer Organizations (employee leasing) became fashionable, the advantages of PEOs--for smaller companies generally--were the leverage of a larger group negotiating for reduced costs for benefits (e.g., group medical, dental, etc.) most often sold by salespeople not licensed as insurance agents. Over time, these advantages diminished. Many benefits brokers can find very competitive rates for their small company clients, especially when all carriers can be accessed versus the usual only one (or at most two) carrier option offered by PEOs. There are a variety of retirement options from which smaller companies can choose (a much better choice because the employer can choose a plan that fits the company s individual needs versus a  plan in a box ) and the advantage of the bundled workers compensation rates evaporated as well. While most PEOs also touted their payroll and human resources support, most often the payroll services were no better or worse than those of free-standing payroll services-only providers (typically lacking any type of customization as the software was written for PEOs) and the human resource support routinely consisted of a very generic employee manual, varying levels of employment expertise and advice most often provided by service staff, not human resource experts.
With the emergence of full-service Administrative Services Offering (ASO) vendors, PEOs have now become the expensive alternative to accessing bundled benefits, payroll, workers compensation and human resources services. However, be aware that if the ASO vendor with which you talk offers a PEO option, the vendor may try to convince you to buy PEO services instead of the ASO model due to the higher profit margins that the PEO generates for the vendor. These higher PEO profit margins are generated by many hidden costs which can be almost impossible to decipher on the automatic fees report that the employer receives when the fees are being automatically taken out of the employer s account along with the payroll and payroll taxes.
Also, PEOs use the annual contract to try to hold onto customers and they can also make it very difficult and painful to exit the PEO. The contract can always be broken but a PEO will try to use scare tactics to keep the client. I have seen PEOs retain employee records and ignore former customers  requests for data. Employees may have to complete a variety of  new hire  paperwork. And if the employer is in the PEO for more than a year or so, the employer s workers compensation mod will be reset with no regard to the employer s good safety record. An employer will also lose a good unemployment rate once they ve been with a PEO for 3 years. They will also charge a  not for profit  FUTA taxes, which  not for profits  are actually exempt from paying.
Unless there is a truly compelling reason not to seek the better option, I recommend that before you make any decision you look for an ASO that does not require an annual contract such as Tricore (www.tricoreonline.com). If you are determined to go the PEO route, set up a spreadsheet and see if you can extract applicable accurate information from each PEO vendor with whom you talk to fill in the columns. Expect it to be almost impossible to get the same kinds of cost breakdowns from each vendor. They make it difficult to do in my experience. Also, ask for at least six references (happy users with similar size and types of companies to yours) and call each one with a standard list of questions about costs and services. What would be ideal, of course, would be to talk to the unhappy former PEO users and see what their experiences were.

/answer/221396,What are the benefits and trade-offs of having 1099 employees versus W2 employees?,,"																																	Technically speaking, anyone to whom you are sending a 1099 is not an  employee ; she or he is a  contractor  and calling him/her a  1099 employee  is slippery slope when regarding the view of the IRS and unemployment claims that you may end up grappling with as well. The  benefits  of having a 1099 worker are that the company doesn t withhold income taxes, doesn t withhold and pay Social Security and Medicare taxes and doesn t pay unemployment taxes on what a contractor earns. Contractors like it because their untaxed checks are greater than they would receive for the same work if they were employees.
The benefit of W2 employees is that you will not be challenged by the IRS or other state or federal governing entity about the legal validity of your classifications. Many employers misclassifying employees as contractors face tax audits and lawsuits with potentially significant payouts. This is because the employer is saving money at the expense of the federal and state governments and at a detriment to the worker. So, under federal and state laws, an independent contractor must be just that--independent. It is very important to make the distinction properly. Contractors should all have specific self-determining kinds of work to do, normally in a finite time period, with defined deliverables, using their own place of work and so forth. If you look at Section Two of the IRS Publication 15-A,you will see exactly what the IRS considers when determining whether a worker is an employee or an independent contractor (i.e., 1099 worker).
In addition, the IRS will help an organization free of charge to determine the appropriate classification for a worker or group of workers in the organization as regards federal law. To obtain that service, you simply complete and submit IRS Form SS-8 to the IRS. However, your state may have more or different requirements.
It s not uncommon for a worker whose contract period has ended to apply for unemployment insurance benefits with a state agency. Then, when officials do not find any earnings reported for the worker, an investigation ensues. For misclassifications, the payouts most often involve benefits and lost wages including unpaid overtime. 
There have been sizable awards for very high profile companies such as Microsoft and Time-Warner/AOL due to misclassification of employees as contractors. So, you may want to consider that the potential pitfalls of retaining independent contractors can outweigh the short-term savings in benefits and reduced paperwork for some firms. On the other hand, if the people you are engaging do meet the criteria of the IRS regarding independent contractors, you have well-crafted professional services agreements in place with each one and you are careful in administering their contributions and status, you will be fine.

/answer/221393,Can I give a personality test during the hiring process?,,"																																	There has been a lot of misinformation published regarding the legality of using personality assessments.  Unfortunately, many of those articles were written by attorneys who did not differentiate between clinically oriented psychological assessments and pre-employment assessments that were specifically designed and developed for business and industrial use.
Not all assessments are suitable for use as pre-employment assessments.  Specifically, psychological assessments that were designed for clinical or diagnostic use should not be used. There is a big difference between pre-employment assessments and clinically-oriented psychological testing.  The courts have consistently ruled that psychological testing generally has no place in the business environment. 
The E.E.O.C. has always tried to promote objectivity in the employee selection process--the more objective the better. Without an assessment program, you have a very subjective selection system that is highly fallible and will depend greatly on biases and prejudices.  Recruiters and managers will always feel more comfortable when hiring people like themselves.  Whites will prefer to hire white applicants simply because they can relate to them better.  The E.E.O.C. realizes this as a natural tendency and that is why they want objectivity in the hiring process.
Using a good assessment properly ensures protection against E.E.O.C. problems and adverse impact.  When an assessment program is properly implemented and utilized in conjunction with other standard hiring and interviewing procedures, it strengthens the employers  position of taking affirmative action to ensure that applicants and employees are treated fairly without regard to race, color, age, religion, sex, or national origin.
It would make the best sense to obtain expert help in selecting the right personality assessment tool to fit your needs to make sure that you use the tool properly and that you use it at the optimal point in your selection process. There are hundreds of assessments on the market. All represent an investment of time and money. But selecting the wrong employees will cost you much more money and will eat into the profits that the good employees are making for your company.

/article/192994,Making Every Day Earth Day ,April 22 lasts 365 days a year for these eco-friendly businesses.,"These days, it's good to be green.So much so that companies like Target, Macy's and Dell are marketing eco-friendly products more than ever. Businesses are pledging their allegiance to all things green by promoting Earth Day--which takes place on April 22--just like any other marketing holiday.Efforts to go green should be applauded, but experts stress the importance of living up to eco-friendly claims.""Nothing will sink a company faster than the realization by its customers that it's only interested in good PR and not in real change,"" says Nik Kaestner, founder of Green Squared Consulting.For companies like Greenling Organic Delivery, TwoGreenMoms and Dropps, that won't be a problem. These companies are built around products and services that make it easier for consumers to minimize their footprint on the environment. Meet the socially responsible entrepreneurs who are turning a profit while trying to save the planet. Door-To-Door OrganicsThe green lifestyle is nothing new to Greenling Organic Delivery co-founder Mason Arnold. He's been an organics pioneer since graduating from the University of Texas, Austin in 2001. Arnold, 29, created his first business, EarthAction Lawn and Landscape, an environmentally responsible lawn company, in 2002. He sold it two years later to launch Greenling in 2005.The Austin-based company delivers fresh organic produce directly to customers' doorsteps. Currently, Greenling delivers to Austin and San Antonio, but Arnold says he plans to extend delivery to Dallas and Houston within 18 months. Ultimately, Arnold would like to expand the service nationwide.""We've developed a system that's a just-in-time inventory, so it reduces the time it takes for food to get from the farm to the table by more than half,"" Arnold says. ""We're delivering a more nutritious product, and we're able to deliver it much faster. We think everyone in the nation should have this available.""Greenling, which had revenues of $1.3 million in 2007, serves about 1,200 residential customers and between 30 and 40 wholesalers.Though Arnold promotes a fun working environment for his 17 employees, he also practices what he preaches. The company purchased computers from Dell after researching its recycling and conservation efforts.""We investigate every company we work with to make sure they share our core values,"" Arnold says. ""We've turned down vendors and service providers before simply because they don't seem to share our values of conversation and sustainability.""In addition to providing a service that's good for consumers and the environment, Arnold uses his organics expertise to encourage Austin locals to do their part to conserve energy.Arnold also formed a private organization, Organic Association of Texas, to give a voice to his industry.Moms Gone GreenJust a few months ago, Jill Clark and Mandi DuPuy were two moms wishing they could do something to help the environment. Now, they're the co-founders of TwoGreenMoms, a website that launched in February 2008.Their product: reusable totes to replace plastic bags. The polypropylene totes are available with or without insulation, in green or blue. The green bag features the saying ""Little Green Bag,"" while the blue bag carries the phrase ""Girls Gone Green."" In addition to the totes with sayings, TwoGreenMoms also features customization.The duo decided to create their line of eco-friendly bags to attract women like them who want to be green, but also stylish.""I wanted a cuter bag than the ones I was carrying,"" DuPuy says. ""You can be a walking advertisement for a grocery store for only so long.""DuPuy, 40, and Clark, 37--who both work out of their Waco, Texas, homes--were friends for seven years before deciding to partner. The idea for the green totes sparked when Clark, who also owns a specialty item company, Kiddoozie, began noticing her clients asking for environmentally friendly products.Clark, the sales guru of the team, saw the need for the totes and decided to fill the niche. She and DuPuy began giving the bags to friends as birthday gifts.Much to their surprise, the response was overwhelming, and their close-knit Waco community began spreading the word about their product. This year, based on early sales figures, Clark and DuPuy are projecting $150,000 in revenue.Not only do TwoGreenMoms want to make a difference in their community, but they also want to have an impact on generations to come.""We're the moms of the world,"" DuPuy says. ""If we can convince all the moms of the world to raise the next generations as more socially and environmentally aware, they will grow up having these practices.""Eco-Friendly Laundry
Just like TwoGreenMoms, Dropps is offering a product that makes it easy for consumers to go green. Dropps, founded by 52-year-old Jonathan Propper, launched in 2005 with the product Laundry Dropps. This eco-friendly liquid laundry detergent--which was listed in O The Oprah Magazine's ""The O List"" in May--comes in pre-measured, dissolving packs.For Propper, a third-generation textiles and cotton-spinning entrepreneur, the evolution of Laundry Dropps started in 1979 when he founded Conshohocken Cotton Co. He developed Cot'n Wash, a concentrated detergent, to care for cotton fabrics.After his wife complained about measuring liquid detergent and making a mess while pouring, Propper decided to reformulate Cot'n Wash in 2005, renaming it Laundry Dropps. It became the first eco-friendly laundry detergent packaged in toss-and-go packs.The Philadelphia-based company, which Propper says has fewer than 50 employees, reports sales in the seven-figures. The product is sold by such retailers as Target, Wal-Mart and Whole Foods.When developing Laundry Dropps, Propper says plenty of thought went into the packaging.""A lot of products have focused on what's inside the package in terms of 'green.' We also have to focus on the package itself, because that's what can ultimately make the difference in the environment,"" he says.To prove what an immense difference Laundry Dropps can make, Propper says the average family could use Laundry Dropps for about 15 years and have the same footprint as one plastic jug of laundry detergent in a landfill.The company is also doing its part to spread the green message. Remy Wildrick, partner and brand manager, says Dropps is involved in community events and is asking people to submit Earth Day resolutions to their company blog.""I think everyone wants to conserve and save the planet in some way, but they need tools in order to do that,"" Propper says. ""Dropps is a very affordable, easy way to conserve water, energy, plastic and trees.""How to Lessen Your Carbon Footprint
Even if your company isn't built around a green product, there are still plenty of ways your office can join the green effort. According to Kaestner, the best place to start is with lighting.ENTREPRENEUR POLL Does your small business plan on making an effort to go green in 2008?   (  surveys)""Switch to fluorescents and make sure no lights stay on that aren't needed. Also, tune your heating, ventilating and air conditioning system, install programmable thermostats, and have your utility provider do an energy audit to identity ways you can simplify,"" he advises.Kaestner also suggests organizing green teams to involve employees and direct future initiatives.That's the kind of environment Arnold has created at Greenling.""Everything that we do, we try to look for ways internally and externally to help guide ourselves, our company and our community to a more sustainable future,"" he says.",Starting a Business,2008-04-18 00:00:00
/answer/221386,Should I give days off in exchange for weekend business travel?,,"																																	If your employees are exempt from the Fair Labor Standards Act, this is a judgment call on your part. I say if because salaried does not necessarily mean that they are exempt employees under the FLSA. Many employers use  salaried  and  exempt  interchangeably, which is not accurate. That is, an employer can pay a non-exempt employee a salary, as long as the employer also abides by the FLSA concerning paying for overtime hours worked and so forth. For purposes of this response, I will assume that  salaried  does mean  exempt  from the FLSA. 
Most companies that have exempt professionals who travel or work on weekends just inform those people that it's part of the job and that this extra time and effort is one reason why the job pays at the level that it does (i.e., the weekend work/travel is calculated into the pay level of the job). However, giving some kind of compensatory time to exempt employees for their weekend travel and business hours is a good thing to do for morale or, as you put it,  to show appreciation.  
Giving back hour-for-hour is more than you need to do. Many accounting firms have a program whereby for each hour worked by exempt employees in excess of a threshold of say 50 hours during a standard work week, one-half hour is deposited to a compensatory time bank. You might want to create a compensatory time bank for exempt employees who regularly work on weekends for travel and business. If so, you should establish clear guidelines to prevent misunderstandings or misuse. For example, you might want to exclude hours worked by employees who infrequently travel or work on weekends (i.e., have a minimum of some kind that makes sense for you and your business). You might want to exclude travel work hours on Friday evenings or Sunday evenings from consideration, because this a typical travel time for many workers who travel for business. These are just some thoughts on the subject. I think overall that it's a nice idea for morale and appreciation purposes.

/answer/221381,Do I still have to pay an employee through their 2 weeks notice?,,"																																	I always recommend checking your own company's employee manual first.  If it says that you do pay in lieu of notice, then you should do so; (although it sounds to me like you want to then take action to change that policy if it does say that you pay in lieu of notice).  If the policy manual is silent on this subject, you are legally required to pay for all time worked by an individual, but not for time not actually worked.  If the employee departing is exempt, you would be wise to pay him for the entire week if he worked for part of the week in which he gave you his notice. But other than that, you are not legally required to pay anyone for their notice period if you want to release them immediately for any reason.
I also highly recommend having a termination policy that explains how you do handle terminations of all kinds and to specify in that policy what you expect from departing employees and how you handle pay for unused or accrued vacation, return of company property and so forth.
You may want to take a longer-term view of the advantages of paying in lieu of notice by using the leverage paying in lieu of notice can provide to you. That is, you may say in your policy that management will consider paying in lieu of notice in certain situations that make sense for the company and if a resigning employee offers two weeks of working notice, agrees to train whoever will be doing the departing employee s work, and if all company property is returned in good condition and so forth.  Also, your reputation as an employer can be damaged with the employees who are not leaving, just yet, if you treat departing employees in what can be perceived as a spiteful fashion. So, think through how you want to handle this potentially negative matter and strategize what will really be the best practice for you and your business. Hope this is helpful.

/article/191974,5 Perfect Office Pranks,Here's some inspiration for creative office hi-jinks.,"At Dunder Mifflin's Scranton branch, pranks are an everyday occurrence. Perhaps the top prankster of The Office, Jim Halpert, played by John Krasinski, has dunked staplers in Jello-O and convinced co-workers it was a different day of the week.For some offices, pranks are part of the corporate culture. They're a way for entrepreneurs to promote a fun, relaxed work environment. In honor of April Fools' Day, we revisited a story we brought you last year by scouring the country for more hilarious office hi-jinks. Read on for inspiration or for a good laugh.Prank #1: Jello-O Stapler--With a TwistPranksters: Sharon Howell, senior account executive, along with other colleagues who helped with logisticsVictim: Bryan Pope, account managerScene of the Crime: LEWIS Public Relations, San FranciscoThe Mission: Howell decided to test out the Jello-O prank Jim pulled on Dwight from The Office. While he was gone, Howell and several colleagues nabbed his Statue of Liberty figurine from his desk and turned it into a green Jello-O mold. The souvenir was special to Pope since he had relocated to San Francisco after living in New York his whole life.Howell carefully placed her digital camera on his desk to capture his reaction upon finding his beloved statue morphed into Jello-O. After returning, Pope laughed as he sat down at his desk and said, ""This is awesome! Now it's even more valuable."" According to Howell, Pope thought it was so funny, that he refuses to wash off the Jello-O.Prank #2: Read Between the LinesPrankster: Jenn Galdes, on behalf of her client, Chef Grant Achatz of Alinea restaurantScene of the Crime: Grapevine Public Relations Inc., ChicagoThe Mission: Jenn Galdes shook up the food world last year by concocting a fake press release on behalf of her client, Chef Grant Achatz, and his restaurant, Alinea. Her idea was to pretend Achatz decided to shut down the restaurant on its two-year anniversary to pursue a career in acting. Galdes says the goal of her prank, aside from some publicity, was to show the chef's playful side.At the end of the press release, Galdes included one line to tip off recipients. It read: For media requests or more information, or to discuss the meaning of today's date, please call Jenn Galdes at Grapevine PR. The prank generated plenty of buzz for the restaurant.Prank #3: ""I Can't Hear You!""
Pranksters: Allison Yochim, Travis Coggin, Gil Jenkins, all account coordinators; Chris Iafolla, senior account executiveVictim: John Fitzpatrick, account coordinatorScene of the Crime: SHIFT Communications, Brighton, MassachusettsThe Mission: It all started when Coggin decided to pull a prank on Fitzpatrick, an Irish native who already received plenty of grief for his thick accent and occasional misunderstanding of American customs. Coggin altered Fitzpatrick's office phone by covering the mouthpiece with tape that was the exact same color as the phone. When Fitzpatrick left his desk, Coggin would add another piece of tape to the phone. It soon became a team prank--Yochim and Jenkins kept an eye out for Fitzpatrick and found reasons to convince him to get out of his seat.While this was happening, Fitzpatrick started noticing people couldn't hear him as well, so he turned the volume up and asked people to try calling him on other lines. The group then recruited John's manager, Iafolla, to call Fitzpatrick more frequently. By day two of the mission, Fitzpatrick began inspecting his phone and eventually found the tape. ""It was fun while it lasted,"" Yochim says.Prank #4:Yppah Sloof LirpaPrankster: Jeff Rice, former chief communications officerThe Victim: Recipients of the company's corporate newsletterScene of the Crime: CROSSMARK, Plano, TexasThe Mission: In 2005, Rice decided to spice up a corporate newsletter by publishing a false story that generated plenty of buzz. At the time, he worked for CROSSMARK, a business services company within the consumer goods industry. In the article, Rice wrote about a new transportation aid developed by Sloof Lirpa, a Scandinavian high-tech startup. He mentioned their patent-pending Electronic Signal Altering Device, promising to change traffic lights to green in advance through radio frequency signaling and modification. He went on to describe the impact the device could have on a company's vehicle fleet by ramping up speed and efficiency, ultimately saving time and money.When the story broke, Rice says management was hounded by thousands of incoming calls and e-mails. Responses ranged from accolades to investment inquiries. Finally, Rice broke down and admitted that the article was all part of an April Fools' hoax. If Sloof Lirpa looks funny to you, that's because it's actually April Fools, spelled backward.Rice says the company's CEO had a keen sense of humor, and actually offered him praise for his creativity--right before sending him back to his keyboard to send out an explanation and apology to all newsletter recipients.Prank #5: Dude, Where's my Scooter?
Pranksters: Bage Anderson, Greg Kemp, Darrell McKinnon and Todd BynumThe Victim: John ClaybrookScene of the Crime: KTXS-TV, Abilene, TexasThe Mission: This prank went down over 20 years ago--but its perpetrators are still laughing about it. After Claybrook rode up to the TV station on his new scooter, he bragged to his fellow colleagues about the money he saved on the purchase price and on gas. From that point on, Anderson, Kemp, McKinnon and Bynum made it their mission to wipe the smug look off Claybrook's face and put him in his place.So when Claybrook was busy working one day, the cohorts picked up the scooter from the parking lot and added a bow, and placed a box and a pad of paper next to it, along with a sign saying, ""Register here to win."" The team of pranksters even wrote a script for a prize giveaway sponsored by the station, and gave it to Claybrook to produce. Of course, he had no idea the scooter the station was giving away was his own ride.After his shift, Claybrook left the building, realized his scooter was missing and canvassed the entire station searching for it--even walking through the lobby and passing the scooter twice without noticing it. Eventually the crew fessed up and returned the scooter to a livid Claybrook. In the days following the prank, Claybrook brought his ride into the station, leaving it near his office to prevent it from being nabbed again.Prank with Caution

/answer/221338,Do you legally have to advertise an open position in your company?,,"																																	It is a good management practice to post job openings internally to give employees a chance to apply, find out more about the job, discover what they may need to do to be best qualified in the future for such a job, etc.  Sometimes management may not be aware of all of the skills, experience, abilities, knowledge, and career interests of all employees.  Posting jobs helps to provide a way for employees to exhibit these and gain exposure to other managers or areas of the company.
However, the appointment of a position is a management decision. The exception to this rule, would be if there is a disseminated policy or a standard practice that all job openings at the company are routinely posted internally for a specified period of time and that internal applicants get first consideration. Even so, most of these kinds of policies have a disclaimer for specific situations to provide management the discretion necessary to act in a timely fashion and protect the best interests of the company.

/answer/221337,Is it legal to ask an employee about their health history?,,"																																	I have to assume that you feel you have a legitimate reason for asking an employee to share his health history with you, but generally speaking, an employee s health history is private and personal information. If your company requires a physical examination, the employee s health history may be gathered as part of that examination by the medical facility doing the pre-employment physical, but even so, it should not be a matter of discussion between you and the employee. You really should only ask questions relating to the employee s ability to do his/her bona fide job tasks.
If the employee is not doing his job, the behaviors should be assessed and the employee should be given a chance to remedy the problematic behavior(s). If you suspect any employees of having a health problem or disability that is affecting their ability to do the job, it would be advisable to deal with the observable behaviors that are affecting your perception of their competence in their role instead of delving into the employees' health history. If the employee volunteers information that he cannot do the job for medical reasons, ask for documentation from his physician regarding what job duties he can do, under what kind of duration, and so forth. Then, accommodate these restrictions if you can.

/answer/221323,How can we enhance our maternity leave program beyond our legal obligations?,,"																																	Hello,
While some states have more demanding requirements, in a nutshell, the legal obligations are to treat maternity the same as any other illness and to abide by the FMLA and any state-required leave for reasons similar to the FMLA definitions.
Being family oriented probably also means that you care about the welfare of each employee's family regardless of whether the person is not able to work temporarily due to having a baby or because of another kind of illness.  Plus, it is important to be fair.
Having a new member in the household is an additional financial burden and other kinds of illnesses can cause negative financial impacts as well.  So, the best thing you can give would be a paid ""maternity leave"" which really should be your short-term disability policy.   That is, if you already offer short-term disability, that is great.  If the employees are paying a portion of the cost, you may want to have the company pay more of the cost or the entire cost of the short-term disability insurance premiums.  You could also institute a self-insured short-term disability program, which essentially extends sick leave for documented serious, longer term conditions.  You can use the FMLA definitions if you like and run the paid time off concurrently with the FMLA (or state-mandated similar programs) mandating unpaid time off work.  If you do not offer company-paid or self-insured short-term disability, this would be an excellent time to start.  Long-term disability is generally an inexpensive kind of insurance to provide to employees as well.
Allowing new moms--and dads--a more flexible work schedule for a defined period of time after birth or adoption might also be a great thing to offer.  If the company wants to work with a specialties vendor and design a standard basket of wonderful baby necessities and luxuries with the company logo on each, that would be fun and well-received.  You could have employees who are new moms and dads suggest what should go into such a basket.  It would also make the employee feel valued.  Most women need to buy some new clothes after the baby, so a gift certificate to a nice department store in the general vicinity with a card instructing her to use it on herself would be great too.
Do you offer paternity leave?  Being truly family oriented includes helping new dads help out with some of the work load caused when a new baby arrives.  Send the family that nice basket of baby stuff and send the dad's wife the gift certificate to a nice department store.

/article/188864,Protect Valuable Company Data,Your most valuable business asset may also be your most intangible one: data. Everything from customer credit card numbers to employee records to pricing information needs protection.,"						This story appears in the February 2008 issue of Entrepreneur. Subscribe  Michael Kogon, 38, founder and CEO of IT consulting and interactive marketing firm Definition 6, has a simple philosophy when it comes to sensitive data: ""If you don't need it, don't store it."" Common sense is a big component of data security. ""You can solve 99 percent of your problems with 1 percent of the effort by doing simple things,"" says Ira Winkler, security expert and author of Spies Among Us. For digital data, a strong bundle of security software, including anti-virus, anti-spyware, firewalls and encryption, is a must.While digital data gets a lot of attention, paper data can be especially vulnerable. ""We have both personal shredders and a company shredding area,"" says Kogon, who projects 2008 sales of $11 million for his Atlanta company. ""We have a third party handle our document disposal."" Winkler reminds entrepreneurs not to overlook things like notes written on scraps of paper or passwords taped to monitors.And the same security policies that are used in the main office should be enforced with telecommuters, says Winkler. To protect off-site data, Definition 6 gives workers remote access to computers that are monitored by the central office and keeps comprehensive logs of who accesses what.Laptops are another source of concern for mobile entrepreneurs. Biometrics, password protection and encryption can all be used to stymie laptop thieves. Still, don't let your laptop out of your sight, and be aware of where you're using it. But the best policy is to prevent sensitive information from ever making its way onto a laptop. ""Our consultants are trained to leave business information that is confidential on the encrypted servers and to not download it locally,"" says Kogon. Most important, train employees to handle sensitive information properly. It's not just about protecting data; it's about protecting your business and your customers.",Growth Strategies,2008-02-01 00:00:00
/article/189744,10 HR Resolutions for 2008,"This year, make it your goal to become a better manager. Here's how.","It's time to review the past year and think about how to improve ourselves and our workplace for the coming year. Some of us go on a corporate diet and plan to pare down expenses. Some of us vow to work harder and use our time more wisely. Still others plan to get along better with direct reports.As entrepreneurs, you face the challenge of implementing positive change within your company. Here are 10 employee-related resolutions you should consider for 2008:Develop and share goals with your employees. Identify where you want your company to go and how you can get there. The goals should be specific, measurable, attainable, realistic and timely. Next, make sure that every employee knows and understands what to do to achieve those goals.Clarify roles and job descriptions. Identify specifically what each person does and should be doing. Ensure that everyone knows how his or her efforts contribute to the organizational success. Unclear roles lead to conflict, disappointment, hard feelings and decreased morale. You can easily avoid these negatives when job descriptions are accurate and clear.Develop an employee volunteer program. Gather a group of employees and think of ways your company can ""give back to the community."" Employees will see this as a positive step your organization is taking to assist others. This is usually a great morale booster, too. You've been making an impact on your company; now you can do the same for your community.Manage by walking around. Get out of your office. See what your employees are doing. Talk with them so they know you're interested in their work. Discover how well people are getting along with each other. Identify frustrations that employees have with each other and with their work. Get to know them as human beings, not just employees. Be available to answer questions, clarify options and interpret company goals. Become a valued resource to them.Address potential sources of conflict before they erupt. Talk with your employees and identify what gets in the way of their achievement. It could be resources, tools, budgets, processes or even managers. Your task is to find these bottlenecks and remove them. Apply proven techniques to lower tensions and build a positive work environment.Survey the corporate climate. Pinpoint the strengths and limitations of your organization. These could be your people, your management structure, the way employees are treated and managed, the clarity of goals, roles, process and systems, and the effectiveness of personal interactions. Then take action to improve the situation.Involve employees in plans for organizational change. Form a team to address the issues discovered in your survey. Before implementing any changes, convene groups of employees to discuss the need for changes and how those changes will be implemented. Make sure employees feel involved in the process. Participation will reduce resistance to the changes.Identify your stars and reward them. Everyone likes to know when they're doing a good job. The compliments validate their efforts and document their success. Make sure that your top performers know you appreciate their work and that you reward them with money, recognition or advancement.Develop a management training program. Build your future managers now; don't rely on chance. Identify the core competencies that have led to success in your current managers and leaders. Then develop those factors in other employees so that you have a continual supply of qualified individuals managing and leading your organization.Offer a periodic social hour. This will allow employees to develop collegiality, share ideas in an informal atmosphere and get to know one another. This can be done inside or outside of the work place. This usually leads to increased employee satisfaction and interest in working with others.Dr. David G. JavitchDr. David G.

/answer/221294,How can I hire more employees and retain them with a seasonal business?,,"																																	For people who own businesses that require employees for specific periods of time, it is a good idea to develop a list of local sources of the kind of talent needed.  If you need techs, for example, perhaps there is a local vocational school or other schools that might have young people seeking work for their spring and summer breaks.  Perhaps contacting other kinds of enterprises that operate in the opposite season (e.g., those catering to things like snow plowing/removal comes to mind) would help you find some people.  The local unemployment office may be able to help you identify other such employers as they are usually on top of companies that lay off workers in the spring and rehire in the fall.  Another idea is to provide flex hours to the degree possible and job sharing. That way you can attract people who need to work but maybe not full-time or 9:00 to 5:00.  Providing a bonus for those who stay on board for the entire season may help you too.

/answer/221288,Should our small business freely share monthly and yearly revenue figures with all employees?,,"																																	While I'm a big believer in ""open book management,"" it's important to make sure that your employees' goals are aligned with the goals of your company. This means not simply sharing your monthly, quarterly or annual financial results, but letting your employees know what they can do to improve those results and giving them a financial incentive to help you do that. Such incentives may take the form of a company-wide bonus pool, a sales compensation plan or a profit-sharing plan. The key is to make sure that whatever incentive plan you put in place takes your company where it needs to go. There's no point in jeopardizing product quality or customer relationships for the sake of short-term sales or profit goals.

/answer/221271,"After looking at the end-of-year sales figures, how should I determine bonuses for my staff?",,"																																	I think that your question is not how to determine how much each person receives as a bonus but rather how much the bonus  pot  should be that you ultimately divide up based on each individual s achievements against
goals, regular job performance, attendance, length of service, and/or whatever other factors that you want to include and the contributions you wish to reward.
If you intend to give out discretionary bonuses, you should budget at the beginning of the fiscal period for what you think that you will be able to afford just as you do for other compensation factors:salaries, overtime, and benefits.
Most companies base the amount of money set aside for bonuses on profitability.In fact, many enterprises refer to their bonus program as  profit sharing.""  If the company does not make a profit, no bonuses are given.  If the company makes a profit, a percentage of the profit goes into the bonus  pot  to be applied in an organized, pre-determined way to reward the people who were most instrumental in the company actually succeeding and being profitable in the preceding period. 
In start-up and rapid growth situations, there may be unprofitable periods and the company may still need/want to give discretionary incentives such as bonuses in order to reward and retain the best talent. In this kind of situation, the chief financial officer will need to calculate a bonus pool as a percentage of the overall direct compensation that the company can afford to pay out and remain financially sound.

/answer/221246,How do I start hiring my first employees?,,"																																	You will need to define the kinds of jobs you need to fill, hours that the people you will want the people to work, and then determine what the market (pay) rates are for such workers. I recommend contacting your local state unemployment office to obtain whatever assistance they have to offer. It varies from state to state, but these state-operated resources have come a long way in providing needed services to employers. They can probably guide you on the forms that you will need to have each employee complete (e.g., W-4, I-9) as well as the state-required reporting requirements on new employees. Also, many offer free job posting online and other Internet-based services. You should also visit the federal department of labor website (www.dol.gov) to help you understand how to properly classify your employees for pay purposes (e.g., exempt or non-exempt) and see what other information there might be helpful to you. 
At some point, you will need to decide whether to learn to prepare payroll properly and submit the reports and withholding amounts to the proper agencies or use an outsourced solution which will save you many headaches. It is a good idea to have at least an outline for training new employees prepared in advance and some basic operating rules, too.  Keep in mind that most workers want benefits such as health coverage and paid time off (e.g., vacation, etc.) So, be prepared for that, if you want to find and keep the best people. In fact, attracting and retaining talented workers is another topic, but an important one. Above is just how to prepare for bringing people on board.

/article/188460,Conducting Employee Reviews,Employee reviews should benefit both of you. Here's how to make the most of them.,"With the end of the year approaching, now is an excellent time to take inventory of your most important business assets. Your employees should be at the top of that list.Keep in mind that employee assessments should be an ongoing process, not something that happens once a year. An effective year-end assessment involves reading the notes you've been making about employees' performance and attitude throughout the assessment period. (If you haven't been taking notes this year, it's well worth considering for next year.)This annual or semi-annual assessment allows you to provide and receive feedback. It's also a wonderful chance to summarize your perceptions of an employee's performance and compare it to the employee's self-appraisal. And you can share and compare views and plan for the new year.Performance appraisal or assessment interviews allow you to do the following:Re-cap positive and negative events, interactions, attitudes and productivity during the past evaluation period;Assess individual and team strengths, limitations and obstacles;Identify opportunities for achievement, growth and promotion; andCreate measurable and achievable goals for the next six to 12 months.The best way to recount the past year is to use terms that describe behaviors and actions. This method reduces employee defensiveness, and your language can be more concrete and specific. Simply saying, ""You did a good job,"" or ""You need to improve your productivity,"" is not effective.These comments are too general. What does ""improve your productivity actually mean?"" Does it encourage the employee to come to work on time? To put forth more effort? How much effort? In what areas and circumstances? With whom? When? And most importantly, how?On the other hand, statements that are measurable and specific can be worked on more effectively. Here's an example: ""In the coming year, I would like to see you increase your daily productivity by 12 percent.""""Ensure that you follow up with your team leader every time you complete a task"" is a very specific instruction. The outcome is that both you and the employee will then know exactly how, when, where, with whom and under what circumstances the employee will be successful. The words ""improve"" and ""successful"" will now be explicit.Implementing an Appraisal ProcessBegin by notifying employees that you would like to have a meeting with them to evaluate their work during the previous year. This performance appraisal time will be a mutual sharing of perceptions regarding employee accomplishment. Then give them a copy of the appraisal form you will use so that they can read it, reflect on the past year and complete it prior to the interview. Encourage them to emphasize areas both in which they did well and areas in which they need further growth and development, especially the former.Additionally, have them consider their goals for the next six to 12 months. These should be ""stretch"" or ""growth"" goals--just out of reach of the employee's current performance to encourage working harder in the same or new areas, but not so far as to cause frustration or failure.Like the performance appraisal itself, these goals need to be action-oriented, specific and measurable. That way, the employee will know exactly what he and you expect and how success will be defined and determined. By reflecting on the goals and putting them in writing, the employee increases the probability of achieving them.At the same time that the employee is preparing for the meeting, you'll also need to map out what you want to accomplish. Conceivably, your views and the employee's views will differ. That's OK; that's what perceptions are all about. The appraisal interview is an excellent opportunity to share perceptions around specific behaviors and translate them into realistic and achievable goals.To accomplish that, recall specific events, interactions, attitudes and productivity from the past year. It can be very helpful to write them down and put them in the employee's folder when they occur, as a reminder to yourself for the appraisal. Don't let that stop you from ""catching your employees doing something right"" and telling them about it at the time it occurs. In planning for the session, make sure you can balance your comments with examples of behaviors that were both effective and ineffective. This isn't the time to ""beat up"" on anyone; nor, however, is this the time to gloss over inadequacies or errors. Remember, your goal is to achieve optimal productivity in a positive environment.If improvements are necessary, be ready to point them out. However, when need-to-improve statements are made, they should be couched with positive statements to improve the likelihood that the negative statements will be heard, accepted and acted upon. For example, you might say, ""I liked the way you handled the irate customer yesterday. That same kind of even temperament and politeness, however, are needed in your actions with the customers all the time.""Finally, conduct your feedback portion of the interview. Remember, if you start the interview with your perceptions, then the employee might feel the need to respond defensively to your statements. Therefore, allow the employee to ""go first"" to share his views. Then you can comment on similarities and differences in perception, keeping in mind that this interview is about improving attitude, employee and employer satisfaction, and performance in achieving goals.Before the interview is completed, make sure that both the employee and you know specifically and measurably what went well this past year and what did not. Ensure that you agree on concrete plans to maintain and increase positive performance, while minimizing or eradicating negative performance. Both of you need to agree on future behavioral goals to achieve success, along with benchmarks during the coming year to measure accomplishment.Dr. David G. JavitchDr. David G.

/answer/221229,What do you do when an employee demands more money?,,"																																	It depends to a great degree on what basis you are paying the employee.  That is, do you have a rational compensation system whereby accurate jobs descriptions exist for all positions and jobs are evaluated using basic compensation factors like responsibility, authority, job knowledge, job skills, and unusual working conditions? Do you have a salary grading system whereby individuals are paid within prescribed ranges based on their levels of expertise? Are you adjusting these ranges by utilizing cost of living increases each year and are specific jobs benchmarked using local market data? Do you have associated merit increase and promotional increase matrices that coincide with a solid performance management system? Have you calculated the value of your indirect compensation package (medical, dental, disability, life insurance, retirement plan, paid time off program, etc.) so that you can explain those aspects of compensation to employees with accuracy and confidence?
If the answers to most of the above questions are,  No,  you may not know whether you are paying appropriately or not, which makes your response to the employee demanding more money rather tenuous. This is one reason why employment experts recommend having a well planned compensation system that can stand up to scrutiny by employees.
If the answers to most of the above questions are  yes  and the employee is valuable to the company, use the system and market data on the employee s job to determine if the employee is due consideration at this time. If so, give him/her that consideration and put together a plan to put and keep him/her on track regarding his/her pay package. For some employees, market adjustments make sense and in other cases performance bonuses might be in order.
If the employee is either not all that valuable or has essentially issued an ultimatum to you (i.e.,  If I don t get a raise right now, I will leave, ) tell him/her that you do not respond to ultimatums and be prepared to lose that employee.
People talk and you may have ramifications regardless of what you decide to do regarding the employee making the demand. That is, if you give a compensation increase, others in similar or same jobs may expect or demand the same. If you do not give a compensation increase,
others may see this as a sign of stinginess that means that they should seek jobs elsewhere.
My best advice:Install a well-designed compensation system, communicate it to employees so that they understand and appreciate it, then use that system to forestall this kind of dilemma in the future.

/answer/221223,"What is the average cost for bringing on a new employee including the interview process, hiring and training?",,"																																	This is a very important subject as we inch closer to 2010--which is predicted by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics to be when we encounter the most severe shortage of skilled workers in the history of this county. The message should be clear to employers that it just makes good sense to keep the good employees that are on board. Following are a few pertinent facts.
According to John Dooney, manager of strategic research at the Society for Human Resource Management, if no other employee leaves due to the departure of the original departing employee, the cost of losing an employee is about 38 percent of the departing employee s annual wage. If another employee of similar rank/pay leaves the percentage doubles. Here are some key factors to use in calculating the cost of turnover:
Separation Processing Costs:
-exit interviewer's time
-departing employee's time
-administrative functions relating to the departure
-separation pay associated with the departure
-unemployment tax related to the departure
Replacement Hiring Costs: 
-cattracting applicants
-pre-employment administrative expenses
-entrance interviews
-aptitude, skill, drug etc. testing
-hiring decisions meetings
-post employment physical exams
-post-employment information gathering (records, payroll, etc.)
-signing bonus
-employee finder's fee
Training New Hire Costs:
-information literature (manuals, brochures, policies, etc.)
-general orientation
-job orientation
Lost Productivity and Lost Business Costs:
-additional overtime to cover the vacancy wages and benefits saved due to the vacancy 
-performance differential while new employee gets up to speed
-low morale-related time wasted due to ""water cooler grumbling""
-lost customers, sales, profits due to the departure
In summary, employee turnover takes a powerfully negative toll on the bottom line. Every company should calculate its rate of turnover and the cost of turnover at least for key positions for benchmarking purposes. Then, strategies should be developed to reduce turnover and, thus, increase profitability.

/article/186872,Rewarding Employees Creatively,"If you don't have the money for large bonuses or extravagant end-of-the-year parties, consider these methods to thank employees.","The end of the year is rapidly approaching. You want to demonstrate your appreciation for your employees, but don't have the discretionary funds for a large, formal party or bonuses.As the entrepreneurial boss, you have two criteria to meet:You want to celebrate the holiday season.You want to recognize the efforts and accomplishments of your employees.If you can't afford to throw a party, don't feel guilty. Often at these events, someone drinks too much or acts inappropriately. This can ruin the fun and create awkwardness at the office for those guilty of indiscretion.Nevertheless, employees often assume that most companies will have some kind of an end-of-the-year celebration. In addition to celebrating the holiday, it's the perfect opportunity to recognize your employees' efforts and accomplishments. And why not? People need to have their self-esteem reinforced. They try hold the jobs that will bring them the most fulfillment, whether that comes from salary, job satisfaction, status, power or other factors.And recognizing employee actions, efforts and accomplishments is a very significant way to motivate your workers to increase their achievement levels. When their attempts pay off, they feel satisfied and productive. It's a win-win situation for the employee and the employer.You shouldn't wait until the end of the year, however, to recognize your employees. You should be doing this on an ongoing basis and certainly during the performance appraisals held semi-annually or quarterly. At the end of the year, you can complement your earlier efforts by publicly recognizing the good work of your employees. Basically, what you want to say is, ""We value you and thank you for your performance this past year.""In addition to the formal party, bonuses are another common end-of-the-year way to recognize employee achievement. But a financial reward is just one way to say thanks. It does have some disadvantages.Some research proves that point. Unfortunately, within a very short period of time, the employee actually forgets about the bonus. In any case, a few months down the line, the money no longer serves as a motivation. In fact, when the Wirthlin Worldwide organization asked employees how they used their bonus money, it found the following:29 percent paid bills18 percent couldn't remember where the money went11 percent purchased gifts11 percent purchased household items11 percent put it in savingsRewarding employees can be done in many other ways using just a little creativity. Here's a list of some alternatives to the typical and expensive company party. Some are especially noteworthy for smaller companies whose budget isn't very large.Take the staff out to dinner.Take the employees to lunch and then give them the rest of the afternoon off.Allow employees to leave at noon on four Fridays during the year.Allow employees to come in late on four Monday mornings during the year.Go to a movie.Recognize employee successes at any of the above events.Provide a certificate for dinner, a spa, a massage, entertainment, sporting events, bookstores, department stores, travel, cooking lessons, cultural events or a weekend at a nice hotel.Contribute to a charity or cause in the employee's name.Distribute a turkey or fruit basket.Have a party for the kids--or nieces, nephews or grandchildren--of the employeesPurchase a prepaid credit or gift card.Participating in community events is another way to demonstrate your company's commitment to the neighborhood. While it does not specifically recognize employee achievement, it does let everyone know that the company is interested in the wellbeing of others and wants to be a good corporate citizen. In so doing, the employees can be proud of their company. Here are a few suggestions for community events:Volunteer at a homeless or women's shelter, a food bank or a soup kitchen.Bring a meal to a shelter and serve it.Collect warm clothes to give away at the shelter.Participate in a clean-up of a local area.Provide gifts for residents at a nursing home or geriatric facility.Volunteer to read at or visit a pre-school or nursing home.Volunteer at a boys or girls club.Help build a Habitat for Humanity house.Ask your employees if they have any charities or causes they would like to help.Whatever your decision, make sure that your employees feel that you value their participation and involvement in helping your organization reach its goal. Let them know that you have had a successful year and appreciate their efforts.After all, isn't that the best holiday gift?Dr. David G. JavitchDr. David G.

/article/186120,Conflict in the Workplace,Sometimes a lack of conflict can be just as bad as the alternative. It all depends on how you deal with it.,"Can conflict ever be a good thing?Two of your employees seem to be in conflict. They bicker, critique or criticize each other. Or, when you interact with your employees, the tension is high.Is this good or bad? The best answer is: It depends.The word ""conflict,"" usually conjures up negative associations, such as arguments, hatred, anger, hurt feelings, distrust and more. But what is conflict and how does it impact worker performance?Stephen Robbins, author of Organizational Behavior, defines conflict as, ""A process that begins when one party perceives that another party has negatively affected or is about to negatively affect something the first party cares about.""I define conflict simply as tension. Shakespeare once wrote that, ""Nothing is good or bad, but thinking makes it so."" Applied to tension, this means that conflict in itself is neither good nor bad. But when we add our own experiences to conflict or tension, we give it a positive or negative value. People who are afraid of conflict likely have had a negative experience with it; they may have been put down by someone, yelled at, insulted, condescended to or embarrassed.People often respond to conflict in at least three ways:They shy away from situations that even hint of conflict. They are reluctant to get involved in conversations that may be challenging, heated or potentially negative.They try to overcome their fear or reluctance by overcompensating. They react in a way that is often too loud, offensive or demeaning.They realize that not all conflict situations are negative, and they enter into the communication with an open mind, eager for an interaction.How employees deal with conflict is usually a direct reflection of the tone or atmosphere you set for your company. If you shy away from conflict, so will your employees. If you confront others in a negative manner, so will they. If you embrace conflict as a potentially positive engagement between individuals or groups, they will, too.So what are the advantages and disadvantages of conflict or tension? Robbins says to value the conflict itself and the conflict's potential for productivity as low, medium or high. Here's a look at a few possible scenarios and how you can make the most of the conflict or lack thereof.Low Conflict/Low Potential: When you don't seem concerned about what your employees do, and the interaction and conflict between you and the employees is minimal or neutral, the overall group cohesion and productivity are low. This usually occurs when employees don't care about their job or the outcome of their efforts. This could be a reaction to what they perceive as your lack of interest or concern or simply their own view of their job.This situation most often occurs in large, impersonal organizations or in bureaucracies. As the boss, you need to evaluate the quality and type of interactions existing in your company. You need to turn an apathetic, negative atmosphere into a positive, thriving one; you can do this by becoming involved in the daily activities of some of your workers or supervisors to show them a more positive and productive way to interact.High Conflict/Low Potential: Here's another situation with a similarly unfortunate outcome. When the level of conflict is high--chaos, strained or uncertain lines of authority, or unclear job processes--and the conflict is negative, employee output and cohesion are also low. Here, even though employees may care about their job, the large amount of conflict clouds their ability to get the job done effectively. This is clearly a time for you to clarify goals, tasks and processes with an emphasis on reducing negative interactions.Medium Conflict/High Potential: The third scenario involves a medium amount of conflict. You and your employees can challenge each other, refute thoughts, offer innovative alternatives and problem solve. This is all done without offending one another. The result of this moderate level of conflict is high cohesion and high output. Employees believe in what they are accomplishing, and they feel committed to the boss, the project and the outcome. This is the optimal combination of tension and productivity.The message here is that conflict is natural. It occurs in every organization. However, the process of engaging in conflict doesn't have to be negative and counterproductive. In fact, it can be positive. It all depends on how you view the tension that gets created and what you do with it. Now go have a productive conflict.Dr. David G. JavitchDr. David G.

/answer/221194,What do I do when I find out a key employee is looking for another job?,,"																																	A lot depends on your situation and industry.  Is ""client stealing"" an issue?  If it is, you need to immediately find measures to protect yourself and your data.
In our current employment climate it is close to impossible to prevent an employee from looking elsewhere.  Today, most professionals view their careers, not their company, as their first priority.   This is likely the result of the perception that the corporation's commitment is to the shareholders and not the employees.  But, whatever the reason, the days of the ""company man"" are just about gone.
You may want to call the employee in for an open and honest discussion.  While you may not be able to turn things around, you may be able to learn where you missed the mark so that you can both part on good terms with this employee and avoid this issue in the future.  Here is my 6-step plan for holding a difficult conversation. Prepare. Make some notes about the situation and your feelings. Write about where you are, where you want to be, and how you might get there. 
  Set the stage. Sit down at a time when you are both clear headed and able to give this important conversation the time and energy it deserves. 
  Speak from the heart. Do not point fingers of blame.  Instead focus on finding a solution that works for both of you.  
  Listen, listen, listen. Listen as if you are an outside observer with no prior knowledge of the situation. Twenty years in the mediation business has taught me that there are at least two sides to every story. You may be very surprised when you hear the rest of the story. 
  
   Define the emotions. Your situation is ripe for feelings of dismissed, discounted, disenfranchised, or disrespected. Sometimes, just defining that emotion and realizing that both of you feel the same way is enough.  However, when there has been a breach of trust, it is usually impossible to get things back to the way they were.  Those are the times when the best you can hope for is closure on a somewhat positive note.  Give yourselves time to think, process the information, and cool down.

/article/185398,Getting the Most Out of Each Employee,Learning how to deal with different working styles is a sure way to improve productivity.,"What are the signs of lowered performance in your organization? To start, employees don't look busy. Individual, team or unit productivity has decreased from where it should be. Morale is down. And you sense that ""things"" could be better.If these are the signs, what are the effects? Certainly workers could be more satisfied; but they're not. Their lack of energy results in less spontaneity and productivity. Revenue and profitability suffer, as does individual satisfaction.So what can you do? First take the temperature of the work environment. You need to gather data to support your thoughts and impressions; compare the current quarter's numbers with those from previous quarters. Look at and compare individual rates of productivity. Then gather impressions from other supervisors or managers to share and compare individual perspectives and perceptions. Finally, summarize your data into conclusions.Addressing the EmployeesNext prepare to meet with the employee in question. This isn't a formal performance interview; it's simply a conversation supported by factual data and impressions. Start by asking the employee what his or her perception of work output is. Sometimes employees don't realize that their performance has been decreasing or that an issue exists. Sometimes they may be aware of the issue, but try to hide the matter, hoping you don't notice. The issues can be professional or personal, but either way, they can be distracting the employee from optimal job performance. That's where you, as the boss, need to intervene. Pause and then present your data comparing current performance with past performance, as well as your perceptions of the problem.Your goal is to help the employee identify the cause of the decreased productivity and motivation. This is where Douglas McGregor, a renowned motivation theorist, can offer insight into what the motivational issues and results may be. Stephen Robbins details some of his important theories in Essentials of Organizational Behavior.McGregor would suggest that you identify the amount of direction the employee needs:Some people need clear and very specific input from a supervisor as to what a particular task entails, who to involve, what the final product or service will look like, and what the steps are to accomplish the goal. They expect management to provide formal direction, and they don't seek additional responsibility. When job specifics aren't provided, aren't clear or aren't sufficient, the employee won't be motivated. His or her work performance will be less than optimal. It's a lose-lose situation for everyone.To increase output, satisfaction and success for this type of worker, simply be more precise, detailed and explicit about the goals, processes and people involved in the project or task. This solution assumes, of course, that you have the time and patience to devote to this employee. If you don't, then he or she will most likely not be effective. Ironically, that person will tend to blame you for not being a good boss and providing enough input and encouragement.Other employees don't like, need or want a lot of structure , input and direction from you. These workers function very well when you give them minimal amounts of control or oversight. They're capable of self-direction and self-control, and they like and seek additional responsibility. Furthermore, they believe themselves capable of innovating and improving processes and procedures. These self-motivated and usually high-performing employees are a joy to work with because they are usually easy to get along with and, most importantly, serve as a role model for others.Both types of employees, however, can be problematic for an employer. If you're a controlling type of leader, obviously you would interact well with those employees who need your style of leadership. Similarly, if you're more of a laissez-faire leader, you would work most successfully with more independent employees. The difficulty erupts when there's a mismatch between employee and employer; when a hands-off leader works with an employee who needs a great deal of direction and structure. The same problem arises when a controlling leader works with more independent employees.Dealing with Differences in StylesIn the first case, the leader won't provide enough direction to satisfy the employee. And the employee's work, morale and productivity suffer because he or she hasn't been given enough direction. In the case of the controlling boss and the employee who thrives on freedom, this employee too will be unmotivated, unproductive and dissatisfied. He'll resent the intrusion on his job process and individualism, believing that he could function more effectively without the boss's intense direction. In both cases, the boss was well-intentioned; the problem was just that there was a mismatch between the needs of the employee and the needs of the leader.To get the most out of each employee, first ask the employee his opinion of the situation and then address the concerns. Next, help the employee understand his needs in terms of direction, structure and control. To save the situation and improve productivity, start with clarification of working styles. Then look for opportunities to reach compromises between individual needs and motivational styles.Dr. David G. JavitchDr. David G.

/answer/221128,Can you get benefits for maternity leave even if you are part-time?,,"																																	A major company would certainly have an employee policy manual that explains eligibility for medical benefits. Most companies have specific rules about employees having to work over 25 hours per week on a regular basis in order to qualify for company-sponsored medical coverage and/or other benefits programs. The length of time you are employed as a part-time employee does not normally affect your eligibility for benefits.
Benefits for maternity leave are the same as for any other medical malady. Once again, the policy manual probably covers this. But think of it this way: If you knew that you were going to have an operation of some kind, what would your leave eligibility be? If you were full-time, you would most likely be entitled to be off work as long as your primary physician said you needed to be; and your job or one very much like it would be waiting for you upon your return.
Again, if you were full-time, your company may offer short-term disability and/or long-term disability for such situations; and the FMLA (Family Medical Leave Act) would apply. However, if you are part-time, you may not qualify for either of these. Often disability insurance programs are for full-time employees only; and the FMLA requires that you work a minimum of 1,250 hours during the 12 months before requesting the leave.

/answer/221126,Should I still pay an employee for holidays after he's used all his paid time off?,,"																																	The vast majority of companies have a policy for paid time off that is for vacation, sick, and/ or personal use plus a policy regarding pay for declared ""company holidays""---ranging from 6 to 9 or so days each year.
I am assuming from your question that you are requiring people to save their vacation time to use on what would normally be declared company holidays at most companies. That is unusual; and I hope that all employees understand that they are supposed to be saving their vacation time for holidays.
The Fair Labor Standards Act requires you to pay an exempt employee for the entire week in any work week in which the employee has put in work time. This would not be an exception. It would be different for a non-exempt employee. You would not be required to pay a non-exempt employee for a holiday after s/he s used all of his/her paid time off as long as you apply this rule consistently.

/answer/221125,"If I hire people that aren't U.S. citizens, can they get a green card if they pay their taxes?",,"																																	There is a great deal more involved in getting a  green card  than paying taxes! If hiring immigrants makes the best sense for your business, follow some good advice from SCORE: 
--Understand the benefits: Immigrants are often well-educated,
intelligent, loyal and dedicated.
--Follow the law: Contact your Immigration and Naturalization Service field office for information and required forms. For locations, visit the INS Web site at www.uscis.gov. 
--Keep things simple: Limit the number of languages spoken to reduce the need for interpreters.
--Expect a community to develop among those who speak the same
language. It s OK. They can help and support each other and assist in
interpretation.
--Encourage your employees to learn English. Send them to courses offered locally or provide classes on-site.
An employer can certainly choose to  sponsor  immigrants if there is a genuine shortage of citizens to fill the jobs that the employer has; but it can be expensive and time-consuming. And as we have all been reading, there are  crack downs  on the horizon for employers who are employing illegal immigrants with bogus social security numbers. Ignorance will no longer be an acceptable excuse; so I urge you to educate yourself if you plan on hiring immigrants.

/answer/221096,How do I get health insurance that covers multiple states?,,"																																	There are really only a few carriers that write health care coverage in all of the states.  The best thing to do is deal with a knowledgeable employee benefits broker who will gather the demographics data on your employees and provide you with all of the different programs that these specific carriers have available where your offices/operations are.  Even with only a few carriers, there will be multiple options (PPO, POS, HMO) and a variety of deductibles, levels of coverage, and varying rates.  However, be sure you are comparing  apples to apples  when you look at the rates quoted to you as these should not vary much for the same programs/same carriers.  Interview a few different brokers or take the recommendation of someone you trust to find the best benefits broker.  
Really compare the services that they provide such as handling the initial enrollments for you and the annual open enrollment process, responding to employee questions/problems promptly, and issuing benefits statements for your employees every year.  Check references with other companies that have used the brokers you are considering for a number of years.  Ask them for the best examples of the broker s services and the worst situation.

/answer/221095,What are my wife's health care options if I end up growing my lawn care business in to a full time job?,,"																																	There are many health care options for small businesses and for individuals as well.  Most kinds of health insurance that larger companies purchase for their employees can be obtained for companies of as few as one employee.  The rates in some states (like Florida) are set by the state for companies employing 25 or less employees.  As the lawn care business owner, you could purchase family health coverage for you and your legal dependents through the same brokers used by other businesses.  Of course, the brokers that cater to smaller companies will probably be more interested in helping you with this than broker who most often seek big business clients.

/answer/221094,Are there self-administered career tests I can give to potential hires before interviewing them?,,"																																	Yes.  There are hundreds of online tests that are inexpensive and easy to administer.  Kenexa  ProveIt  offers over 800 online tests ranging from different levels of accounting to technical proficiency to very common office skills (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, typing tests, math, spelling, grammar, etc.) and testing in a number of different languages, too.  All are well defined and provide instant test scores to the administrating company, as well as benchmark data, and detailed reports.  It really only makes good sense to use testing before investing time in interviewing.  After all, no matter how nice a person is, if s/he does not have the requisite skills to do the job, it is not necessarily kind to bring him/her in and interview him/her.  Even if there is plenty of time to train a new person, having the data on his/her level of skills in required areas as s/he is brought on board will help in developing/obtaining the proper training to bring him/her up to speed most expeditiously.  So, testing still makes good sense.

/answer/221093,Do businesses normally reimburse employees if they decline their health insurance premium?,,"																																	It is not usual and customary, but some companies do it.  Most companies simply charge the employees enough of a portion of the premium to discourage anyone who does not need the coverage from enrolling in it.  But going the extra step to pay employees an amount of taxable income if they do not enroll for health coverage is a practice mostly used by smaller employers whose health coverage cost-per-employee is a serious expense.  As long as the employee has health coverage through another source, it is not a bad practice; but it is also not really necessary and I would not recommend that a business start doing this as a general rule.   
What I think is at the other end of the spectrum and not a good trend are the companies that are now actually requiring employees who have spouses with access to health insurance coverage to take their spouses  dependent coverage regardless of whose coverage is better for the employee and his/her family.  This new trend is worrisome on a number of levels in my opinion.

/answer/221092,What are some ways to avoid incompetence when hiring a new manager?,,"																																	First of all, be certain that you have accurate job specifications.  Outdated or otherwise inaccurate job specifications can result in honest misunderstandings regarding what the job entails and end up causing confusion about the qualifications and traits that will most likely result in a longer-term successful hire.  Objectively review resumes to assess the experience/knowledge base of each applicant and select only those who actually appear to  fit  the established criteria.  Then, use a phone screen comprised of questions that enable you to determine employability factors of the potential finalists (why are they on the job market, do their career stories make sense, what are they seeking in their next career step, etc.)  If possible, use a validated aptitude/personality dimension assessment to further narrow the field and ensure that each finalist is genuinely capable and suited for the management job.  For the face-to-face interviews, use a standardized behavioral-based questionnaire that is based on the actual job that needs to be done.  Ask everyone you interview the same questions in the same order.  Take notes.  Be sure to give each candidate time to talk.  Having a weighted  scoring system  also facilitates the objective aspects of the interviews.  When it is your turn to talk, don t sugar-coat what the management job entails.  Be honest and watch the 
body language and reactions to the stated challenges that you feel the new manager will face.  Review your notes and your scores as objectively as you can.  And finally, use your gut.  Which candidate most impressed you as having the qualities that will work well with your other team members and with you?

/answer/221091,How do I determine what type of personnel I need to hire for my small business?,,"																																	It really depends on what kind of business you want to start. If you're running a home-based service business where you're making the sales and doing the work, you may not need any staff at all except for a freelance bookkeeper. However, as your business starts to grow, you're probably going to need to hire sales and customer service staff as well as technical people who can help you deliver the service or make the product. My advice is to try to hold off as long as you can on hiring full-time employees. The more you can do with freelancers and independent contractors, the more you'll save on taxes and benefits and the longer you'll be able to save on rent by working from home.

/article/183616,Can I Work From Home?,"When an employee asks this question, having a company policy in place can make answering it much easier.","The scenario: Your business has seven employees, all of whom work at the company's only office. A situation arises where one of your employees has a work conflict. Maybe she recently had a baby, her spouse or child developed a serious medical condition, or her spouse has a short-term assignment in another state and she wants to go with him and return when it's completed.Despite the conflict, she wants to continue working for you and suggests working remotely from her home. She's your company's best employee, and you don't want to lose her.This is a tough situation, but as an employer, it's one you need to be prepared to address. Before deciding whether to allow one or more employees to work offsite, review the positive and negative aspects of both options.Why it's best to have all employees at the same site:We're creatures of habit; most of us only have worked in on-site offices. As a result, having everyone together is customary and reasonable. Bosses generally like to see and interact with employees, especially if something urgent comes up.This is especially true when you need to schedule a meeting with employees. When everyone works in the same location, you don't have to go to great lengths to find a convenient time for everyone to meet. It's simply a matter of stopping by their desks.Unfortunately, some employees work best under supervision. It's often easier to control operations when everyone is present in the same office.Why it's not necessary to have all employees at the same site:Many organizations have offices in multiple locations, whether they're in another city, state or country. In today's modern office, people can readily communicate via computer, fax, phone and videoconference. Connecting with fellow workers can be just as easy--or difficult--whether they are in the same office or completely off-site. For example, it takes the same amount of effort to call someone in the next office as in another city.Many employees who are given the opportunity to work at home are more dedicated and productive because they're so appreciative that they can meet both professional and personal needs on their own terms.Your OptionsAfter you've reviewed the pros and cons of allowing your highly valued employee to work from home, you may want to develop a written policy to protect yourself. Regardless of your decision, the issue will likely come up again.If you let one employee work from home, other employees may resent your making an exception for one person and not offering or allowing others to work from home or another remote location. If your staff is jealous, they may criticize you for giving another employee preferential treatment. Morale, worker satisfaction and productivity could begin to tumble. Customer satisfaction and revenues might drop as well.Here are a few of your options:1. Require that all employees be located on site. In this scenario, you end up losing your best employee.2. Create an on-site-only policy, but allow for exceptions under specific situations to be approved by you, on a case-by-case basis. If you implement this policy, you'll need to build in some safeguards.Be clear with others about the criteria and obligations for receiving permission to work off site and when permission can be denied. This should be a well-thought-out policy based on a rational understanding of the issues and options.Be prepared to create processes that allow at-home workers to stay in contact with on-site employees. To accomplish this, an off-site employee will need to be connected by computer, fax, phone or videoconference.To maintain good communication between on-site and at-home employees, you'll also need to establish a way for the two groups to make immediate contact with each other. This may mean blocking out a few hours when all employees need to be available. This is particularly helpful for those who work non-traditional hours.Time flexibility also provides employees the freedom to carry out other obligations that necessitate them working off-site, yet allows them to be available for crucial employee contact and communication.Each off-site employee must clearly understand all deadlines and how to meet them. When the employees are ""out of sight,"" it's easy to forget about them, as well as their tasks and responsibilities. This also means that you need to follow through to ensure that deadlines aren't missed.3 . Allow other employees to work at a remote location. The same safeguards listed above should be implemented.Whatever option you choose, it's crucial that you remain in contact with the off-site workers; otherwise they can soon feel out of touch with the organization. And being out of touch can often lead to lower-quality output and feelings of not being valued.Dr. David G. JavitchDr. David G.

/article/182360,Summertime Business Dilemmas,"When the kids are out of school, the parents sometimes become distracted employees.","It's summertime. That means vacation, fun and freedom for the kids. They need to be driven to activities, entertained and simply cared for. When all is going well and these activities run smoothly, the situation presents no problem for the working parent or you, the employer.But what happens when the caregiver arrives late or calls in sick? Or when an activity is cancelled? Or when the child frequently calls the working parent at the office to complain or in need of something? What is the parent supposed to do? And even more importantly, what are you, the boss, to do?Many people say that the business of business is business; simply stated, the work needs to be accomplished. While laudable, this goal can present a challenge, especially for the worker in question who may be a good, productive employee. That person may have a positive reputation and may want to continue doing a superior job, but childrearing demands are placing considerable pressure on that ambition.Another problem is when an employee is on the phone listening to children's complaints and trying to organize and re-organize their activities and caregivers. Clearly, the employee isn't focused on being productive. The job simply isn't getting done. Or the quality of work isn't what it could be. Also, fellow employees who are working hard may resent the time these parents take off from focusing on the work.Here are some ways that you and the parents can find a balance:Encourage parents to plan ahead. To minimize distractions, the parent can hire a nanny, a babysitter, or a neighbor to drop off and pick up the kids. He or she also can find other parents with children in similar activities to form a carpool. If your employee can't easily take time away from work to drive in the carpool, perhaps he or she can pay another parent to assume that responsibility. If the parent doesn't know other people with children, often the organization sponsoring the activities can provide the names of local families who might be willing to form a carpool.Learn about the parents' circumstances. Allow the employee to explain the circumstances and details regarding the summertime issues that might arise. Once you have been alerted to the potential for distractions, if and when those situations occur, you can be more understanding.Discuss flexible work hours. In many organizations, employees have the option of coming in ""late"" and leaving ""late,"" or coming in early and leaving early. Or if the employee needs to leave early, he or she can arrange to take work home. Make-up work also could be finished on the weekends. If an employee needs to leave early, make sure you've clearly stated what needs to be accomplished by the next morning and how the tasks can be accomplished.Suggest taking personal time. If your company doesn't allow for flexible scheduling, then the employee needs to consider taking some vacation time or personal time to take care of the child's needs. If your company's schedule and culture don't allow for flexibility, you'll have to agree to ""dock"" a certain amount of time and pay to cover the conflicting schedule demands. However, this should clearly be used as a last resort. A person's take-home pay is often sacred. Tampering with that can easily lead to a decrease in morale and productivity.Keep an open mind. Consider making an exception for employees with significant demands outside the work environment. Allow for some flexibility in the work schedule. Explain that this isn't to allow people to simply sleep late in the morning, but for dealing with urgent needs. Chances are that employees will outperform their previous productivity levels because they're so grateful that you understand their difficult situation.Dr. David G. JavitchDr. David G.

/article/177646,How to Tell an Employee He Smells,"As a business owner, you're going to have to deliver bad news every once in a while. Here's how to approach sensitive subjects without offending people.","What's so great about good news? Simple--everyone likes it. Employers don't dread telling a worker they've done a great job. They don't fret over finding a tactful way to tell an employee that everyone in the office enjoys working with them.But we all know the news isn't always good. Perhaps you have an employee who wears clothes that are too tight, one who constantly discusses a sensitive medical condition that makes other employees feel uncomfortable, or one who simply smells bad.Upsetting employees can set in motion a negative cycle. They may begin to feel bad about themselves, question their ability to do the job or resent the person who delivered the news. Hearing bad news can also cause defensiveness that protects the recipient, yet prevents him or her from truly hearing the gist of the message. Feeling bad and not focusing on the point prevents them from turning something they don't want to hear into a positive outcome.So how can you frame the news so that it's at least partially positive and therefore easier to hear and accept? First, determine whether the issue is one you could address without having to approach the offending employee directly. For instance, in the case of someone wearing clothes that are too tight or revealing, an e-mail to everyone in the company may suffice. You could say, ""With summer approaching and everyone wanting to wear cooler clothes, I want to go over the company's dress policy."" In the case of the smelly worker you could first send an e-mail that says, ""We have some employees with very sensitive allergies. Please refrain from wearing perfume or scented lotion and try to keep your smell as neutral as possible."" Maybe the culprit is some very unfortunate cologne.If you do have to approach an employee individually, start with positive feedback before moving onto the negative comments and the request for change. This method should be brief and to the point.For example, let's say that a worker comes to a team meeting unprepared and you want to say something about the situation. Beginning with a positive statement, you could say, ""Juan, I really appreciate the work that you've been doing on this committee."" Then state the negative: ""This week I noticed you didn't seem as prepared as usual."" End with a change statement: ""I want to make sure you're fully prepared with data for the next meeting."" Even offer to help create the solution: ""Are you overwhelmed right now? Is there anything I can do to help you get ready for the next meeting?"" This could also help you get to the root of the problem.In more sensitive situations--like the one involving the smelly employee--be sure to stress that you're addressing the problem because you truly care. Start by saying you've noticed the person sometimes doesn't smell quite right. Quickly explain you're saying something because you want to help them find a solution--and help their career. Ask if everything is OK and if there's anything you can do to help. Maybe the person is a busy, newly single father and sometimes sacrifices showering, but didn't think other people noticed the smell. Or maybe the person has halitosis, but didn't realize there was medication he could be taking for it.Concluding with a concrete suggestion of a change provides the recipient with a thought, action or attitude that can help him or her turn a negative situation into a positive one. In some situations, it's nearly impossible to avoid hurting someone's feelings. But once the person has time to reflect on the discussion and make a positive change, he may come to appreciate and respect your concern, honesty and tact.Dr. David G. JavitchDr. David G.

/article/176430,Top 10 Office Pranks Exposed,Find out what practical jokes workers have pulled in their office--and how to avoid taking your tricks too far.,"Are you and your co-workers meticulously planning your ideal April Fools' prank? You're not alone. Despite the fact that the lighthearted holiday falls on a Sunday this year, a Monster.com survey says one in three workers plans to play an April Fools' joke on a fellow employee. If you're looking for some inspiration, we've compiled our 10 favorite office hi-jinks. But before pulling your prank, be sure to review the guidelines from business etiquette expert Pamela J. Holland for what's workplace appropriate.Prank #1: Foiled Again . and Again and Again.Prankster: Michael Casto, former VP of design and now chief creative officer at Mindsalt Design & PR in Louisville, KentuckyScene of the Crime: An ad agency in LouisvilleThe Mission: Creative guru Casto decided to ""foil"" a co-worker while he was out of town on business. Despite inclement weather, including a tornado warning, nothing was going to stop Casto from wrapping every single item in the co-worker's office in aluminum foil. The mission, which required two industrial-size rolls of foil, took three people an hour and a half to pull off.Prank #2: What's Wrong With My Mouse?Prankster: Jerry Ostergaard, former PR director, now employed by Devry Inc. in Oakbrook Terrace, IllinoisScene of the Crime: Allegiance Telecom, Inc., based in DallasThe Mission: Ostergaard's joke is pretty simple to set up, but it managed to stump his IT technician. Ostergaard placed a small Post-It note with the words ""April Fools!"" written on it underneath his co-worker's mouse. When the technician attempted to use it, the track ball was ineffective. After about 10 minutes, he finally figured it out.Prank #3: Always Cover Your TracksPrankster: Becky Boyd, former computer sales representative, now employed with MediaFirst PR, AtlantaScene of the Crime: Hewlett-Packard Company, based in AtlantaThe Mission: While working at Hewlett-Packard, Boyd's manager, Mark, always had a jar of M&Ms on his desk that he'd dive into every day. One of Boyd's co-workers, Bill, was known for being rather anti-social and grouchy, so one April Fools' Day, they decided to play a joke on him. As soon as Bill got up from his desk, Boyd and her cohorts stole the jar of M&Ms from Mark's desk and left a trail of chocolate on the floor leading to Bill's desk and hid the nearly empty jar in Bill's credenza.Mark returned to his office and immediately noticed his M&Ms were missing. He followed the long trail through the rows of desks to where Bill was sitting. When he opened Bill's credenza and found the jar, Bill was shocked, but his fellow employees got quite a laugh.Prank #4: A Prank with PotentialPranksters: Emily Brand, account executive, with the help of her co-workersScene of the Crime: The Cannon Group, based in New YorkThe Mission: This covert plan hasn't happened yet--but it's set to go for this Monday, April 2. Brand and her co-workers are planning to pull a prank on their boss. Everyone plans on calling in with some type of excuse, leaving an empty office. The best part of the trick: A new hire is scheduled to start that day. But they won't be leaving the two alone for long. The co-workers plan on meeting at a local bakery to pick up breakfast for their boss before showing up at the office at the same time to say, ""April Fools!""Prank #5: A Joke That Ends with ""I Quit!""Pranksters: The employees of Dave Syferd & Partners, as told by Katie Robertson, PR account coordinator for Dave Syferd & PartnersScene of the Crime: Dave Syferd & Partners, based in SeattleThe Mission: When Vandy Kindred, partner and creative director for advertising and public relations firm Dave Syferd & Partners went on vacation, he had no idea what he'd be coming back to. The day before he planned on returning, employees banded together to move the contents of his office into a small cubicle. Instead of leaving his former office empty, they set it up for the president of a company who leased cubicle space from them. When Kindred stepped into his former office the next day, he was instantly baffled by the new arrangement. After asking co-workers what was going on, they escorted him to his small cubicle, and he angrily fled the office.Instead of allowing the company to demote him, Kindred decided to drive to Canada and become a park ranger. When his fellow employees hadn't heard from him for a few hours, they called him since he was expected to record audio for a client. Kindred was already sitting in line to cross into Canada, but decided to return to work in Seattle after an employee explained the joke.The Hi-Jinks ContinuePrank #6: Training with a TwistPranksters: The training class at PrintingForLess.comScene of the Crime: PrintingForLess.com, based in Livingston, MontanaThe Mission: While William Malek was in technical service representative training, he had to leave the office for two weeks to fly back to Stanford and wrap up some teaching engagements. While he was away, the rest of the training class at PrintingForLess.com got together and ran all of his equipment, including his mouse, computer screen, keyboard and phone through their shrink wrapping machine in the bindery.Prank #7: Pranking the PrankstersPranksters: The employees at WRBV-TV, as told by Brian Eckert, former program director and production manager at the station. He's now the director of Media and Public Relations at the University of Richmond.Scene of the Crime: WRBV-TV, Channel 65 in Vineland, New JerseyThe Mission: Eckert was out of the office the afternoon before April Fools' Day about 20 years ago. He and his co-workers had been involved in an escalating series of practical jokes. In his absence, his fellow employees got the key to his office and turned everything upside down, including the furniture, papers and office equipment. Unbeknownst to them, Eckert arrived unusually early the next day. He was stunned at what they'd done but decided to one-up their stunt. So he turned everything right-side up and left the office to get coffee before everyone arrived. When he got back, he unlocked his office and walked in like normal, pretending not to know what happened as they peeked into his office with confused looks on their faces. Unless they're reading this now, Eckert says they still don't know what went wrong with their April Fools' Day stunt.Prank #8: Caught in the ActPrankster: Hans Engebretson, senior account executiveScene of the Crime: OLSON, based in MinneapolisThe Mission: Advertising agency OLSON was in the middle of a dispute with the city concerning a 10-foot-tall brick statue atop their office building. Officials had asked the statue be removed, however OLSON argued the ""Brick Man"" was both their icon and a piece of art. Hoping to get CEO John Olson fired up about the dispute, Engebretson left Olson a stern message from his own cell phone, disguising his voice and warning him that the agency was being fined $400 for each day that passed since their violation notice, which at that point totaled $12,000. Olson panicked and called the agency's COO. After hearing her advice, he called the number back, but Engebretson was on another call with a client so couldn't answer. The call went to voicemail, and Olson discovered the prank. Though he sprinted toward Engebretson's desk red-faced and head shaking, they all got a good laugh out of it. OLSON won the battle, and the ""Brick Man"" remains on the rooftop to this day.Prank #9: Is That Your Final Answer?Pranksters: Kimberly Hassler, former copy writer, along with co-worker Jeff White. Hassler is now a writer with Lehigh Valley Hospital and Health Networks in Allentown, Pennsylvania.Scene of the Crime: Lieberman-Appalucci, based in Allentown, PennsylvaniaThe Mission: The senior copy writer at Lieberman-Appalucci, John, wanted to be on Who Wants to be a Millionaire in the worst way. He told White he had qualified for the show the night before when he called an 800-number and was anticipating a call that day. He warned the receptionist to page him if anyone called and no matter what, not to put any calls into his voice mail. White lured John away from his desk, while Hassler, a regular prankster, placed a fake call to him saying she was a producer with the show and would like him to call back. When John returned to his office, he saw he had a message and was annoyed with the receptionist.He frantically punched the number into his phone (which was the real number to ABC Studios in New York) and told the person who answered what he was calling about and was put on hold. Meanwhile, Hassler walked into his office and asked if she could have a month off from work to travel. When he said no, she asked, ""Is that your final answer?"" When he said yes, she asked again, and he realized what she was doing.Prank #10: The Intern and the Press ReleasePranksters: Jeff Hardison, former account executive, along with co-worker Nate James. Hardison is now employed with McClenahan Bruer Communications, based in Portland, Oregon.Scene of the Crime: A Portland, Oregon-based advertising and PR firmThe Mission: Around April 1, 2000, different teams within Hardison's former company were hiring so many new employees that the current ones were growing upset by all the new faces they didn't have a role in approving. So Hardison and co-worker, James, worked with their IT administrator to create a fake e-mail address for a ""new intern"" named something like Jessica Benet Ramsfeld. They sent out an e-mail to the entire company from her address, laden with misspellings and teenage slang. The scenario: Since ""Jessica's"" supervisors were out of the office for her first day, she ended up having to send out a news release about a new ice cream flavor for their gourmet food client. The ice cream flavor was going to be called ""Spirit Cow"" in honor of the Dalai Lama's visit. They attached a horribly written news release about the ice cream, with ""Jessica"" explaining that the release had already crossed the wire. People flipped--especially new employees who felt threatened.Pull the Perfect Prank--Without Losing Your JobIt may start out as fun and games, but there's always the occasional prank that goes a bit too far, resulting in a firing or even a lawsuit. Pamela J. Holland, COO of BRODY Professional Development in Jenkintown, Pennsylvania, says there's a balance to having some fun with your fellow employees and crossing moral and ethical boundaries. ""People need to be very careful about office pranks. While I am a firm believer in the benefits of humor and laughter in the workplace, people should really think about what they're doing before they do it,"" advises Holland.Here are some guidelines she recommends when pulling your prank:Make sure it doesn't embarrass someone or cause disruption in the workplace. Think through all possible consequences of the joke.Don't use April Fools' Day as an opportunity to ""get back"" at someone you don't like.What's OK to do at home with family or friends may not be appropriate for the workplace.If your boss is the subject of your prank, be extremely careful. You need to know this person extremely well, understand their sense of humor and never do anything that would diminish your boss's authority.Kristin EdelhauserAs Entrepreneur.com's staff writer, Kristin Edelhauser writer features, blogs and other pieces for the site.

/article/175530,When the Opposite Sex Joins the Office,Making sure your work environment is welcoming to employees of both genders requires vigilance.,"""The times they are a-changin',"" as the 1964 Bob Dylan song goes. That's especially true in the workplace where men and women are finding themselves in jobs not traditionally associated with their gender. You've likely noticed more men working as flight attendants, court reporters, administrative assistants and hair stylists. On the other hand, it's becoming more common to see women serving as construction workers, fire fighters and stock traders.That might seem like old news, yet employees who feel uncomfortable in the workplace because of their gender are far from uncommon. This can be true even in offices or departments that just happen to employ mostly one gender, such as a small accounting firm with one male and three female employees or a marketing department that consisted only of men before the ""new woman"" was hired. So, how can you make sure your workplace is welcoming for all employees, regardless of gender?Keep in mind that change is hard for most people. It can be disrupting for employees who've grown used to a certain environment. While it may seem basic, remind your employees that different workers bring diversity to the workplace in terms of work habits, skills, perspectives and resources.Beginning with the screening and interview process, make sure there's no discrimination against any candidate, especially one applying for a non-traditional position. The interviewer sets the atmosphere for the company, and most candidates are sensitive to the interviewer's cues. It's not difficult to discern whether an interviewee is being discriminated against; in fact, many job-seekers are very vigilant about this issue.Once you hire a candidate, redouble your efforts to ensure that sexual discrimination or sexual harassment doesn't occur. This can easily be accomplished with sensitivity training for all employees. It's much better to be proactive than reactive in this regard. In other words, create an atmosphere of acceptance before--not after--a problem occurs. This might mean telling male employees that their off-color jokes, while never appropriate in the workplace, are certainly out of bounds when their female colleague joins the company. Or it may mean that women can no longer talk about issues that would be offensive to their male counterparts.In addition to sensitivity training, you should serve as a model for all employees. Be vigilant about your employees' behaviors to ensure their actions and attitudes are welcoming and appropriate. Letting even one lewd comment go without reprimand can signal that you aren't serious about the rules you've established.Next, do what you should be doing when any new employee joins the company: Reiterate the mission and goals, restate the proper processes for accomplishing those goals, and continue to build self-esteem while creating a positive esprit de corps.To be effective, you must be aware of how the new employee is being treated and take swift action if there is even a hint of discrimination or ill-will from other employees. If you haven't established a safe and appropriate working situation, you are exposing yourself to the possibility of a sexual harassment or sexual discrimination suit. These negative situations can be avoided with proactive training, the right attitudes, and constant attention with reinforcement at the highest levels of the organization.Dr. David G.

/article/174342,Managing a Satellite Staff,Strong relationships and clearly outlined expectations make off-site workers part of successful whole.,"Mergers and acquisitions, plus flexible time and multiple work sites, have created the need for alternative work situations--and in many cases this means offsite teams. In the electronic age, employees at different sites can be connected by e-mail, fax, telephone and web conferencing. Whether your employees are working at a different plant, factory, office building or simply from home, addressing the issue of satellite staffs is vital to your business's success.What type of employee is best suited for off-site work? Specifically, employees must be independent self-starters who do not need an on-site supervisor. They need to be assertive enough to speak up, state views and ask for assistance before situations become critical. In addition, they must be self-critical workers who can evaluate their own work and know when input from others is needed. They must voluntarily seek advice and counsel from others without fear of appearing inadequate, unconfident or unprofessional. And most importantly, they must be able to create their own work day and schedule without the structure of a formal, eight-hour day.But what problems can arise in a satellite or home office? First, off-siters sometimes complain that they don't feel like part of the team, that an esprit de corps doesn't exist because of the physical separation between offices. Also, developing a rapport between supervisee and supervisor can be difficult since the latter isn't on-site. As a result, it's easy for milestones and deadlines to go unmet. Unsupervised work can become distracted, off-course and less than optimal. A related issue is ""out of sight, out of mind"": An off-siter's work may not be considered or valued as highly as that of on-siters. And finally, without an externally imposed structured day, work performance can suffer.So what can you do to ensure that your offsite employees' productivity and success don't falter? First, you must clearly communicate your expectations of remote workers, including key milestones and deadlines. The milestones should be firm and short term to ensure that work is acceptable, timely and coordinated with on-site employees. Feedback on progress should be specific, measurable, timely and action-oriented. Above all, your remote workers should feel that they can easily seek out a supervisor for advice, counsel and input.To further ensure accountability, goals must be clearly stated and written to guarantee agreement between all parties. An oft-stated truism applies here: ""If you don't know where you're going, you'll probably end up somewhere else."" Starting off on the wrong foot or in an inappropriate direction can spell disaster, especially when working at different sites. In addition to goals, agreed-upon standards and level of quality will help eliminate any doubt about what's required. Reporting relationships also should be outlined; each employee must clearly understand to whom he or she reports. Having the line of authority and responsibility clear greatly improves the intensity, effectiveness and quality of the reporting relationship.The final aspect of off-site management to consider is communication. Often, e-mail is the easiest and the quickest way to communicate, but it can make expressing emotion difficult and can lead to misinterpretation. Someone who is always succinct in e-mails may come across as rude to a friendlier co-worker, while a good-natured joke might lose its intended humor and be read as an insult by the recipient.The most effective means of sending and receiving messages is a combination of e-mail, faxes, regularly scheduled telephone conference calls, and video and web conferencing. The latter are particularly important since they contain the all-important aspect of seeing the people with whom you are speaking. While this visual component can help facilitate personal relationships, nothing can replace the quality of a face-to-face meeting. To maximize interpersonal interaction, create rapport between employees, and improve working and personal relationships, in-person meetings should be scheduled at least quarterly.Dr. David G.

/article/172920,Dealing With an Office Romance,"When employees become romantically involved, should you anticipate trouble? Here's some real-world advice on the matter.","Love and marriage may ""go together like a horse and carriage,"" but the question for entrepreneurs is, ""Do they go together in today's business environment?""Work, after all, is the place where many people spend more than a third of their lives, and it's possibly one of the best places where employees can find a potential mate who shares similar life goals and attitudes.But as romantic as that sounds for someone who's looking for love, dating in the workplace poses many problems for business owners. That's why many businesses have rules against office romances; some even have rules against hiring married couples.Before you find yourself facing this potentially sticky situation, let's take a look at some of the factors that come into play when potential couples begin to mix their personal lives and professional responsibilities on the job.Let's Give 'Em Something to Think About""Why the concern? We're both adults,"" your canoodling employees might say. But adults don't always act like adults, especially when they're in love--or when the person they're dating falls out of love with them.Consider these risky situations. What would happen if the couple has an argument? Would they be able to keep their personal lives separate and away from the workplace? Or would they act out their feud on the job? And would other employees be pulled into their disagreement, forcing co-workers to take sides? Would it detract from their own and/or other people's workplace productivity?And what about the issue of favoritism? For instance, if one person in the relationship supervises the other, will he or she be able to be fair and objective when delegating responsibilities or distributing work projects?The questions get even more complex when you take into account the organizational chart. Would the supervisee have the same power or influence over his or her boss as any other employee would have? Would the supervisor be able to evaluate the supervisee in a fair and equitable manner, or would the supervisee be given a more positive and lenient treatment? Would decisions be made that are motivated by the personal relationship vs. the merit of the idea or the individual(s) involved? Would the lower-level employee in the relationship be given special consideration by their partner when it came to handling tasks, responding to situations or fulfilling the job requirements?Other perils abound: Due to the closeness of the relationship, either of the employees could inappropriately or accidentally divulge information to his or her partner. This could easily occur in the course of sharing events of the day with one another. Just how sensitive is the information being passed on?An equally challenging question to ask is this: Do other employees believe that because of the special relationship and special allegiance the pair of employees has to one another, that these other employees can't discuss or complain about the other individual? If that's the case, then issues that might normally be discussed and brought out in the open might possibly remain unspoken and unaddressed. And when employees feel that communication is blocked, for whatever reason, morale can suffer. Worse yet, what if they thought the situation was bad enough that they were forced to do something drastic, like file a discrimination suit?There are other dilemmas, too, for the business owner. What happens if and when the couple breaks up? Will other employees feel the effects of the ""divorce""? Again, will they be asked or expected to take sides? Will they feel any of the hostility that may be directed at the other person in the former relationship? Will there be a negative tension in the workplace environment?You also need to consider another possible and quite serious result of a breakup, especially if there's a difference in rank between the two individuals involved. What if one party claims sexual harassment and considers a lawsuit? In this instance, one party can claim to have suffered undue pressure to remain in the relationship lest their job performance be negatively evaluated.Taking the Right Steps
Obviously, the best way to avoid the negative repercussions of a romance gone sour is to forbid your employees from dating and never hire married couples. Realistically, that could prove extremely difficult and even more challenging to enforce in today's world, although these are options that some companies have taken in an attempt to avoid this type of situation.It's extremely critical, especially as your company grows, to get ahead of the curve. The best thing to do would be to work closely with your HR person or an HR consultant to anticipate problems and then set up remedies. For instance, you might provide sensitivity training for both men and women about what constitutes sexual harassment. Or you might establish a policy that supervisors aren't allowed to date their direct reports.Your goal is to provide a professional atmosphere where your company goals can be achieved. Ideally, the working environment should be pleasant enough that your staff can enjoy themselves while being as productive as possible.Just remember, interpersonal relationships between your employees will inevitably develop. And while the outcomes of those relationships could be far more complex than you may have imagined, being aware of the potential drawbacks and what types of relationships are developing will go a long way to keeping the environment as ""hazard free"" as possible.Dr. David G.

/article/171568,Creating Loyal Employees,"When it comes to employee loyalty, the bottom line is, it's all about "",  you , u"". Here's what you can do to create a loyal staff.","In today's business world, loyalty is a very powerful concept. Decades ago, most younger employees would stay on a job for several years at a time. Older employees would stay longer, especially if they were concerned about building a career with that employer. But times have changed, and many employees, especially those in their 20s and 30s, don't consider loyalty to an employer to be as important as it once was.But what exactly does loyalty mean in a business setting? In its most basic sense, it's the relationship between an employer and an employee--an abstract, often unwritten contract in which the employer agrees to provide the materials and resources the employee needs to get the job done, matched by the employee's agreement to work at an optimal level to fulfill the goals of the company. Loyalty is really the glue that ties an employee to their job, and that tie is a function of the respect and allegiance the entrepreneur attempts to develop in their employees. When it comes right down to it, loyalty is a key reason many employees remain on their job.But when either party to this contact fails to fulfill their role, the contract that's hard to build in the first place gets broken. And then it's extremely difficult to rebuild the trust that existed between the employee and the boss.But why are loyal employees so important--even critical--to the success of your business? Loyal staffers help create a history and a culture of stability; people who've been around awhile know the road, the rules and the ""how it's done around here."" Loyalty reduces costly turnover rates by eliminating the time needed to advertise for new hires, then interview, screen and train them, and wait till they get up to speed. Loyal employees are usually also satisfied, productive employees.Steps to Take to Develop Loyal Employees
So how do you go about instilling loyalty in your employees? Stephen Robbins, the author of Organizational Behavior, offers several ideas in his book. The important thing to remember is that it's all about you-how you behave, how you treat your employees, how you perform as a manager. While it would be nice to think you'll be able to hire people who will be loyal and stay the course, it's really comes down to their interactions with you, because you are the company, and if they like and respect you, chances are, you'll have loyal employees.First, you've got to prove you have what it takes to get the job done--you've got to be competent, or you'll get no respect. This means you need to show a high level of knowledge, skills, and ability when performing both your operational and leadership functions. If you can demonstrate that, your employees will come to respect you--a major step toward building loyalty.But if an issue arises in which you don't have the knowledge or skills to develop a solution, then you have to be honest about your lack of ability and seek input from others. If you make excuses or blame others for your lack of knowledge or for the problem, loyalty will suffer.And that leads us to the next step: You've got to demonstrate integrity in your actions and beliefs. This means you've got to be honest and trustworthy, especially in difficult situations where it would be easier to blame someone else or deny involvement in a negative situation. When false blame or a denial occurs, employees quickly lose respect for their leader, and loyalty decreases.You want your employees to look up to and be proud of you-and they'll do that if you demonstrate your integrity. Loyal employees trust that their boss will be honest and truthful in their interactions, and that they can be relied on to take the moral high ground, especially in difficult situations.You also need to behave consistently with your staff. When you do that, you'll show your staff that you're reliable and predictable, and that you use good judgment. Workers who want to follow a leader can't do so when they can't rely on their boss or know their boss's judgment is flawed.Next, you need to display a willingness to protect your employees and help them save face. Your goal should never be to embarrass an employee. If you do manage to embarrass them, then you're going to be the ""bad guy"" and the embarrassed employee becomes the martyr in the eyes of others. This isn't to say that you can't reprimand or correct an employee's behavior. On the contrary--not doing so will lead other employees to believe that you have no standards, and they'll lose respect for you.When you encounter an employee who's made a mistake or has had an error in judgment, the boss who wants to build loyalty will correct the errant behavior in a manner that doesn't demean the employee, but rather helps them learn what the problem was and how to correct it in the future. Better yet, the boss who helps their employee identify the issue before it becomes a problem or results in an error will gain that employee's appreciation, respect and loyalty.Finally, when it comes to developing a loyal workforce, it's important that you be as open with your employees as possible. Do you easily share information and ideas with your employees? Or do you withhold key data from them? Clearly, there is some information that needs to be withheld from employees due to its sensitive nature. But short of that, the entrepreneur who openly shares appropriate information that enables their employees to work productively and efficiently will be seen as a trustworthy boss who deserves an employee's loyalty.As you can see, there's a clear link between what you do and how you do it that can impact whether or not your employees will respect you and feel a sense of loyalty. By working to develop that trait in your employees, you're most likely creating one of the strongest factors in an effective employee-employer relationship.Dr. David G. JavitchDr. David G.

/article/170244,The Pros and Cons of Job Sharing,Thinking about implementing a job-sharing program? Here's what you need to consider before you do.,"In today's hectic business world, people try cramming as much into the work days as possible. When employees are trying to finish up all the tasks on their to-do lists, 40-hour workweeks can easily morph into 45 or 50--and work can begin to impinge on their leisure time. To ease the stress of not having enough free time, some employees look to job sharing-- the process of splitting one full-time job between two people--in order to take back control of their lives and spend it the way they want.Employees who job share often cite ""quality of life ""issues as the main reason they only want to work part time. After weighing the amount of time they spent at work vs. the amount of time they were able to spend on leisure activities, they opted to work less so they could enjoy life more.Other job sharers cite the need or desire to take care of children or aging parents as reasons to work part time. Still others opt for part-time work for health reasons. Whether it's to cope with chronic stress or other health-care issues, working half time could literally be a ""lifesaver"" for some people.If you have employees who might be interested in a job-sharing arrangement, what can you do to ensure the successful execution of a full-time job shared by two people? First, two needs must be met: the needs of your business and the needs of your employees. Both of you need to buy into the concept that more than one person can adequately cover the task one full-time job.In addition, both employees who join forces to fill one full-time job must be willing to exert a maximum effort to ensure that this work model succeeds. Of course, that's usually the case because both employees are so pleased they've found a working situation that fits their needs that they're extremely motivated to make it work. And motivated workers are productive workers; and productive workers are satisfied workers. So having a fully functioning job-sharing program can be a win-win situation for both your business and your employees.But are there any negatives in a job-sharing model? Of course there are. The most common detractor is the ""Who's in charge?"" syndrome. Without clear and close coordination between the job sharers, neither the employees nor the boss knows exactly who's responsible for what part of the shared job or tasks. This can easily lead to confusion, decreased productivity, and dissatisfied workers and supervisors.To avoid this situation, each employee must do what nurses have long ago realized is crucial: Every day, at the beginning and end of each shift, they have to carve out time to fully inform the person taking over for them about the tasks in progress and any critical needs they'll need to address that day. If your workers don't do this or don't do this completely, information may be lost and/or misinformation may be communicated.Another potential problem involves other employees. I highly recommend that you make sure other employees and managers understand exactly when each of the job-sharing team will be working. This way, other individuals will know when to try or not try to contact each of the job sharers. Of course, everyone won't always remember who's in on which day or which part of the day. Distributing a written schedule will help. And timely e-mail messages and notes will help keep information clear and up to date.The final potential challenge you'll need to keep an eye on, if you choose to implement a job-sharing program, is this: Both of the two employees sharing the job will not always be available to respond to an inquiry or respond to an action because they won't be physically present. So if another employee needs to speak with the job sharer and that person isn't in, the result could be a delay in communicating or a delay in productivity. To help eliminate this problem, you might have your job sharers agree to be contacted at home on their ""off"" day in the event of an emergency.A job-sharing program is an excellent way to offer your valued employees a way to have the best of both worlds: to continue working in a job they love but giving them more time for personal activities. If you want to hang on to your top staff members, this might be one way to offer them an option that can make both of you happy.Dr. David G. JavitchDr. David G.

/article/169320,Is It Time to Outsource Your HR?,Need HR help for your small business? Consider hiring a PEO.,"When the time comes to start hiring staff, a lot of entrepreneurs fail to give much thought to all the responsibilities that come with being an employer. The average small-business owner isn't equipped with either the knowledge or the time to comply with the mountain of regulations required by the government. Fortunately, HR outsourcing--hiring a PEO to oversee your HR tasks--is a solution that not only provides help with compliance issues but can also provide assistance that's tailored to your company's specific needs.A PEO, or Professional Employer Organization, can offer HR solutions tailored to small and midsized businesses in all industries. For an annual fee, usually 2 to 7 percent of the dollar value of your annual payroll, a PEO will take care of everything from recruiting and hiring to managing your health benefits. Since many smaller businesses can't afford to hire an HR professional, PEOs can be a cost-conscious option. For instance, if a company has a $1 million payroll, a PEO can provide the equivalent of a full HR department for roughly $20,000 to $70,000 a year, considerably less than a fully staffed HR department or even one qualified executive.Generally, a PEO will legally hire a company's current employees, thereby making the PEO the ""employer of record"" for taxation and insurance purposes. Having the employees of multiple businesses ""on staff"" allows PEOs to enjoy lower benefits' costs because more employees mean better rates. The employees are then leased back to the original employer (now a PEO client) under a shared-employment contractual relationship, which sets out the powers, responsibilities and liabilities of the parties. This practice is also known as ""employee leasing"" or ""staff leasing.""The PEO then assumes responsibility for all payroll obligations, workers' compensation coverage and tax filings. Additionally, health, welfare and retirement benefits can be contracted as well as all associated administrative work. Because they take over most of the headaches of being an employer, PEOs are ideal for small businesses. In fact, most PEOs target companies that have 150 employees or less.Many times, a PEO arrangement is the only way a small business can offer benefits like health insurance, dental and vision care, life insurance, retirement saving plans like 401(k)s, Section 125 cafeteria plans (flexible spending accounts for healthcare and childcare), job counseling, adoption assistance and educational benefits. Most small businesses just couldn't afford or manage these benefits on their own.Finding the Right PEO for Your Company
Ideally, a PEO will relieve its client companies of the time-consuming and money-draining burdens associated with HR. Because PEOs offer many different types of services, choosing the right PEO is essential. If you're thinking about hiring a PEO for your business, consider the following factors to find the best possible PEO arrangement to meet your needs:Conduct a basic needs analysis. Lay out exactly what type of HR and risk management concerns your company has.Review the services of all the PEO firms you're considering. Find out which firms can meet all your needs and will do so in a manner that meets--if not exceeds--your expectations.Perform extensive background research to find out if the PEOs' sales pitches are really what they deliver.Check out the companies' staff. Does it have the depth and expertise to deliver on its promises?Find out how the firms deliver their services. In person? By phone? Via the web? A mix of all three?Determine what kind of consulting the PEOs provide on strategic HR issues like recruiting, HR procedures and processes. Ask for a few references, and then check them. If a particular PEO can't relieve your HR burden, one of the other ones certainly can.Find out if the PEOs charge any upfront fees and how those fees are determined. What about pre-payments? Do you have to put up a deposit?Ask for some demonstration that payroll taxes and insurance premiums are being paid properly, and that any past clients' legal issues have been correctly and efficiently handled.Once you've selected the PEO you'll be hiring, lay the foundation for a lasting relationship with your PEO by meeting the people you'll be working with face to face. An open line of friendly communication ensures you won't be lost in the in-box.The bottom line is, PEOs can help small and midsized employers enjoy the same HR benefits as large companies without the considerable overhead. A PEO costs less than hiring an internal HR employee and will maintain critical employment records and payroll reports, as well as provide the forms needed to make sure you're in compliance with all required employee regulations. Being an entrepreneur is difficult enough without all the accompanying HR hassles, so find a PEO for your company today.

/article/169102,Conducting an Exit Interview,Just why would you want to interview an employee who's decided to quit? We'll give you a few good reasons.,"So what exactly is the point of having a sit-down with an employee who's on their way out the door? What do you expect to learn? Or what can you hope to learn? Is it really going to do you any good anyway?Let's start with the basics. An exit interview is a voluntary, verbal interview between an employee who's leaving your company and someone else (an HR person if you have one; you if you don't). For the purpose of simplification, let's assume it's you. The interview often takes place one to two days before the employee actually leaves, whether they're leaving voluntarily or not.The goal of this interaction is two-fold: First, you want to give the employee a chance to vent their feelings about the work experience. This includes what worked right in the job as well as what didn't. Subjects covered may include their boss, their colleagues and their direct reports, as well as company processes, interaction between individuals and work units, productivity, morale, finances, equipment, worker satisfaction and so on. To get the most out of the interview, it's helpful, prior to the interview, if you share with the employee an overview of the type of questions you'll be asking. This way, the interview becomes more of a discussion--rather than an interrogation--where both parties are prepared to talk about the work situation.Simply gathering the information is only part of the exit interview process. The second purpose is to analyze the information you gather, and then feed it back to the people with whom the departing employee worked. Since the goal here is to improve any aspect of the organization that was discussed, it's crucial for you to formulate comments, even negative ones, in an educational, positive framework. Although this may be difficult, especially if the information is truly negative, there's really no purpose in simply relating negative information without trying to put it into a context that serves to educate the people involved and bring about change in a troubled area.Keep in mind that some of the information you share may come as a surprise to the people you're sharing them with. An employee who's about to leave the company is often more forthcoming that one who still has to come back to work the next day. Don't be surprised if the employee's supervisor is taken aback by some of the feedback the employee shared with you. They may even get defensive and try to blame the employee or deny that the action(s) or issue(s) in question ever took place. As a skilled communicator, you must phrase the information in a manner that clearly states the problem, yet frames it in such a way that it also states and demonstrates the possibility of turning around a negative situation.Fortunately, the information you'll get won't always be negative, and you should be sure to share the employee's positive comments with their supervisor and others involved. Often, people hesitate to pass on good news, falsely believing that people don't need to be told when they're doing a good job. On the contrary! In a world where people too often share only negative information, it's my belief that every business would be far more productive if more positive feedback were provided.What's the Point?Are exit interviews always helpful? Absolutely not. First of all, some employees are reluctant to ""burn their bridges"" and are therefore not completely honest. Fearful of receiving a negative reference for a future employer, many employees are reluctant to be totally truthful and informative with you. Instead, they either paint a rosy picture or simply withhold negative information. This creates a system in which change is critically needed, but no one knows it because everyone's afraid to point out the obvious: that the emperor isn't wearing any clothes.So what can you do to encourage more effective exit interviews? First, you need to demonstrate to your employees that the information you gather in an exit interview is being shared appropriately. This means that the exit interview process has had a positive impact on an existing situation, that something the departing employee complained about was actually addressed by you. For example, let's say a departing employee complained that the boss never gave superior ratings on the performance appraisal instrument, despite the impression that productivity was well above average. The next time an evaluation was given, if some high achievers received appropriately superior ratings, this would signal to your employees that you were willing to correct a negative situation.A second instance where exit interviews may not be effective is where the departing employee simply isn't interested in sharing information. They're not invested and simply give brief yes or no answers. There are any number of reasons for this. Maybe the employee didn't like their job, wasn't challenged by it, or simply didn't care about the job or the company or the exit interview process. Or maybe they're afraid the offending supervisor may retaliate toward the remaining employees. Additionally, if other employees have complained about issues during their exit interviews and nothing appears to have happened as a result, employees can simply lose faith in the process and won't be invested or forthright when they have their own exit interviews.The final instance where the process doesn't work is one in which it's apparent that the departing employee simply isn't telling the truth. Signs of this situation include information that is overly negative or overly positive, information that is extreme in nature, such as stories that show that nothing or little the supervisor ever did was positive--or, on the contrary, everything the supervisor did was extremely positive. If you keep an eye out for these instances, you can modify the tone of the interview--and therefore the quality of the information being shared--so that the process can be both effective and productive.Dr. David G.

/article/166668,Managing an Independent Contractor,Smart tips on what to do--and what not to do--when it comes to hiring and managing contract employees,"When it comes to hiring staff for your business, you probably most often consider bringing full-time employees on board. But there are certain tasks and positions that might best be filled by an independent contractor, such as one-time or intermittant projects, graphic design, copywriting, research and development, and accounting. And while most business owners understand that independent contractors can't be treated like employees, you may not know exactly what the differences are. So let me spell it out for you with a few questions and answers that explain just what can be required of any independent contractors you hire and that offer tips on how best to manage them.What is an independent contractor and why should you hire one? An independent contractor is an individual who's self-employed or hired by an outside organization to work in another (that is, your) organization. This subcontractor is paid by you for work performed according to your specifications. The original contractor will bill you for the services of the subcontractors.If the contractor is completely independent, then you'll pay this individual directly. This individual must work according to the policies, principles, procedures and culture of your business. The length of service may be time limited, meaning that you hire them for a specific, finite project, or may be ongoing. Usually, the independent contractor doesn't receive fringe benefits from the hiring organization.Why should you hire an independent contractor? There are basically two good reasons to hire an independent contractor. The most common is that your business doesn't have the needed expertise in-house to complete a task or project. Also, hiring someone through a third party usually ensures that the worker's been screened and is competent and experienced. If, for whatever reason, the worker's productivity is unacceptable, the person can easily be replaced by a more acceptable individual without too much trouble.Another reason to take on an independent contractor is when an ""extra hand"" is needed. If you only need someone for a task that's time or project limited, when the task is complete, it's quite easy to end the working relationship and avoid any legal complications associated with termination.Will independent contractors work as hard as my own employees? The answer here is, ""It depends."" Generally speaking, the notion that you get ""an honest day's work for an honest day's pay"" remains true. The hiring company expects the employee to work diligently, get the task done on time and under budget while working well with other employees. On the other hand, the independent contractor expects the employer to be available to answer questions, offer appropriate direction, provide an appropriate working climate, and to pay promptly.This concept is called the psychological contract. If the independent contractor is hired because they have a certain expertise your regular employees don't have, then the former can easily earn the admiration of the latter. In this case, the independent contractor will usually continue to shine so as to receive ongoing approval. After all, recognition is a prime motivator for most people. This achievement may even lead to an extension of the working contract, which will benefit everyone involved.However, there are other factors to consider, especially when trying to understand why the independent contractor may not work out as expected. One factor is complacency. This would occur, for instance, if the independent contractor falsely believes that their job skills are so highly valued by you that they don't have to put forth a strong effort and that they'll could only be fired for committing a flagrant error. The result is that while the work output might be acceptable, it wouldn't be optimal.Another issue that might lead to complacency is the fact that the employment is time-limited. The independent contractor may work diligently in the beginning, but as time goes by, their work product may falter. If their employment is for a specific period of time, the contractor may rightly assume that once the task is at least halfway complete, you won't pull the plug on the contract and terminate the contractor.Another factor that can lead to decreased productivity is a lack of commitment on the part of the independent contractor. If the job is time-limited, this employee might assume that ""doing just enough to get by"" will not cause any negative ramifications. And to some extent, that's probably true. You may find it difficult to terminate a contractor who accomplishes only part of--or even most of--a task (but not enough to be considered an optimal worker). This is especially true if the project has a deadline. The contractor can easily figure out that even if their work is just okay or perhaps even sub-par, there's no time for you to terminate them and hire someone new to finish the task.What can you legally require of an independent contractor? Even though they may not officially be one of your employees, this individual still owes you a high level of performance that should equal, if not exceed, the standards you set for your own employees. After all, this individual is still working to receive a paycheck. It's not uncommon for entrepreneurs to want to give these subcontractors ""special treatment"" out of fear that if they don't like the job, they'll leave.While it's true they have the freedom to more easily leave your employ, that doesn't mean you should treat them with kid gloves. Doing so has two negative effects: It lets the contractor feel they're special and could potentially get away with doing inferior work. Second, giving them preferential treatment could make your regular employees jealous, and that could produce some very negative emotions that can backfire and result in hostility, decreased morale, and decreased productivity for all involved.Exactly how should I manage an independent contractor? There are some things you should do that are similar to how you manage your other employees and some things that are different.Things that are similar:Clearly state your goals, expectations, milestones and expected work outcomes.Let the contractor know that you value the work produced.Quickly inform the contractor when output fails to meet your expectations in terms of time, quality, quantity, cost and so on.Demonstrate concern and support for efforts exerted toward goal accomplishment.Inquire as to the existence of any obstacles that might prevent the successful completion of the project.Things that are different:Check in with this individual more frequently to determine work satisfaction, challenge and potential aids and obstacles to achievement.Reinforce the positive aspects of the individual's performance. This worker can leave your employ fairly easily if they're unhappy, so it's not bad to be extra concerned. Remember, an independent contractor is used to working for various bosses for a variety of time periods. Therefore, while leaving your employ may not have a significant effect on this person, it could have a marked impact on your company's productivity.If there's a difference between the job description of the independent contractor and your other employees, be certain the contractor's responsibilities are clear and are being adhered to.Dr. David G.

/article/159740,Hiring Your First Employee,Looking to bring your first employee on board? We'll help you understand the legal requirements of hiring staff so you don't hit any rough waters down the line.,"For months, you've operated your new business as lean and mean as possible and continue to wear every hat yourself. Finally, you've hit a point--or your breaking point--where, in order to remain competitive and prosper, you'll need to welcome a helping hand aboard your tight ship.But before bringing just anyone on board, you need to understand that extra manpower entails a whole new string of legal obligations, liabilities, expenses and, of course, paperwork. One estimate tallies the average cost of recruiting, hiring and training a new employee at close to $4,000.Beyond the red tape, hiring mismatches can result in high turnover, absenteeism, higher healthcare costs, workplace violence and theft--substantial costs to an organization's bottom line and reputation.To help you navigate the legal ramifications of the hiring process, we've laid out the steps and precautions you should follow to ensure you make informed decisions, while staying within legal and ethical boundaries.1. Don't trust your instincts. Whether your new recruit will be filing reports or configuring computer networks, realize that criminal, under-qualified, and emotionally unstable minds hide in all uniforms and job titles. In reality, nearly 40 percent of all job applications and resumes include bogus or inflated facts. Plus, the number of negligent hiring lawsuits in this country is mounting--if your staff member's actions hurt someone, you can be held accountable and sued. And with terror acts, corporate scandals and identity theft on the rise, trusting your gut as a basis to hire is simply unsafe.So just what do background checks check, and what kind of stuff is off limits? The search typically consists of confirmation of prior employment claims, determination of worker's compensation claims and criminal and incarceration records, drug tests, credit history and driving record. In some cases, an identity (Social Security) check is undertaken.While much of this information is documented publicly, certain personal records, including education, military and medical, are confidential and necessitate an applicant's consent before digging them up. If you can, you should try to obtain original educational credentials. With advances in technology, a manufactured diploma or degree is as simple as typing in a few keystrokes.When prying into an interviewee's possible criminal past, take note: While a criminal conviction can be reported indefinitely, arrest records, paid tax liens, accounts placed for collection, civil suits and judgments can't be included on an employment background check after seven years. In some states, more stringent reporting rules apply. In California, for example, bankruptcies are off limits after ten years.If you plan to farm out a fact-finding hunt to a third-party, you're required by federal law to alert the person who's under investigation in writing. You must also notify the applicant if he or she is being denied a position due to disparaging information you've uncovered, and give him or her a chance to refute that information.Be forewarned, however: The internet is loaded with scam artists and private companies that compile ""virtual rap sheets."" What such online brokers dish up isn't always accurate or current, and the low rates they advertise may be deceptive.Each of the following firms is established in this arena and has been in existence for thirty years or more:Sterling Testing SystemsIntellicorpKrollworldwideUnderstand that the more jurisdictions you want to search, the more you're likely to pay.2. Test for illegal substances. With more than 250,000 drug- and alcohol-related deaths a year nationwide, our society's battle against substance abuse is far from over. Whether cocaine or sleeping pills are the drug of choice, addicts can be a terrible drain on an organization's productivity and balance sheet. Did you know that 65 percent of on-the-job accidents are related to substance abuse? And drug-abusing employees are six times more likely to file worker's compensation claims than other staff members.To weed out such weak links from your work environment, pre-employment and random drug testing are an employer's best lines of defense. Some occupations actually mandate such checks, including industrial tractor and truck operators, material movers, child-care workers, teachers, private and corporate investigators, state and federal personnel and police officers.Before instituting a drug exam of your own, bear in mind, on pre-employment interviews, it's illegal to inquire about a candidate's prescription medication use. However, if an applicant refuses a drug test, an employment offer can be denied or retracted.3. Screen for unwanted behavior. Depending on the position you're trying to fill, there are supplementary screening options available. Psychological testing, handwriting analysis, skill and aptitude tests and even lie detector tests are additional assessment tools that business owners exercise today to help them select the best job candidates. Such profiling allows you to select people who have the skills and the temperament needed to succeed in your business. To avoid any legal problems, before administering such tests, be prepared to demonstrate job-relatedness, non-discrimination and statistical validity.Time to Hire
Once you've completed your behind-the-scenes evaluation and have turned up some promising candidates, you'll need to know the dos and don'ts of interviewing someone face to face. 1. Some questions are off limits. Whether on a written employment application or in person, it's unlawful to ask about an applicant's age, sexual orientation, marital status, religious affiliation or race. And questions pertaining to the nature of a physical, emotional or mental handicap can only be asked if an applicant will need special accommodations for performing a specific job.During your dialogue, you should also be mindful of other important federal laws including:Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which covers the subject of discrimination or harassment on the basis of race, religion, sex or creedThe Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990The Family Medical Leave Act of 1993For more information on each of the federal laws noted above, visit the sites for the U.S. Department of Labor , the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and MyEmploymentLawyer.com .2. Check references. Before making a formal job offer, be sure to ask the contender for at least three references. Two of the references should be professional, and one should be personal to help endorse the character of the applicant. Then pick up the phone and call those references--do not neglect this step! You'd be surprised what references are willing to tell you about an applicant if you'd only ask.Be sure to keep your queries as objective as possible, and, if you're speaking to the professional references, make sure they relate directly to the candidate's job performance and duties and to information provided on the application or resume, or to information provided during the interview. Forms of discrimination that apply to interviewing and hiring are also applicable to reference checking, so be sure to avoid questions that involve race, age, disabilities, national origin, religion or marital status. For a personal reference, find out how long they've known the person and then ask about the person's character and work ethic; you might also ask if the person would hire the applicant themselves, if they had an appropriate job opening to fill.3. Set a salary and choose the employee's classification. When it comes to paying and classifying a new employee, federal laws provide clear guidelines when it comes to both. The minimum wage currently stands at $5.15 per hour--that's the lowest you can go when it comes to paying hourly wages. And if it's a young person you're putting on your books, the Fair Labor Standards Act sets the minimum age for employment in non-agricultural employment at 14 years old.Depending on your hiring needs and finances, you'll need to determine the status of your new employee as being part time or full time. According to the U.S. Department of Labor, part-time workers are those who work 20 hours or less per week, while full-timers log in 30 hours or more. Because states differ on the payment of benefits to part-time employees, you should check corresponding regulations with your local department of labor.For tax reasons, you must categorize your worker as an independent contractor, common-law employee, statutory employee or statutory nonemployee. Misclassification can result in fines equal to one-and-a-half percent of the questionable wages, plus the withholding taxes. Criminal charges can apply as well.As long as you retain the right to control their activities (such as when and where the person works, the tools and equipment they use, and where they purchase supplies), your workers are considered common-law employees .A statutory employee is one who's an employee by statute and is allowed to report income and expenses as a business. The most common employees in this category are its officers, but it also includes such employees as:A full-time traveling salespeople who solicit orders from wholesalers, restaurants, or similar establishments on behalf of the company. The merchandise sold must be for resale (for example, food sold to a restaurant) or for supplies used in the buyer's business.An agent-driver or commission-driver engaged in distributing meat, vegetables, bakery goods, beverages (other than milk), or laundry or dry cleaning servicesA home worker performing work on material or goods furnished by the employerA statutory nonemployee , which includes direct sellers and licensed real estate agents, is treated as self-employed for all federal tax purposes, including income and employment taxes.An independent contractor works for himself or herself, often for more than one company. This person typically works offsite, is paid on a per-job or commission basis, and sends invoices for his or her services. Employers aren't required to deduct taxes on their behalf or extend them the same benefits that they do for standard employees. This also applies to freelancers and consultants. For tax purposes, it's a good idea to draft an agreement with an independent contractor, stating that he or she is not an employee.4. Get your records straight. Before your newest team member logs in a single hour of work, there's a folder's worth of records you'll need to complete and process. According to the U.S. Department of Labor , there are 12 records an employer must maintain on each member of their staff for the length of their employment:Employee's full name and social security numberMailing address, including ZIP codeBirth date, if the employee is younger than 19Sex and occupationTime of day and day of the week when employee's workweek begins, hours worked each day, and total hours worked each workweekBasis on which employee's wages are paid (weekly, bi-monthly, and so on)Regular hourly pay rateTotal daily or weekly ""straight time"" earnings for each workweekTotal overtime earnings for each workweekAll additions to or deductions taken from employee's",Growth Strategies,2006-07-27 00:00:00
/article/175388,Determining Your Company's Culture,"Did your business's culture happen by default or design? If it's not what you dreamed it would be, it's time to make some changes.","Walk into any company and you can tell the culture of that company in about 10 minutes--sometimes even in 10 seconds. For instance, if you walked into the headquarters of surf ware manufacturer Quiksilver in Huntington Beach, California, in a suit and tie, you'd be very out of place. Likewise, if you walked into electronics manufacturer Toshiba in Irvine, California, with spiked hair and a skateboard under your arm, you'd feel like you didn't belong.Whether you realize it or not, your company has a culture based on its core values. So did you design the culture with passion and purpose--or did it occur by default? Can you even describe what your company culture is? Or are you too close to the trees to see the forest? If you can't describe it immediately, let's take a look at few areas that'll help you identify your company's culture--and make positive changes for the better.Good News and Bad News
As the leader of your business, what type of corporate culture have you set up when it comes to receiving news that's less than positive? Many business owners have a fit and blow their lids when they hear any bad news. But what kind of signal does that send to your employee? Knowing that the boss is unlikely to be kind means employees most likely won't say anything for fear of getting their heads chopped off. So that leaves just one thing to do: Tell the boss what he or she wants to hear. If this is you, you're never going to hear the truth from your employees--only what they think you want to hear. So you're most likely never going to hear anything negative until you've got a full-blown crisis on your hands.What about the good news? As the company leader, do you take credit for the good ideas--even if they weren't your ideas? Do you have the attitude that ""It's their job, and I expect it to be done well"" without giving them credit for working hard and excelling? What type of recognition programs do you have set up to reward or acknowledge a job well done? The answers are in the questions.Helpful Hints: As the leader of your company, it's important to avoid outbursts and blow-ups. Your goal is to provide a place of centeredness, be clear about your expectations, have trust and faith, and create a future vision for the company. A humble leader who gives credit where credit is due will have very loyal employees.Meetings
Company meetings have a culture of their own, too. How effective are yours? Have you ever heard anyone at your company say, ""That was a horrible meeting. What a waste of my time!""? Unfortunately ineffective, wasteful meetings have become a norm in many companies. If you'd like to turn things around, you can.Helpful Hints:Be sure you have an agenda and stick to it.Limit the number of items on the agenda to just two or three.Start on time and end on time.Make sure the decision makers are in attendance, or reschedule the meeting.Each item covered in the meeting should either be resolved during the meeting or have an action step and follow-up person assigned to it.Each action step should include the standard ""Who, What, When, Where, and By What Date"" information.The Pulse of Company Culture
If departments are working against each other with a ""we vs. them"" attitude, the heartbeat of the company will be rapid and dysfunctional because employees are operating from a basis of fear. That creates a very unhealthy corporate culture.Helpful Hints:
It's usually pretty easy to spot the untitled leaders in your company--those are the people that your other employees are listening to. If you can get these unofficial leaders on board with your plans and goals, you'll start to defuse the ""we vs. them"" culture.Remember, corporate culture begins at the top and ends at the top. When you want changes to be made, you'll have to be the one to get the ball rolling. A healthy company culture is one in which the following process exists: The business owner makes a decision, then delegates responsibility for that decision and watches to see how well it's carried out. If it's not working well, the business owner will revise their plan and try something new. A dysfunctional leader, on the other hand, will defend the decision to the death just because he or she made that decision and ""That's the rule!""A corporate culture often happens by default instead of design. But companies that purposefully set up their culture are far more successful than companies that have a culture that exists by default. If your company's culture is not quite what you'd dreamed it would be, you have the ability to change it. It's never too late to create your own success.Patty Vogan is Entrepreneur.com's ""Leadership"" columnist and owner of Victory Coaching, an executive coaching company for business and personal success, and a chairman for the largest CEO organization in the world, TEC International.

/article/159744,Recruiting and Hiring Top-Quality Employees,Follow these tips to ensure you'll bring the right people into your company.,"As all employers quickly learn, there's a world of difference between a worker who's correctly matched to their job and their organization, and one who is not.But how do you find and match the right people to the right jobs? By including, in your comprehensive people strategy, a well-structured recruiting and selection program. The key to successfully developing such a program is to follow a proven recruiting process for the positions you need to fill. Resist the temptation to omit steps, because shortcutting the process can shortchange your results. Here's what you'll need to do:1. Develop accurate job descriptions. Your first step is to make sure you have an effective job description for each position in your company. Your job descriptions should reflect careful thought as to the roles the individual will fill, the skill sets they'll need, the personality attributes that are important to completing their tasks, and any relevant experience that would differentiate one applicant from another. This may sound fairly basic, but you'd be surprised at how many small companies fail to develop or maintain updated job descriptions.2. Compile a ""success profile."" In addition to creating job descriptions, it's important to develop a ""success profile"" of the ideal employee for key positions in your company that are critical to the execution of your business plan. These might include such positions as team leaders, district managers and salespeople. For example, let's say you currently have 20 salespeople. Within that group, you have four that are top performers, 12 that are middle-of-the-road and four that aren't quite making the grade. If you could bump the number of folks in the top group from 20 percent to 33 percent, that could have a dramatic impact on your company's performance.To accomplish that goal, you need to profile everyone in the sales group to identify any skills and attributes that are common to the top group but missing from the other groups. Using this information, you'll be able to develop a profile to help you select the candidates most likely to succeed in that position. Remember, you can't tell if you've found a match if you're not matching candidates against a specific profile.3. Draft the ad, describing the position and the key qualifications required. Although some applicants will ignore these requirements and respond regardless, including this information will help you limit the number of unqualified applicants.4. Post the ad in the mediums most likely to reach your potential job candidates. Of course, the Internet has become the leading venue for posting job openings, but don't overlook targeted industry publications and local newspapers.5. Develop a series of phone-screening questions. Compile a list of suitable questions you can ask over the phone to help you quickly identify qualified candidates and eliminate everyone else.6. Review the resumes you receive and identify your best candidates. Once you post your ad, you'll start receiving resumes...sometimes many more than you anticipated. Knowing what you're looking for in terms of experience, education and skills will help you weed through these resumes quickly and identify potential candidates.7. Screen candidates by phone. Once you've narrowed your stack of resumes to a handful of potential applicants, call the candidates and use your phone-screening questions to further narrow the field. Using a consistent set of questions in both this step and your face-to-face interviews will help ensure you're evaluating candidates equally.8. Select candidates for assessment. Based on the responses to your phone interviews, select the candidates you feel are best qualified for the next step in the process.9. Assess your potential candidates for their skills and attributes using a proven assessment tool. A resume and phone interview can only tell you so much about a job applicant, so you'll need a dependable assessment tool to help you analyze the core behavioral traits and cognitive reasoning speed of your applicants. For example, a good test will provide insights as to whether the individual is conscientious or lackadaisical, introverted or extroverted, agreeable or uncompromising, open to new ideas or close-minded, and emotionally stable or anxious and insecure.The success profile you created for each position will help you determine which behavioral traits are important for that position. For example, you would expect a successful salesperson to be extroverted. On the other hand, someone filling a clerical position might be more introverted.These assessment tests can be administered in person or online. Online testing and submission of results can help you determine whether the applicant should be invited for a personal interview.10. Schedule and conduct candidate interviews. Once you've selected candidates based on the previous steps, schedule and conduct the interviews. Use a consistent set of 10 or 12 questions to maintain a structured interview and offer a sound basis for comparing applicants.11. Select the candidate. Make your selection by matching the best applicant to the profiled job description.12. Run a background check on the individual to uncover any potential problems not revealed by previous testing and interviews.13. Make your offer to the candidate. The information you collected during the interview process will provide you with important insights as to starting compensation levels and training needs.Additional Pre-Recruiting TipsBefore you start the hiring process, determine your strategy relative to how people fit into your organization. What is your process for making sure they're a good fit with your company's culture? Decide whether your approach to the cultural question should include a second interview. Also, who else, if anyone, do you involve in the interviews to help make this selection and judge the candidate? Your goal is to have a plan that will help you determine whether you have a qualified applicant who will fit into your company's culture.In addition, decide whether you're going to conduct pre-employment testing. How much is it worth for you to know an individual's strengths and weaknesses, not just as a hire/don't hire test, but as a coaching tool to help you determine their training needs and the best approach to maximize the person's productivity? Pre-employment testing is often overlooked, when it could be a very valuable tool. For example, if you find an applicant who fits the job description and appears to be the person you want to hire, pre-employment testing can help you determine how to work with them more effectively and move them along in your organization.If you want your business to attract and retain good clients, your comprehensive people strategy must include a recruiting and selection strategy that attracts and retains quality employees. Following a well-thought-out, structured process will help you best match the right people to the right jobs in your company.",Growth Strategies,2006-07-20 00:00:00
/article/159746,Author David Rye on Retaining Top Talent,Why hiring and holding on to the best employees is a smart move for your company,"Much has been said lately about the leaders of today's businesses--about the mistakes to avoid, the procedures to adhere to when doing business, the steps to take for future growth. But where are the employees in that mix? That is, the outstanding employees? They are out there--you just have to know how to find them and hold on to them. And even if you've had to lay off some employees, you still need to think about the future, when the economy is back on track, your business starts to boom again and you're suddenly in need of stellar workers to make things run smoothly.And that's where David Rye's Attracting and Rewarding Outstanding Employees comes in. The book illustrates that now more than ever, today's businesses need not only an effective leader, but effective employees as well. Here, Rye fills us in on what exactly it means--to you and your company--to hire and retain top talent.Entrepreneur.com:  What is an outstanding employee?Rye:  Outstanding employees set a positive tone throughout the organization. You are only as good as the people who are working for you. That means your employees will magnify the state in which your business is. You have to look for what is inspiring about an employee, and you should easily be able to recognize their contributions. While interviewing, you should check and study people for what they can do for you. A good employee will admit they are not perfect, ask questions, and possess a tenacity to learn and improve their skill.Entrepreneur.com:  What, in your opinion, are most business owners doing wrong as far as hiring goes?Rye:  Something that actually surprised me was a survey I read that asked business managers why they hired their employees. I was disappointed when I read that most business managers who had recently hired someone said they hired to fill a position. Most people make the mistake of filling a position as soon as possible instead of holding out for the best person for the job. Like I said, people are a reflection of you, and you want to make sure you remember that when you're screening people for a position in your company.Entrepreneur.com:  What are some tips for managers who are looking to hire outstanding employees?Rye:  In the interview, ask people what they've accomplished in the past 10 months, personally or [workwise]. Ask people what their goals are; get to know the character of the person who wants to work for you. ""If we hired you today, where do you think you will be in the next 10 months? Where do you plan to be with the company?"" Those are good open-ended questions to test the character of future employees.Entrepreneur.com:  What kind of positive reinforcement do most employees respond well to?Rye:  In the past 10 years, there has been a big change in the office environment. There is more socializing in the office than ever before, because more companies want to set the tone that work is fun. Going to lunch is a formal way of saying thank you; another formal way is presenting an outstanding employee with an award at a banquet. A less formal way of showing appreciation is a simple ""thank you"" and a pat on the back.Most people think [employees] want a financial raise in their paycheck, but... rewarding someone financially comes across as buying them. After a few months, the money goes, and their respect for their hard work has no reinforcement. Rewards draw the best out of people, and that sets a positive tone in the office.",Growth Strategies,2006-07-20 00:00:00
/article/159752,The Many Uses of a Job Description,"It's not just for screening candidates anymore. Today, business owners are finding numerous ways to put an employee's job description to work for them.","Who knew that a good job description could be such as a versatile management tool? Though it still remains a hiring tool in the most traditional sense--a written description identifying a job by title, essential functions and requirements--a well-crafted description also spells out the knowledge, abilities and skills required to perform a job successfully. These additional descriptions are extremely helpful when it comes to employee training and career development.A business owner can use a good job description not only as a valuable aid in the job-recruiting process, but also as an outline for reporting relationships and working conditions. A well-crafted job description can also be used for:Performance management. You can use it to set measurable performance goals based on duties in the job description, and then coach your employees to meet these goals as needed.Training and employee development. You can use your employee job descriptions, along with descriptions of possible job promotions, as incentives for employees to pursue classes, seminars and other career development activities. Compensation. Job descriptions can be helpful in developing a standardized compensation program with minimums and maximums for each position. Recognition and rewards. You can use the descriptions as a baseline for performance, and as a tool to encourage employee performance ""above and beyond"" the job description in order to receive recognition and rewards. Discipline. If you need to, you can use the job description to illustrate that an employee isn't adequately performing job functions. Return-to-work programs. You can prepare for light or modified duty options to allow for a smoother transition from a workers' compensation injury or leave.Essential job function analysis. Written job descriptions have become increasingly important due to the enactment, in July of 1992, of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). A well-developed job description can provide details on the ""essential functions"" of a job. This is very helpful when an employee requests a reasonable accommodation under the ADA. The job description can contain prerequisites for positions such as educational requirements, employment experience, physical requirements, supervisory responsibilities and certificates or licenses needed. Well-developed, accurate job descriptions may also prove useful in providing a defense against charges of employment discrimination beyond the recruiting process. When it comes to job description, flexibility is the key. It may be wise to create more generic job descriptions that emphasize expectations and accountabilities, rather than specific tasks, thereby encouraging employees to focus on results rather than job duties. A more wide-ranging job description is also easier to maintain--it doesn't require modification with every minor change in duties.Mary Massad is the director of HR product development for Administaff, a leading personnel management company that serves as a full-service human resources department for thousands of small and medium-sized businesses throughout the United States.

/article/159754,How to Build Loyalty Before the Employee Shortage Hits,"Believe it or not, before long you could be scrambling to fill job vacancies. The solution? Make yourself desirable ',  now , u'.","The current economy provides wise employers with a prime opportunity to build loyalty among their employees. While there is currently a shortage of jobs, especially in the technology sector, according to a May 20 BusinessWeek article demographers and economists predict we will soon experience a tremendous labor shortage of many years' duration. Some sectors are already experiencing a shortage of workers--health-care and construction industries are scrambling for help.The reason? In the next several years, huge numbers of baby boomers will retire, and the population coming behind them is not sufficient to fill the vacated jobs. Among the possible effects predicted by BusinessWeek: a greater dependence on older workers and efforts to encourage them to put off retirement, health benefits for part-time workers, and more flexible hours to meet the needs of employees.Companies that take steps now to make themselves desirable places to work will reap the benefits of well-established loyalty when the employee crunch hits. If you've made your employees happy when jobs are few, they'll have little reason to wander when other companies come calling later. Tom Engibous, chairman, CEO and president of Texas Instruments Inc., has launched a ""re-recruiting initiative--asking workers what they need--days off, new assignments, a different boss--to keep them satisfied right now,"" according to a May 13 BusinessWeek article. Following are some tips for keeping your employees ""satisfied right now"":1. Lay the foundation by providing equitable compensation and benefits packages. It is true that most people who leave jobs do so because of how they are treated by their bosses, not because of money. However, a basic requirement of happy employees is to earn a good living wage and enjoy benefits that provide peace of mind for their families.2. Be that rare company: one that regularly acknowledges the good work employees do. In too many companies, employees get attention only for failing to do their jobs or for making mistakes. Good employees want to hear from employers that they are doing a good job! Too common is the story of the excellent employee who left her job after years of devotion to an organization because she could not get her manager to acknowledge her either through regular reviews of her performance or respectable pay raises. When she tendered her resignation, her boss begged her to stay, offered her any restructuring of her job that she wanted and offered her a significant pay raise. It was a classic case of too little too late. This highly productive employee had long since given up on her current employer and was looking forward to working for a new boss who was excited about using her talent.3. Create opportunities for having fun. Employees can have fun at work and get their jobs done, usually with greater enthusiasm, energy and creativity. Some companies have already discovered the benefits of making fun a part of their culture. At AGI Inc., the Melrose Park, Illinois, cosmetics packaging company, monthly employee meetings are opportunities to ""stump the CEO."" The person who asks the toughest question wins a prize, and everyone enjoys the challenge of trying to stump the CEO. The CEO's willingness to face difficult questions and respond as openly as possible, in front of all employees, builds confidence in the company while demonstrating a lightheartedness that boosts morale. For more examples of how to have fun at work, see next month's ""The Bottom Line.""4. Provide opportunities for employees to learn. The kind of employees you want are the kind who want to learn. Good workers improve their skills in many areas of work and life. They can either do it on their own, and be more inclined to go elsewhere for continued challenge and learning, or they can learn under your auspices, and develop close ties to your organization while they do. Learning can be job-related or personal; both areas of learning are important to the good employee. Learning a new language, beefing up computer skills, getting a better handle on project management--all are areas of stimulation to the employee and ultimately useful to the employer. There are many others as well. See what people in your company are interested in. If you live in an area where Spanish is heard more and more frequently, put together a Spanish language class for employees. They can learn the language while enjoying getting to know each other in a different setting. They will feel more connected to your organization while building a new skill.5. Engage your employees in efforts to make their workplace safer and more pleasant. Our surroundings can powerfully affect how we feel about where we work. Is the parking lot safe--well-lighted and well-marked? Are there pleasing pictures or other designs on the walls? Is the lighting sufficient to read and work by? Are bathrooms clean and well-stocked? What kinds of additions to the break room might make it more convenient to use? Ask your employees what would improve their work areas, and do whatever is reasonable to do. They will understand if you can't purchase expensive new equipment, and will be delighted if you make the effort to do even some of the things they've expressed an interest in.Scott Miller is vice president of Kirk Miller & Associates Inc., a management consulting firm that writes and presents highly interactive workshops designed to improve productivity, retention and morale through developing employees' soft, or interpersonal, skills.",Growth Strategies,2006-07-20 00:00:00
/article/159756,How to Comply With Workers' Comp Laws,Determine if your small business really needs it--and then start doing some research.,"Q:  I recently started a business. I've hired a young neighborhood boy to assist me two to three times per week. Do I need to have some kind of insurance for either the business, him or myself in case he's injured on the job, or can I hire him as a contract employee and eliminate the need for insurance? If I can hire him as a contract employee, what's the procedure for doing that?A:  With respect to the issue of injuries on the job, employers need to make certain they are complying with their state's workers' compensation act. While workers' compensation is not truly ""insurance,"" every state has an act with laws that provide for compensation for loss resulting from injuries received at work. Although each state's workers' compensation laws are different and constantly changing, the general purpose of these laws is to afford workers a right to relief for injuries received on the job. Depending on the state, workers' compensation laws can be either compulsory or elective. Under elective laws, an employer may choose to accept or reject the act, but if he rejects it, he loses certain defenses if a worker is injured on the job. Coverage is only elective in two states: New Jersey and Texas. Therefore, most states require employers to accept its provisions and provide the benefits specified therein.It's worth noting that every state's workers' compensation act provides that minors are covered. In fact, the acts in some states even provide that if a minor is illegally employed, and that minor is injured on the job, he will receive additional compensation.With respect to the issue of whether a worker is hired as an independent contractor or an employee, each state's workers' compensation law is different with respect to how these categories are treated. Some states require all workers to be covered under its workers' compensation programs, regardless of whether or not they are employees or independent contractors. Other states, on the other hand, only require employees to be covered. It is noteworthy that, if an independent contractor were injured on the job in a state where he is not covered by workers' compensation, he would not be limited in the type of civil action he could file against the employer arising out of that injury. In states where independent contractors are covered by workers' compensation laws, the contractor is limited to the remedies provided under those laws. Accordingly, employers need to research their state's laws to determine who in fact is covered and what is required of them to comply.Employers need to be particularly cautious not to incorrectly classify a worker as an independent contractor, as the liability for doing so can be significant. To determine whether or not an individual is an employee or an independent contractor, employers must conduct a fact-specific inquiry regarding the particular job duties of that individual. In conducting this inquiry, employers will use different tests under various employment statutes to help make their determination. Generally, these tests consider how much control an employer has over the worker (often referred to as the ""right to control"") and whether the worker is dependent on the business of the employer for his livelihood. In applying these different tests, many factors will be considered, including: whether the worker is trained by the employer, who furnishes the necessary equipment, whether the services are rendered personally, how the worker is paid (by the hour as opposed to by the job), the duration of the employment and how the employer can terminate the relationship. The workers' compensation statutes in some states also provide specific guidance with respect to what is necessary to establish independent contractor status.In sum, because each state has its own workers' compensation act, employers must look to their state's statute to determine what is required in order for them to be in compliance.Note: The information in this column is provided by the author, not Entrepreneur.com.

/article/159764,Successfully Screening Job Candidates,Follow these tips to ensure your interviews net you the best hire.,"When interviewing potential job candidates, one of the major errors many entrepreneurs make is that they don't know what they're looking for. Nice looking? Well dressed? Tall? Physically fit? These factors are easy to identify and clearly impact the outcome of an interview, but they're not indicators of success on the job-unless you're looking for a model.So what can entrepreneurs do to help ensure they hire the right candidate for the job? The best answer is: Know what you're looking for. If you don't know what specific characteristics the best candidate should have, then you probably won't find the right person for the job. The result? An inappropriate hire.Even before looking at your first resume, you need to consider several factors. First, identify the specific and measurable knowledge bases, skills and abilities the available job requires. Hopefully, you'll be able to find this information in the job description. (If you don't have an existing description for the job that's available, this article by our Legal Columnist Chris Kelleher can help you get started.)As you review it or create it, the key here is to be very specific about what you want. For example, a ""good or working knowledge of Microsoft Excel"" is not sufficient to differentiate an intermediate from an experienced person. Being specific, and measurable, you could say, ""Using Excel, able to add, subtract, multiply and divide figures, create multi-colored bar and pie charts, sort and filter data, etc.""Second, make sure you ask behavioral questions, those that ask for specific, action-oriented responses, instead of vague, abstractions. For instance, if you ask someone if she is successful or not, you'll probably get a ""yes"" or ""no"" reply that doesn't really provide any concrete details. However, if you also ask, ""And could you give me an example of a particular project of yours that you completed successfully?"" you then have a response that will provide you with concrete, insightful information.Third, check out your applicant's nonverbal behavior. If the candidate sits rigidly without moving, if he or she doesn't make or keep eye contact with you, or if he or she is turned away from you, these are clues that this person is uptight and not interested or able to engage you in relationship building. On the other hand, if the candidate is nervous, frequently changes position and gestures in a bothersome manner, then that person is probably just anxious or worried about something. What does the candidate's posture tell you? Is it slumped down or forward, looking lazy or tired? Rigid and nailed to the chair? Look for behaviors that express life, interest and enthusiasm without appearing too manic or too subdued.In addition, evaluate the candidate's verbal behavior. Is their tone of voice loud or soft, appropriate or inappropriate to the situation? How about the types of words they use? Are they simple, simplistic, or complex and complicated? What is the pace of their speech? Is it too slow or too fast? As in all these examples, a medium level of verbal behaviors is usually most appropriate; other levels might help you screen out the competition.Finally, after assessing these important factors during the interview process, identify and assess the residual feelings you have both in your head and in your gut. Do you have some gnawing feeling that something may not be ""right"" or ""good?"" Were you ""blown away"" or ""under impressed"" with what the candidate said or did? Whatever you experience during or after an interview, make certain you probe your reactions to uncover your true feelings. As a result, you'll be developing more confidence in your interview skills and discovering more concrete, helpful information to help you make an effective hiring decision.",Growth Strategies,2006-07-20 00:00:00
/article/159440,The Benefits of Flextime,"With our personal lives busier than ever, offering flexible work options to your employees could be the best way to keep the good ones around.","Five days a week, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., 48 to 50 weeks per year: That had been the typical work schedule for a good portion of Americans for many decades. But by the 1990's, employees were finding that the traditional workweek was sub-optimal. But why?Though still very dedicated to their jobs, a certain percentage of the workforce was trying to adapt to the combined needs of a demanding professional life and a busy personal life. They were feeling off kilter and unbalanced. They required a more novel approach to the workweek and found it necessary to request a special, more flexible work schedule.Their reasons for wanting this ""flextime"" were many and varied. In some cases, the quality of both their work performance and their home life was decreasing. Parents of young children needed time to drop those kids off at school or day care. Employees with elderly parents needed time to assist with their parents' daily care or even drop them off at elder care facilities. And at the end of the day, pick-up obligations for both kids and parents again ate into the traditional nine to five workday.And there are reasons that go beyond the traditional family care issues. For instance, some employees need time off to attend or teach classes; other workers have a second job. Many need to adjust their schedules to avoid serious, predictable and time-consuming traffic jams. And for others, working a nontraditional part-time schedule is a lifestyle choice.But as an employer, why would you consider offering flextime? After all, it's ""different,"" and if you run a very traditional sort of business or operate out of habit, to see employees arriving and leaving at various times during the day can be upsetting. It can also be problematic to coordinate people, tasks and productivity when your employees aren't at work at the same time. So why should employers consider creating flexible schedules?The main reason is to retain key, dedicated employees whose personal needs conflict with traditional work hours. If you can offer flex time, you'll gain increased productivity and worker satisfaction, along with decreased absenteeism and turnover--all great money-savers for your company!Flextime helps create a happier, more satisfying workplace, too. Because employees are often so glad that their employers are willing to allow for a work-life time adjustment, they tend to work harder and in a more dedicated fashion to hold on to their now-perfect schedule and re-balance their lives.Flextime OptionsSo just what kind of options are there to the traditional workday? Perhaps one of the oldest plans is job sharing. In this case, two workers usually each work half time, comprising one full-time equivalent (FTE) employee. For this type of plan, tasks, roles and responsibilities need to be closely coordinated to ensure optimal productivity.A second plan allows for employees to work different hours, which usually involves them coming in to work either earlier or later than most of their counterparts. For instance, instead of working 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., flextime employees might work 7 a.m. to 4 p.m. or 10 a.m. to 7 p.m.Another option allows employees to alternate between a four-day week and then a five-day week, thus permitting a traditional two-day weekend followed by an extended three-day weekend. Or, if your business allows it, employees can work ten days straight (including weekends) and then enjoy four consecutive days off. Or they can work four, ten-hour days every week and then have three consecutive days off. The possibilities here are only limited by what works for your business.In companies with peak periods, such as accounting firms or tourist businesses, employees can work many more than forty hours each week during the busy season(s), and then enjoy shorter weeks in the less-busy season(s). Closely related to this seasonal plan is ""comp time"" which refers to employees working more hours than usual each week but not being paid overtime for this overage. Instead, employees can leave early some days or take a day off to balance out their hours.In many companies, some employees' job responsibilities are primarily project oriented--as soon as one job's completed, the employee can simply go on to the next task. With this type of job, an option here is for the employee to be paid on a project basis by deciding how long the task should take and what the remuneration will be for that responsibility. And the employee can take time off between projects if they finish sooner than planned. In this instance, the employee functions much like an external consultant who's hired on a project basis.Telecommuting is a plan that incorporates characteristics from several other flextime ideas. With PDAs, computers, the internet and cell phones, employees no longer have to be ""under the same roof"" to accomplish their jobs. Employees can work at home all or part time and in the office part time. This plan allows employees to mix the quiet or comfort of home with the dynamics at the office. This is especially helpful if their work environment is small, crowded or noisy, and they need quiet time to get the job done.Success TipsIf you're at all worried that your employees might take advantage of your good nature and goof off when they should be working, these tips will help ensure maximum output:1. Your goals for any employee working flextime need to be clear. The goals must be both specific and action-oriented so they can be measured at the end of the work period. And both of you need to agree on the actual scope of work. And it's critical, especially when it comes to telecommuting, that the mode of transmitting the end result be unambiguous. For example, do you want work details or the end product to be communicated by phone, internet or in person? Are rough drafts and a phone call sufficient or do you need a polished report?2. An employee's exact role in the company needs to be clearly defined. Each person--manager and employee--must know the expectations and responsibilities of self and others. Each person must also know exactly who does what and with whom and who is responsible to whom. This is especially true when you have employees working outside the office and communicating only via phone or e-mail. When role clarity isn't ensured, confusion, blame, dissension, antagonism and a lack of productivity often result.3. You must determine the frequency and mode of communication you require before your employees begin working their flextime schedules. Employers vary on the amount of control and contact they want or demand from their employees. Some bosses want a written summary of a week's efforts first thing Monday morning; others are satisfied with a phone call. Still others believe that a face-to-face meeting is essential. Figure out what you need to feel comfortable with the work your employees are doing and set some guidelines.4. Establish some regular working hours for your telecommuting employees. It seems the less often an employee is present in the office, the more that people need to get in touch with that person. The telecommuter needs to outline a usual time that he or she will be available by phone or e-mail and also set a regular time for coming in to the office. Many employers with flextime employees have discovered the concept of ""core hours."" This is the time all employees must be physically present at the business location for a set amount of time on a specific day. Knowing, for example, that all employees will be available for a meeting every Tuesday from noon to 2 p.m. can go a long way to decreasing the anxiety of flextime.Dr. David G. JavitchDr. David G.

/article/159442,The Toxic Entrepreneur,It's time to take a hard look at yourself to see if your behaviors and attitudes are creating a toxic environment at your company.,"Last month, I wrote about toxic employees--those individuals who, like nasty chemicals, can be harmful and destroy almost anyone or anything they come in contact with.

After all, you're the boss and you've worked hard to build a successful organization. So how could you be toxic?It happens all the time.But you're the boss: You call the shots, you're in charge, you sign the paychecks and employees report to you. So how could your behavior be problematic? Well, it can be problematic even if you are in charge or, more important, it can be problematic simply because you are in charge.Whatever your management style, whatever your company size or whatever your industry, your employees want and need to admire and respect you. They want to look up to you, and often, they want to model themselves after you. However, when your behavior or attitude turns toxic, you confuse your employees, who previously looked up to you. They experience a conflict between wanting to see you as credible, trustworthy and admirable, but are actually experiencing you as negative, and counterproductive to productivity and worker satisfaction. Clearly, you have a problem on your hands.Remember, just because you're in charge doesn't mean you're exempt from causing problems. And your employees aren't immune from imitating your problematic behaviors and attitudes. Employees try--and often succeed--in repeating the behaviors they see, especially the behavior of their boss. If your actions or thoughts are negative and counterproductive to success, then you've created a standard, a norm and a model for others to replicate. And neither you nor your employees are immune from the virus-like spread of these behaviors and attitudes to others. Soon, the work environment becomes toxic, with productivity, profits and morale all decreasing. And you may not even know why.The Signs of Toxicity
Often, the signs of toxicity are obvious to others but not to you. They're most likely hidden by your refusal or inability to see them. Some of the most virulent forms of this poisonous negativity include:Increases in turnover and/or absenteeismIncreases in industrial accidentsIncreases in employee complaintsIncreases in your criticism of othersIncreases in your employee demands that go beyond acceptabilityIncreases in your cryptic, negative or sarcastic commentsIncreases in argumentsDecreases in productivity and profitabilityDecreases in the numbers of employees who seek out your opinion or directionDecreases in moraleDecreases in your satisfaction with othersDecreases in successes and accomplishments from both you and your employeesSo what's the cure? First, take a deep breath and calm down. No one's perfect, not even the boss. Being aware of the problem is the first step toward resolving it. Second, identify the symptoms. Reread the previous list; try to add more items to it. Third, get objective feedback by confiding in a trusted friend or fellow business owner who can provide you with honest information on your behavior and attitude, without fear of reprisals for that honesty.Fourth, identify which part of what you do is really the issue. Are you verbally critical or abusive? Are you overly impatient? Are you excessively fault finding? Do you complain too much about employees or productivity? Are you more negative with certain people, processes or events? Do you believe that people shouldn't need support or encouragement from you? Do you purposely avoid interacting with certain employees? Do you provide more negative feedback than positive to others?Take Action
Once you've identified someone whom you can trust, whether that's a close friend, an executive coach or consultant, or another business owner you know well, here are a few steps you can take to resolve the problem:Discuss and share with this person exactly which behaviors or attitudes seem to at issue. Make sure you both agree on these points.State why you want to change or modify these behaviors.Identify ways or methods you can begin to transform the challenging areas. Spend a lot of time on this one because this is critical in achieving success.Set up a realistic timeframe to achieve your goals.Ascertain ways to evaluate your progress and know when you've succeeded implementing new behaviors and attitudes.Finally, be sure to reward yourself for your progress. Rewarding yourself will increase the probability that you'll repeat these positive behaviors.In addition to working through the issues with your mentor, it's also important to identify a person with whom you've had difficulty because of your toxic behavior. Once you're on the path to recovery and have interacted with them again, ask them for their perception of this latest contact. Find out how they perceived the ""new you."" You can truly begin the process of de-toxifying when you demonstrate to that person that you honestly want feedback and that giving it in no way will result in any retribution, even if the feedback is negative. Then praise or thank them for giving you the feedback.You'll gain brownie points with this person simply by requesting the information and then responding in a positive manner. You'll be showing yourself to be a more open person, intent on gaining information to improve your behavior. And in that way, you'll be modeling for that employee a positive behavior that hopefully they'll use with others. In one fell swoop, you'll have accomplished two goals at once. And you'll be well on your way to eliminating the toxicity in your life.Dr. David G. JavitchDr. David G.

/article/159444,Recognizing Toxic Employees,Do you know the signs? And just what should you do if you identify one in your company?,"You know the word ""toxic"" often refers to nasty, chemical products or by-products--those compounds you know to be poisonous, dangerous, contaminated and even lethal. But did you know the word could also apply to employees, perhaps even someone in your own business?Just what is a toxic employee and how do you recognize one? Are they really harmful to your business? And if they are, what exactly can you do about them?Identifying the Disease
Like a virus, toxic employees can subtly--or overtly--spread their counterproductive attitudes or actions that can negatively impact the workplace. Their harmful, contrarious and antagonistic attitudes and actions can easily spread to other employees who then begin to agree with and identify with the toxic individual.The result? Vulnerable employees without a strong immune system or the ability to rationally understand what's happening can become victims of this virus; these victims often can't discern or differentiate antagonism from positive criticism, can't separate forming negative coalitions from simply agreeing with colleagues. Because neither employees nor organizations are immune from employees with toxic, negative attitudes and behaviors, as the boss, you have to be aware of the signs, symptoms and impact of employee toxicity.So just what are the symptoms? They are many:A decrease in or lack of productivityA decrease in or poor moraleAn increased frequency in arguments between the employee and othersA sense that the employee is increasingly frustrated because ""things just aren't going right""A negative, antagonistic attitudeAn increase in negative comments and personal attacksAn unwillingness to work overtime or stay late without reasonAn unwillingness to ""go the extra mile"" while encouraging others to refuse as wellOther symptoms include infighting, backbiting, passive/aggressive behavior (aggressive actions done in a passive or weak manner), arguments or criticisms for the sake of being different or antagonistic, and an unwillingness to help out others in a culture that values providing input and assistance to colleagues.This is not to suggest that opposing views or differences of opinions, attitudes and behaviors must be squelched. But when these behaviors are negatively affecting other employees and productivity, you've got to jump in and address the problem.Curing the ProblemSo what exactly should you do?The answer is, ""It depends."" If you're a laissez-faire, hands-off leader, then you could do nothing and just hope the situation will go away or burn itself out. And every once in awhile, it will. But understand that in the majority of cases, this action (which is really an inaction on your part) will not correct the situation. On the contrary, it will only serve to allow the problem to grow and continue to negatively impact and infect your business's other employees, productivity, growth, profitability and success.On the other hand, if you're an action-oriented entrepreneur whose would prefer to isolate and end these negative attitudes and actions, then you have several ""antiviral"" techniques you can use.First, you need to ""identify the virus."" In other words, you need gather your data to ensure that you have an accurate and complete picture of the situation. You don't want to take any action based simply on hearsay or assumptions.So your first step is to talk to any managers or supervisors who work directly with the toxic employee. Look at error rates, attendance or tardiness records, late arrivals or early departures. Determine whether the employee's work, such as reports or projects, is being completed on time and with top quality. If projects are late, delayed or laden with errors, try to determine why or if a pattern exists. Investigate the complaints of negativity or antagonism. Do these occur with just one individual or with several or many individuals? In other words, is this an isolated personal issue between two people or one that's happening across the board?Next, speak with your staffers who work most closely with the employee in regards to problem employee's attitude toward work, colleagues, the unit and the company in general. Determine who else may be infected with a negative attitude, behavior or performance record.When you have sufficient information to validate the complaints or anecdotes you've heard about the toxic employee, invite that employee into your office or a neutral office to discuss the situation. The goal here is to have a positive interaction with the employee, not an argument or negative confrontation. What you're attempting to do is determine the accuracy of your information as compared to the toxic employee's version.Begin by stating your concerns in a general manner: that you've heard there are some potential problems, that the atmosphere is not as positive or productive as possible, that some employees are dissatisfied or upset. In other words, don't jump all over the employee with your information. Doing so will simply create a negative atmosphere and immediately put the employee on the defensive. In such cases, the outcome of the interaction is usually negative, stalemated and nonproductive. Instead, allow the employee to share their views of the situation, their relationships with their colleagues, their behavior at meetings, and any other areas in question.Then state the results of your information collection. Identify key areas of inconsistency between your information and the toxic employee's views. Attempt to reconcile the views or at least get an understanding as to why differences in perceptions of the situation exist (the old ""he said/she said"" argument). Attempt to demonstrate how you and others see the employee as negative or toxic, even if the employee's views differ from yours.At this juncture, one of two things usually is evident: Either the employee's views are inconsistent with your information, or the information from both sides is compatible. In the first case, the employee might refuse to believe your information. Then the employee can either decide to change their behavior and attitude anyway just to be more aligned with the behavior and attitude you want. Or the employee can simply refuse to change. In the second scenario, you'll then have to decide whether to begin an official warning system procedure or the termination process.Keep in mind that when meeting with your toxic employee, your goal is to change their behavior and attitude. If you've invested time and money in developing an employee, especially a long-term employee, jumping quickly into the termination process may not be the best solution or return on your investment.However, if it appears the employee just will not or cannot make changes that will lower the levels of toxicity everyone else is encountering, then beginning the termination process may unfortunately be exactly what is required.David G.

/article/84128,Having Trouble Finding Tech Employees?,Why are so many entrepreneurs struggling to find qualified tech employees?,"						This story appears in the April 2006 issue of Entrepreneur. Subscribe  After three months of looking for a technician to install phone systems, Sheila Mayer Tobier has yet to find one she wants to hire. Those she has found through a combination of networking and online job banks have either lacked the skills she wants, not returned her calls, or been lured away by other offers of employment. ""It's always hard to find people,"" says the 50-year-old co-founder of Proactive Solutions Inc., a seven-person, $1 million telecommunications and home automation business in Plantation, Florida, that she started with Richard Tobier, 45. ""But it seems to be a little more difficult now.""The supply of technically trained employees started shrinking last year, according to Tom Gerace, CEO and co-founder of Boston-based Gather Inc., an online source for user-generated content. ""Last year, hiring technical workers didn't pose a problem for this company,"" says Gerace, 35. ""We found terrific talent and were able to recruit people on schedule. This year, we're seeing the market as much more competitive for talent.""Jobs calling for skills in Java programming, database systems and quality assurance have been harder for the 25-person company to fill, says Gerace, who attributes the shortage to revived venture funding for tech startups and bigger companies restarting shelved IT projects. ""The number of applications coming in has dropped,"" he says. ""We're still getting quality people, but they often are coming in with an offer in hand or looking at two or three other opportunities.""These entrepreneurs' experiences are far from unusual, according to Charlie Jones, vice president of operations for Yoh Co., a technical and professional staffing company based in Philadelphia. Jones singles out data warehousing and internet portal technology as two of the areas where companies are scrambling most to find people. ""High-level architects and designers are at a premium,"" he says. ""And though there is greater demand for some of the [more advanced] technologies, demand is increasing across the enterprise."" Another hard-to-find employee is the worker who combines business savvy with technical expertise, he adds.Companies that can't find the technicians they need suffer a variety of ills. Completion dates for current development projects may be pushed back, and new ones may be delayed. The projects likely to be affected nega-tively are precisely the ones most companies can't afford to have hurt, Jones says. ""What you're seeing right now is a shortage in the critical skill areas,"" Jones adds. ""These are areas of high technology that are leading-edge or bleeding-edge, that really drive a company's profitability.""A worker scarcity should also drive up wages, and some evidence suggests that is occurring. According to the Yoh Index of Technology Wages, which tracks wages of highly skilled workers, pay for these employees rose a sharp 2.7 percent in one month, July 2005. Although wages grew a more modest 1.1 percent the following month and fell slightly in September, Jones expects 2006 to hold more strong hikes.""By the end of this year, we're going to see a pretty significant swing in terms of wages and hourly rates for IT consultants and IT professionals,"" Jones says. ""I wouldn't be surprised to see double-digit gains in the near future.""So far, we haven't seen a return to the dotcom days of lavish and often frivolous perks offered to tech candidates by companies desperate to get them onboard. ""Power has shifted more to the employer with the economic downturn,"" says Peter Koutroubis, a data team leader who manages sales and recruiting for Yoh. ""Five years ago, a lot of people had pool tables and a refrigerator stocked with beer, and people could wear flip-flops to work. Now it's, 'You're going to dress in a certain way, and we're going to cut back on the fringe benefits.'""Instead of perks, employers are resorting to offerings that enhance work-life balance and help employees see how they fit into the business. ""At the companies that are most successful, you are seeing some flexible work schedules,"" Jones says. Employees are also attracted to companies that can show them a plan for how they will be used at the company for the short and long term. Rather than just a paycheck, today's tech workers want to feel they are making a difference and are treated fairly, he says.Not everybody agrees there's a less than adequate supply of technicians. Richard F. Tax, president of the Ameri-can Engineering Association, a professional organization in Fort Worth, Texas, says those who cry shortage are repeating misconceptions and misstatements by people who hope to benefit from the perception of a shortage. ""Everybody's been yelling about shortages for years,"" he says. ""But if they looked, they'd find there is no shortage.""As an example, Tax points to a widely circulated 1987 National Science Foundation report that warned of a massive shortage of engineers and scientists in the coming years. Although the basis of the report was later largely discredited, it led to considerable public debate and legislation aimed at increasing funding for engineering education and boosting the NSF budget. The report has also been cited in efforts to raise the number of foreign technicians allowed to work in the U.S. under the H-1B visa program.Other reports since have falsely stated that fewer college students were seeking engineering, math and science degrees, or that there were other signs of a current or future shortage. However, no serious, long-lasting shortage has appeared. Demand and supply of engineers and other technically trained workers fluctuates, with more students seeking computer science and related degrees when demand is high, and vice versa. This alarm is no different, Tax says: ""Nothing has really changed.""Across the country, however, recruiters and employers say technically skilled workers are getting harder to find. One reason may be that employers' demands for the positions have been ramped up. Mayer Tobier, for example, doesn't want just any technician. She wants someone with experience working on the Panasonic equipment she sells. It may be that employers aren't quite needy enough yet to pay technicians what they want, or to accept that they will have to train technicians in some skills.At Proactive Solutions, Mayer Tobier says she'll muddle through with what she has until she finds what she's looking for, although she doesn't consider the situation ideal. ""I'm taking my time because I seem to be able to get the work done with the people we have,"" she says. ""But I think I'd be able to give better service to my clients if I had more people.""Mark Henricks is Entrepreneur's ""Staff Smarts"" columnist.",Inspiring Your Team,2006-04-01 00:00:00
/article/83804,When Good Employees Go Bad,How do you handle formerly perfect employees who have turned into problems? This expert has some tips.,"Let's say you've got an employee you think is pretty much close to perfect. This staff member has continually been productive, cooperative and successful, and has always contributed positively to the work effort. They're responsive to direction and input from others, take initiative, complete their work in a timely manner, ask appropriate questions, and willingly participate in work-related events. Their mood is positive and upbeat, and they're a joy to be around.Recently, however, their productivity has tanked. They're no longer cooperative, productive or self-motivated, and they may be irritable or even depressed. They're not getting their work done and their formerly sunny disposition has a little black rain cloud right over it.If this is the case, it doesn't take Sigmund Freud to tell you that your employee is experiencing some kind of event that's sucking the energy, enthusiasm and productivity right out of them. You know it, and, most likely, other people know it, too.So what do you do when an effective employee's work output begins to take a tumble? When your formerly close-to-perfect employee turns into a problem?First, realize that no change occurs without some form of awareness, either internally (within the individual) or externally (from the boss, colleagues, significant others, etc.). The easiest way to gain insight into the problem or issue is to speak directly with the employee.But wait. Before you interact with that employee, you'll want to prepare yourself for a frank discussion with that employee by first gathering any necessary data. That might include first discussing your concerns with the employee's direct supervisor or team leader; looking into their productivity levels; reviewing performance factors, including quality and error rates; taking a look at their absentee records; and reviewing any complaints made to your HR manager. Then examine their job description to understand exactly what the employee is supposed to be doing as opposed to what you think they should be doing. What you want to do is gain as complete a picture of the situation as possible before you speak to the employee. But do it quickly! Enough time has passed since this out-of-the-ordinary behavior pattern began--no need to waste more time.Next, ask the employee to meet you in a neutral space, such as the conference room or some other quiet area. Avoid meeting in the employee's office or workspace, since that can be seen as an invasion of turf. (After your discussion, your employee will have no ""safe"" haven to return to.)If no neutral space is available, then meet in your office. Ask the employee in and invite them to sit down. The goal is to create a positive atmosphere where the two of you can talk openly and honestly with each other about the employee's job performance. Remember, you're relating to a valued employee whose work has generally been positive and effective. Something now is wrong, and your goal is to learn what the issue is and to create mutually agreeable methods and steps to reverse that downward slope of productivity.Try to avoid sitting behind your desk--you don't want to set up a barrier to communication or create an adversarial atmosphere. If possible, sit at a round table so you don't appear to be in a power position or too distant from the employee. If a table's not available, pull your chair out from behind your desk and sit next to the person. Create positive rapport by maintaining eye contact, keeping your arms and legs uncrossed, and having a pleasant look on your face. Even though you're in charge, you need to avoid coming off as ""the big boss"" who's coming down on an underling for poor job performance.Begin the conversation with a positive tone of voice and on a positive note. Talk about the employee's past successes and praise past accomplishments. If it's appropriate, mention potential plans for their near future and career path.Then, while maintaining eye contact, you can take one of two tacks. You can be fairly straightforward and mention that ""Things seem to be going wrong (or not well, or not consistent with past performance, or something similar)"" as based on several criteria, which you can present at this time, including complaints, performance data, absentee records, unusual behavior and so on.Or you can be more general and ask them, ""How would you evaluate your recent accomplishments (or behavior, or attitude, or mood)?"" If you use this latter approach, you have to be prepared for the employee to respond that ""Everything seems to be going well...perhaps not perfectly, but certainly passably."" If this is the case, then you need to use the data you collected to show that ""all is not well.""Be firm about your beliefs that all is not well, but don't be overbearing: Coming on too strong will usually prompt an employee to deny or minimize any problems or difficulties. Your goal is to encourage this person to realize that you're aware of the difficulties they've been having, and to open up and participate in a discussion about what's really going on and how you two can turn it around so the employee can return to their former productive self.If the employee tries to negate your information and appears resistant to the possibility that something's wrong, don't push the point. Instead, simply refer to the data and talk about their recent performance. It's possible that the individual doesn't want to admit to having any problems such as issues at home, problems with alcohol or drugs, lack of competence, or fears and anxieties). Your goal is not to force them to admit to a problem but rather to look at the hard facts of a decrease in productivity, regardless of the cause.Often, at this point, the employee will admit to decreased output or performance. Then you can begin to look into ways to turn their behavior around. Perhaps more training or closer supervision is needed; perhaps more appropriate work tools or implements are required. Maybe their work schedule needs to be modified to allow for daycare drop-off and pick-up. Or maybe they just need a few days off to relax and de-stress. You may even want to discuss the benefits of seeking a counselor or social worker who can help them deal with the causes and impact of whatever the underlying issue is. In any case, no matter what they're problem is, your concern is for their well being as well as for a return to their previous positive levels of performance.No matter what approach you take to working with a performance issue, the key to remember is that you value this individual and the individual's previous work ethic and output. Your task--and the task of the individual involved--is to come up with a plan for turning that former productive employee back into a standout performer.Dr. David G. JavitchDr. David G.

/article/83774,Hiring Your First Employee,Looking to bring your first employee on board? We'll help you understand the legal requirements of hiring staff so you don't hit any rough waters down the line.,"For months, you've operated your new business as lean and mean as possible and continue to wear every hat yourself. Finally, you've hit a point--or your breaking point--where, in order to remain competitive and prosper, you'll need to welcome a helping hand aboard your tight ship.But before bringing just anyone on board, you need to understand that extra manpower entails a whole new string of legal obligations, liabilities, expenses and, of course, paperwork. One estimate tallies the average cost of recruiting, hiring and training a new employee at close to $4,000.Beyond the red tape, hiring mismatches can result in high turnover, absenteeism, higher healthcare costs, workplace violence and theft--substantial costs to an organization's bottom line and reputation.To help you navigate the legal ramifications of the hiring process, we've laid out the steps and precautions you should follow to ensure you make informed decisions, while staying within legal and ethical boundaries.1. Don't trust your instincts. Whether your new recruit will be filing reports or configuring computer networks, realize that criminal, under-qualified, and emotionally unstable minds hide in all uniforms and job titles. In reality, nearly 40 percent of all job applications and resumes include bogus or inflated facts. Plus, the number of negligent hiring lawsuits in this country is mounting--if your staff member's actions hurt someone, you can be held accountable and sued. And with terror acts, corporate scandals and identity theft on the rise, trusting your gut as a basis to hire is simply unsafe.So just what do background checks check, and what kind of stuff is off limits? The search typically consists of confirmation of prior employment claims, determination of worker's compensation claims and criminal and incarceration records, drug tests, credit history and driving record. In some cases, an identity (Social Security) check is undertaken.While much of this information is documented publicly, certain personal records, including education, military and medical, are confidential and necessitate an applicant's consent before digging them up. If you can, you should try to obtain original educational credentials. With advances in technology, a manufactured diploma or degree is as simple as typing in a few keystrokes.When prying into an interviewee's possible criminal past, take note: While a criminal conviction can be reported indefinitely, arrest records, paid tax liens, accounts placed for collection, civil suits and judgments can't be included on an employment background check after seven years. In some states, more stringent reporting rules apply. In California, for example, bankruptcies are off limits after ten years.If you plan to farm out a fact-finding hunt to a third-party, you're required by federal law to alert the person who's under investigation in writing. You must also notify the applicant if he or she is being denied a position due to disparaging information you've uncovered, and give him or her a chance to refute that information.Be forewarned, however: The internet is loaded with scam artists and private companies that compile ""virtual rap sheets."" What such online brokers dish up isn't always accurate or current, and the low rates they advertise may be deceptive.Each of the following firms is established in this arena and has been in existence for thirty years or more:Sterling Testing SystemsIntellicorp Background ScanningKrollworldwideUnderstand that the more jurisdictions you want to search, the more you're likely to pay.2. Test for illegal substances. With more than 250,000 drug- and alcohol-related deaths a year nationwide, our society's battle against substance abuse is far from over. Whether cocaine or sleeping pills are the drug of choice, addicts can be a terrible drain on an organization's productivity and balance sheet. Did you know that 65 percent of on-the-job accidents are related to substance abuse? And drug-abusing employees are six times more likely to file worker's compensation claims than other staff members.To weed out such weak links from your work environment, pre-employment and random drug testing are an employer's best lines of defense. Some occupations actually mandate such checks, including industrial tractor and truck operators, material movers, child-care workers, teachers, private and corporate investigators, state and federal personnel and police officers.Before instituting a drug exam of your own, bear in mind, on pre-employment interviews, it's illegal to inquire about a candidate's prescription medication use. However, if an applicant refuses a drug test, an employment offer can be denied or retracted.3. Screen for unwanted behavior. Depending on the position you're trying to fill, there are supplementary screening options available. Psychological testing, handwriting analysis, skill and aptitude tests and even lie detector tests are additional assessment tools that business owners exercise today to help them select the best job candidates. Such profiling allows you to select people who have the skills and the temperament needed to succeed in your business. To avoid any legal problems, before administering such tests, be prepared to demonstrate job-relatedness, non-discrimination and statistical validity.Time to HireOnce you've completed your behind-the-scenes evaluation and have turned up some promising candidates, you'll need to know the dos and don'ts of interviewing someone face to face.1. Some questions are off limits. Whether on a written employment application or in person, it's unlawful to ask about an applicant's age, sexual orientation, marital status, religious affiliation or race. And questions pertaining to the nature of a physical, emotional or mental handicap can only be asked if an applicant will need special accommodations for performing a specific job.During your dialogue, you should also be mindful of other important federal laws including:Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which covers the subject of discrimination or harassment on the basis of race, religion, sex or creedThe Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990The Family Medical Leave Act of 1993For more information on each of the federal laws noted above, visit the sites for the U.S. Department of Labor , the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and MyEmploymentLawyer.com .2. Check references. Before making a formal job offer, be sure to ask the contender for at least three references. Two of the references should be professional, and one should be personal to help endorse the character of the applicant. Then pick up the phone and call those references--do not neglect this step! You'd be surprised what references are willing to tell you about an applicant if you'd only ask.Be sure to keep your queries as objective as possible, and, if you're speaking to the professional references, make sure they relate directly to the candidate's job performance and duties and to information provided on the application or resume, or to information provided during the interview. Forms of discrimination that apply to interviewing and hiring are also applicable to reference checking, so be sure to avoid questions that involve race, age, disabilities, national origin, religion or marital status. For a personal reference, find out how long they've known the person and then ask about the person's character and work ethic; you might also ask if the person would hire the applicant themselves, if they had an appropriate job opening to fill.3. Set a salary and choose the employee's classification. When it comes to paying and classifying a new employee, federal laws provide clear guidelines when it comes to both. The minimum wage currently stands at $5.15 per hour--that's the lowest you can go when it comes to paying hourly wages. And if it's a young person you're putting on your books, the Fair Labor Standards Act sets the minimum age for employment in non-agricultural employment at 14 years old.Depending on your hiring needs and finances, you'll need to determine the status of your new employee as being part time or full time. According to the U.S. Department of Labor, part-time workers are those who work 20 hours or less per week, while full-timers log in 30 hours or more. Because states differ on the payment of benefits to part-time employees, you should check corresponding regulations with your local department of labor.For tax reasons, you must categorize your worker as an independent contractor, common-law employee, statutory employee or statutory nonemployee. Misclassification can result in fines equal to one-and-a-half percent of the questionable wages, plus the withholding taxes. Criminal charges can apply as well.As long as you retain the right to control their activities (such as when and where the person works, the tools and equipment they use, and where they purchase supplies), your workers are considered common-law employees .A statutory employee is one who's an employee by statute and is allowed to report income and expenses as a business. The most common employees in this category are its officers, but it also includes such employees as:A full-time traveling salespeople who solicit orders from wholesalers, restaurants, or similar establishments on behalf of the company. The merchandise sold must be for resale (for example, food sold to a restaurant) or for supplies used in the buyer's business.An agent-driver or commission-driver engaged in distributing meat, vegetables, bakery goods, beverages (other than milk), or laundry or dry cleaning servicesA home worker performing work on material or goods furnished by the employerA statutory nonemployee , which includes direct sellers and licensed real estate agents, is treated as self-employed for all federal tax purposes, including income and employment taxes.An independent contractor works for himself or herself, often for more than one company. This person typically works offsite, is paid on a per-job or commission basis, and sends invoices for his or her services. Employers aren't required to deduct taxes on their behalf or extend them the same benefits that they do for standard employees. This also applies to freelancers and consultants. For tax purposes, it's a good idea to draft an agreement with an independent contractor, stating that he or she is not an employee.4. Get your records straight. Before your newest team member logs in a single hour of work, there's a folder's worth of records you'll need to complete and process. According to the U.S. Department of Labor , there are 12 records an employer must maintain on each member of their staff for the length of their employment:Employee's full name and social security numberMailing address, including ZIP codeBirth date, if the employee is younger than 19Sex and occupationTime of day and day of the week when employee's workweek begins, hours worked each day, and total hours worked each workweekBasis on which employee's wages are paid (weekly, bi-monthly, and so on)Regular hourly pay rateTotal daily or weekly ""straight time"" earnings for each workweekTotal overtime earnings for each workweekAll additions to or deductions taken from employee's wagesTotal wages paid each pay periodDate of payment and the pay period covered by the each paymentWhen it comes to filing taxes, you'll also want to make sure your paperwork's in order. Here's a list of the taxes you'll need to shell out and the related documents you'll need to file as an employer, according to the Internal Revenue Service :A W4 form to withhold the proper amount of federal income tax from a full- or part-time employee's pay, once a year to your state and federal governmentsA W2 form to the Social Security Administration and a share of a full- or part-time employee's Social Security payroll taxes (FICA) once a year to your state and federal governmentsAn I-9 Employment Eligibility Verification form for every new hireTaxes on 1099 workers (independent contractors) either quarterly or once a year to the federal governmentThe same forms must also be submitted to the your state's department of labor or taxationProof of worker's comp insurance. Such a policy indemnifies a business against its legal liabilities towards accidental or fatal injuries sustained by employees during working hours. Although this is required by federal law, the administration of this benefit is at the state level.State and federal unemployment taxes, but only if (1) they pay wages to employees totaling $1,500 or more in any quarter of a calendar year, or (2) they employed at least one person during any day of the week during any 20 weeks in a calendar year, regardless of whether or not the weeks were consecutive. In some states, this is tied to a worker's status as part time or full time, but you should contact your state workforce agency to learn the exact requirements.5. Handle your immigration issues carefully. With roughly 10 million undocumented immigrants living in America, obviously, this segment of the population has become a major factor in our workforce. If you're sponsoring or petitioning a foreign national to work here, you must verify and send in documents proving his or her eligibility to do so here.To avoid civil and criminal penalties and audits to your company payroll, you must also file an I-140 form (Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker) on his or her behalf with the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS). An Employment Authorization Document, also known as an I-9 check, must accompany such credentials.There are additional, specialized classification forms to fill out, depending on what type of work the foreign national will be doing. For more on this process and an employer's obligations, contact the USCIS .6. Get the right insurance coverage. While only Puerto Rico, California, Hawaii, New Jersey, New York and Rhode Island require employers to provide income to disabled employees who get hurt off the job, many experts advise buying disability (or loss of income) insurance for yourself and key employees from the get-go.There are two basic types of disability coverage: short term (which covers anywhere from 12 weeks to one year), and long term (which covers anything over a year). An important component of disability coverage is the waiting period before benefits are paid. For short-term disability, an employee will generally have to wait seven to 14 days. For long-term disability, an employee will wait anywhere from 30 days to one year. If having an employee laid up for a limited period of time wouldn't seriously jeopardize your business, you can decrease your premiums by choosing a longer waiting period.Well that's it--the basics of legally becoming someone else's boss. While you may be intimidated by the scope of your new role, remember why you went solo in the first place. There's a price to pay for investing in your own destiny. Hopefully your outlay will be eclipsed by productivity and profit!

/article/83618,Build Your Management Team,"If the time has come to admit you can't do it all, this guide can help you figure out just who you need on your executive team, where to find them and how to hire them.","In the early days of running your own business, it's natural to try to do as much as possible yourself. It's the most cost-effective, comfortable, sensible way to do things in the beginning. But as your enterprise grows, you'll find yourself stretched thinner and thinner. Eventually, you'll find you just can't continue to oversee operations and sales and accounting and fulfillment and marketing--and hope to continue to grow your business.When you reach this point, it's time to think about bringing other high-level managers on board to help you out. You need to build a senior team that's able to manage all the critical areas of your business to take it to the next level.Building your team demands matching jobs to people's strengths. That means giving people responsibilities according to skill level, not based on how close a friend they are, or how closely related they are to you, or whether you just like their sunny personality. That includes you as well--don't give yourself an impressive title and job unless you're right for the job. The fact is, many smart entrepreneurs hire their own boss when they realize their skills lie elsewhere in the company.When it comes time to hire an executive team, you'll need to find people to fill the following roles:Chief Executive Officer (CEO). The fact of the matter is, the CEO is the boss of everyone and is responsible for everything. They determine the company's strategy. They hire and build the senior team. They make the final call on how resources (read: money) get divvied up, and they're the one whose face appears on the cover of BusinessWeek--whether that's in front of a grand jury on ethics charges or in front of a 3,000-foot yacht, wildly successful, and richer than a Betty Crocker, triple-chocolate fudge cake.The CEO's skills must include strategic thinking, the ability to rise above the daily details and decide where the industry and business are headed. They must then be able to decide the company's best route for navigating the future market conditions. They have to be able to make good bets.The CEO's key skill, however, is in hiring and firing. The right management team can cover a CEO's shortcomings. A CEO may be able to set strategy, predict the future and control the budget, but if they don't hire the right team, they have to master it all themselves. So they need to be able to identify and hire the best, fire the ones who don't work out, and run the show in between.You know you need a professional CEO when you're mired in the details for way too long and can't pull yourself out. CEOs think about where the organization is going, the people and processes needed to get there, and how they'll work in the current market. If you like details rather than strategy, either shift your thinking or hire a CEO to do the job for you.Chief Operating Officer (COO). A COO handles a company's complex operational details. Think about UPS moving three billion packages in the two weeks before Christmas: The company's COO insures the business can deliver day after day. He figures out just what needs to be measured so he can tell if things are going well. Then his team creates the systems to track the measurements and takes action when the company isn't delivering.In a one-location retail business, the store manager is effectively the COO. When you expand to multiple locations or when ensuring smooth operations becomes a big part of your business, it's time to hire someone who revels in measurements, operations and details.President. No one knows just what a president does. I've asked dozens of executives, and everyone's answer is different. Some say a president oversees staff functions--human resources, finance and strategy--while the COO oversees daily operations. Others proclaim that the president is a synonym for COO, especially in smaller companies. Yet sometimes, the president fills gaps left by the COO and CEO. Or sometimes, the title goes to someone you want at the strategy table but who doesn't have an obvious C-level title. In any case, you should think long and hard about whether you need someone to fill this title, or if your company is fully covered with a CEO and COO.Chief Financial Officer (CFO). Plain and simple, your CFO handles the money. They create budgets and financing strategies. They figure out if it's better for your business to lease or buy. Then they build the control systems that monitor your company's financial health. The CFO is the ""bad guy"" who won't let you buy that really cool videoconferencing equipment and makes you pay down a commercial loan instead. While you mope about it in your office, the CFO will be busy figuring out which customers, business lines and products are profitable, so next year you can afford the really cool videoconferencing equipment.Believe me, you'll know when you need a CFO. Do you lie awake at night dreaming about numbers? No? Then you need to bring someone on board who does. You want a person whose dream birthday gift is a calculator and a blank book of ledger paper. Money is your business's blood, and in entrepreneurship, cash flow is everything. You don't know the difference between cash flow and profit? Run--don't walk--to the nearest phone and go find yourself a CFO.Chief Marketing Officer (CMO). Recently, companies have been bringing in a marketing expert at the C-level rather than as just a vice president. The reason is simple: Many current business battles are battles of marketing, so corporate strategy often hinges on marketing strategy. The CMO owns the marketing strategy--and that often includes the sales strategy--and oversees its implementation. The CMO will know (or learn) your industry inside out and helps you position your product, differentiate it from your competitors' products, enlist distributors, and make sure customers learn to crave your product.If your business's success depends mainly on marketing, you need a CMO. That might be you--but only if you have time to keep up with competitors, oversee the marketing implementation, and still do the rest of your job--and do it well. Otherwise, you need to look for the person with the sunny disposition, Blackberry in hand, keeping up on what's hot and what's not.Chief Technology Officer (CTO). I'm a techie from way back, so I'm pretty opinionated about CTOs: Many of them just don't belong in the C-suite. A CTO should keep up with technology trends, integrate those trends into the company's strategy, and make sure the company keeps current when it's necessary. They should not be buying new toys and leading-edge technology just because it's the latest, greatest thing out there.You need a CTO if technology impacts your business or industry strategically. (If you're in tech yourself, or your industry relies heavily on technology, that means you.)Here's a quick test to find out if your CTO can link technology and strategy: Ask your CTO how a company's chosen programming language choice affects strategy. If the answer sounds more sophisticated than ""It makes it easier to find programmers,"" your CTO just might know how to think strategically.Finding Your Team Members
Unfortunately, good executives don't grow on trees (and you wouldn't want to hire the ones that do). Since their decisions can make or break your business, you want the best. Newspapers, classified ads and internet bulletin boards are not the way to go. And mass-market ads will attract exactly that--the mass market, people who have no other job prospects. (A skillful, former executive rarely lists themselves in the same newspaper section as used backyard grills and heavy farm machinery.)If you have the funds available, executive search firms are a good way to go. Although they charge through the nose to find candidates, they do due diligence and present you with pre-screened candidates, so when you're running around handling the emergency of the day, they can be a huge time-saver. They also monitor the pool of executive talent and can likely reach candidates you couldn't approach on your own. Search firms may specialize by industry, function, geography and level of job, so if you decide to hire one, make sure you know what you're getting.Networking is a time-honored way to find new hires. Let your professional and personal networks know what kind of person you're looking for. Then get one-on-one introductions, and take the candidate to lunch to test the chemistry.When networking, avoid specific ""networking forums."" Go straight for what you want. If you want a law firm CMO, spend a weekend at the Legal Sales and Service Organization's Raindance conference, which attracts senior marketing folk from law firms. Network, network, network--but make sure it's targeted.Once you've got a potential candidate, how will you know for sure they can do the job? Executives have great impact--on employees, on systems, on profits--so it's worth your time to check them out thoroughly. Call each of their references, and listen between the lines (with lawsuits today, recommendations always glow). A CFO may have embezzled from his last company, but the employer still says ""They did a good job"" (I swear--this is a true story). This grade inflation means you need to listen for less-than-glowing opinions. ""Fred showed up and sat at his desk like a real trooper"" is a sure sign that Fred enjoys taking every Wednesday off to go golfing with the boys.Interviewing Tips
When it comes time to sit down with your potential C-suite candidate, there are a few things to know that will make your job a little easier:Make sure your candidate really knows the job. If your CMO-to-be doesn't know the difference between marketing and sales or your CFO can't tell you the difference between LIFO and FIFO, pass 'em by.Interview for chemistry. Do you trust this candidate? Do you want to spend time with them? Believe me when I say, you don't want an abrasive team member, no matter how talented they may be. One COO I know, scared to make the hard decision, reorganized his entire company around a highly talented, incredibly obnoxious executive that everyone despised. The exec's talent got to shine--but everyone within 100 yards quietly subdued theirs.Talk to people from your candidate's former company. Are the candidate's claims of divine brilliance reflected in what their former peers and subordinates have to say about them? Find out if they got the work done and also how they contributed to the company's culture. In a small business, cultural issues can be every bit as important as getting things done.Always hire really smart people. Here's a good guideline to follow: Every new hire should increase your company's average IQ. That means they should all be smarter than you. Get used to it.Look for evidence of learning ability. Will your candidate repeat mistakes they've made in the past? Or will they learn from those errors and adapt that knowledge to your company?Use ""behavior description interviewing"" techniques. Don't ask about principles, knowledge or ""what if"" stories. Instead, ask your potential executive team member to share specific past events. Their stories will reveal their values, skills and abilities. For example, you might ask a CFO to describe a budget they set up and how they handled it when a manager exceeded their budget and asked for more.One word of caution: Be wary of hiring friends or family members. They'll expect you to trust them and just assume they have a high skill level. What's worse, you may trust them and assume they have a high skill level without any evidence to the contrary until after you've hired them. And unless you take care to be very clear about the boundaries between friendship and work, you may find your friendship in ruins over workplace disagreements.Making The Deal
Once you've found the executive you'd like to hire, you have to entice them to join your team. There are no standard rules for the best deal to offer them. Hourly workers may be thrilled to get cash, but executives aren't so easily satisfied. They often want stock options, exorbitant pay and an annual--or even quarterly--bonus. Since their job is to make the entire company succeed, use stock options and a bonus plan to link their income to the company's overall performance. Stock options should be aligned with long-term performance, while bonuses and profit sharing should be based on the past year's results.Of course, not all executives crave stock. Ideally, you'd love someone capable who's happy with a challenging job and modest salary. And they're out there! Some well-qualified people care much more about family time, a fun culture, a challenging job, or being part of a world-changing effort. The more you understand each person's drivers, the more you can craft deals that satisfy them in ways that transcend mere dollars.But no matter what you decide to offer, keep it simple. If your bonus formula requires a PhD in higher math to understand, it won't motivate anyone.Delegating to Your New Executives
Once the new members of your team are on board, it's time for the truly hard part: trusting them. Your gut will fight you every step of the way. You'll assume your instructions are clear and misunderstandings are their fault. You'll assume when you disagree that you're right and they're wrong. But you'll sometimes be wrong. The key to successful executive relationships is changing what your gut tells you.Remember how you interviewed for trust? That's important because once you hire an executive team, you must let them take their responsibilities and run with them. That means agreeing with them about what their roles are, what deliverables they're responsible for and on what timeframe.It's also worth deciding in advance how you'll handle disagreements. You hired this person assuming their judgment was better than yours. So when you disagree, if you did your job right, chances are that they're right and you're wrong. Discuss early on about how you'll make the call, so you get the most benefit from constructive conflict. Just remember: If you agree on everything, one of you is redundant.Entrepreneurship is about going for the things that are much bigger than what you could do alone. Your job isn't to reach the goal; it's to build a team that will reach the goal. If you really want to reach your goals, you'll need to bring on others to help, and creating a good executive team means knowing what you need them to do, finding good candidates, and giving them what they need to do their jobs. If you choose well, they'll be successful and make you successful as well.Stever Robbins is an executive coach who helps people make key changes in their lives and careers.

/article/83260,Mastering the Art of Influence,"When it comes to getting your employees to do what you want, don't discount the effect of a positive impact.","Do you sometimes question the amount of authority you successfully exert over your employees? Do you ever think you're not as commanding and effective as you'd like to be? If so, you're not alone--many other entrepreneurs share similar concerns and would like to be able to increase their influence over their employees. (We're defining influence here as the process of having an impact on other people.)My experience shows that business owners who master the use of influence are significantly more successful than those who don't. These masters of influence inspire people to do what they want them to do; they motivate their staff toward increased productivity, profitability and achievement without incurring the typical cost of organizational repair and maintenance.Gaining and maintaining influence over your employees involves three crucial challenges:Creating specific, measurable and attainable goalsIdentifying the tools, or resources, necessary for accessing internal and external sources of influenceDefining and using influencing techniquesTo get started, first visualize a specific, measurable and attainable task or series of tasks that, when achieved, will make you feel influential and appreciated by others as being influential. Then sit down and figure out just how you can transform those tasks into a series of concrete, achievable steps.Next, identify the tools, or resources, you already possess as an influential or potentially influential leader. These resources are the factors that assist you in expressing influence. And don't think you don't have any! Whether due to modesty, lack of awareness or just plain ignorance, many of you probably don't use or are even aware of the internal tools at your disposal. In other cases, you may need to borrow tools from external sources to increase your influence.Not sure what tools you have at your disposal? Here a few examples:IntelligenceGood judgmentCreativityKnowledgeSkillsAssertivenessInterpersonal networkBudgetEquipmentPast successesReputationExpertiseJob positionCharismaLeadership abilityOf course, no one has all these tools. But clearly, the more resources you have and the more you can amass from others, the more influential you'll become.The strategic question now becomes: With your specific, measurable and attainable goals determined and with your key tools in place, how can you positively influence your employees so they're working to their full capacity? The answer is, by learning specific influencing techniques.We all know how to yell, scream, rant and rave, but those mechanisms are rarely effective when it comes to exerting influence. Oh, they can impact others--but the impact is usually short lived and most often negative. And negative influence often encourages retribution, resistance and decreased quality on the part of the person who was negatively influenced.Recent research shows that the following seven methods are the most effective techniques when it comes to influencing others:1. Rapport. This technique involves creating relationships by expressing your feelings and identifying those feelings in others. So ask your employees how they feel, how their work is progressing, what they feel are obstacles to their success, how they feel about the work and the workload they have. Then be honest and tell them how you feel about them and their work style and their productivity. Sharing this type of information lets others know exactly ""what the score is"" and often leads to improved openness and productivity. Employees will appreciate your efforts and concerns about them and their work.2. Teamwork. To develop a feeling that you're all the same team working for the same goals, you need to create a synergyYou want to create an environment in which everyone is effectively working in a unified and coordinated manner with others to meet organizational goals. As you put people together in teams to solve problems or chart future courses of action, your employees will get to know each other better, can more effectively use and appreciate others' skills and expertise, and will build on each others' capabilities to solve problems. When the outcome is efficient and productive, you'll be seen in a positive light since you were the one who created the teams.3. Logic. This technique involves managing your employees by using valid, rational reasoning. When speaking to your employees, carefully, in a clear, unemotional and orderly manner, explain issues, ideas and processes. And be sure to solicit their questions and concerns, then explain any uncertainties and complexities in a manner that makes sense to them. If you can remain unemotional--but not unfeeling--about the goals you all need to achieve, your employees will come to regard you as a very effective leader.4. Assertiveness. When you ask questions, when you make assertions, when you share ideas in a manner that doesn't overwhelm, embarrass or minimize your employees, they will come to admire you and value your input because you have learned to express your thoughts and feelings with due regard for others. Furthermore, your employees will usually share more of their questions and concerns with you because you will have created a ""safe and positive"" environment for them to work in.5. Aggressiveness. This is the second cousin to assertiveness and involves expressing your thoughts and feelings without due regard for others. Although this isn't a technique I'd recommend you use on a daily basis, in times of emergency when quick responses and actions--like decisions or directions--are needed, being aggressive can be seen as positive, as long as the emergency doesn't occur with frequency.6. Credibility. You'll gaining respect by demonstrating your expertise using appropriate language and timely and accurate responsiveness. When you correctly respond to employee questions or concerns, when they can rely on you to follow up, when you modestly demonstrate your expertise, you easily impact others and have a very strong, positive influence on them.7. Cultural hierarchy. Understanding and using your knowledge of ""how things are done around here"" is a powerful way to get others to do what you want. By reminding them what acceptable behavior is by modeling it yourself and by acting in a manner consistent with those behaviors, employees will learn to respect your leadership abilities and be willing to follow your direction.These seven influencing techniques can be learned and easily applied to almost any situation. At times, one strategy will be more effective than another; sometimes, a combination of strategies is even more potent.When considering which strategy to use, you need to consider these key factors:your preferred style of leadershipthe style and personality of the person you want to influencethe issue at handthe specific situationthe location or environment in which the influence will take place. For example, a specific strategy used to influence an employee during an employee review may not be the same one to use during a sales training class.The secret to mastering the art of influence is to create specific, measurable and attainable goals, determine which tools or resources you have at hand to deploy, and then employ your techniques. The world needs truly influential leaders. Be one!Dr. David G. JavitchDr. David G.

/article/81292,SCORE's Top Human Resources Tips,Are you the best boss you can be? Create a happy workforce with these tips.,"5 Tips on Building a Senior Management TeamStart with part-timers. You may not be able to afford a full-time chief financial officer at first, but chances are you can find one who will gladly work part time.Look for volunteers. The SCORE Association is one place to start and may help you establish a volunteer advisory board. Also check with your local business schools.Consider outsourcing your management team. Check the Yellow Pages under Employment Agencies, Employee Leasing, Executive Search Consultants and Management Consultants.Check references and backgrounds, just as you would for a full-time employee. Look for a good fit.Treat part-time and volunteer executives just as you would full-time, paid senior managers. Make them a part of your team.5 Tips on Employee Performance ReviewsConcentrate on what you and the employee can achieve together in the future. Don't use performance reviews just as a means of telling workers everything they're doing wrong.Strive for consistency and fairness. Apply performance criteria to all employees, not just a few.Encourage employees to evaluate themselves and to discuss their own strengths. Your view of an employee and the employee's view of himself should match fairly well. Otherwise, it's a warning signal.Be honest about poor performance, but not brutal. Document your observations in writing.If you're small enough that constant communication and feedback are taking place, you may be able to avoid performance reviews. But don't send the message that performance isn't critical.5 Tips on Helping Employees Take Pride in Their WorkEmployees are your most important assets, so hire the best, provide training and growth opportunities, and recognize good performance.Have a meaningful, concise and realistic job description for each employee. Make sure you review it with the employee and that it's understood.Be sure employees know what is expected of them. Establish high standards of performance ethics.Offer specialized training or skills enhancement to your current employees. Promoting from within encourages and motivates your greatest assets--your current workforce.Create a New Employee Referral Bonus Program. Describe your needs in title and duties and offer a reward for your ""most wanted.""5 Tips on Hiring ImmigrantsUnderstand the benefits. Immigrants are often well-educated, intelligent, loyal and dedicated.Follow the law. Contact your Immigration and Naturalization Service field office for information and required forms. For locations, visit the INS website at www.ins.com .Keep things simple. Limit the number of languages spoken to reduce the need for interpreters.Expect a community to develop among those who speak the same language. It's OK. They can help and support each other and assist in interpretation.Encourage your employees to learn English. Send them to courses offered locally or provide classes on-site.5 Tips on Hiring Quality and Reliable PeopleExamine your own skills carefully. Know your own strengths and weaknesses and hire to complement your skills, not duplicate them.Assure yourself plenty of applicants by casting a broad net. Interview applicants in a structured way by asking all applicants for a job the same questions.Draw applicants to your website by placing the web address in all advertisements.Use an 800 phone or fax number as a toll-free way for applicants to contact you.Offer a signing bonus--anything from $25 to $2,500 could be an incentive to help bring on a fence-sitting applicant. This is a common practice for ""super starts.""5 Tips on Hiring SmartHire slowly. Be willing to invest time and energy in your hiring decisions.Be clear in your own mind what the job requires and measure candidates' qualifications against the requirements of the job.Consider how well a candidate will fit in with your corporate culture. Are her attitudes compatible? Is he cooperative?Narrow the pool to serious candidates. Ways of weeding out non-contenders include announcing that drug testing is required of all new employees or asking applicants to write a brief essay on why they want the job.Do brief phone interviews with 8 or 10 top candidates to reduce the pool further. Then do longer in-person interviews with two or three finalists.5 Tips on Recruiting Workers in a Tough Labor MarketGet referrals from employees. Consider giving bonuses to employees whose referrals are hired.Ask your suppliers. They can recommend good salespeople who have called on them or competent technical people who have serviced their equipment.Approach retirees and other good people who have worked for you before.Post an ad on the internet. Some small business owners experience success in recruiting through such employment sites as CareerBuilder, Monster Board and Career Mosaic.Consider unconventional sources. People with disabilities often make excellent employees. One business owner turned to non-violent first offenders, who weren't sent to prison, but had graduated from a Marine-style boot camp program instead.5 Tips on Promoting From WithinUnderstand your advantage. In a small company, you're in a better position to know what people's abilities and interests are than in a large company.Develop a nose for hidden talent. Find out what skills people use when they're not at work and determine if those skills can be put to use in your company--in a higher position.Create career paths for employees. Your people need opportunities to grow.Consider the work you outsource. Can that work be brought inside, creating an advancement opportunity for one of your employees?If an employee needs outside training for a higher-level job, pay for it. That'll be cheaper than recruiting a new employee.5 Tips on Where to Publicize for New HiresWrite and place ""sizzling"" help wanted ads. Write ads with a marketing perspective as to what will bring you prime prospects. Place them in trade journals and in professional association job banks and newspapers.Post job openings at colleges and trade schools. Let educational institutions know about your company and its hiring goals. Schedule personal visits as needed.Place magnetic signs on your car, truck or van. Take your advertising with you wherever you go. Showcase the phrase ""Now Hiring"" in large print with your phone number.Advertise on radio or cable television; rates can be very reasonable. Or sponsor a promotional event.Consider outdoor advertising or even bus bench ads. You can reach a wide audience.5 Tips on Where to Go to Gain ReferralsHold an open house or an in-house job fair. Invite schools, county or state job developers, and others in the community to attend.Contact Urban League, Youth Employment Programs and Private Industry Council in your area. These are wonderful training organizations that offer free placement assistance.Go online and search the internet. Post your openings on free and fee-based bulletin boards such as Monster.com, Careerpath.com or pdqcareers.com.Contact local government job banks for free referrals. All states have aggressive welfare-reform goals and may be a source of employees.Call the Veterans Administration and Rehabilitation Agency. They can refer some very capable people.Brought to you by   SCORE , ""Counselors to America's Small Business.""",Growth Strategies,2005-12-06 00:00:00

Our expert walks you through the hiring process from start to finish.,"As a business owner, one of your most important tasks is workforce management. It's your job to make sure you have the right people--and the right number of people--to keep your company running smoothly. Now let's say your business is growing and you're sensing you need to hire new employees. How can you really be sure the time is right to bring in additional staff? There are at least seven common clues:Your employees are working very hard--perhaps too hard--and they're letting you know--or complaining--that they have too much to do. Complaints of this nature aren't uncommon, but your task is to determine if they're legitimate. How can you do that? Try talking to your employees and asking them to validate their concerns of being ""overworked."" Then look at attendance and productivity indicators to substantiate their claims.

Our expert walks you through the hiring process from start to finish.,"As a business owner, one of your most important tasks is workforce management. It's your job to make sure you have the right people--and the right number of people--to keep your company running smoothly. Now let's say your business is growing and you're sensing you need to hire new employees. How can you really be sure the time is right to bring in additional staff?

Complaints of this nature aren't uncommon, but your task is to determine if they're legitimate. How can you do that?

/article/80602,Build a Stellar Sales Team,"If you want to build a strong business, you're eventually going to have to hand over the sales reins to a sales team. Here's how to do it right.","Free Webinar | August 16thFind out how to optimize your website to give your customers experiences that will have the biggest ROI for your business.							Register Now  When you're starting out, you may be sales manager, marketing director and lone salesperson all in one--plus filling whatever other spots exist on the organizational chart. As you grow, however, you'll find you need additional people to handle specialized jobs. These will someday include a chief financial officer and vice president of operations, among others. But one of the first specializations in which you're likely to need to hire is sales. This makes sense because sales are what drive your company's growth. All other things being equal, the more salespeople you have, the more sales you will generate. So adding sales personnel and improving your existing sales staff are essential parts of growing your company.Evaluating Your Sales Force Maybe your sales force is fine the way it is. Maybe not. How can you tell? Evaluating your sales force is an important step in the process of deciding whether and how to grow your sales team. If your existing sales force is fine and will be more than adequate to fuel future growth, you still might need some additional training or perhaps a revamped compensation package. On the other hand, your sales force may need to grow by a few heads, or you may choose to stay the same size but have different people filling the sales positions.Step one in evaluating your sales force is to decide what you want it to do for you. For some companies that do most of their selling through mail order or the Internet, a sales force is strictly an option. In this case, you may expect your sales force to handle only the larger accounts, leaving the smaller orders to customer service personnel and order-takers. For other companies, however, the salesperson is the most visible--and perhaps the only--outward manifestation of the company seen by customers. This type of salesperson carries a heavy load. He or she has to uphold the company's image, hold the customers' hands, interface with delivery and repair departments at headquarters, and, of course, get the sale.It won't require a lot of thought for you to come up with a good description of what you want your sales force to do. Make sure you're not evaluating your sales force based on some other company's needs. For instance, if your salespeople are primarily charged with following up on leads generated by your advertising, don't penalize them if they aren't making a lot of cold calls. Once you decide what jobs your sales force is intended for, simply check their performance against the requirements. The key measure when it comes to evaluating a sales force is sales productivity.Measuring Sales Productivity The simplest measure of sales productivity is the dollar amount of sales per salesperson. That's easy enough to figure out: Just divide the volume of sales by the number of salespeople on staff. That will give you an average sales productivity figure and let you know how the average salesperson in your organization is doing. More useful, though, is to know how each individual salesperson is doing compared to the average. You may have a handful of relatively productive people who are carrying the load for a raft of underperformers. This is the kind of information you'll need to know to decide whether to make a change.Be warned, though: Sales productivity may involve more than simply generating dollars of sales. Your sales force may be moving a lot of product now but costing you sales later by alienating customers with poor service. They may be making promises you cannot deliver on, overburdening your production and shipping departments. They may be selling a lot of the wrong products (items with low margins or high support costs) while ignoring your more profitable lines. Check to see if certain salespeople have large numbers of returns or tend to sell to customers who don't pass credit checks. These salespeople could be costing you more than they're worth.Hiring Salespeople Adding salespeople can result in steadily increasing sales. This can free you up to spend time and energy on other tasks. Hiring salespeople could also hurt sales, erode profits, damage valuable customer relationships, and destroy your image in the marketplace. The difference between these two scenarios is the difference between hiring the right salespeople and the wrong ones.Salespeople aren't just the people responsible for building your bottom line. They're also your front-line troops, the ones with the most daily contact with your customers. With those caveats in mind, it's important to not only grow your sales force, but to grow it properly.To start with, understand that there may not be any truly bad salespeople. There may just be good salespeople in the wrong positions. To hire the right salesperson for the job, you have to understand and be able to describe what the job is. That means clarifying whether this sales position is intended to immediately generate sales or perhaps develop contacts for a sales cycle that may stretch into months or years. Do you want someone who is a closer or one who takes more of a consultative approach? Matching your company's sales needs and selling style to your new hires is the first step in getting good salespeople.Few salespeople are motivated by altruism, and misunderstanding your company's compensation package is one of the main reasons for sales staff dissatisfaction and turnover. For all potential new hires, explain precisely what the compensation plan is. In addition, clarify the territory, your performance expectations, any training you will offer, and any sales tools you will provide. You should also provide candidates with a thumbnail description of the market and the competition. Then you will know that you've explained the opportunity accurately to anyone who's interested.Don't stop by describing your needs. Imagine the ideal salesperson for the job, including his or her personality, experience, energy level, reputation and abilities. You may not find someone exactly like that, but if you don't know what you want, the odds of making a bad hiring decision are high.Only now should you actually start looking for salespeople. But before dashing out a three-line ad and calling the classified department of your local newspaper, consider some other options:Look internally. You may have technical, support, operations or administrative people who would and could successfully move into sales. Post the ad on a bulletin board and see what happens.Ask for employee referrals. Chances are your existing employees know the kind of people who would be happy working for you. They may be able to suggest some people for you to contact.Network with suppliers, customers, colleagues, advisors and social contacts. This can be cheaper, faster and more reliable than advertising to the general public.Check with professional associations. They may have job lines to help members find employees.Try online advertising. The speed, freshness and searchability of online job banks make them attractive options for both candidates and employers.Check with your local college. You may be able to hire a recent graduate who's enthusiastic, effective and less expensive than a seasoned professional.Contact headhunters. Headhunters specializing in sales personnel aren't cheap, but when labor markets are tight, it may be worth the cost to find a solid salesperson.Consider using temporary and staffing services. Temporary and staffing services can provide you with sales and marketing personnel on a temporary, temp-to-perm, or permanent direct-hire basis.Types of SalespeopleManufacturer's RepsManufacturer's representative, broker and agent are terms used to describe independent sales agents who work on commission. You don't pay them a salary, just a percentage of what they sell. Manufacturer's reps offer a practical, cost-effective alternative to a direct sales force for many growing companies. There are more than a half-million reps in North America, most selling to targeted markets in select geographic regions. Reps know their markets because they call on local buyers regularly and have established working relationships.Using reps can provide you with many of the benefits of having a satellite office in the location--including knowledge of local markets and rapid access to large accounts--without your incurring large fixed costs. With reps, sales costs are always a fixed percentage of sales. The downside is that reps typically handle many different products. Some may be complementary to yours, while others may compete. A typical manufacturer's rep earns a 5 percent commission on sales, although that amount varies widely depending on the product, market and sales volume.TelemarketersTelemarketers who contact your customers by phone can provide customer service, answer questions and follow up on previous shipments as well as take orders. One of telemarketers' most useful jobs is generating qualified leads. Because you contact customers using phone numbers, it's easy to track results from a telemarketing effort. You can build your own telemarketing operation in-house or contract with a third-party call center.Of course, you need not decide to go with only one form of sales force. Many entrepreneurs effectively deploy a mix of inside and outside sales forces, sales reps and telemarketers. The challenge is managing conflicts, including turf wars and cannibalism.Sales ManagersIt's never easy to hand over responsibility for an important management job to someone else, but delegating accounts to your sales manager may be the toughest thing you will ever have to do. After all, you've won over these customers. How can you be expected to happily shift the responsibility for servicing them to somebody else? But hiring a sales manager is an important part of your business's growth. It's unreasonable to expect to be able to make a dozen sales calls a day, direct other salespeople and run the company at the same time. Once you hire a sales manager, you'll be able to greatly reduce your sales calls and eliminate managing salespeople, and devote the balance of your time to the jobs you're uniquely qualified to handle, like devising the company's strategy.A good sales manager has to be able to:Oversee salespeopleDevelop sales strategies and plansSet targets for the sales teamMonitor sales performancePersonally handle key customersPrepare sales reports and other reportsReport directly to you or a superior in marketingTypically, you'll want a sales manager with experience both selling and managing. Sales managers should be well-versed in the computer or other technical skills required to manage your department and demonstrate your products. He or she should have good leadership and communication skills and have a proven record of growing sales in past positions. If you have a specific problem you want your sales manager to address, such as difficulty reaching larger corporate customers, you will want someone with expertise in that area.In-House or Outsource?In these days of outsourcing everything, many companies continue to keep their sales forces in-house. There are plenty of opportunities for having outside salespeople hawk your product, but there are many advantages to keeping the sales function internal.Inside salespeople work for you as employees so you can expect their full attention and dedication to calling on customers, answering queries and handling problems. Because they work for your company, they should know a good deal about opportunities for cross-selling additional products and services to existing customers when they are placing orders. Since they're on staff for the long haul, you can afford to train them to be knowledgeable and courteous when dealing with customers. Inside salespeople can be shaped the way you want them--to go after large sales or focus on after-sales service--as you and your strategy dictate.Outside salespeople, such as manufacturer's reps, have one shining quality that distinguishes them from in-house people: They're cheaper. Because you don't have to pay a salary and benefits to third-party salespeople, you can afford more of them. This may allow you to reach more markets and customers than if you were relying solely on the salespeople you can afford to hire as permanent, full-time employees. The problem with outside salespeople is they may be selling similar and even competing products, so you could lose sales.Dividing Up TerritoriesA sales territory is a segment of your market that you've assigned to a salesperson or a group of salespeople. While a sales territory is usually described as a geographic area--states west of the Rockies, for instance--it should be thought of as a group of customers and should be serviced with close attention to customer type. Some territories aren't geographical areas--customers over $1 million in annual sales, for example. These ""territories"" may be assigned to product or account specialists, such as those focusing on large accounts, rather than to the people who would otherwise own them because of their geographical territories.Few things are as loaded as the assignment and division of sales territories. Salespeople tend to think all the good prospects are in others' territories, while all their best customers have been gerrymandered into someone else's territory. When dividing up territories, you want everyone to feel they got a fair shake, but at the same time, you have to be realistic. You want to match salespeople with territories based on things other than strict equity. For instance, if your salespeople vary widely in talent and energy level, you don't want to give everyone comparable sales territories. It makes sense to divide territories to make the most of everyone's abilities. If a salesperson is great at dealing with midsized accounts, save big prospects for someone who'll do well there. Therefore, the key to good sales territory design is appropriate balance.Just Sold!As your business grows, so will your need for additional sales personnel. Remember: The more salespeople you have, the more sales you will generate. So don't make the mistake of thinking you can grow your business without growing your sales force--one way or another--right along with it.Excerpted from Growing Your Business .",Sales,2005-10-14 00:00:00
/article/79940,Joining the Ranks,Returning veterans are proving to be powerful new hires.,"						This story appears in the October 2005 issue of Entrepreneur. Subscribe  When constance Cincotta needed to hire two key employees, her
search led to an unexpected place. Glenwood Mason Supply Company
Inc., the $25 million sales company Cincotta founded in New York
City in 1993, needed a worker with excellent integrity and loyalty
to check shipments leaving the company's yard and a manager who
could mold yard workers into a cohesive team.""When I started thinking about who I was looking for, all
the characteristics were [those] I associated with the
military,"" says the entrepreneur. Cincotta wound up hiring two
former Army officers, and she was so satisfied with the attitudes
and skills they brought to the job that she later hired another
former soldier to work as a maintenance mechanic for her
80-employee company.The 190,000 people who leave active service with the U.S.
military each year are becoming increasingly attractive employees
for entrepreneurs, according to William M. Houchins Jr., vice chair
of executive search firm Christian & Timbers in Columbia, Maryland.
""Even five years ago, the commonly held belief was that anyone
who spent significant time in the armed forces was too inflexible
to succeed in the private sector,"" says Houchins. ""All
this has changed. CEOs and boards now value the lessons learned
from military experience.""Drew Myers, president of RecruitMilitary LLC, a Loveland, Ohio,
company that matches employers and ex-military job candidates, says
military veterans offer good character and a strong work ethic.
""When you hire a veteran, the reference checks have already
been done before the interview, by virtue of honorable
service,"" he says.Many veterans have extensive training in areas from information
technology to leadership, all paid for by the government. About a
quarter of officers have engineering degrees, which make them
attractive to construction, manufacturing and high-tech firms,
Myers says. Many others specialize in logistics and
transportation--key areas for a variety of companies. Even soldiers
strictly trained to fight offer finely tuned abilities to lead
teams and solve challenging problems in stressful situations.Most veterans enter the civilian labor force with an appealing
combination of work experience and eagerness to prove themselves,
Myers adds. Of course, they also present challenges. For instance,
few small companies can match the benefits former soldiers were
used to as government employees. Nor is it always immediately
obvious how to translate military-skills training to profit-making
work activities.Most issues can be dealt with through careful interviewing.
Cincotta was careful to avoid those who seemed as though they'd
have trouble integrating into her firm's culture. She asked
candidates pointed questions about their ability to lead in an
environment where lines of authority are less absolute than in a
typical service hierarchy. ""I was concerned they might be too
forceful or abrupt with employees.""You can find veterans by visiting local military bases and
contacting the office in charge of helping former service members
transition to the civilian world. There are also a number of online
recruiting tools that allow employers to search veterans'
resumes and post job openings. They include RecruitMilitary, The Destiny Group and Corporate Gray.Before extending an offer, Myers suggests making it clear to
veterans how their work will fit into the company's plan for
success. And emphasize that pay will be based on performance. After
you've brought a vet onboard, explain how he or she will be
trained to handle new duties. Myers says, ""Vets respond best
if they understand the training plan, and it's realistic and
measurable.""Mark Henricks writes on business and technology for leading

/article/79620,Encouraging Employees to Speak Up,Open the lines of communication with this advice for making employees feel more comfortable speaking with you.,"Good communication is the lifeblood of every organization, no matter the size, industry or geographic location. When that communication is positive and effective, employees feel secure in their jobs and confident they know ""what's going on. Therefore, they tend to be more alert, more concerned about their job and their company, and more productive. And increased productivity leads to increased employee satisfaction. That's a win-win situation for everyone!On the other hand, when communication is ineffective, employees often feel uncared for, underappreciated, left out of the loop and disconnected from the mainstream. In these cases, morale, achievement, employee satisfaction and productivity can all tumble, while griping, lack of concern for their jobs and, at times, sabotage, can occur.So what can you do to ensure a more positive, effective flow of information between you and your employees? Many entrepreneurs believe they're open to ideas and comments from their employees. Many have a so-called ""open door"" policy that hopefully allows and encourages people to stop in and chat, share a gripe or seek information. But does it really? How can you tell?First, start by asking yourself if your employees really feel comfortable talking to you. The best way to figure this out is by looking at the number of people that stop by your office to talk. Are they from all levels of your company? With what frequency do they come to your office? Do only the high performers or the managers show up? If so, something's not working--somehow the message you're sending is saying that you welcome only certain employees.Next, even if only a favored group of people drops in to visit, look at the ratio of positive to negative comments and questions that are raised. If all or most of the discussion is positive, you must ask yourself and others if the atmosphere or corporate culture allows for disagreement or questioning. Do these people believe it's okay to raise tough questions and discuss challenging issues with you? My guess is you may find the answer is no.""Group think"": That's the formal name for the process whereby a group or team is reluctant to challenge the leader, thereby presenting the image that all is well, even if it's not. Post Watergate, many of the imprisoned burglars and planners said they knew the plan was problematic but that no one was able to give negative feedback to President Nixon. To what degree does this concept sweep though your organization? Group think is, after all, a common ego boost for the boss who's proud of his or her own leadership style. The absence of negative feedback or challenges from others can easily lead you to believe that your thoughts are supported and validated by others.As you can see, unknowingly--or even despite the best intentions--leaders can discourage open communication. So what can you do to free up communication to more of your employees and in a more realistic manner that allows both positive and negative messages to be exchanged?Your first option is to invite a random group of people from different departments and from different hierarchies into your office, a conference room or other open area. You can either create an agenda for these sessions with input from the invitees, or you could have open sessions where people discuss topics of their choosing or ask you spontaneous questions. You could also can hold theme-based sessions on topics of concern such as morale, salary, productivity, benefits, career opportunities, and so on. Whatever the topic or approach, always serve something to eat and drink to ""break bread"" with your employees and create a welcoming atmosphere.Another idea is to hold larger meetings on a monthly or quarterly basis to which you invite all employees. Questions can be verbal or written down and handed in ahead of time. (The latter is preferred when employees want anonymity.) While this larger format doesn't provide the opportunity to meet with people in an informal forum, it at least provides your employees with access to you and gives you the opportunity to present the image you want them to perceive. By taking the time to meet with your employees on a regular basis to listen to their questions and comments in a positive manner and respond with respect, you'll be demonstrating and building the very atmosphere you're hoping to create, an atmosphere that says, ""I'm interested in what you have to say"" and ""I'm the type of leader you can rely on to hear your concerns and then act on them.""Good luck!Dr. David G.

/article/79454,Building Profitability By Building Trust,Earn your employees' respect and watch your business soar,"If you want to build trust with your employees--and profits for your business--you need to make trustworthiness a priority in your company. When people trust each other, they feel more comfortable sharing their ideas and concerns, focusing on common goals and working as a team. And studies show that businesses with high trust levels are significantly more creative, productive and profitable than those in which the trust level is low. One study even found that the three-year total return to shareholders was almost three times higher at companies with high trust levels.Recent surveys also show that most employees believe trust in the workplace has gone down over the years. In one survey, more than 50 percent of those polled said they considered hypocrisy the biggest problem in corporate America today and that the upper levels of management are to blame.Researchers tell us that rebuilding trust once it's been hurt or lost is five times more difficult than establishing trust initially. To establish and protect such confidence, you must regularly practice building trust with your employees. There are three ways you can do this:1. Do what you say you'll do. Doing what you say you're going to do is the one action that contributes most to building trust, so don't make statements or commitments you can't or won't keep. For example, don't say you have an open door policy and then direct your assistant to keep people from reaching you.Treat every employee--from the most junior new hire on up--with respect and consideration. Listen to their thoughts and feelings even when you don't agree with them. Communicate openly and honestly without judging others. Make yourself vulnerable by letting employees know you need their help because you don't have all the answers.To those of us who grew up with authoritarian leaders who feared losing face, this last point may seem like a stretch. But the fact is, we gain more respect and trust from others by acknowledging our weaknesses than by brazenly trumpeting our strengths.2. Always support your troops. When employees know they can depend on management's integrity, their trust can become boundless. An excellent example of this occurs when a business owner stands behind his or her employees when they're honest about a controversial matter. And chances are, even if the business is placed in jeopardy, you'll win the undying loyalty and trust of everyone who works for you--and build a good business in the process.3. Most change requires trust. Change of any kind is somewhat unsettling, and organizational changes can cause employees to feel downright frightened. Moving from old management styles can mean creating new and different types of working relationships, even when there are no personnel changes.So make sure employees are properly briefed before any changes take place, and monitor how the changes affect relationships in the workplace.During periods of change, you can increase your employees' trust levels by taking the following actions:Understand the cultural and operational differences between various departments.Have at least one person in each department give you honest feedback on how changes are affecting work and relationships.Use language everyone understands when speaking with members of different departments at the same time.Know and explain to the various departments how each department adds value to the others and to the company.Actively help employees work effectively with other departments.Finally, before you or your managers undertake any significant changes, ask yourself how doing what you want to do will affect trust levels within your business. It can take a lot of time and effort to establish trust--but only a moment to destroy it.Paul Sarvadi is the ""Human Resources"" coach at Entrepreneur.comand is chairman of the board, CEO and co-founder of Administaff,one of the nation's leading Professional Employer Organizations (PEO), which serves as an outsourced full-service human resources department for small and medium-sized businesses throughout the United States.",Growth Strategies,2005-08-15 00:00:00

First, it sets a precedent and second, it's good for morale. Employees are often very pleased when they see that ""one of their own"" has been promoted to a management-level position. And when morale goes up, productivity most often follows, especially when the employees like or respect the newly promoted individual.Third, employees often believe that ""If it can happen to that person, it can happen to me, too!"" So other employees see an internal promotion as a tangible, credible and attainable goal for themselves. Any motivational psychologist will tell you that creating or maintaining clear and higher-level goals, and striving for increased productivity and visibility, are important sources of motivation. And again, with increased motivation you get increased productivity, and that often leads to increased employee satisfaction.Fourth, an internal candidate is most likely already familiar with the functional aspects of their new job. This person knows the corporate culture, the procedures, policies, processes, employees, and internal and external customers associated with the job. They know the ins and outs--the ""how things get done around here""--of the job. So this person can generally hit the ground running. Hiring an internal candidate clearly decreases--or erases--the usual amount of time spent advertising a position, interviewing, selecting, training and waiting for the new hire to get up to speed with the new job and its environment.A final reason to hire from within is that the current employee is already a ""known quantity"" to both managers and nonmanagers. Both groups know the employee's strengths and limitations in terms of technical skills, abilities, knowledge bases, and professional personality.When it comes to hiring a management-level position, however, there are also five good reasons why you ought to consider hiring an external candidate.First, while the internal candidate may be technically proficient or even technically superior, their managerial competencies may not exist, may not be apparent or may not have yet been proven. An external candidate will come with these qualities already intact. What happens when internal candidates get erroneously selected goes something like this: When selecting internally, you commit an error known as the ""halo effect""; that is, you see an employee doing something correct (their job) and, erroneously or without proof, assume that the employee can succeed in another task or level, in this case, a managerial position. However, the managerial position requires a different--and often more challenging--skill-set that the employee may not possess. What they possess is superior technical skills, but technical and managerial competencies are definitely quite different.The second reason for hiring an external candidate is that this person comes with proven managerial expertise, or else you wouldn't be considering them for the job. While these candidates may not be familiar with your company's culture, they are familiar with and experienced in the usual procedures, policies, processes and legwork associated with being a manager. Hiring someone who already knows the managerial ropes is a clear plus in the column of the experienced managerial candidate vs. the inexperienced one.Third, your external candidates already have management skills--that's the main reason you're considering them for the job at your company. They already know how to motivate, how to lead, what can be delegated, what tasks deserve close attention, what issues to avoid, and how best to work with the crucial people--interactions that demand so much of a manager's time.On the other hand, in woefully too many cases, an internally promoted employee doesn't receive the management training they need before starting in their new management position. So they fail to perform optimally in a position for which they weren't qualified to begin with.Another reason to consider hiring from the outside is that external candidates don't bring along any negative baggage regarding your company. Internal candidates may be affected by situations from the past in which they didn't perform well, shirked responsibilities or angered some co-workers. Now a manager, this person could conceivably have difficulty managing his former peers and justifying his past performance. An external candidate would have no such problems.Finally, external candidates usually bring new energy, ideas, enthusiasm and perspectives to the job. They most likely have experience doing things differently at other companies, so they can bring a fresh perspective to their job with your firm. Internal candidates, on the other hand, while being a ""known quantity"" to you, may not have the exposure to other organizations, products or services that your business needs to thrive and grow.So just what should you do when hiring a new manager? How do you decide just who to hire? Address the following issues to gain the clarity you need to decide what would be best for your business:First, decide what your key hiring criteria are.Next, weigh each candidate in terms of knowledge, skills, abilities, experience, ideas and energy.Third, determine just how much technical and managerial training each candidate will need.Next, consider the value-added significance each candidate brings to the table.Finally, identify how much will be gained or lost--morale, good will, newness or uniqueness, and so on--in hiring the internal vs. the external candidate.Good luck!Dr. David G.

/article/78506,Importance of a Job Description,"It's not just for screening candidates anymore. Today, business owners are finding numerous ways to put an employee's job description to work for them.","Provided byWho knew that a good job description could be such as a versatile management tool? Though it still remains a hiring tool in the most traditional sense--a written description identifying a job by title, essential functions and requirements--a well-crafted description also spells out the knowledge, abilities and skills required to perform a job successfully. These additional descriptions are extremely helpful when it comes to employee training and career development.A business owner can use a good job description not only as a valuable aid in the job-recruiting process, but also as an outline for reporting relationships and working conditions. A well-crafted job description can also be used for:Performance management. You can use it to set measurable performance goals based on duties in the job description, and then coach your employees to meet these goals as needed.Training and employee development. You can use your employee job descriptions, along with descriptions of possible job promotions, as incentives for employees to pursue classes, seminars and other career development activities.Compensation. Job descriptions can be helpful in developing a standardized compensation program with minimums and maximums for each position.Recognition and rewards. You can use the descriptions as a baseline for performance, and as a tool to encourage employee performance ""above and beyond"" the job description in order to receive recognition and rewards.Discipline. If you need to, you can use the job description to illustrate that an employee isn't adequately performing job functions.Return-to-work programs. You can prepare for light or modified duty options to allow for a smoother transition from a workers' compensation injury or leave.Essential job function analysis. Written job descriptions have become increasingly important due to the enactment, in July of 1992, of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). A well-developed job description can provide details on the ""essential functions"" of a job. This is very helpful when an employee requests a reasonable accommodation under the ADA. The job description can contain prerequisites for positions such as educational requirements, employment experience, physical requirements, supervisory responsibilities and certificates or licenses needed. Well-developed, accurate job descriptions may also prove useful in providing a defense against charges of employment discrimination beyond the recruiting process.When it comes to job description, flexibility is the key. It may be wise to create more generic job descriptions that emphasize expectations and accountabilities, rather than specific tasks, thereby encouraging employees to focus on results rather than job duties. A more wide-ranging job description is also easier to maintain--it doesn't require modification with every minor change in duties.Mary Massad is the director of HR product development for Administaff, a leading personnel management company that serves as a full-service human resources department for thousands of small and medium-sized businesses throughout the United States.

/article/78040,Follow a Leader to Become a Leader,"When it comes to managing your employees, your leadership style directly affects your success. Put your business on top by following these proven HR strategies.","One of the best ways to become a great manager is to follow the example of another great manager. Adapting a ""best practices"" approach to managing your employees may be one of the best ways to excel in your market or industry.By studying what the top 10 percent of U.S. companies have in common, researchers have identified five HR practices these companies consistently use that make them successful. And each process, system or approach is a practice your company can easily adapt.Before implementing these best practices, however, it's important to realize that for them to bear fruit, they must be rooted in a nurturing environment. This fertile soil, as we might call it, that is shared by the top companies is a ""getting better"" agenda that recognizes the value of their employees to their success equation. They realize that the key to growing a successful business is not in markets, technology or opportunity but in their ability to attract, select, develop and retain the right people--and they base their actions on that knowledge. They recognize that leadership style--the way managers motivate employees, make decisions, gather and use information, manage change initiatives and handle crises--influences a business's climate and can account for nearly one-third of their company's financial performance.If you've got the right environment, let's get started planting the right seeds.Five HR Practices Shared by the BestRecent studies indicate that the following five specific HR practices are used by the most successful companies:Selecting the best talent and putting it in the right place in a companySetting and aligning individual work goals with company objectivesBuilding trust and instilling loyaltyCoaching for resultsUsing influence, not power, to get the results you wantImplementing these practices in your company is important to your success, but understand that your leadership style also can affect your desired outcome. You may not be surprised to learn that when it comes to leadership, there's no ""one size fits all"" approach. The good news is that as a business owner, you can fine-tune your leadership skills by using whichever of the following six basic leadership styles maximizes your effectiveness at the time.The coercive style. Used by military men and mothers of rebellious two-year-olds everywhere, this style is perhaps best described as ""Do what I say, not what I do, and do it now."" In the business world, this is not a style that generally lends itself to building relationships and accomplishing long-term goals. Unfortunately, you might be surprised at how often it's used instead of more effective styles. Use it sparingly, if ever.The authoritative style. Used when you want to persuade others rather than order them, this style effectively says, ""Come with me."" It's directive and confident, as good leaders should be, but it's also considerate, as with managers who provide subordinates with explanatory insights about their instructions.The affiliative, or servant leadership style. Also known as ""People come first,"" this leadership style was best exemplified by Sam Walton, who drove the same pickup truck for 30 years and spent time with employees--from greeters to managers--when he visited his empire of Wal-Mart stores.The democratic style. This style aims to obtain consensus, or at least a strong feeling among your employees that they have a voice in decision-making. If you help an employee feel their input is as valuable to the company as their output, you'll have taken a significant step toward maximizing their productivity.The pacesetting style. With this approach, you set high performance standards for yourself and encourage your employees to do the same. Unlike the coercive style, this approach says effectively, ""Do as I do.""The coaching style. In this mode, the manager focuses on personal development rather than immediate tasks in order to develop consistently high performers.There are also times when you might want to combine several of these styles, such as pacesetting with coaching to achieve desired goals, or pacesetting with servant leadership to demonstrate the value you place on people.Observations about HR best practices gleaned from researchers appear to reach the same or very similar conclusions: that you need to focus on people and their potential rather than products and processes if you're going to create a successful company. The best good is that using the insights I've described above can produce excellent outcomes, not just uniform behaviors. And that's a great way to improve performance in any organization.Paul Sarvadi is the ""Human Resources"" coach at Entrepreneur.comand is chairman of the board, CEO and co-founder of Administaff,one of the nation's leading Professional Employer Organizations (PEO), which serves as an outsourced full-service human resources department for small and medium-sized businesses throughout the United States.",Growth Strategies,2005-06-13 00:00:00
/article/77406,Bringing In a New Manager,Follow these nine tips when introducing an outsider as a manager to make the transition smooth for everyone.,"Here's the scenario: You have an opening in your company for a new manager. Ideally, you've already interviewed internal candidates; unfortunately, for whatever reason, no one's appropriate, so you've decided to go outside your company to find the knowledge, skills and abilities you need--in other words, to find the best person for the job.This seemingly simple scenario has both positive and negative implications, many that business owners often overlook. On the positive side, the new external hire theoretically has all or most of the necessary qualifications you need. Also, and potentially more important, this person will bring a fresh, new and hopefully objective perspective to your organization. Their views will probably be free of any of the aspects of your company's culture that may have inhibited past managers. These obstacles could include: the same old way of seeing and thinking about issues; being restricted by ""the way we've always done things around here""; being impeded by employees who react in a ""groupthink"" manner, that is, not disagreeing with the prevailing view or the ""boss's"" perspective.On the negative side, you need to look at the implications for the unsuccessful internal candidates as well as other employees who've observed the process. Some employees may conclude that the boss doesn't promote from within. In that case, some employees may believe they have no future in the organization or, at best, that their chances of promotion may be limited. Previously loyal internal people will feel rejected, angry and frustrated with their potential for promotion into key positions. This is especially true if the new, external hire is not familiar with the processes, procedures, market or customers in their new job. Existing employees, especially those passed over for the job, will resent having to train their new boss or having their own productivity slowed down while the new hire gets oriented and acclimated to the new position.Given the pros and cons of hiring an external candidate, what can you do to proactively smooth this person's entry into your business and move readily into increased productivity and profitability? Here are a few steps to take that will help:1. Explain the culture of your organization to your new manager, including the stories, myths, heroes and norms; ""the way things are done around here""; and your spoken and unspoken rules, policies, procedures and attitudes. But be careful: In doing this, try not to shape this person into the mold of their predecessor--unless, of course, that's your express purpose in hiring this candidate.2. Explain the potential ""landmines"" that predecessors have experienced. This caveat is not made to necessarily encourage the new hire to avoid certain topics, procedures or issues, but rather to simply point out what may have not previously worked. An intelligent, experienced entrepreneurial individual who sees potential in something that previously failed will not simply avoid that issue; rather, the creative manager will try to figure out how to turn the unsuccessful endeavor into a successful one.3. Discuss previous successes and failures in the organization, especially in regards to individual employees. Be cautious not to prejudice your new manager against anyone, because in so doing, you may be encouraging them to avoid building and improving a potential resource. It would be fair and appropriate, however, to tell the new manager that certain individuals or units have not been as successful as possible. Most effective managers will analyze the situation and seize the opportunity to make improvements.4. Ensure that the new manager's role is extremely clear to both the manager, their peers and their direct reports.5. Ease the new manager into their full responsibilities in an appropriately timely manner. Specifically, this means slowly adding more responsibilities and authority based on visible positive outcomes. Overloading any new hire with every one of their responsibilities can be too challenging, especially in complex situations.6. Introduce the new manager to peers, staff and direct reports. Lend the manager the power and status of your office by officially passing the ""mantle of power"" to them there. Explain the credentials and successes this person brings to your company to help people understand why you hired this person.7. Encourage others to welcome the new hire and make sure they understand that the new manager has your complete confidence and support. This process truly helps the new hire successfully obtain crucial support and credibility from colleagues and direct reports.8. Serve as a mentor to your new employee. Act as a sounding board, especially during the first six months, to help ensure an easy and positive transition into your company.9. Remember that you're the one who hired this new manager, and their success is your success. Do what you can to make it work!Dr. David G. JavitchDr. David G.

/article/77332,Size-mology,Corporate refugees can be a boon to a small business--as long as you both know what to expect before jumping in.,"						This story appears in the May 2005 issue of Entrepreneur. Subscribe  Next time you're looking for workers, your friendly
neighborhood Fortune 500 company may be the place to start. Due to
a wave of downsizing, layoffs and early-retirement programs that
have swept through the corporate world, lots of people who have
experience working for big companies are ready to try working for
small ones.The Bureau of Labor Statistics counted 16,334 mass layoffs
involving 50 or more people during the year that ended last
October. The events left over 1.6 million people out of corporate
jobs and countless others wondering whether to leave before the
next round of layoffs began.Often, former big-company workers check out smaller employers in
hopes of finding the loyalty that seems to have evaporated from big
business, says Mel Zwirn, president of Select
Staffing in Schaumburg, Illinois. ""It comes up
often,"" says Zwirn. ""Especially when the big growth in
the American economy has been the small company."" It's
then that entrepreneurs have to decide whether and how to bring
someone from a big firm into their smaller enterprise. And, adds
Zwirn, ""It's a very tricky hire.""The good news about job candidates who have experience working
with big companies is that they have significant advantages over
workers with other backgrounds. Training is one biggie. Sales
courses, budgeting classes, management seminars and other learning
experiences are standard offerings at many big companies.Few smaller firms can match that work-related training, notes
Robert W. Wendover, author of Smart Hiring: The Complete Guide to Finding and
Hiring the Best Employees, 3rd Edition. But they can get it
for free by hiring ex-corporate refugees.Big-company employees may also have hard-to-match experience in
international business, government regulation, technology
management and other valuable fields. But these refugees from big
businesses also come with some weaknesses. One weakness is often an
expectation that they'll earn more money than you can pay.
""Even if the people are willing to take less money, sometimes
they don't have a great attitude about it,"" says
Zwirn.Corporate employees are also more likely to be
specialists--unable or unwilling to perform the kind of
multitasking that is second nature to every small-business
employee. Zwirn recalls a complaint from one ex-IBM manager who was
having trouble with his new job at a smaller company. ""He
didn't like it because people in his last job brought him
reports,"" Zwirn says. ""[Now], he had to go get the
reports.""If you want to get the benefits of hiring people from big
companies while minimizing the negatives, start by making it clear
what the job entails. Corporate refugees desperate for security may
agree to pay scales, benefits packages and resource restrictions
that, in the long run, leave them dissatisfied and performing at
less than their peak.Be equally clear about what the candidate is offering. Don't
be dazzled by resumes stuffed with impressive-sounding job titles
at well-known corporations. Look for identifiable skills that fit
your needs. ""If they're so darn good, why are they
suddenly willing to work for half what they were getting?""
says Wendover. ""You have to be skeptical.""If you still aren't clear about the chances for a
big-company refugee making it at your company, consider taking the
employee on as a temporary worker and transitioning him or her to a
permanent employee after a time. If you really want the advantages
that corporate experience can bring to your work force, you can
probably find a way, Zwirn says. ""After all is said and done,
people are hiring from big companies and [new hires] are making the
successful transition.""Mark Henricks writes on business and technology for leading

/article/77678,The Importance of Employee Development,Learn why creating formal employee training and development strategies is essential for the continued success of your business.,"Many entrepreneurs seem to view employee training and development as more optional than essential...a viewpoint that can be costly to both short-term profits and long-term progress.  The primary reason training is considered optional by so many business owners is because it's viewed more as an expense than an investment. This is completely understandable when you realize that in many companies, training and development aren't focused on producing a targeted result for the business. As a result, business owners frequently send their people to training courses that seem right and sound good without knowing what to expect in return. But without measurable results, it's almost impossible to view training as anything more than an expense.  Now contrast that approach to one where training's viewed as a capital investment with thoughtful consideration as to how you're going to obtain an acceptable rate of return on your investment. And a good place to start your ""thoughtful consideration"" is with a needs analysis.  As it relates to training and development, a needs analysis is really an outcome analysis--what do you want out of this training? Ask yourself, ""What's going to change in my business or in the behavior or performance of my employees as a result of this training that's going to help my company?"" Be forewarned: This exercise requires you to take time to think it through and focus more on your processes than your products.  As you go through this analysis, consider the strengths and weaknesses in your company and try to identify the deficiencies that, when corrected, represent a potential for upside gain in your business. A common area for improvement in many companies is helping supervisors better manage for performance. Many people are promoted into managerial positions because they're technically good at their jobs, but they aren't trained as managers to help their subordinates achieve peak performance.  Determining your training and development needs based on targeted results is only the beginning. The next step is to establish a learning dynamic for your company.  In today's economy, if your business isn't learning, then you're going to fall behind. And a business learns as its people learn. Your employees are the ones that produce, refine, protect, deliver and manage your products or services every day, year in, year out. With the rapid pace and international reach of the 21st century marketplace, continual learning is critical to your business's continued success.  To create a learning culture in your business, begin by clearly communicating your expectation that employees should take the steps necessary to hone their skills to stay on top of their professions or fields of work. Make sure you support their efforts in this area by supplying the resources they need to accomplish this goal. Second, communicate to your employees the specific training needs and targeted results you've established as a result of your needs analysis.  Third, provide a sound introduction and orientation to your company's culture, including your learning culture, to any new employees you hire. This orientation should introduce employees to your company, and provide them with proper training in the successful procedures your company's developed and learned over time.  Every successful training and development program also includes a component that addresses your current and future leadership needs. At its core, this component must provide for the systematic identification and development of your managers in terms of the leadership style that drives your business and makes it unique and profitable. Have you spent time thoughtfully examining the style of leadership that's most successful in your environment and that you want to promote? What steps are you taking to develop those important leadership traits in your people?  Financial considerations related to training can be perplexing, but in most cases, the true budgetary impact depends on how well you manage the first three components (needs analysis, learning and leadership). If your training is targeted to specific business results, then you're more likely to be happy with what you spend on training. But if the training budget isn't related to specific outcomes, then money is more likely to be spent on courses that have no positive impact on the company.  In many organizations, training budgets are solely a function of whether the company is enjoying an economic upswing or enduring a downturn. In good times, companies tend to spend money on training that's not significant to the organization, and in bad times, the pendulum swings to the other extreme and training is eliminated altogether. In any economic environment, the training expense should be determined by the targeted business results you want, not other budget-related factors.  To help counter this tendency, sit down and assess your training and development needs once or twice a year to identify your needs and brainstorm how to achieve your desired results effectively and efficiently.  Your employees are your principle business asset. Invest in them thoughtfully and strategically, and you'll reap rewards that pay off now and for years to come.

/article/76982,The Importance of an HR Policies & Practices Strategy,Learn the keys to establishing procedures and guidelines necessary for your employees--and business--to thrive.,"""Why,"" you may ask, ""do I need a policies and practices strategy for my business?""  The simple answer is...because you have people working for you.  With human nature being what it is, employees will test limits and act ""creatively"" in workplace situations, so you need a strategy for developing, communicating and enforcing a set of policies and practices that reflect your standards of acceptable behavior.  But a successful policies and practices strategy does more than draw boundaries; it also recognizes and addresses people's needs.  There are many different types of people, and not surprisingly, they react differently to the need for policies and practices based on those differences. For example, some people prefer there be a written policy for everything, while others favor having no policies at all and would leave everything open to interpretation as situations arise. Neither of these extremes contributes to a work environment that's conducive to high productivity levels. The answer is found in between, with the right number and types of policies and practices that are focused on a primary goal--improving individual performance in the workplace.  When you get to the heart of the matter, performance improvement is really about the process of setting expectations and meeting them. The focus in business is not just about meeting specific goals, but also about how you achieve them. And the ""how"" affects the liabilities you create in the process.  So how can you make sure your employees have clear expectations and are treated fairly as they work to help build your company? The answer is found in the way you address four key elements related to the development and deployment of your policies and practices: roles, rules, consequences and tools.  Roles  People like to have a clear understanding of their role in a company as well as the roles of others. Every successful team has well-defined positions for its members: Everyone knows what he or she is to do, how to do it and how their performance can impact those around them. In business, this means you need to have clear reporting structures that spell out who's in charge and how tasks are to be accomplished in the organization. This approach applies not only to intradepartmental structures, but also to company-wide or interdepartmental projects. In addition, role definition is a foundational part of establishing clear performance expectations for each employee.  Rules  Managers and employees need to share a clear understanding of what is and what is not acceptable behavior within the company. Unfortunately, in today's workplace, an employer can be held liable for the bad behavior of an employee, especially when that bad behavior affects other employees, clients or individuals. Having a clear set of behavioral expectations is critical to establishing that you're not contributing to that bad behavior as an employer. Setting clear and specific behavioral standards in the form of rules establishes a framework for spotting and addressing violations of those standards. If you rely on loosely defined general standards that aren't properly documented, then violations become subjective and open to interpretation. The result of such ambiguousness is often litigation.  Consequences  It's important that you clearly state consequences for violations of your behavioral standards so that employees know what to expect and have fair warning of those expectations. In addition, clear consequences help to ensure that you aren't limited in your options for dealing with improper behaviors. To establish these standards and violation consequences, sit down and think through the over-the-line behaviors that won't be permitted in your company. It's essential that you know ahead of time what employee actions require an immediate dismissal. Similarly, you want to know what performance issues may qualify for a more progressive disciplinary approach, and then define the steps involved in that approach.  By nature, people are complex beings who will confound you one minute and astound you the next. And except for violations that warrant immediate firings, it's usually a wise, compassionate and financially prudent course to help people strengthen their character by overcoming their weaknesses. Also, this approach provides you with a way to retain experienced employees and recover your investment in their training.  I've found that managers are often disappointed in an employee's performance even though the manager never clearly communicated his or her expectations to that employee. If you don't take steps to set clear expectations, the consequences you administer for failure to meet those expectations can seem unfair. This is extremely important because an employee who feels they've been treated unfairly can create a great deal of liability. In many cases, the key issue is not whether they were actually treated unfairly but whether the employee feels or perceives that they were treated unfairly.  And it doesn't stop with the affected employee. If you or your managers haven't clearly communicated your expectations to one employee, chances are you haven't done so with other employees as well and they can be quick to empathize with any affected workers. It's natural for employees to wonder, ""What if that happened to me?"" To avoid the negative effect such a chain-reaction can have on your workplace, be clear about your expectations with all employees at all times. Most employees will appreciate and respect your forthright clarity.  Building a great company has a lot to do with how people work together. Policies and practices can improve the way your employees interact, while minimizing the personnel obstacles that often arise in today's workplaces.  Tools  Tools address the question of how you support the people in your company who manage other employees. When faced with a specific personnel issue, what resources are available to them? Do they have an employee handbook or a policy guide? What about regular training in company policies and practices, coupled with simple, easy-to-use forms to guide them when dealing with particular issues? Are you giving them a clear directive on working with your human resources personnel or legal representatives? Are your resources available online? Tools like these are vital not just to help avoid litigation, but also to minimize the time it takes for you to deal with productivity-draining people issues instead of core business matters. Because many small-business owners lack these resources and aren't sure where to turn for help, they may use attorneys and HR consultants on an a la carte basis to address such issues. Other businesses call on professional employer organizations like Administaff to provide the support of a full-service human resources department.  Whatever your approach, the key to success is to devote the time and resources it takes to develop a policies and practices strategy for your business before the need arises. It's an investment that can pay large dividends in increased productivity and minimized litigation. And it's an essential component of your comprehensive people strategy.

/article/76422,Teaching Good Customer Service,Follow these tips to ensure that all your employees understand the value of good customer service.,"Is customer service important? Is customer service every employee's responsibility?The clear answer to both of these questions is a resounding yes! And more important, the major responsibility for creating a customer friendly atmosphere begins with you, the boss. Not only are you responsible for teaching first-rate customer service skills, but as their leader, you must demonstrate these behaviors and be a role model for your employees. Without positive examples from you, they're not likely to improve.But just why is customer service so crucially important to the success of your company?Whether or not your employees work specifically as customer service people, as the head of your organization, you must instill in all your employees one key strategic thought and direction: If you're going to create a positive and productive business environment, everyone must speak and relate to customers and potential customers as if each person were their paycheck. Because, in fact, they are.Tell your employees to seriously consider this startling truth: If customers don't keep coming back and purchasing your company's products or services, there will be no company. And obviously, if there's no company--or if you're forced to downsize--many of the people working for you now may lose their jobs.I bet you'll have your employee's complete attention.So just what is optimal customer service? Simply stated, it's a positive way of relating to people that lets them know you care about them, their actions, their purchases and the buying process, no matter how expensive, intricate or involved it is. Your main goal is to have each customer leave with a smile on their face and a feeling of having been well taken care of by you and your employees--and for having purchased just what they needed or wanted.But why is optimal customer service so crucial? Won't customers keep coming back if your price is right? Not necessarily. If you want your customers to come back again and again, you've got to satisfy them by making it easy for them to do business with you, which will get them to return for more. Understand that if they aren't treated properly, they won't become those coveted return customers.Here are four powerful points you need to model and impart to your employees in order for them to provide top-notch service to the purchasing public.Optimal customer service means:Your employees can keep their job. Remember, no customers equals no business and no employees.You've created a positive buying atmosphere for both first-time and repeat customers.You're able to satisfy the information or buying needs of your potential customers.You're able to transform prospects into happy, satisfied customers. And happy, satisfied customers come back for more.Your next step is to teach and motivate your employees to demonstrate the following successful customer service behaviors:Stop talking with colleagues and get off the phone whenever a potential customer approaches.Look up and at the person, smile and welcome your potential paycheck.Ask how you can help or assist your potential customer.Provide information in a pleasant manner, always remembering to smile.Ask, in a friendly way, if you've been of assistance to the customer. If the answer is no, continue to serve your customer until you've satisfied their needs.Ask if there's anything else you can do to help them make the right decision.Smile and say goodbye, encouraging the customer to return with other questions.Mean what you say and mean what you do.And don't forget that the most important features of an interaction that potential buyers will remember are how helpful the employee was and how delighted or satisfied the customers are with the product and the process of purchasing.Undoubtedly, these satisfied customers will return over and over. And this result is due to the attitude, politeness and willingness to assist that your employees express.Bingo, they just earned their paychecks!Dr. David G. JavitchDr. David G.

/article/76182,Recruiting and Hiring Top-Quality Employees,Follow these tips to ensure you'll bring the right people into your company.,"As all employers quickly learn, there's a world of difference between a worker who's correctly matched to their job and their organization, and one who is not.But how do you find and match the right people to the right jobs? By including, in your comprehensive people strategy, a well-structured recruiting and selection program. The key to successfully developing such a program is to follow a proven recruiting process for the positions you need to fill. Resist the temptation to omit steps, because shortcutting the process can shortchange your results. Here's what you'll need to do:1. Develop accurate job descriptions. Your first step is to make sure you have an effective job description for each position in your company. Your job descriptions should reflect careful thought as to the roles the individual will fill, the skill sets they'll need, the personality attributes that are important to completing their tasks, and any relevant experience that would differentiate one applicant from another. This may sound fairly basic, but you'd be surprised at how many small companies fail to develop or maintain updated job descriptions.2. Compile a ""success profile."" In addition to creating job descriptions, it's important to develop a ""success profile"" of the ideal employee for key positions in your company that are critical to the execution of your business plan. These might include such positions as team leaders, district managers and salespeople. For example, let's say you currently have 20 salespeople. Within that group, you have four that are top performers, 12 that are middle-of-the-road and four that aren't quite making the grade. If you could bump the number of folks in the top group from 20 percent to 33 percent, that could have a dramatic impact on your company's performance.To accomplish that goal, you need to profile everyone in the sales group to identify any skills and attributes that are common to the top group but missing from the other groups. Using this information, you'll be able to develop a profile to help you select the candidates most likely to succeed in that position. Remember, you can't tell if you've found a match if you're not matching candidates against a specific profile.3. Draft the ad, describing the position and the key qualifications required. Although some applicants will ignore these requirements and respond regardless, including this information will help you limit the number of unqualified applicants.4. Post the ad in the mediums most likely to reach your potential job candidates. Of course, the Internet has become the leading venue for posting job openings, but don't overlook targeted industry publications and local newspapers.5. Develop a series of phone-screening questions. Compile a list of suitable questions you can ask over the phone to help you quickly identify qualified candidates and eliminate everyone else.6. Review the resumes you receive and identify your best candidates. Once you post your ad, you'll start receiving resumes...sometimes many more than you anticipated. Knowing what you're looking for in terms of experience, education and skills will help you weed through these resumes quickly and identify potential candidates.7. Screen candidates by phone. Once you've narrowed your stack of resumes to a handful of potential applicants, call the candidates and use your phone-screening questions to further narrow the field. Using a consistent set of questions in both this step and your face-to-face interviews will help ensure you're evaluating candidates equally.8. Select candidates for assessment. Based on the responses to your phone interviews, select the candidates you feel are best qualified for the next step in the process.9. Assess your potential candidates for their skills and attributes using a proven assessment tool. A resume and phone interview can only tell you so much about a job applicant, so you'll need a dependable assessment tool to help you analyze the core behavioral traits and cognitive reasoning speed of your applicants. For example, a good test will provide insights as to whether the individual is conscientious or lackadaisical, introverted or extroverted, agreeable or uncompromising, open to new ideas or close-minded, and emotionally stable or anxious and insecure.The success profile you created for each position will help you determine which behavioral traits are important for that position. For example, you would expect a successful salesperson to be extroverted. On the other hand, someone filling a clerical position might be more introverted.These assessment tests can be administered in person or online. Online testing and submission of results can help you determine whether the applicant should be invited for a personal interview.10. Schedule and conduct candidate interviews. Once you've selected candidates based on the previous steps, schedule and conduct the interviews. Use a consistent set of 10 or 12 questions to maintain a structured interview and offer a sound basis for comparing applicants.11. Select the candidate. Make your selection by matching the best applicant to the profiled job description.12. Run a background check on the individual to uncover any potential problems not revealed by previous testing and interviews.13. Make your offer to the candidate. The information you collected during the interview process will provide you with important insights as to starting compensation levels and training needs.
	Additional Pre-Recruiting TipsBefore you start the hiring process, determine your strategy relative to how people fit into your organization. What is your process for making sure they're a good fit with your company's culture? Decide whether your approach to the cultural question should include a second interview. Also, who else, if anyone, do you involve in the interviews to help make this selection and judge the candidate? Your goal is to have a plan that will help you determine whether you have a qualified applicant who will fit into your company's culture.
 In addition, decide whether you're going to conduct pre-employment testing. How much is it worth for you to know an individual's strengths and weaknesses, not just as a hire/don't hire test, but as a coaching tool to help you determine their training needs and the best approach to maximize the person's productivity? Pre-employment testing is often overlooked, when it could be a very valuable tool. For example, if you find an applicant who fits the job description and appears to be the person you want to hire, pre-employment testing can help you determine how to work with them more effectively and move them along in your organization.If you want your business to attract and retain good clients, your comprehensive people strategy must include a recruiting and selection strategy that attracts and retains quality employees. Following a well-thought-out, structured process will help you best match the right people to the right jobs in your company.",Growth Strategies,2005-02-14 00:00:00
/article/75340,The Best Ways to Reward Employees,Having an effective reward program in place can help solve many of your HR issues.,"Every company needs a strategic reward system for employees that addresses these four areas: compensation, benefits, recognition and appreciation. The problem with reward systems in many businesses today is twofold: They're missing one or more of these elements (usually recognition and/or appreciation), and the elements that are addressed aren't properly aligned with the company's other corporate strategies.A winning system should recognize and reward two types of employee activity-performance and behavior. Performance is the easiest to address because of the direct link between the initial goals you set for your employees and the final outcomes that result. For example, you could implement an incentive plan or recognize your top salespeople for attaining periodic goals.Rewarding specific behaviors that made a difference to your company is more challenging than rewarding performance, but you can overcome that obstacle by asking, ""What am I compensating my employees for?"" and ""What are the behaviors I want to reward?"" For example, are you compensating employees for coming in as early as possible and staying late, or for coming up with new ideas on how to complete their work more efficiently and effectively? In other words, are you compensating someone for innovation or for the amount of time they're sitting at a desk? There's obviously a big difference between the two.The first step, of course, is to identify the behaviors that are important to your company. Those activities might include enhancing customer relationships, fine-tuning critical processes or helping employees expand their managerial skills.When business owners think of reward systems, they typically put compensation at the top of the list. There's nothing wrong with that, since few people are willing or able to work for free. But the right strategy should also include an incentive compensation plan that's directly linked to the goals of your company for that period. You might want to include some type of longer-term rewards for key individuals in your organization. Historically, this has often included some form of equity ownership.Benefits are another type of reward in a strategic reward system, and your employees are definitely going to notice the types of benefits you provide. Companies that don't match or exceed the benefit levels of their competitors will have difficulty attracting and retaining top workers. This is one reason an increasing number of businesses are turning to professional employer organizations like Administaff to gain access to a broader array of company benefits.However, you can't diminish the importance of recognition and appreciation as integral components of a winning strategic reward system. These two elements rarely receive the attention they deserve from business owners, which is amazing because they're the low-cost/high-return ingredients. Employees like to know whether they're doing good, bad or average, so it's important that you tell them.Recognition means acknowledging someone before their peers for specific accomplishments achieved, actions taken or attitudes exemplified through their behavior. Appreciation, meanwhile, centers on expressing gratitude to someone for his or her actions. Showing appreciation to your employees by acknowledging excellent performance and the kind of behavior you want to encourage is best done through simple expressions and statements. For example, you might send a personal note or stop by the employee's desk to convey your appreciation. Another approach is to combine recognition and appreciation in the form of a public statement of thanks in front of the employee's co-workers or team, citing specific examples of what they've done that has positively impacted the organization.Now that you know what it should include, it's time to review your strategic reward system. Does it address compensation, benefits, recognition and appreciation? Is it aligned with your remaining business strategies? Is it driving the right behaviors for your company, as well as your performance goals? If it needs fixing, don't wait. It can mean the difference between your business' success and failure.",Growth Strategies,2005-01-10 00:00:00
/article/75242,Hiring Employees for Your Homebased Biz,"Before you place a classified ad for your first employee, take these 10 points under consideration to find out if you're really ready to add to your homebased staff.","I'll never forget the day I visited ABC Co. for a first interview with the owner. The person who arranged my interview hadn't told me the business was run out of a home office. So I walked up to the front door of a big brick house in a residential neighborhood, wondering whether I'd written down the street number incorrectly. I soon found myself being led down a hallway, past the piano room and up a flight of stairs to the third-floor office space.For the first few minutes of my interview (those critical moments when impressions are set and judgments are made), I was in a haze. I was thinking, What does this company do again? Am I seriously considering working out of someone's house? I'm sure I projected an air of total confidence. Right...What I'm sure I was actually projecting was confusion and hesitation. The home office setting had caught me completely unprepared. . . which leads to my list of the ""10 Cardinal Rules for Homebased Business Owners."" If you operate out of a home office and are thinking about hiring an employee, this list will help you set the stage for success.Rule 1. Provide full disclosure. Prior to an interview, you should let each candidate know about your home office base. In my case, one of the things I couldn't help but wonder was whether the company was trying to hide something from me. That's not the greatest foot to put forward to potential hires.Rule 2. Ask potential candidates how they feel about working in a home office. This should be one of the first questions you ask--and you'll want to listen carefully to the answers you get. If you're not satisfied with their answers, follow up with some behavioral questions to find out what they're really thinking. You should give the candidate time to voice any misgivings they may have. If you've followed Rule 1, this question won't come as a surprise to your candidates and you'll be more likely to receive an honest answer.Rule 3. Before the employee starts work, set up an appropriate workspace for them. You need to find a way to balance the limited space in your home with your employee's need for privacy. Let's face it, nobody wants to be in a situation where the boss can hear every single word they say on the phone. It just breeds discontent and puts more pressure on your employee. Over time, that pressure will build up and create a situation that isn't likely to end well.Rule 4. Establish a separate space for meetings. At the very least, you should invest in a table you can sit around to hold meetings. In theory, using your desk as a place to sit around during a meeting is a decent idea. In practice, however, it will be difficult to set a professional tone for the meeting if you and your employee are crowded around your desk, trying to work in the midst of all your paperwork.Rule 5. Take bathroom facilities into account. If you don't have a bathroom dedicated primarily to the office space and your employees, you might want to reconsider your plans to hire someone else. Enough said.Rule 6. Have an appropriate exit/entrance to your home office. The path to your home office should ideally not interfere with what goes on in the rest of the house. This rule isn't as critical as the restroom issue, but it helps lend a feeling of professionalism to the entire endeavor if you have an entrance that's as direct as possible.Rule 7. Make the office off limits to your family. You need to make sure your family understands that your office space-and in particular, the desk and computer of your employee-is a no-go zone. Sure, the office is in your house, but if you want your employee to feel comfortable, this is a line that must not be crossed.Rule 8. Provide generous vacation time. It's my belief, after working in a home office, that the rule here should be more vacation rather than less. A home office is an intense work environment, and your employees are much more apt to burn out here than in a standard work environment. An extra week of vacation-and three should be the minimum-is a great way to minimize burn out.Rule 9. Be flexible. Be open to your employee's ideas and needs. Suggest flex-time or working remotely-your employees will thank you for it.Rule 10. Try and laugh a little. The close quarters of a home office can be stifling, and there are no other employees around that your worker can vent to. So figure out how to keep the mood light and learn to laugh about life's daily little annoyances.Tom Candee has spent the past two years working out of a home office as a marketing guru for an internet store in Cambridge, Massachusetts.",Starting a Business,2004-12-27 00:00:00
/article/75036,How to Become a Destination Workplace,People will want to work for you when you create the right corporate culture.," Every business should strive to create a positive corporate culture. But developing a culture that attracts, retains and motivates quality employees doesn't just happen by accident-it requires a plan. You can start by asking yourself what kind of workplace you want. To help you define your desired workplace and shape your corporate culture, focus on these four points:  1. Mission: Your mission answers the question, ""What are we here for?"" Your response should include your primary product or service, your target market and key elements of your service model (such as the importance of creativity, technology, a team approach and so on). Every business should have an up-to-date, well-structured mission statement that's understood and embraced by its employees. I also recommend that you communicate your mission statement in appropriate ways to your clients, customers, prospects, potential employees and other interested parties. Doing so sends an important ""who, what, when, where and how"" message about your enterprise to those most important to your business, beginning with your employees.  2. Values: Values convey what's really important to you. We heard a lot about values during the last election, and it should come as no surprise that values are important to people in all areas of life, including business. Three commonly shared values that resonate with most people are: honesty, integrity and treating others with respect. Take some time to identify and define the values that are important to you and your company. They are key statements in their own right and are essential in formulating your beliefs and standards.  3. Beliefs: Beliefs are a natural extension of our values and help answer the question, ""How do we make decisions?"" For example, one of our foundational beliefs at Administaff, the Houston-based professional employer organization where I am chairman and CEO, is that our greatest asset is our people. This belief has its roots in our value of respect for the worth of each person. In fact, we believe that a company is its people. This principle guides our recruiting strategy and helps us attract and retain quality workers that are hired for their input more than their output.  Another foundational belief is that of maintaining a proper work-life balance. We don't live to work, but rather work to live. While there will be occasions when we all have to put in some extra hours, those instances really should be occasional and not typical. Accordingly, we make decisions to provide employees with the tools, training and support they need to accomplish their tasks in a normal workday. These beliefs are even factored into our decisions about organizational structure, so that our growth doesn't overburden our employees and disrupt their work-life balance. We've also learned that becoming a better person at work can help you become a better person at home.  4. Standards: Standards provide clear statements about how people are expected to behave, interact, resolve conflicts and relate to each other. Standards are essential to any successful undertaking, whether you're an organization of one or 1,000. If you don't follow commonly accepted guidelines of respectful behavior and productivity, you'll never get anything done and you'll alienate most of your support team in the process. We all do better when we know what is expected of us and how we are to manage interpersonal relations. Conflicts and disagreements are inevitable, but they can be either constructive or destructive, depending on how they're handled. A company handbook like we provide our clients is an essential tool for capturing and conveying company standards. Couple the handbook with periodic training to remind and reinforce your corporate standards and exhibit top-down exemplary behavior (practice what you preach), and you'll find that your employees will adhere to those standards in their daily work with very positive results.  Developing the corporate culture of a destination workplace happens by design, not default. Too many companies fail to give human resource management the time and attention it deserves. Also, a positive corporate culture is the foundational component of a comprehensive people strategy that will enable you to leverage your human capital into a competitive advantage. Just as you need solid strategies for sales, finance and operations, you need a human resources strategy. Use the elements outlined above to structure your corporate culture strategy, and you will have taken a significant first step toward developing a winning people strategy.

/article/73396,"Creating a ""People Strategy"" for Your Business",Hiring the right people and managing them well is essential to your business' success. Here are 6 tips for developing an effective HR strategy.,"Many entrepreneurs will admit they're great at producing their product or providing a service, but they aren't natural-born managers. There's no shame in that-entrepreneurs are a breed of their own. But without an effective people strategy in place, you run the risk of joining others who had a great idea but-like a bad golf swing-had no follow-through.Why is it important to invest in your human capital? A comprehensive approach to managing and growing the strengths of your employees has a significant and lasting payoff. Studies show there's a direct link between an effective people strategy and a company's competitive advantage.Simply put, the better a business manages its human capital, the better its profitability and shareholder return will be. According to Watson Wyatt Worldwide's latest Human Capital Index study, a successful people strategy is not merely linked to market value; it's a leading indicator of increased shareholder value. The study showed that high-performance human resources (HR) practices are key to attracting and keeping the best employees and to improving a company's productivity and profitability.So, how can you meet this challenge?In short, by taking the same kind of systematic and strategic approach to human resource issues that you've used to successfully build your core business. Once you've decided that a comprehensive people strategy is a necessity for your company, you're ready to take the first step to building it. And here are some key ingredients:Develop a strong corporate culture.
Every organization has its own distinct culture, whether it's worked consciously or not to develop it. A positive, innovative corporate culture can contribute to the growth and success of the business and position the company as a ""destination employer.""Institute a strategic reward system.
Rewarding your employees for a job well done directly affects their performance-and your company's bottom line. Employees receive a certain amount of satisfaction from achieving goals and improving the company, but it's even more meaningful when that success is recognized. It's important to decide beforehand what kind of behavior and performance to single out, how it should be rewarded and how to communicate that reward.Hire the right people.
Creating a positive corporate culture begins with hiring the best people for the right jobs, and that means you need a strategic recruiting program.Stay armed for the ""war for talent.""
A recent survey by the Society of Human Resources Management showed that most employees would actively look for a new job once the economy starts to improve. That kind of attitude drives home the importance of a strong employee retention strategy. Given the high cost of employee turnover, the value of spending time, effort and money on keeping valuable employees becomes clear. Companies with a strategic retention plan in place are well armed to combat turnover.Develop sound policies and practices.
Having a comprehensive set of written policies and procedures in place based on sensible HR and legal principles is critical to helping employees understand and meet expectations. It's also important because government regulation of the employer-employee relationship has made personnel administration increasingly complex.Have a strategy in place for training and development.
Talented employees want more than a paycheck-they want the assurance that they can grow in their jobs and advance in the company. A thorough, results-driven training and development strategy helps business owners identify leaders, equip them to do their jobs and increase the performance of the company.Think of it this way: Human capital is a resource that can walk out the door anytime. Your employees are central to the success of your business. They are the ones who help create and improve your products and services. They deliver your products and interact with your customers. They work to protect your ideas and assets. Without their productive contributions, it's likely your business would fail.",Growth Strategies,2004-11-01 00:00:00
/article/73386,Becoming a Preferred Employer,"To attract high-caliber employees who are loyal to your business, follow this advice from a human resources expert.","Achieving business success is a goal that goes well beyond analyzing spreadsheets to an entrepreneur's ability to appreciate the crucial role employees play in that quest. The best business idea in the world is worthless without the right people to help us create, improve, protect and deliver the services and products we depend on for our livelihoods. And to attract and retain high caliber staff, you need to be viewed as a preferred employer.  So what distinguishes a company as a preferred employer, and how does an organization earn that label?  One definition is that preferred employers are companies where people are so engaged in their jobs that they're not interested in pursuing other opportunities. Being such a destination workplace changes the success equation for small businesses because a company is better able to uncover and capitalize on more opportunities when it's strategic and systematic in the role its employees play in the business.  Becoming a preferred employer involves more than learning the characteristics of such an organization, however-it also requires that you understand what top performers want and value in a relationship with an employer. Interestingly, the answers to both questions are the same.  To begin with, top-tier employers offer more than competitive pay and benefits. In fact, the word ""competitive"" implies that you're simply matching what many other businesses are providing. Even important additional elements, such as a good environment and open communication, won't necessarily make the difference.  Studies show that the most important factor is how people feel about their role in the business. Employees perform at different levels based on how they're engaged in the lifeblood activities of the company. When an employer brings in people who are talented, aligned with the company's values and focused on its goals, the results can be tremendous.  Want to set your company apart from your competitors? Here are some steps that can help you draw the best people to your business:  Make sure your employees know they're important. Your staff needs to know they play a vital role in your company's success. Remind them that your business couldn't achieve its goals without them doing what they do every day.  Encourage loyalty through appreciation. That feeling comes when an employer shows gratitude. Giving credit for extra effort sounds like a little thing, but demonstrating appreciation for discretionary effort motivates people to continue performing at high levels.  Provide your staff with the support and resources they need to achieve their goals. Ask your employees, ""Do you have what you need to get the job done? What else can we do to make your job better?"" A business owner's role is to provide support by bringing people together and supplying them with the tools and resources to get their jobs done well.  Make people feel rewarded in a way that goes beyond compensation and benefits. Top performers look forward to being given challenging, significant assignments. It's essential if you're going to keep them motivated and on board.  Understand the crucial importance of giving credit and accepting blame. If a company achieves its objectives, it's because its employees performed well. If the goal is missed, it's often because the leader didn't align employees with the objectives, didn't equip them properly, or didn't provide the resources necessary for them to get the job done.  Help your employees achieve a sense of accomplishment. Communicate the importance of what your workers have achieved so they know they're making a difference. Unlike a large corporation where people often can't see the direct results of their daily efforts, you can more easily let people know what their efforts mean to the success of your company.  The past few years have been a challenging time-the bursting of the dot-com/technology bubble, the tragic events of September 11, the war against terrorism, and the effort to work through the economic downturn.  But these hurdles have served to highlight the crucial leadership role business owners play in our communities and in our national economy. We've seen business leaders dust themselves off, rally their people to pick up the pieces, and get going again. That's true leadership. And you can become a true leader, too. You can create a company that's the best in your field-an organization to which top performers gravitate. You can become a preferred employer in the 21st century.

/article/72382,The Right Time for a Raise,Take these factors into consideration the next time your employees ask for more compensation.,"When I ask people at all levels in organizations what would make them happier on the job, the majority say they want more money. Nonetheless, entrepreneurs shouldn't be too quick to give employees the requested raises.Almost everyone needs more and more income to deal with the realities of today's economy. But before you rush to your checkbook to increase an employee's income, consider these factors:1. Why does this employee want or deserve a raise? Aside from the fact that most people want to increase current spending or savings levels, you shouldn't increase a salary based solely on the need or desire. Of course, if great need is the case (and if you can afford to increase the salary), then, of course, allow your humanism to shine through. Otherwise, ask your employee to present significant information and examples to convince you of his value to the company and therefore substantiate the reasons for the raise.Make sure you know all key facets of that person's job description and the supervisor's interpretation of it as reflected on the employee's performance appraisal form. Since this document reflects management's evaluation of employee productivity, this form should serve as the basis for your review of the salary increase request.2. Ask yourself how valuable this individual is to your company. Objectively evaluate how she has contributed to the success of the team, department or business. Analyze how she has grown through any additional training, coursework or achievements in key areas or projects. Think about the amount of additional time she typically spends on projects or assisting others. In other words, exactly how and why is this employee valuable to your company?3. Compare this employee's salary to others in the industry. Find out the range of what similar colleagues in your business (and any competing companies) are earning. Look for similar backgrounds, responsibilities, experience and expertise. Based on this information, you can consider the percentage increase of the request. Sometimes, if the percentage is high, you might balk. However, you need to delve further into the situation to determine if the current salary is below par or below the equity level. Most importantly, this knowledge will provide you with rational data with which you can compare the equality of the current pay with that of others. Armed with this crucial information, you add significant power and substance to your response to the salary increase request.What happens if you conclude the request is unwarranted? Don't stop there. Use this opportunity to discuss the employee's career path. First, explain exactly why the request was rejected. Common excuses are: ""We're at the end of the budget cycle,"" ""We don't have much money left in the budget for unscheduled raises"" or ""You don't deserve a raise."" If your response happens to be, ""You don't deserve a raise,"" discuss frankly and specifically with the employee what he can do during the next assessment period to improve.Whatever the reason, use it as crucial information for this employee to plan for his next request. Timeliness may be the answer in the future. Often, promotions and salary increases are discussed only during the performance appraisal time, the end of the fiscal year or the start of the next.Help your employee understand what additional experiences, knowledge, skills, abilities or responsibilities she must gain to be in a better position to request a salary increase next time. Be concrete. When the employee grows and develops in almost any area, you and your company grow and gain also. So understand that this partnership benefits both management and non-management.When you objectively discuss your thoughts and evaluate the individual, you are demonstrating a realistic and rational plan the employee can follow to succeed. Most importantly, you are also showing concern for the well-being of this individual. Whatever the outcome, the employee should feel that she has experienced an objective process where she was listened to and responded to, and developed a clear plan of how to get her needs met in the near future.What more could anyone ask for?Dr. David G.

Ironically, many employees do not see change as simple or as uplifting as management does.But you can minimize or avoid potentially negative aspects of change by following my ""seven P approach"" that includes purpose, people, plan, process, product, perception and problem.1. Purpose: Ask yourself and others the most important question of all: Is there a need for a change? If the answer is no, then your most crucial task is either to persuade people of the need or to create a need. Otherwise, without a recognized need for change, the entire change process is doomed to failure. Next, as a change agent, you need to ask yourself these questions: Exactly why am I encouraging this change? Who will benefit from it, and who will not? Is the change worth it?2. People: Look at the people on your team and those who will be affected by the change. Are they committed, and do they have the needed skills to participate in the change process? Are they willing to take risks? Will they support you through the easy times as well as the difficult times? Do they need to see some progress before joining the team or agreeing to engage in the change process?3. Plan: Do you have a solid, working, practical plan? Is it rational and well thought out? How sure are you that it will succeed? Is it flexible enough to adapt to unforeseen changes or obstacles? Is the plan motivating, uplifting and visionary enough to attract followers and helpers? Have you built in buffers or backups of resources that you might need should unexpected obstacles arise? Are your time frames realistic?4. Process: What processes have you and others created to ensure the success of the change? Will you start the change with a small unit or group, or will you foolishly begin the change with the entire division, section or organization? What mechanisms are in place to deal with obstacles, especially those you do not anticipate? How are decisions made? Will you allow for dissent or be caught in the sinking process of groupthink, where dissension is not tolerated or voiced? How and by whom will communication within the change team be communicated internally and externally? And finally, but very crucially, how will you deal with conflict before it inevitably arises?5. Product: Exactly what is it that you and others are working so hard to achieve? How realistic is it that you and your team can achieve this product? What is the cost of this product in terms of time, people, money and equipment? Beyond the vision of creating your product, what will it look like? How will it be used? If your end product is a service, how will it be carried out? How will you know if you have been successful?6. Perception: How do others perceive you, your colleagues, the change process and the end product? You may believe that everything is moving along smoothly, that all or most of the people understand and accept the change and its implication, but those are your perceptions. Have you verified your reality with the reality of your colleagues and the other people involved in the change? Do other people perceive that you are an effective change agent, that the change will actually benefit them and that they can trust you with this process?7. Problem: How will you deal with problems that inevitably occur? Do you have a crisis plan in place? Are your team members able to identify potential problems or obstacles before they get out of hand? Do your people know what to do when a problem occurs in terms of how to cope with it, whom to contact, what procedures to follow and how to prevent it from recurring? What will you do if you run out of resources or if the time frame shortens?When considering any type of change, try to recall these important factors before you even think of moving forward.

/article/71096,How to Handle an Overbearing Board of Directors,"If your board is trying to run your business, it's time to take charge of the situation.","Q: I'm the CEO of a growing medical products manufacturing business, and I'm having some trouble with my board of directors. All businesspeople, they are a combination of investors, fellow entrepreneurs and two cousins. The problem is that they all want to run my company, and several have very different ideas. They're driving me nuts. I find them overly involved in company operations, needling me instead of questioning me, and antagonistic and critical of my accomplishments. How do you suggest I deal with the situation?A: It certainly is challenging trying to meet the needs of your employees, investors, vendors and your board, especially when you are looking for some friendly, or at least objective, advice. As I see it, you have several issues going on here: the role of the board, the communication process and the issue of trust.First, you need to deal with the role of the board and the communication process. You need to make this clear in your mind, and then in their mind. Boards of directors do not ""run"" an organization. Typically, they do not get involved in administrative or operational issues, unless they determine that the current officers are significantly ineffective. If that is your situation, then find out specifically where they find you ineffective so that you can address that issue head-on. But for now, let's assume that is not the case. What I suggest you do is scope out very clearly your roles and responsibilities. Identify which roles you believe you perform well, which need some input and which need considerable input. At the same time, invite a confidant on the board to do the same for you. In this way, you'll have two points of view.Next, share with the board your view of what their roles are, as described above and based on your needs. Use a consultant, if necessary, to assist you. The advantage of a board is that it can offer a variety of perspectives and skills that a CEO may not have. The disadvantage is that the board can become overbearing and intrusive where it is not warranted.Once you have your list of the areas that you and/or your confidant feel need improvement or outside perspectives, then you can ask or even suggest to the board to decide which individuals can effectively provide you with appropriate feedback in various areas. Explain that while open channels of communication are usually helpful, the numerous phone calls and e-mails from so many of the board members are overloading your circuits.As a result, you will be decreasing the amount and variety of input you are currently receiving. This will most likely result in a more manageable and acceptable level of input from a selective number of directors.You'll start to make progress once you take charge of the situation and address the key issues either by yourself or with the assistance of a few board members. During this process, you will be demonstrating your abilities and learning how and where to improve. As a result, the board will begin to trust you more when they see success. And the more success they see, the more they should back off from trying to run your company. Everyone wins! Good luck.Dr. David G. JavitchDr. David G.

/article/71108,Paying Employees During the Startup Stage,"When getting your company off the ground, there are ways to compensate workers that won't break the bank.","Q: I need to hire three employees to help get my business started, but I don't have enough financing to pay the salaries for all three. Should I try to raise more money before hiring anyone or should I hire just one employee and hope that I can make it work with limited resources?A: Every entrepreneur faces the question of how to pay employees during the startup stage when money is tight and the business has yet to prove itself.You'll be able to determine the right answer to your question by understanding the nature of your business and your appetite for risk. If your business growth is best executed in small steps, your staffing strategy should be very different than if your business needs financing in large portions. For example, if your business is a restaurant, it would be foolish to try to launch it without adequate staff and equipment. Alternatively, a one-man army could be the best way to start an import-export business or consulting practice.If you're convinced your business needs three employees to get off the ground, you shouldn't launch it until you can hire all three. This is a surefire way to increase the possibility that your business will fail due to poor execution. If you don't have enough money to pay for three employees, there still might be a way to make it work. Here are some creative ways to compensate your employees during the startup stage:Hire stay-at-home moms and dads. Part-time employees, particularly stay-at-home moms and dads, are a secret weapon for startups. When my company first launched, we advertised for ""flex time"" employees in local papers and were surprised by the number of highly qualified applicants we received. For less than half the cost of full-time staff, it's possible to attract experienced employees to your company. If you plan to hire a stay-at-home mom or dad to work at your company, be wary of assigning them critical time-sensitive projects. Keep in mind that if you're not paying them enough to cover adequate child care, they'll be unable to prioritize business meetings over personal meetings if they have a sick child or family situation to deal with.Defer compensation. One of the most common ways that cash-strapped entrepreneurs hire employees is by convincing them to accept deferred or delayed compensation. There are different ways to do it: a deferred cash bonus until the business generates a certain amount of revenue; an increased salary when the employee hits performance milestones; or back-pay provided when the business becomes profitable. I recommend offering an increased salary rather than a cash bonus or back-pay because one-time lump sum payments tend to offer short-lived gratification and tend to give you less bang for the buck. In addition, employees feel more pride when their salary is permanently increased due to business progress or personal achievement.
If you choose to offer deferred compensation, it's very important to consult an attorney about how to write the offer letter for the employee. For example, even using the term ""deferred compensation"" (as opposed to ""bonus payment"" or ""performance incentive"") can create a binding liability for your company. This is one of the areas where spending $200 for an attorney to provide you with a sample offer letter could save you thousands later.Use equity and stock options. Another alternative is to offer employees equity grants or stock options instead of cash. This is only a viable alternative for companies that have realistic prospects for liquidity; in other words, don't offer stock options if you don't think they'll be worth anything. Most companies are never sold and never have an IPO, so it's unlikely that stock options are a worthwhile compensation tool.
Nevertheless, stock options tend to motivate employees more than cash bonuses at the startup stage. The cocktail party crowd has romanticized stock options, and employees still find them appealing, even if they're unsure about their true value. My advice is to avoid stock options (and the legal costs of setting them up) unless you genuinely believe they'll be valuable one day.Employ interns and volunteers. Hiring unpaid staff is an obvious solution for startups but one that's often overlooked. Colleges and universities are teeming with bright young workers willing to work part time or full time during vacations to gain experience. Just posting an internship announcement at your local college will draw applicants.
It takes effort to set up a win-win situation for both intern and employer, however. It's important to remember that interns are not like part-time employees who are primarily interested in a paycheck: You can't expect to give them menial work for the duration of their internship. One way to motivate interns is to ask them to list their learning objectives for the internship. Have monthly meetings with them to track how well they're doing on reaching these objectives. Then even doing menial work becomes tolerable if it's put in context.Focus on revenue. As any entrepreneur will tell you, the best way to pay for three employees when you only have the financial resources to hire one is to generate more revenue. The first of the three employees you hire should be the one that will get you closest to generating sales so you can afford to hire the other two. It's never too early to start selling-or pre-selling-your product to get funds in the door.Asheesh AdvaniAsheesh Advani is CEO of Covestor, an online marketplace for investors.

/article/70608,Selecting the Best CEO for Your Company,Ask these questions to find out if prospective executives will fit with your culture.,"Q: We hired a CEO for a previous company we started, and after about five months noticed that this individual was a micromanager who wanted to control everything. We will be hiring a CEO for another startup company and would like to know how to choose the right CEO for the type of culture we are developing. Are there pre-employment tests or specific questions to ask and behaviors to look for? How do you know if a CEO candidate can manage without controlling?A: I can understand your concern for hiring the right or best CEO. All the successes and failures in any company flow up and down the hierarchy, but, ultimately, the CEO is the person in charge who needs to assume responsibility for the outcomes.There is certainly no ""one best"" CEO or boss. This individual is a combination of personal and professional traits, behaviors, characteristics, knowledge, skills and abilities. Management researchers have not yet decided which of these factors coupled with which management or leadership theories are most effective. However, most people would agree that success definitely depends on the best matching of those factors with the environment or culture of your company. The successful CEO of IBM, for example, might not be successful at a chain of statewide supermarkets or high-tech fix-it shops. Failure or success comes not only from within the individual, but also from the individual who works within the existing culture or desired culture that the CEO attempts to develop.You already seem to have an idea about the importance of a prospective CEO fitting into your culture. Let me offer a few more thoughts and questions to trigger your deepening view of the aspects that define a culture and the necessary factors a CEO candidate must possess in order to work well within a culture.First, a culture is generally defined as the sum total of a group or organization's actions, structures, policies, beliefs, legends, ceremonies, history and values. The CEO and the people he or she trusts and/or delegates to are responsible for creating or furthering the ongoing aspects of that culture.If you want to improve the chances that you will hire the best candidate for your culture, you will need to take a hard assessment of your internal and external corporate environment, no matter how large or small your organization may be. For instance, with whom will the CEO communicate: other CEOs? Community leaders? The press? What is the CEO's vision for your company? How well does it mesh with your view? Just where does the CEO want to take your company, or is that candidate happy with the status quo? What goals does this person have for moving from today's world into tomorrow's world? How will that be achieved? At what cost and to whom? With how much change? Using which process of change?What values does the CEO candidate espouse? How does this person feel about these issues: honesty, integrity and ethics? Outcome issues such as productivity, revenue and quality? Values such as individual vs. teamwork? Highly structured vs. less-structured leadership styles? Autocratic vs. democratic processes? People-oriented vs. productivity-oriented? Trust vs. distrust? Creativity and innovation vs. current focus? Risk-taking vs. playing it safe?These are, of course, just some of the descriptors that can define a successful CEO. The most fundamental step is for you and your colleagues to answer these questions. Then, review resumes and interview candidates to determine just how close they come to reflecting the picture of the ideal candidate for your specific company. In the process of making that decision, ask specific questions of the candidate and insist on specific, measurable responses that include key examples of what the candidate did and did not do in various situations.Dr. David G.

/article/70440,Talent Scouting,Employees' hidden star qualities might be just the thing to put your business's name in lights.,"						This story appears in the May 2004 issue of Entrepreneur. Subscribe  Do you know how talented your employees really are? Every
employee has hidden talents that could take your company from good
to great. ""People come with more talent than the job
they're hired for,"" says Robert Kelley, a professor of
management at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh.Tapping the talent zeitgeist is more important than ever before.
Employees want their hidden talents to be recognized and developed:
When Indianapolis loyalty research firm Walker Information Inc.
surveyed 2,400 employees last year, it found two-thirds wanted to
leave their companies because there weren't enough development
opportunities.While skills and knowledge can be learned, talent is
instinctive. An administrative assistant could have a knack for
negotiation, or an accountant a penchant for spotting industry
trends. Employees may also have ""black market""
talents-like photography or musical ability-that don't seem
relevant to the workplace but can ""make new things
happen"" if used strategically, says David Magellan Horth,
program manager and a senior faculty member at the Center for
Creative Leadership, a leadership training and research firm in
Greensboro, North Carolina. He points to one manager who opened a
meeting by playing his cello to get employees thinking. It
worked.Employees rise above the rest once they harness their natural
talents, says Kenneth A. Tucker, seminar leader and managing
consultant for The Gallup Organization in Washington, DC, and
co-author of Animals, Inc.: A Business Parable for the 21st
Century (Warner Books). His research has found that an
employee using his or her true talents has more than twice the
productivity of a person who doesn't have a natural talent for
doing the same job. And a company rockets to the next level once
each employee applies his or her talents. ""Tiger Woods
redefined our reality of what great golf looks like,"" Tucker
says. ""Talent will redefine the reality of your
organization.""As an entrepreneurial company, you have a size advantage in
unleashing talent. But it's hard for most managers to think
beyond meeting quarterly projections and enforcing job
descriptions. ""It's not that they tell [employees] they
can't use their talents,"" Kelley says. ""[Managers]
don't even think of it as a possibility.""You and your managers can master the possibilities with
strategic thinking. Start by making sure your recruiting tools are
centered on developing talent. ""When you sit down for an
interview, is the discussion and conversation about talent?""
Tucker says. ""It has to come down to individual employee
performance.""Use one-on-ones to find out what drives each employee. What are
their hobbies and interests, and how do they feel they're being
underutilized at work? Contemplate how you can incorporate their
hidden talents, and phase in change slowly. You might let the
receptionist spend two hours a week on a marketing project, for
example, or allow a software engineer interested in sales to sit in
on an occasional sales meeting.Alliant Technologies LLC, a 5-year-old IT engineering and
consulting company in Morristown, New Jersey, uses a survey tool
called the Predictive Index (published by PI Worldwide of
Wellesley, Massachusetts) to assess employee workstyles. When the
80-employee company tested workers in 2003, it found some people
weren't using their true talents. One engineer had an ability
for sales, and another entry-level employee had a gift for
detail-oriented projects. The company is having the engineer
research market trends, and the entry-level employee is now in an
administrative function. ""We identified strengths and were
able to move people into more effective positions,"" says
founder and CEO Bruce Flitcroft, 38. Developing talent isn't
hurting Alliant: Sales grew 34 percent in 2003 to $25 million.Company meetings can also unearth hidden talents. Begin a
discussion where employees can offer solutions to problems. You
might be surprised what people know. ""It's an opportunity
for employees to unleash their talents,"" Kelley says.What you do now will put your company ahead as talent wars heat
up again, because the best firms will be consistent about
identifying talent and putting it in the right place. ""This is
not a quick fix,"" says Tucker. ""It's a cultural
revamping.""Flitcroft's advice? Developing hidden talent takes time, but
the results can be dramatic. ""Of our 20 original [employees],
18 are still here,"" he says. ""That's a damn good
sign.""Chris PenttilaChris Penttila is a Washington, DC-based freelance journalist who covers workplace issues on her blog, Workplacediva.blogspot.com.Read more",Growth Strategies,2004-05-01 00:00:00
/article/70172,Establishing an Employee Review System,"By setting clear standards and involving employees in the review process, your entire company can benefit from formal appraisals.","Q: I'd like to establish a formal review process for my employees. Do you have any suggestions?A: Increasingly, entrepreneurial companies are implementing formal employee evaluation tools. Both in the short term and long term, if properly administered, this process will be extremely effective and motivating. Some of the common benefits are increased revenue, creativity, productivity, employee satisfaction and career path clarity. Why? Because employers and employees can clearly understand and chart employee value and potential to the company.Career specialist and author David Campbell once said, ""If you don't know where you're going, you'll probably end up someplace else!"" When management and non-management can work together to improve performance and outcomes, everyone wins.Generally, the three areas you need to comment on are quite similar. They refer to what the person is doing now; how well he or she is doing it; what needs to be changed, improved or learned now and in the future; and their career path: where the individual is or can be headed in the short and long term at your company.Employers and employees have the opportunity to share their current and individual assessment of the employee, plus discuss plans for growth into future positions, knowledge and skill bases. I specifically added the word ""employee"" to the previous statement. I firmly believe that if the employee can provide input to the performance appraisal interview prior to the evaluator's providing comments, the employee will feel he or she has had an opportunity to offensively evaluate self-performance.Clear, action-oriented, positive and negative statements and steps need to be expressed here by both parties. In that way, the employee can learn what areas need to be improved or acquired in order maintain employment or continue to move ahead on the career path. The employer can learn the employee's goals and, if interested, assist the employee in gaining the desired position or responsibilities.Specifically, as a leader, you can address the particular actions and knowledge sources where the employee achieves or is deficient. Hopefully, these comments and interventions will be made all during the year, as opposed to the more common practice of a once per year formal or informal evaluation event. Take this occasion seriously as an opportunity to praise and therefore further motivate the individual. Also, use this time to identify key deficiencies and opportunities for growth in the employee. Many evaluators either understate or overstate the negatives or positives. The usual result is that the employee is overwhelmed with either the number or intensity of negative statements or is disappointed with the lack of positive ones.I strongly urge that these statements be balanced to point out that no totality of employee performance is all effective or all ineffective. Rely on these key questions to guide your comments: ""How can the employee grow, improve and build on his or her current set of successes to contribute a maximum to the company's success?"" ""What can I as the leader do to point out and/or provide resources, guidance and opportunities, while minimizing the obstacles for the individual to grow, change and achieve?"" ""What does the individual need to do on his or her own to continue to grow and succeed?""Once both you and the employee seriously and objectively assess the employee's current and future resources, interests, knowledge, skills and abilities, you, that employee and your company will benefit!Dr. David G.

/article/69144,The Challenges of Mixing Business With Friendship,Tips for motivating a poor-performing employee who's also a friend and investor,"Q: My best friend is a freelance member of my staff. He has committed six months of his inheritance money into becoming the company's first sales manager. However, he is only a quarter of the way to achieving his target, although he could still achieve the set minimum target.Since he will probably only achieve the minimum target, I can only promise him a minimum wage plus commission. With regard to his commitment over the past six months, he has stressed that he cannot afford to come on board at the minimum wage, but asked if I would consider giving him shares in the business so he has a vested interest. What are your thoughts?A: Your concerns and questions are certainly very valid and serious, and they strike at the heart of doing business-making a profit. No matter how large or small the enterprise, revenue cannot be overlooked or minimized.You have two key issues at stake here-money and friendship. When you combine them in a business setting, you risk losing one or both of these factors. Yet, you also have the potential to increase the return on both. The real question for you is, are you prepared to lose a close friendship and/or company revenues?You have already decided to go ahead with your best friend as your sales manager, at least for now. He isn't performing up to expected levels, he's using his own money, and he wants company shares to solidify his commitment. This is potentially a problem for both of you.If his lack of accomplishment is due to a lack of commitment due to low salary and no stock, how can you be assured that simply giving him a piece of the company will increase his commitment and his sales? You can't. It would seem that as a new employee, having put his own money into the deal, he should have been sufficiently motivated to bring in the sales. But this is not the case. Something else is the problem.If he is looking for stock to increase his motivation, commitment and performance, he might suffer all around if, given stock or stock options, his performance does not adequately improve. His obstacles to success may be due to the market, the product or his own skill set. The research in the area of employee stock ownership does not always show an increased work ethic or increased company profitability. Therefore, your friend certainly needs to demonstrate a commitment and clear sales before you offer him company stock.I suggest that you discuss the situation with him. Evaluate cost projections, sales and return on investment. Once the risks and advantages are clear, map out a strategy to identify leads, present and sell the product, and look forward to revenue. Next, identify timelines for him to meet your mutually agreed-upon sales goals. At both of these points, you need to identify any obstacles to success. This is where you will probably uncover the real issues at stake: his skills, abilities, confidence and contacts.If he's willing to put in the time and effort necessary to meet standards and goals, then I would suggest an increase from the minimum wage to demonstrate your trust in him. So far, you have little or no confidence that he will succeed for himself, for you or for the company. Therefore, it would be unwise for you to give away company stock at this point.However, this is also the time to discuss the potential for company stock. The cardinal rule is performance equals profits and, in this case, profit sharing. When he actually meets the performance deadlines and when revenue goals seem likely, then I would offer him predetermined stock. But until he performs adequately, in my opinion, you would be throwing away your money by giving him shares without the basis of past performance or a solid potential for future performance.Dr. David G.

/article/66230,Ensuring Employees Get the Credit They Deserve,"When employees aren't properly recognized, your company can suffer.","Q:  I work for a business and manage its orthodontic clinic. For the past year, I've worked closely with my manager to open a branch office, but when the time came to fill the manager position at this new office, I was passed over for someone with less experience and education. This person even calls me for help! My direct boss recognizes my hard work, but the corporate bosses don't. How can I get the recognition I deserve?A:  Attention fellow entrepreneurs: This is an issue you need to look into. There is a lot at stake here: revenue, productivity, management behavior, human resources policies and employee morale. And that's just for starters! What we have here is the situation of an apparently outstanding employee, certainly a creative jewel that any smart entrepreneur should be grateful for. Instead of allowing this person to lose her position, authority and responsibilities, you and the manager in question should be heaving accolades, raises and increased status her way.From the employee's e-mail, she survived the red tape, was a visionary in terms of participating in the strategic planning and had the foresight and perseverance to expand the services and revenue of the dental offices. What's not to like?One of her questions asks how to let the corporate office find out about her skills and successes. This is a key part of career-pathing and looking out for an employee's best interests. Being aware of entrepreneurial employees is one of your most important responsibilities. What a pity that the boss in question says she will never get the credit and recognition she deserves. Furthermore, the immediate supervisor or manager should take credit for having mentored or at least encouraged and allowed this employee to participate in the strategic planning and assist in allowing ideas to come to fruition.But that's in the past. Now, the employer should inform the employee that she has at least three choices. First, consult with her direct boss and others whom she trusts to help her determine just why she was overlooked for the position she seems to have deserved. Next, she should try her best to be open and willing to accept feedback. The more she knows now, the better off she will be in current and/or future jobs.Second, she needs to ask how she can get people further up the hierarchy to notice her skills, abilities, knowledge and accomplishments. Is she on the appropriate committees or project teams? Does she partner with others when tasks need to be accomplished? Does her direct supervisor sing her praises at management meetings? Does the manager take credit for the work she does, thereby feathering his or her cap while preventing others from knowing of this employee's successes?And third, if it looks like she will not get the appropriate position and appreciation for her accomplishments and potential, I suggest that she start writing her resume. She needs to contact organizations that could benefit from someone like her who has energy, enthusiasm, perseverance and a positive track record. There are many companies both inside and outside of her industry where she can apply her skills.Fellow entrepreneurs, do you want to lose valuable employees? If not, then do not allow them to start looking for another employer. Get out there and find all the employees like her: Tell and show them how and why you value them. Acknowledge and reward past accomplishments. Conduct some serious career-pathing arrangements so that your organization can benefit more fully from eager and effective individuals. If you don't do something, you stand to lose productive and creative employees, while creating animosity, unfilled job positions, and decreasing morale and productivity. This, I am sure, is not what you want for your company.Dr. David G. JavitchDr. David G.

/article/65780,Dealing With a Confrontational Employee,Working together with your employees can help put an end to negative behavior.,"Q:  I have an employee in a support area who has been a positive nightmare. Two months ago, the person approached me and said that because of his shift, he couldn't find proper care for his children before and after school. I accommodated him temporarily and explained that there were five other people on the desk who I had to think about as well. Ever since that day, he has been a thorn in my side. He is openly confrontational to his supervisor, has been antagonistic toward me and has been trying to provoke a physical confrontation at every turn. In speaking with the supervisor, I learned that this employee was unhappy that we wouldn't accommodate him on a regular basis with times that were convenient to him so he was going to be as disruptive as possible. The supervisor said that the employee felt we were singling him out. When the employee started calling in sick, I requested a note, which only made him more defiant. Now he is calling in sick for a week at a time which is causing major scheduling issues. Where do I start in dealing with this troublesome employee?A:  Apparently, your employee never heard the expression, ""Don't bite the hand that feeds you."" It sounds like you were trying to be flexible, especially during a time of need with this employee; this is the mark of a helpful and understanding employer. The fact that your actions and best intentions backfired should be an immediate red flag to you that there is a real and serious problem brewing.You seem to have three management challenges confronting you: first, the issue of flexible time; second, unusual and ongoing negative behavior by the demanding employee; and third, as a result of this behavior, declining morale on the part of the onlookers. Let's deal with the second issue first, the negative behavior. Regardless of its causes, no one can or should tolerate confrontational behavior, especially if it is accompanied by veiled or overt physical or emotional threats. If either of these get ""out of hand,"" the result could be clear physical and emotional harm to individuals, destruction of property, lawsuits, and decreased productivity and profitability, to name just a few. This cannot and must not be tolerated by anyone, anywhere.Immediately, you need to convene a meeting with your human resources officer, your lawyer and your security staff to identify the scope of the current activity and your options. Next, you need to invite the problem employee into a meeting, either with you alone, or preferably with the aforementioned colleagues. Frankly and empathetically, you need to ask the employee about the negative behavior and begin searching for an understanding of the causes and implications of his actions. Then, once the employee feels heard and understood, you can proceed toward creating solutions.The very first resolution needs to be a cessation of negative verbal abuse, calling in sick without a physician's letter and potential physical threats or actions. If these three issues are not immediately agreed to, then employment termination needs to be seriously considered. This is based on both legal concerns and fear for potential violence. The key to this process is to create awareness in the employee that you are acting on behalf of and in the best interests of all of the employees in the company, including him. Above all, as the president or CEO, you need to ensure a professional and safe environment for everyone.At this point, it is necessary to suggest a referral to an Employee Assistance Program (EAP) or other form of counseling or therapy because your employee's actions are well beyond what is ""normal"" and acceptable, especially in the workplace. We do not yet know the reasons why this individual is acting in an inappropriate manner; more importantly, we cannot be certain that his actions will not turn to be more punitive and violent. This is why you need to act immediately and cautiously to protect the health and welfare of all individuals as well as the ongoing viability of your organization.While this process for resolution is in motion, you and your management staff need to meet with your employees to reassure them that you are concerned about the health, safety and productivity of all individuals in your organization. To that end, you will enforce policies and procedures that help ensure employee satisfaction and output, being as flexible, understanding and supportive as possible. You also need to instill in them the firm belief that your organization exists to provide everyone with an opportunity to earn an income in a safe and supportive environment.In the process of conducting these meetings, you will be addressing the other challenges mentioned earlier, the issues of flexible time, fairness to all individuals and employee morale.

/article/65236,Hiring the Right Employees for Your Business,Follow these steps to ensure the best person for the job is also the best fit for your company.,"Q:  I am a small-business owner and am getting ready to hire at least five new people. I want to make sure that in addition to hiring the most qualified workers, I find folks who will fit into our corporate culture. What steps can I take to ensure I bring in the best people for my business?A:  When I read your question, I immediately thought of the manufacturing company I consulted with years ago. There were 90 employees in one department, and 150 of them left within one year. At first, you might say that's impossible, but when you look deeper, you understand that conditions were so bad that almost every new hire left within a year. When the CEO asked me how to decrease the wrenching turnover, I simply told him to hire better candidates.So how do you hire better candidates? And why do so many companies make mistakes in this area? The simple answer is that they weren't trained in the art and science of hiring human beings.Here are some chief reasons for why new hires are frequently misfires. First, knowingly or not, many interviewers are biased. The reason you like someone or something is rarely based on rational thought; instead, it's based on, ""Well, I just prefer it this way."" With candidates, you may like the way they look, smile, dress, act or speak. Or they may remind you of yourself or someone you like. They may have interests like yours or know people whom you know.Or, they may be good at one or two aspects of a job, and you eagerly assume or want to believe that they will be effective at other aspects. You may accept as honest and true something a reference said about the candidate. But keep in mind it would be highly unlikely for a candidate to offer the name of a reference who would not offer positive information.There are, of course, key methods for avoiding biases and making successful hiring decisions. First, identify the most important knowledge areas, skills and abilities the ideal candidate should possess. Human resources people call these ""factors."" Next, create the same specific questions that you will ask of all candidates that will clearly and behaviorally demonstrate to you that they have these critical factors. But don't simply accept the candidate's word that he or she possesses a certain skill or knowledge base. Ask that person to demonstrate the skill, solve a problem, or write or create something that clearly and concretely provides you with the proof you need to make an informed decision.Next, ask specific and measurable questions of the candidate. If you ask if this person considers himself a success or a failure, do not simply accept a yes or no response. Probe for specific examples of both successes and failures. The latter is especially rich in response material because you can then ask what the person could have done to turn the failure into a success. In the process, you are observing how the candidate analyzes situations, how rationally or logically the situation is presented, and whether or not, to the best of your judgment, the person is trying to cover something up or lie.To ensure that you understand the individual as well as possible, involve one or two other interviewers in this process. In that way, you can all share your insights and impressions of the candidate. Furthermore, one interviewer can add an aspect to a question that another one may have overlooked. Two or three heads are often better than one.Finally, make sure you know enough about a candidate before you hire that person, and never, ever hire even a moderately qualified person just because you need someone now. That rushed hire will likely become problematic. And you know how long and painful it can be to terminate someone and advertise, screen, interview and hire another person. So take your time and make sure you have the best person possible for every position. You and your company will be pleased with the results.Dr. David G. JavitchDr. David G.

/article/64734,Learning to Say What You Mean to Employees,Tips for making sure your suggestions and corrections are understood by everyone,"Q: What do you do when an employee overreacts to a correction from his or her supervisor? One of my supervisors has become leery of correcting an employee because of the strong response she receives. A small correction like, ""Let me know when you are leaving early. I need to know when you will not be in the office,"" triggered a strong negative reaction and created a lot of tension in the office.A: When a simple statement like ""Let me know when you are leaving early"" elicits a strong negative response, it means a problem exists, and it needs to be addressed immediately. But the problem is not new, and the responsibility is not totally yours. In fact, it is shared by managers in every industry and in every country in the world. So at least you are not alone.It seems there are two basic issues here: First, what the supervisor said and how it was said; and second, how the employee perceived or misperceived that message. This is a classic case of ineffective communication. An employee may think he understood what was said, but it's possible that what he heard and understood were not what your manager intended.As the senders of messages, you and your staff certainly have to look at the tone of voice used (too harsh or too soft?), your physical proximity to the individual when you sent the message (too close? too far?) and what your posture was (were you standing, sitting or leaning toward or away from the employee?). If misused, intentionally or unintentionally, each and every one of these factors can lead to misunderstandings, hard feelings, decreased productivity and decreased worker satisfaction. In some cases, these misperceptions can even result in sexual harassment charges.Let's assume that the supervisor intended none of those negative factors. He or she simply made a basic statement, ""Let me know when you are leaving early."" Now let's consider the second part of the issue, the employee's perspective. How often has the supervisor made that or similar statements to that particular employee? Does the supervisor make similar statements, using approximately the same words, in the same way, with the same posture and tone to other employees? Might the offended employee believe the supervisor only makes those statements to him or her and is therefore singling out that individual for negative treatment? Does that person believe the supervisor is inappropriately checking up on him or her, or that the supervisor doubts he or she is working as hard as the others or thinks he or she is leaving early or taking longer breaks than the others?As you can see, there are many possibilities in trying to interpret how and why your employee reacts so negatively to a seemingly innocuous statement. One of the most obvious is that the employee feels guilty for trying to sneak out early. But again, we do not know that for a fact. The simplest way to find out what the real issue is, and how many other issues may be boiling inside that employee as well, is to simply ask. Encourage the supervisor to invite the employee into a conference room or other neutral territory. (Never do this in front of other people.) Ask the supervisor to state what you saw happen (your supervisor made a statement about a certain behavior) and then describe the employee's reaction (a strong reaction). The supervisor describes his or her interpretation--such as, ""I was very surprised that you were so upset."" Then ask the employee to explain his or her perception and reactions.By going direct, you or your supervisor may uncover possibilities that you never even imagined. Here are some: The supervisor picks on some people, doesn't trust others or acts like a ""mother hen,"" constantly micromanaging. The employee may have to rush out to pick up a child or an elderly person, or care for a sick family member or friend. The employee is unhappy in the job, underpaid or underutilized. Or perhaps that employee has to leave early or exactly on time for a doctor's appointment or an ongoing medical treatment. Who knows? Only the individual involved knows, and you will only find out by directly addressing the issue with the employee.The key issue here is to reopen the lines of communication so that all parties deliver, receive and understand verbal and nonverbal messages in the intended manner. If your goal is to ensure the highest levels of productivity and employee satisfaction, with the lowest levels of turnover and absenteeism, then using clear communication is one of the best methods to achieve your goal.Dr. David G.

/article/63948,Preparing for the Baby Boomer Exodus,"If your staff is heavy on the over-40 crowd, here's how you can be ready when they start leaving the nest.","It's no secret that the Baby Boom generation is getting a little long in the tooth. Within the next five to 10 years, over 76 million Baby Boomers are scheduled to retire from the workforce, with only about 44 million Generation X'ers available to pick up the slack. Companies that don't start planning now for this mass exodus of talent will find themselves in a gut-wrenching transition. Who will help them?Enter The Hyde Group Inc., a human resources firm based in Greenwich, Connecticut that specializes in helping companies cope with change and transition in the workplace.""I realized several years ago that without proper planning, companies both large and small will be caught with their pants down when their Baby Boom employees retire en masse,"" says company founder Anne Hyde. Hyde, a native of Great Britain who survived the London blitz during World War Two (as a child, she was buried for three days in a bomb-collapsed house, with no food or water), decided she would create a new consulting product to help companies transition quickly to a younger workforce.She began by seeking the help of an old friend, New York City management consultant G. Todd Jagerson. Coincidentally, Jagerson had just completed a remarkably similar project: helping formerly state-owned companies in Russia recover from the ""brain drain"" that occurred when millions of people suddenly fled the country after the collapse of the former Soviet Union. Together Hyde and Jagerson developed The Boomer Transition Service, a step-by-step program that helps HR executives identify the extent to which the Baby Boomer exodus will affect their companies, decide which Baby Boomers should be encouraged to stay on board into their 70s and which should be let go, and provide training, mentoring and support to those Generation X executives who will be asked to assume a lot more responsibility in a very short time.""It may seem silly to talk about all this at a time when companies are laying off people right and left,"" says Hyde, ""but if companies don't start retraining people and planning for this right now, they don't realize how desperate they'll be for talent in the years to come."" As an example, adds Jagerson, ""70 to 80 percent of all airline pilots are scheduled to retire in the next five years.""The Boomer Transition Service sets out a four-step strategy:Immediate: ""Stop doing things that force good Baby Boomer executives to take early retirement,"" says Jagerson, and forego traditional practices (such as ""Golden Parachute"" payments for retiring execs) that will dramatically increase the cost of a mass exodus.Short-term: Get selective Baby Boomer executives to stay on beyond normal retirement age for at least five to seven years, with appropriate incentives. ""I think many Baby Boomers can be persuaded to work into their 70s,"" predicts Hyde, ""but I don't think they'll want to do the same jobs. Companies will lose a great deal if they don't continue training their Baby Boomers and help them develop new skills.""Middle-term: Develop Generation X talent through a massive internal mentoring and training program.Long-term: Adopt an ""employment branding"" strategy to make the company's jobs more attractive than its competitors' jobs. ""This will be very important as companies start fighting aggressively over a shrinking pool of talent once the Boomers leave,"" says Hyde.What about the Baby Boomer execs who are left behind in the transition? Hyde says her firm's executive coaching services, offered as part of The Boomer Transition Service package, will help aging executives ease into retirement or find another career. ""Companies will want to help these people, if for no other reason than they'll be swamped with age discrimination lawsuits if they don't,"" says Hyde.Hyde believes it will be particularly difficult for many Baby Boomers to make this transition. ""The Baby Boomers didn't suffer through the Great Depression, the World War and the Cold War as [my parents] did,"" she says. ""They grew up in one of the strongest economies of all time and have been 'living for today' with the expectation that things would always continue that way. They haven't really saved as much for their retirement as they'll need, and as a result, they're going to have great difficulty getting over what will probably be their first major setback.""And that's a problem that's never plagued Anne Hyde, who claims that ""if you can survive the Blitz, you can survive anything.""Cliff Ennico is host of the PBS TV series MoneyHuntand a leading expert on managing growing companies.

/article/58222,Outsource Your HR,"Payroll, benefits, hiring, firing, tax compliance--erase those tasks from your to-do list by hiring an HR outsourcing firm.","IntroductionA Human Resources (HR) department is a critical component of employee well-being in any business, no matter how small. Human Resources responsibilities include payroll, benefits, hiring, firing, and keeping up to date with state and federal tax laws.Any mix-up concerning these issues can cause major legal problems for your business, as well as major employee dissatisfaction. But small businesses often don't have the staff or the budget to properly handle the nitty-gritty details of Human Resources. Because of this, more and more small businesses are beginning to outsource their HR needs. In fact, the HR outsourcing industry is expected to grow from $13.9 billion in 1999 to $37.7 billion in 2003, according to the market research firm Dataquest.Today, HR outsourcing goes beyond just handling payroll and benefits. Deciding which HR functions to offload and which firm to outsource to can be quite a challenge. This buyer's guide will help you to easily navigate through the process.What is HR outsourcing?HR outsourcing services generally fall into four categories: PEOs, BPOs, ASPs, or e-services. The terms are used loosely, so a big tip is to know exactly what the outsourcing firm you are investigating offers, especially when it comes to employee liability.PEOs
A Professional Employer Organization (PEO) assumes full responsibility of your company's human resources administration. It becomes a co-employer of your company's workers by taking full legal responsibility of your employees, including having the final say in hiring, firing, and the amount of money employees make. The PEO and business owner become partners, essentially, with the PEO handling all the HR aspects and the business handling all other aspects of the company.By proper definition, a service is only a PEO when it takes legal responsibility of employees. But take note--some HR outsourcing services like to use the recognized term ""PEO"" when they handle the primary aspects of HR like payroll and benefits, yet they do not take this legal partnership.BPOs
Business Process Outsourcing is a broad term referring to outsourcing in all fields, not just HR. A BPO differentiates itself by either putting in new technology or applying existing technology in a new way to improve a process.Specifically in HR, a BPO would make sure a company's HR system is supported by the latest technologies, such as self-access and HR data warehousing.Get free price quotes on HR outsourcingat BuyerZone.com.ASPs
Application service providers host software on the Web and rent it to users-some ASPs host HR software. Some are well-known packaged applications (People Soft) while others are customized HR software developed by the vendor. These software programs can manage payroll, benefits, and more.E-services
E-services are those HR services that are Web-based. Both BPOs and ASPs are often referred to as e-services.Who's who?
These services listed are fairly straightforward in their own right. But the confusion comes as these services increasingly cross over into other types of services, or shed some of the services for which they are known.For example, some BPOs will take over legal responsibility in much the same way as PEOs, while others do not. And many ASPs/e-services will also consider themselves to be BPOs because they are implementing new technology by hosting software and allowing self-service for employers and employees.So know these service terms, but don't get too sidetracked by the names when interviewing potential outsourcing firms. The key to hiring the right outsourcing firm is knowing what services your company needs and then find an outsourcing firm that can provide them.What can you get?When you outsource HR functions, some services go with the ""all-or-nothing"" approach, requiring that they handle all your HR functions or none at all. Others offer their services ""a la carte,"" meaning you can pick and choose from the services they offer.Typical services include:Payroll administration: Produce checks, handle taxes, and deal with sick time and vacation time.Employee benefits: Health, Medical, Life, 401(k) plans, cafeteria plans, etc.HR management: Recruiting, hiring, and firing. Also background interviews, exit interviews, and wage reviews.Risk management: Workers' compensation, dispute resolution, safety inspection, office policies and handbooks.Some services are full-service and will provide these as well as additional services like on-call consultants, who will come in to train or even settle a dispute.Online services tend to be limited in their offerings, but you'll get added options like Web access, which will allow you to view information (like benefits packages) and even make changes to such information online. Most will give you and your employees access to view their benefits plans, enroll in benefits, read policies, and make changes to current data.Even PEOs that have survived off-line since the early 1980s are starting to offer online access for certain aspects of their service (like viewing benefits packages).PricingThere are no clear-cut price ranges with HR outsourcing. The fees range greatly between services, as well as within the services. Aspects like number of employees, the options you choose to use, and even geography, will affect your overall cost.A PEO typically charges 4 percent to 8 percent of each employee's pretax salary per month. The monthly range can be as little as $20 per employee to as much as $200.A typical package with an online service, including insurance, 401(k) and workers' compensation, costs $75 to $130 per employee per month with an upfront setup fee of about $2,000.If you think this sounds expensive, do a cost comparison of an outsourcing program you are investigating and the average salary and maintenance of an in-house HR director or staff. You might find significant savings either in money, hassle, or both.Contracts with HR outsourcing firms will usually run a year. But you should work in a clause in which you can give 30 days' notice to break the contract if you are dissatisfied with the services or don't need the services anymore.AdvantagesWhat are the biggest advantages to outsourcing your HR needs?Does your business allow you the time to personally deal with federal and state employment laws? A big reason businesses turn to HR services is that they don't have the time, or expertise, to deal with this. And if you choose to go with a PEO, you can pass the legal responsibility of your employees onto them.You may also save money. You can usually count on a reduced benefits rate when outsourcing to HR services. Because they buy so often from vendors, they usually get a discounted rate that they pass on to you.If you opt for an online service (ASP/e-service), you don't have to purchase software, install it, and worry about configuring it. An ASP business model is hosting software, so you don't have to bother with additional software or installation.DownsidesSo what are some key things you'll have to give up if you favor outsourcing to hiring a full-time, in-house HR department?There are some definite drawbacks to not having an HR manager in-house. An in-house HR person handles perks that you can't necessarily count on an outsourcing service to carry out--like looking into group offerings, building employee incentive programs, even taking care of recognition for employees' birthdays. And employees may want someone in-house--an impartial co-worker they can trust and see daily--to turn to if they have a work-related problem or dispute with another co-worker.Because an in-house HR person interacts daily with your employees, they will likely have more of an interest in your employees. For example, employees often appreciate having someone on staff who will help negotiate in their favor for certain benefits that are critical these days for employee retention (like 401(k) plans and vacation policies).Also, in the case of using a PEO, giving up the right to hire and fire your employees may not be desirable for your particular business. Most PEOs insist that they have the final right to hire, fire, and discipline employees. While having the extra time and not having to deal with the stress of this may be appealing, you may not want this responsibility out of your hands.And if you decide to use an e-service, the same issues you'd have with any ASP remain. When everything is stored and handled online, there are concerns about security as well as potential crashes, both of which can be detrimental to your business.Common complaints about HR outsourcing range from payroll mix-ups to payroll not being deposited on time to denied medical claims.Should you consider outsourcing?If you have fewer than 100 employees, the answer is yes. At this size, you often don't have the resources for an in-house HR staff, so outsourcing is just right for you. You don't have to worry about managing all the details that are so critical to HR in your business, and most small-business owners just don't have the skills and experience to do so. Remember, HR functions must be handled correctly as close to 100 percent of the time as possible; slip-ups can cause your business major problems.If you have at least 12 employees, consider a PEO. Most PEOs only take on businesses with at least a dozen employees. Get recommendations and references for PEOs, and consider one that is part of the NAPEO (National Association of Professional Employment Organizations). The NAPEO is committed to educating PEOs. If a PEO is a member, it's a good sign that they are committed to being the best in the field.If you're even smaller, online services are the way to go. These services are tailored to work with all sizes of businesses, even the smallest. You don't have to give up legal responsibility just yet, and you'll be able to easily access your information online. And since the charge is usually by user, you won't be overpaying.If you're uncertain about outsourcing everything but know you don't have the staff or experience to keep it in-house, try outsourcing only certain parts, such as payroll and benefits. You can also purchase HR software right off the shelf to support any in-house efforts.Whatever you decide, make sure to keep your employees in the loop. They will appreciate knowing that you are seeking the most affordable solution for the business while doing your best to meet their needs.Mie-Yun Lee, BuyerZone.com'sfounder and vice president of strategic services, oversees the marketing, content development and customer care initiatives for the company.

/article/56064,Communicating Well With Employees,Employees not listening? Perhaps you need to take a closer look at your communications style.,"Q: I own a small medical services business. I have a problem getting some employees to follow new methods. The problem is that the old methods still work for these employees, but create more work for others. I have talked until I am blue in the face, and the problem still exists. Is there something I'm doing wrong?A: The third chapter in my book Bringing Out the Best in Peopleis titled ""Louder, Longer, Meaner."" It refers to the way most people try to get others to do what they want them to do. That is, they tell them over and over but vary the message or the intensity of it in hopes that one variation will bring about the desired action. Mothers around the world have learned that if you call a child by his full name, he'll respond better to a request. In reality, it's not using the full name or changing the tone of voice that gets the action. What causes the behavior to occur at that point, when other more gentle requests failed, is the fact that hearing the full name is the only request for action that is routinely associated with a consequence.Management literature has been obsessed with communication as the biggest problem in business when, in fact, it is the consequences that follow or don't follow the communication that are the problem. The clarity of the communication, the intensity with which it is delivered or even the extent that employees understand the message is not the problem. It is that what we say we are going to do and what we actually do are often at odds. For example, it might be that you told employees that they should use the new methods because it will make their work and that of others easier. However, because they are used to the old methods--and because the new ones take more time to learn and are more difficult to execute correctly in the early stages--they find excuses to continue to use the old ones. In other words, you said that their work would be easier, but their immediate experience is that it is not. You might have told them in your frustration that you will not accept procedures done the old way, but have found yourself not following through because of schedule demands of your customers.When introducing a change into the workplace, the first thing you should plan are the consequences for performing and the consequences for not performing. When I say consequences, I mean rather immediate consequences for the performer, not ""in the sky by and by"" consequences and not those that benefit the organization. When I use the word ""consequences,"" most managers think of negative ones. While there should be negative consequences for repeated failure to use new methods, you should focus on positive consequences for learning and using the new methods. Positive reinforcement should be for individual and group accomplishments. For example, write notes thanking those who are using the new methods and spend some time in the workplace asking individuals about how the new work is going. Plan a lunch when the entire office is using the new methods. Have a ceremony that buries the old method. In other words, have fun with it. If you spend the same amount of time delivering consequences as you do talking until you are blue in the face, I'm sure that you won't have a problem with compliance, and your job will be a lot less stressful as well.Aubrey C.

higher, they set it higher for the entire company.""When you're running a business, it's easy to focus on
employees who stand out the most, either in a good or a bad way.
Just 20 years ago, employers scoured their work forces for the
bottom 15 percent who were dragging down productivity. With the
tight labor markets of the late 1990s, all the attention switched
to recruiting and retaining the top 20 percent of any work force, a
trend that will only heat up again along with the economy, says
consultant Carol Kinsey Goman, owner of Kinsey Consulting Services
in Berkeley, California. But that leaves about 65 percent of your
workers overlooked while you develop your stars and prod
underperformers.""We probably take [regular performers] for granted,""
says Arlene Vernon, an HR consultant and founder of HRx Inc. in
Eden Prairie, Minnesota. ""These are the people who need more
attention. Without them, we're in trouble.""Stuck in the
Middle
""The people in the middle get lost, and they're the ones
with the capability and perhaps the desire [to do more],"" says
Joseph R. Weintraub, a management professor at Babson College in
Wellesley, Massachusetts, and co-author of The Coaching Manager: Developing Top Talent in
Business (Sage Publications).Workers playing supporting roles-assistants, administrative
personnel, part-timers-also lose out on growth opportunities.
""Employees can be seen as average because their contribution
isn't seen as key,"" Kinsey Goman says.Ignore these employees at your peril. Like middle child Jan
Brady whining ""Marcia, Marcia, Marcia,"" your middle
performers will get frustrated when they feel forgotten. Eventually
they'll quit, or worse, they'll stay but just quit
trying.Your solution is to use some good, old-fashioned management by
walking around. When was the last time you thanked a middle
performer for a job well-done? Acosta-Rubio looks constantly for
ways to single out the middle performers among his 17 employees.
Recently, he sent a letter and a $100 gift certificate to the
mother of a mid-level performer just to let her know how much
everyone values her son. ""You can't put a value on the
feeling I gave him by doing that,"" Acosta-Rubio says.At the same time, he keeps this salesperson motivated by
allowing him to train new salespeople. ""Selling may not be his
hot button, but contributing and feeling a part of it is,"" he
says. ""For a lot of employees, it's not the money,
it's the recognition, the ability to contribute.""Acosta-Rubio's efforts certainly aren't hurting the
company's bottom line: Sales have tripled yearly to $6
million.Find Some Middle
Ground
These types of rewards are crucial to motivating middle performers,
Vernon says, but keep your expectations reasonable. Not every
employee has the skills to be a top performer. Instead of grooming
a star, develop a happy employee who consistently performs well and
inspires co-workers to do their best--not a bad compromise.Acosta-Rubio is realistic. ""Am I always going to want my
[top] 70 percenters to be [top] 20 percenters? Of course. Am I
always going to cajole and motivate them? Of course. Is it going to
make a difference? Maybe,"" he says. ""If an employee
continues to improve even just a little bit, it doesn't matter
whether they're in the top 20 percent or 70 percent, you've
got a great employee.""Consider the benefits of shedding your bottom 10 percent, too.
Jack Welch did it, and so can you. You'll be able to spend more
time developing top performers and solid middle people. If you have
managers, they should be developing employees even more than
you.""Think, 'How do I design my work force so I have all
No. 2s and 3s--all good, steady employees--and then I have my
shining stars who will drive me forward?'"" Vernon
says.Acosta-Rubio has learned some lessons about managing the middle
performer. ""Your company isn't built on the rock
'n' roll superstars. It's led by them, but it's
built by the 70 percent,"" he says. ""Reward and
acknowledge their strengths."" You may find that it keeps you
from always going to extremes.Chris Penttila is

/article/55550,How to Set Starting Salaries,Determining the salaries of your company's founders will impact both funding and friendship.,"Q: I'm starting a company with two friends. I will be CEO; they will be the CTO and COO. Should we all have equal salaries, or should they be different? I have enough in my budget to pay each of us something in the low six figures.A: Setting salaries is an art, not a science. I've seen startups work great when each founding partner had an equal salary and equal share of the company. I've also seen startups work when there's great inequity between the partners. The question is: What criteria should you use to set the salaries?First, salaries shouldn't depend on experience--not in my book. Salaries should be related to management results. Spending 10 years running a company that never showed a profit should command a much lower salary than 10 years spent running a spectacularly successful company in a variety of market and competitive conditions.But I'd make an exception: At the end of the day, results are only somewhat under your control. If a candidate had managed an unprofitable business but claimed to have very high-quality management and operational processes, that could be a good sign. In that case, I would want very detailed presentations of the management processes, so I could decide whether or not I was willing to bet on those processes in my company.Salaries shouldn't be set based on a salary survey. In a cash-poor, startup environment, does it makes sense to pay anyone a six-figure salary? Prior to 1996, it was almost unheard of to pay six figures in a startup. You were expected to take a salary around 30 percent below market (assuming that still left you enough to live on) and do whatever it took to further conserve cash.Here are some more things to consider:Are executive salaries your best use of cash? Running a startup is all about cash flow and conserving cash. Salaries in the six figures are high enough so that each of you is being paid about double the salary of a relatively senior non-executive. In a startup, who's more important, the executives or the people executing (note that executives might execute)? If I were running a start-up and could afford six figures in my salary budget, I'd give myself $35K per year and spend the remaining money on two or three high-quality engineers, marketing people and so on. As the founder who stands to get rich if the company succeeds, my short-term cash needs should defer to the health of the company.What bets do those salaries demonstrate? Salaries in the six figures are excellent in the United States. Those salaries in your company would signal to me, ""These founders aren't betting on the company succeeding. They get a good deal no matter what happens.""Do those salaries make sense from a financing point of view? Even if you just pay yourselves less and keep the cash as a buffer against a rainy day (hint, hint), giving yourselves lower salaries means increasing your profit, which will make it easier to get financing in the future and make profitability easier to come by. And when or if you ever go public, public companies are typically valued as a multiple of earnings. If you save $1 by giving yourself $1 less in salary, and you go public at a multiple of 20, then you just got back $20 in market value in return for deferring that $1 in salary.Salary ConsiderationsWhen presented with job candidates for CEO, CTO and COO, how do you determine their salaries? If you try to argue them down, what arguments would you use? Would other, established companies value these same three people this highly for these same jobs? If not, then you may be overpaying them. 

If, however, your candidates have demonstrated the ability to perform at that level, then the salary is probably fine. (Though for cash-flow and bet-signaling reasons, I'd still take it as less cash plus more stock.) But if you haven't demonstrated that you can create $150K of value running something, it would be a very tough sell to persuade me that I, as your investor, should pay you that until you've shown that you're worth it.Do those salaries lock you into unfavorable positions politically? If you three get high salaries, you're setting a range for any executive-level person you bring in. It will be hard to hire someone for much cheaper, and someone coming in with twice your experience, even if they're ""just"" a VP, may feel (and be correct) that they deserve a higher salary than you, based on experience. For the health of the business, you may have to hire them and pay them that--which sets the baseline high and really limits your flexibility. Not to mention, if you're spending $500K on the top three salaries, will you even have anything left over to afford a top-flight management team?Whether salaries are the same or different depends on circumstances. Even if a survey says two positions get equal salaries, that isn't necessarily the best decision. From an investor perspective, salaries should be set for the optimal health of the company: Enough to ensure you guys won't starve or be too stressed out about money, but low enough to conserve cash and ensure that the founders share in the same risks the investors are taking.Should you set salaries by job titles? The answer is no. regardless of what's printed in his business card, the CEO of a new start-up isn't doing the same job as the president/CEO of a $10 million company. Set salaries based on how much each person is contributing to the firm. But if differing salaries would cause resentment or feelings of unfairness among the founders, then set them all the same. You can't afford that kind of emotional baggage in your working relationship.You should set salaries for the best working relationship and best business performance. In your shoes, I'd set three moderate, equal-base salaries at about $50K each. I'd want everyone to feel they were treated fairly, and no one to feel they were getting the same or a better deal than they'd get on the open employment market. If you want to reward people for the differences between their jobs, set up a bonus structure related to some combination of personal and group milestones. Keep the overall structure simple (salary plus bonus) and the bonus criteria simple enough so that the motivations and rewards are very clearly connected to each person's contribution.As the company grows, raise your salaries last. Use the extra money on building infrastructure, hiring people who will accelerate your growth, developing marketing campaigns and forging deals that will give you access to the channels you need. Once the business is healthy and thriving, then you can raise your salaries. If the business is successful, you'll be rich enough so it won't matter. But if the business isn't successful, you'll be demonstrating to investors that you have the ethics and business sense to align your interests with those of the people who put their faith in you.Stever Robbins is a venture coach, helping entrepreneurs and early-stage companies develop the attitudes, skills and capabilities needed to succeed.

/article/54952,Choosing an Employee Incentive Program,"With so many choices out there, how do you pick the best one for your business?","Q: How do you pick one incentive program over another? I've asked business associates what they do, and they're all over the map. One offers a cash incentive, another uses merchandise. Both say they work well. A third colleague says he doesn't offer any incentives and seems to do OK. Is there any objective data to tell which is the most effective?A: It is good that you are concerned about the question of incentives and rewards. A recent article in the Harvard Business Review (March-April 2000), ""Leadership That Gets Results,"" reported that of six leadership styles studied, the use of rewards was the single highest predictor of ""organizational climate,"" which in turn had a direct correlation with financial results.You are correct in your assessment of the variety of incentive plans in the workplace. Most of them are home-grown, and many business owners insist they produce positive effects. Of course, rough impressions like these are based on personal experiences, not scientific research.Dr. Alyce Dickinson of Western Michigan University has probably done more research on the issue of incentive effectiveness than anyone. In a recent review of her work and that of others in this field (""Individual Monetary Incentives: A Review of Different Types of Arrangements Between Performance and Pay,"" Journal of Organizational Behavior Management, Vol. 21, #3, 2001), Bucklin and Dickinson indicated that most of the common variations in incentive plans make no difference in performance. These variations include percent of base pay available as an incentive, whether the percent increases, decreases or stays the same for increasing performance, total amount that can be earned, or the per piece incentive amount. One of her studies showed that performance did not differ significantly whether the amount to be earned as an incentive was 3 percent or 100 percent of total pay. As her work seems to indicate, any incentive plan, regardless of its structure, is better than none at all. They also found that plotting results on a graph each day facilitated performance under incentive plans.To get the most out of any incentive plan, I would advise the following:Let the performers track their performance daily. The payout can be monthly, but feedback should be available daily.Separate incentive pay from regular pay. I would advise issuing separate checks and giving them out on different days.Consider non-cash incentives. These are not confused with ordinary pay and actually have advantages over cash. For further details, you may want to read about this in my book Performance Management: Improving Quality Productivity Through Positive Reinforcement, which is available at www.aubreydaniels.com.Individual incentives are more effective than group incentives. You may add an incentive for group accomplishments, but the plan should differentiate between individual contributions and accomplishments.Make sure that your day-to-day management is positive. No matter how much money you put into rewards, you'll waste both money and time if you use negative reinforcement as your management style. There's no substitute for daily contact with employees--asking how they're doing, asking if you can help with any problems and, most importantly, recognizing even small improvements.Systematically evaluate the effectiveness of your plan on performance, cost and employee satisfaction.Aubrey C.

/article/54444,Young Is Old,Maybe youthful energy can't quite top the experience that comes with age after all.,"						This story appears in the September 2002 issue of Entrepreneur. Subscribe  Riegsecker Marketplace Inc. has good employees. Founded by Mel
Riegsecker, this combination retailer, restaurant and furniture
manufacturing company in Sheshewana, Indiana, has a specific hiring
strategy. Part of what keeps this $13 million business successful,
Riegsecker says, is hiring people over age 50. A veteran
interviewer, he's turned off by the sometimes arrogant attitude
of recent grads vs. the experience, skill and solid work ethic of
the mature worker. When faced with such prospects, he says,
""It doesn't take me long to make a decision.""According to a report by Challenger, Gray & Christmas, job
search time for workers over 50 shortened last year, despite a
slump in overall hiring. Meanwhile, the National Association of
Colleges and Employers reports companies are hiring about 20
percent fewer graduates in 2002 than last year. The trend is fed by
the swell of aging baby boomers and the fact that one person turns
50 every six seconds, says Don Blohowiak, a workplace issues expert
and founder of the Lead Well Institute. ""These boomers
aren't ready to retire-they want active work, to make a
contribution.""Don't know where to find more seasoned workers? Riegsecker,
61, enlisted the help of Experience Works (www.experienceworks.org), a nonprofit organization
that offers training and employment services for mature workers as
well as a staffing service to place them in jobs.That doesn't mean young employees aren't a part of this
workplace trend. Riegsecker notes that his 27-year-old son, Ryan,
was mentored by and worked closely with a 60-year-old worker who
once managed the $894 million sales of a large corporation. Says

/article/54498,Woe Is the CFO,"These days, CFO may have more responsibility than the acronym was meant to handle. Does yours have what it takes to handle the scrutiny and the pressure?","						This story appears in the September 2002 issue of Entrepreneur. Subscribe  If you thought small-business CFOs weren't reeling from the
Enron implosion like the financial chiefs of their billion-dollar
brethren, you thought wrong. ""I definitely feel the
heat,"" says Arthur Tanner, CFO of Circle Group Internet Inc.,
a 34-employee Mundelein, Illinois, company that provides
capital-raising and consulting services to emerging-growth
companies.Tanner, who recently prepared his company for listing on the OTC
Bulletin Board, says the scrutiny from shareholders, regulators and
auditors has been intense. Where they once gave certain numbers a
cursory glance, ""now they're asking more and more
questions,"" says Tanner. ""Everybody was a little bit more
apprehensive than in the past, double-checking, triple-checking the
numbers."" As auditors scramble to rebuild their reputations,
they're putting more pressure on their clients. ""I have to
know the rules a lot better because there are going to be more
rules,"" says Tanner.Indeed. The post-Enron slew of proposals for regulatory reform
and accounting changes was only the beginning, despite the the fact
that, at press time, many of the proposed measures were not
expected to pass. ""I don't think we've seen the tip of
the iceberg as far as changes to accounting treatments that will
ripple through small companies,"" says Richard Brenner, CEO of
The Brenner Group Inc., a Cupertino, California-based company that
provides interim executive management.That will likely heap further complexity onto the role of the
CFO, which has been continuously evolving over the past three
decades. Once considered to be simply bean-counters, CFOs were
forced by the M&A craze of the 1980s to become deal
strategists; the '90s and the dotcom boom added
investor-relations savvy to the roster of required skills and
thrust finance chiefs into the celebrity spotlight.Enter the dotcom bust and the Enron fiasco, which have swung the
pendulum back toward a greater emphasis on traditional control and
planning. CFOs still have to wear many hats and demonstrate
superior financial acumen, but in an increasingly hostile,
zero-tolerance environment, they also must convince shareholders
and boards that they're pure as snow.""There's a lot of caution in the hiring process [for
CFOs],"" notes Michael Flannery, co-chief executive of Redwood
Partners, an integrated advisory firm in New York City that
provides executive search and venture capital services to growing
companies. ""We are getting requests to do many more background
checks, criminal checks, all sorts of different things to make sure
no one has to look over their shoulder down the line.""The caution is understandable. While smaller companies don't
have the same opportunity to do the extensive kind of
off-balance-sheet activity that led to Enron's demise, they can
still get into big trouble when the CFO operates below-board.
""If the CEO does not have a strong advocate and advisor to be
his conscience, he can run amok in a small company,"" says
Brenner. One or two wrong turns can erase shareholder value
quickly. ""And my shareholders care just as much about their
investment as Enron's shareholders do,"" says Tanner.Which is why many entrepreneurs are taking fewer chances on CFOs
who lack a full range of expert skills. Philip Livingston,
president and CEO of Financial Executives International in
Morristown, New Jersey, points out that Enron CFO Andy Fastow's
narrow specialty in finance was a weakness. ""When a person
[has advanced to the level of] CFO, they should have experience in
multiple areas of finance-that's accounting, budgeting,
planning, tax, treasury and investor relations,"" says
Livingston.That's a tall order, particularly for small-business CFOs.
""The CFOs of small companies today are really
super-comptrollers,"" says Brenner. Most of them, he adds, rose
through the accounting ranks to their current position. Brenner
contends a true CFO is a genuine business partner, not a historical
reporter or accountant. ""The CFO should be intimately involved
with and understand all the business decisions a company [will]
make to grow,"" says Brenner. ""His job is not just to talk
about the financial implications, but to participate in what the
impact of those strategic decisions will be.""How can you tell whether your CFO measures up? Larry Downes,
consultant and author of The Strategy Machine: Building Your
Business One Idea At a Time (HarperBusiness), advises giving a
quick quiz. ""Ask your CFO to tell you the last five legal or
regulatory changes they looked at to see if they had an impact on
how the company was doing its books,"" says Downes. ""If
they can't name five in the last two years, that's a
problem."" To test the CFO's knowledge of the company's
strategic mission-which he or she will need to use finance as a
competitive weapon-ask him or her to name the company's five
most valuable intellectual or information assets. ""If they say
'What's an information asset?' you know you have a
problem,"" says Downes. ""That's not the CFO you
want.""C.J. Prince is a New York City writer specializing in

/article/54412,Celebrate the Good Times,How to throw a shindig that thanks hard-working employees,"Q: My company is doing really well this year, and I'd like to reward my employees. But how do you pick one incentive program over another? I have business associates who tell me about what they do, and they're all over the map. One has a cash incentive, another uses merchandise. Both say they work well. A third colleague says he doesn't offer any incentives and seems to do OK. Is there any objective data to tell which is the most effective?A: Congratulations on a great year! I am pleased that you want to celebrate your success with your employees. I'm confident that companies that choose not to celebrate their successes will have fewer successes in the future.Most managers think that a celebration is all about food and drink. That's because from the first birthday cake, almost all our successes and milestones are associated with food and drink. However, if you really examine it, food and drink are just used to set the stage. The celebration is all about recounting what the person or persons did and how they did it. Celebrating in the locker room of the team that wins the World Series is always associated with lots of champagne, but what do they do with it? Most of it is shaken up and squirted on the other players. When the microphone is stuck in a player's face, what he begins to talk about is what the various players did that got them to the championship.I define a workplace celebration as ""an opportunity to relive an accomplishment."" It's an occasion for employees to talk about how hard they worked, how smart they were and how creative they were in achieving a goal. It is the manager's job to facilitate the reliving. Any tangible item given should only serve the purpose of anchoring a memory of the accomplishment. The item need not be expensive. The primary consideration in choosing an item as an anchor is how to make the item (whether it's a T-shirt, a cap or a coffee mug) something that your employees will keep as a memento in their pockets, on their desks or on their walls. While I say that the item doesn't need to be expensive, it certainly could be. It's just that giving expensive items is not necessary to have an effective celebration.Here's what I propose that you do. Get your employees together. Explain what was accomplished and its importance to you and the company. Make it brief--no more than five minutes. There is a negative correlation between the length of a management speech and the enjoyment of the celebration by the employees. End your speech by asking the group how they accomplished what they did. This starts the celebration. Make them feel comfortable by telling them that they can talk about what others did, as well as what they did. Give them time to respond. If employees are slow to talk, you may need to ask someone to tell the group something he or she did of which you have personal knowledge. In the beginning, people are often slow to respond, but as they see others participate, you'll have no trouble getting people to talk. If someone brings up a problem or makes a critical remark, respond by saying that this session is only about what was accomplished and that you'd be happy to discuss the problem at another time.Once everyone has had an opportunity to participate, you should bring out the item you've chosen as a memory anchor and say something like, ""By the way, in order to help you remember what we've accomplished, I have these personalized baseball caps for everyone.""I believe that if you think of a celebration in this way, you'll have many other occasions to celebrate in the future. And as I've always said, companies that don't celebrate success will eventually have no success to celebrate.Aubrey C.

/article/53608,Finding the Time to Lead,Don't have the time to cultivate good employees?  Make  time! You'll thank yourself later.,"It's a common complaint, one I hear from many of the entrepreneurs who read my book on leadership: ""I know I ought to work on communications, employee morale, and training and development issues, but I simply don't have the time. I'm too busy doing my own work to invest in leading my employees to higher levels of performance in their work.""Hold everything! If you are one of the many who struggle to get through your pile of work, consider this: The more leadership you provide, the less work you'll have to do yourself, and the more able and productive your people will be. In fact, at the risk of irritating already-stressed entrepreneurs and managers, I'd hazard a guess that anyone who feels overwhelmed by their work today is not doing everything they can to lead their people. Because ideally (and it's not that unrealistic of an ideal), the main job of the leader is to lead, not to crank out the work himself or herself.Learn MoreClick herefor tips on making the most of your busy days.How do you move closer to this ideal? Sears Credit recently revamped the job descriptions of all their managers and supervisors, who are now expected to spend the majority of their time on employee development. That's a radical thought, isn't it? If you spent the majority of your days helping your employees get better at their work, would your in box soon be empty? Maybe!Experts tell me there are many ways to ride a horse, and most of them are wrong. Amateur riders find themselves bumping and sliding around, setting up contrary motions that make the ride terribly uncomfortable and waste a lot of energy. That is a pretty good metaphor for how most of us wrestle with time, especially at work. And this problem is most acute for workplace leaders, who not only need to manage their own time well, but also need to make sure their employees are efficient and effective. Time seems to be the thing that every leader values most and has the least of. Time is leadership's most limited resource.Time management expert Dick Cipoletti and I have been talking about this problem and what to do about it, and his advice falls into the category of learning to ride the horse more easily and naturally rather than trying to force it to go faster or farther than it can.For instance, business leaders are plagued by interruptions. They receive hundreds of calls or e-mails each day, and employees often seek their advice or assistance. When asked, these time-pressured managers can't even recall where the time went. The day seems to slip by as they put out time fires, until whatever they might have wanted to do is long since forgotten.A simple trick can improve the situation: Write down your one most important goal for the day, then work on it first thing in the morning before allowing interruptions. Schedule visitors to come back at the end of this focused work period if need be. If the leader clocks an hour or two of focused work on his or her key project or problem, then the rest of the day can often be given over to answering questions and helping employees be productive without that panicked feeling that you aren't doing what you need to.Also, don't rescue employees by doing a task after they mess it up. Teach them the right way, even if it takes twice as long, then you won't have to do it for them again tomorrow. (""Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach him to fish and you feed him for a lifetime."")Another trick is to recognize that your work style can be a source of chaos and lost time for you, and possibly for your employees as well. Many entrepreneurs are either highly creative (read: disorganized--that's my problem), or the opposite, highly organized and systematic. Either way, we rely on our relatively extreme qualities to build our businesses.You gotta be a bit crazy to be an entrepreneur after all! But when we impose our style on a business and its employees, we may be forcing many of them to work in ways that don't feel natural and thus create friction and wasted time.

/article/52686,Fire Proof,A thorough investigation is the only way to build a case against problem employees.,"						This story appears in the July 2002 issue of Entrepreneur. Subscribe  Rumors are flying. Everyone in the office is talking about a
fellow employee stealing supplies, taking drugs or using office
computers to run a porn Web site. Time to check it out and take
action.But not too fast. ""Before disciplining anyone for
misconduct, conduct a full and fair investigation,"" says Jeff
Pasek, an attorney specializing in employment law with Cozen
O'Connor in Philadelphia. That way, you'll have an
excellent defense if you end up in court. The opposite is also
true: A jury hearing that you fired someone after false accusations
and a slapdash investigation may be more sympathetic to the
ex-employee.In one case, food products were disappearing from a
retailer's warehouse, and a security guard reported seeing a
supervisor eat a bag of chips from the inventory. The retailer
promptly fired the supervisor, without talking with her or checking
with other witnesses. Worse, when gossip started spreading,
employees were told the woman had been fired for stealing.The woman sued, claiming defamation, and the jury awarded her
$90,000 in compensatory damages and $1.4 million in punitive
damages. While the verdict was later overturned by an appellate
court on a legal technicality, Pasek contends that the case remains
a textbook example of how not to conduct an investigation.Doing It RightSo how do you investigate properly? ""I don't think
there's ever been a perfect investigation,"" Pasek says.
""The issue is how to do it well enough."" He offers the
following suggestions:Plan in advance how you'll handle
an investigation should the need arise. ""That way,
you won't have to scramble in crisis mode,"" Pasek
says.Appoint an objective party to
investigate. This may seem obvious, but Pasek has seen
cases where the subject of a sexual harassment complaint was
appointed to investigate.Investigate promptly and
thoroughly. In cases of harassment, prompt action can
protect you from liability. ""If a company doesn't act
quickly on a complaint, it can be held liable, even if the
harassing conduct had stopped before management took action,""
Pasek says.Be objective and fair.
""Imagine the case before a jury,"" Pasek says.
""People decide these cases, and they will expect your tactics
to pass the test of fairness.""Unless it compromises the
investigation, tell the employee what's going on and allow a
response.Don't compromise an employee's
reasonable expectation of privacy. Informing employees
in advance that you retain the right to investigate misconduct
eliminates this expectation.Don't share your suspicions or the
results of the investigation with third parties.
Breaching confidentiality is inviting a defamation lawsuit.If high-level executives are part of
the problem, hire an outside investigator. Otherwise, an
employee assigned to investigate may fear reprisals.Take a lesson from Enron and Arthur
Andersen. If the problem is financial high jinks,
don't assign the investigation to someone from accounts payable
or from the accounting firm that advises your business.Interview witnesses effectively and
document everything. Cover what occurred, where and when
it happened, who was involved, and whether it could have been
avoided. Be consistent in what you ask and what you do with the
information.If the employee requests
representation, don't proceed without it.The list of cautions may be daunting, but doing it right can
fend off liability that could be worse than the original
problem.Steven C. Bahls, dean of Capital University Law School in

/article/53160,Absentee Ownership: How Do You Manage?,"Even if you don't want to personally manage the business you bought as an investment, you may still have to step in when things go awry.","Q: I own a fitness center. I bought it as an investment. I am not a fitness trainer. My problem is that I have heard through the grapevine that the center manager is creating poor morale among the trainers and having run-ins with customers, causing some of them to drop their memberships. I have not witnessed any problems directly. I don't want to manage the center and I can't think of anyone to replace her. Do you have any suggestions?A: I have some suggestions, but I'm not sure you want to hear them. The reason is that they all involve more direct involvement and personal time than you want to spend to solve your problem. First, let me say that it sounds like your manager is using fear and intimidation as a primary management tool. I say that because your employees apparently don't feel they can approach you even indirectly about the problem. If this is the case, you have a serious problem.Next Step It pays to hire top talent. For easy-to-follow tips and techniques, read Attracting and Rewarding Outstanding Employees: How to get and keep the best and brightest talentby David Rye.My first recommendation is that you find out for yourself whether the reports you have heard are from one employee or whether they are shared by other trainers. I suggest that you set up one-on-one meetings to talk with your employees. This will open the door to more direct communication and make it much easier for them to tell you how they feel about working for the manager. Next, you should call customers who have left the center and conduct a post-exit interview. These discussions should also provide you with valuable information about the state of affairs at your fitness center. It may also be a wise idea to contact current customers to gauge their satisfaction with their current memberships. Taking these steps--communicating directly with employees and past and current customers--should help you pinpoint the cause of the problem. If you find it is merely one disgruntled employee, you have a fairly simple problem. However, because the report came to you in such a roundabout way, I suspect it is more widespread.If it does turn out that the problems at your fitness center can be traced to the manager, you must deal with the situation quickly. Be aware that since you don't relish the involvement, your tendency will be to give it a superficial investigation, giving more weight to the manager's explanation of the facts than the other sources. This could be a costly mistake. If she is the problem, she is already costing you money. If you wait to solve the problem, she will also cost you a lot of time.Learn More Do you need to fire a problem employee? Understanding your legal obligations can help you stay out of court.Assuming that she is the problem, it will be very difficult for you to correct her management style by absentee management. You must be present several days per week for several months and devote yourself to rebuilding her management methods through a systematic system of positive reinforcement.If you cannot, or do not want to, spend that amount of time on the problem, you need to replace her as soon as possible. If that is the direction you decide to take (which, in your situation, may in fact be a more practical solution), my advice would be to choose wisely. You may even want to hire a professional consultant to help you identify and hire the right person. Throughout the process, keep in mind that an experienced manager who understands the power of positive reinforcement will turn complaints into compliments and workplace woes into satisfied customers and employees--all factors that will keep your investment successful.Aubrey C.

/article/52966,Proper Payroll When an Employee Leaves,How soon are you required to pay a former employee's wages?,"Q: Within what time frame is an employer required to pay an employee wages owed if the employee quits? Does the answer change if the employee is terminated?A: Federal law does not set a deadline for the payment of accrued wages, commissions or salaries when an employee is separated from employment. However, states can--and do--adopt their own laws with respect to the timely payment of wages upon termination of employment.For example, in Arizona, an employee that is terminated must be paid all wages due within three working days from the date of discharge, or the next regular payday, whichever comes first. When an employee resigns, he is entitled to receive his wages no later than the next regular payday, and if the employee so requests, the employer must pay the employee by mail.By comparison, in California, in most cases, if an employer discharges an employee, any wages earned but unpaid at the date of discharge must be paid immediately. If an employee resigns, he must be paid his final wages no later than 72 hours after quitting. And in New York, the employer must pay an employee's unpaid wages on the regular payday for the pay period during which the termination or resignation occurs.Next Step Your best employee just told you he's decided to resign. Here are some suggestionson how to handle the bad news. 

 Brush up on your knowledge of legal matters in the workplace with The American Bar Association Guide to Workplace Law: Everything You Need to Know About Your Rights As an Employee or Employerby Barbara J. Fick and the American Bar Association.Because each state is different, employers must check their particular state's laws regarding the timely payment of wages. Employers must also check their particular state's laws with respect to what actually constitutes ""wages"". For instance, in some states, vacation pay is considered to be earned wages. Therefore, any earned vacation pay must be included in the final payment to the employee within the time frame provided by that state's laws. The same is true regarding severance pay. Some states consider severance pay to be part of an employee's earned wages, while others do not.Another issue employers often have to consider when an employee is separated from employment is whether or not they're allowed to withhold money from an employee's paycheck for property belonging to the employer, such as equipment or uniforms. Again, whether or not certain deductions are allowed is governed, in part, by state law. Regardless of what a particular state law requires, employers must also be sure to comply with federal wage and hour law regarding minimum wage whenever making any deductions or withholdings.In sum, the time frame within which an employer must pay an employee wages at separation of employment is governed by individual state laws. Employers must also consult their state laws with respect to what constitutes wages and permissible deductions.Note: The information in this column is provided by the author, not Entrepreneur.com.

/article/51900,On Their Own,Give your independent thinkers space--but not enough to get lost in.,"						This story appears in the June 2002 issue of Entrepreneur. Subscribe  Ask employers what kind of person they'd like to hire, and
you'll hear some familiar phrases: ""A go-getter.""
""A self-starter."" ""Someone who can take the ball and
run with it."" Now you've hired an employee that fits the
bill, and things aren't going so smoothly. What's the
problem?Steve Seiden thinks he knows. Seiden is CEO and director of
marketing at Acquired Data Solutions Inc., an 11-employee
engineering contracting firm in Alexandria, Virginia. He recalls
hiring one ambitious, confident and independent-minded employee.
""He wanted to figure out [the job] on his own,"" Seiden,
34, says. So Seiden let him do his own thing, thinking he could
handle it.As time went on, however, Seiden noticed that the employee
wasn't working out. The independent thinker set his own
deadlines and used valuable time researching project manuals rather
than bouncing problems off co-workers for quick answers.
Seiden's $1 million company was billing projects by the hour,
and the employee's independence was becoming a bane to repeat
business--the lifeblood of any start-up. Eventually, Seiden began
to micromanage the employee. ""It was a bad decision,""
Seiden says. ""It was difficult for him to understand.""
The relationship was over within a few months.Had Seiden made a mistake? ""[Independent thinkers] need to
feel they're in charge of what they do, when they do it and how
they do it,"" says Barbara Moses, president of BBM Human
Resource Consultants Inc. in Toronto and author of The Good News
About Careers: How You'll Be Working in the Next Decade
(Jossey-Bass), which contains information about various employee
work styles. ""The worst thing you can do is try to control
them.""Results Are inSo how do you manage and motivate an employee who is working for
you but needs to control his or her job? Focus on the ends and not
the means. ""Give these people macrostructure, not
microstructure,"" Moses says. Talk about the milestones you
want to reach, but let the employee decide how to get there. Other
gestures, such as allowing employees to decide on the pace for
reporting and planning sessions, also help make them feel
empowered.The control issue is often daunting for entrepreneurs. Daniel
Miller, 41, has started two companies and now runs a third called
BizTank LLC, a Sarasota, Florida, strategic planning firm that
works with start-ups. He remembers employing an independent
salesperson when he started his first company in the 1990s. ""I
was threatened by him doing his own thing,"" he says. ""It
took several months for us to reach a balance.""Miller should have sat down with the employee right off to
discuss roles and expectations and how often they would
communicate. Once they finally did, the work went more smoothly.
""To do this all upfront is challenging,"" he says.
""But if you [do], everyone knows how much control and
flexibility they have. Within structure, there's
freedom.""When creating that structure, assign small amounts of
responsibility and increase them quickly as employees prove they
can handle it, says Jana Matthews, president and CEO of Boulder
Quantum Ventures in Boulder, Colorado, and co-author of Leading
at the Speed of Growth: Over 500 Entrepreneurs Reveal the Secrets
of Successful Leadership and Sustained Growth (Hungry Minds).
Make sure workers understand they're a part of a team, not
desperados riding the entrepreneurial range. Matthews suggests
praising them for their independence and rewarding them for their
sense of teamwork when they keep everyone in the loop.What's Your
Motivation?Your independent employee will force you to confront your own
delegation style, so know where you fall on the scale. Your level
of delegation may be the simple ""just keep me in the
loop"" or you may want daily progress reports. You may need to
change your style to avoid conflicts and work more effectively with
an independent worker.And don't be skimpy with feedback. Just like everyone else,
independent employees want to know how they're doing. Seiden
has learned to ease them into the job to see how they develop
relationships before letting them spread their wings. Then he takes
a hands-off approach, checking in once a week and staying focused
on results. ""It's how you create the checks and balances
that let you understand how they're performing,"" says
Seiden. But once you get it, managing your independent go-getter
may be one of your most satisfying management experiences.Chris PenttilaChris Penttila is a Washington, DC-based freelance journalist who covers workplace issues on her blog, Workplacediva.blogspot.com.Read more",Growth Strategies,2002-06-01 00:00:00
/article/52008,Leading in the Splash Zone,Ken Blanchard's  Whale Done!  proves the power of positive reinforcement with your employees.,"I just finished reading one of those little ""pop"" management books that so often prove to have a lot more sizzle than steak (or perhaps I should say more odor than cheese?). But this one was quite the opposite--a real gem that I can recommend whole-heartedly. The book's lead author is Ken Blanchard (who also wrote The One Minute Manager), and the title is Whale Done!: The Power of Positive Relationships.You'll know it by the leaping killer-whale icon on the cover. (See, I warned you it was a ""pop"" treatment, but stick with me here--it's not as goofy as you might think.) Blanchard has a genuine interest in performing killer whales, and I've heard him weave interesting lessons about whale training into his management teachings before. Why killer whales? Because you simply cannot use many of the standard management techniques with them. If you do, they'll eat you.Killer whales don't suffer negative feedback as patiently as employees do. They cannot be trained through punishment. This means their trainers must work entirely with positive reinforcement of good behavior--and Blanchard's conviction is that this emphasis on good performance is the stuff great performances are made of. With increased emphasis on ""catching people doing something right,"" as Blanchard likes to say, it becomes less and less necessary to catch anyone doing anything wrong.Learn MoreRead our personal interview with Ken Blanchardfrom the June issue of Entrepreneur magazine.But keep in mind that Blanchard's approach involves plenty of focused attention on employee (or whale) performance. You don't just let them do what they want. You need to jump into the water with them and work routinely on their performances. In Blanchard's view, the manager needs to be involved in setting performance standards and drawing attention to them through active recognition of good work. And then if it proves necessary to supplement this positive recognition, the manager may occasionally need to correct poor work in a positive way that focuses on what needs to be done.For fans of The One Minute Manager, this advice may feel familiar. Blanchard revisits and expands on some of his fundamental teachings about goal-setting and feedback in this book, and I recommend managers do the same. A quick brush-up on these essential management skills is always helpful.But the most exciting idea in Whale Done! may be the observation from killer whale trainers that you cannot teach them to perform until you have gained their trust--or, as the book puts it, until they know you mean them no harm. To build trust, the trainer starts by spending time in the water with a new whale. They play together and develop some ground rules for communicating. This essential first step--creating a positive relationship by spending time with or near the whale--parallels my own findings about management. Often, business leaders struggle to improve performance when the underlying foundations of performance are shaky. In the workplace, too, we must make sure we create the right conditions for great performances. How do you do that?First, get in the water with your employees, or at least be willing to spend time near enough to the water that you can get a real feel for what they do. The ""splash zone"" is the section of seats right next to the pool at a killer whale show, and that's where managers need to be in order to make a real connection with their employees. In my work, we call this factor overlap and define it as time spent in meaningful interactions with your employees. Modern work pressures and technologies reduce overlap to the point that employees feel they hardly know their leaders--and so cannot be sure they mean them no harm.Second, share enthusiasm. Blanchard observes that there is a lot of positive energy when those killer whales perform. They enjoy working with their trainers and putting on their shows, therefore they work hard and well. A positive, can-do attitude is an essential foundation for good performance. Managers often need to attend to their own attitudes first--don't waste that overlap time by spreading your own stress or negativity! Also, think about the emotional message of the workplace itself--is it an up, warm, exciting place to work, or a dull, depressing one? I am sure the folks at SeaWorld would never try to put on a killer whale show in a dirty tank. Environment matters a lot, yet is often overlooked by business leaders.Once you have established a trust-based relationship with good communications and plenty of overlap, and once you have made sure the general emotional climate is positive and not negative, you will find it a lot easier to set challenging goals and give people positive feedback as they pursue them. The right conditions make peak performance far easier to attain.And if you find yourself struggling with inadequate performances or performers, think for a moment about those killer whales and their trainers--and remember to get back in the splash zone and rebuild the emotional foundations of success. These are the essential conditions you need to move ahead toward any business goal that requires the participation of your employees.Alex Hiamis a trainer and consultant and the author ofMotivating & Rewarding Employees: New and Better Ways to Inspire Your Peopleas well asMarketing for Dummies.

/article/51084,Kids These Days,Senior staff hopelessly out of date? Younger mentors can help them keep up.,"						This story appears in the May 2002 issue of Entrepreneur. Subscribe  One of the most valuable things Judy Kirpich has learned is that
some of the best ideas come from people who were barely born when
she started in marketing 23 years ago. ""I routinely get
technology information from younger employees who have grown up on
computers,"" says the 49-year-old CEO and co-founder of Grafik
Marketing Communications Inc. in Alexandria, Virginia.What Kirpich is doing is reverse mentoring--matching younger
employees who know a lot about the Internet, wireless commerce or
some other field with senior managers who aren't so up on the
latest digital domains. Joining youthful insight with elder
influence can have long-lasting benefits. Kirpich says she was cool
to technology in the 1980s, but invested in computers at the urging
of the younger set in her company. ""If I hadn't listened
to the younger people,"" says Kirpich, ""we'd be out of
business.""Reverse mentoring has probably been around forever, but it first
became a mainstream idea a few years ago when General
Electric's then-CEO, Jack Welch, ordered several hundred of his
top managers to hook up with younger employees to learn about the
Internet. Since then, reverse mentoring has been seen as useful for
managing intergenerational differences at work, understanding
younger consumers and generally fishing around for new ideas.The OutsidersKeys to successful reverse mentoring include training the mentor
to be patient and restricting his or her advice to the relevant
topic, says Jerry Wind, a professor at the University of
Pennsylvania's Wharton School, who oversees a reverse mentoring
program matching entrepreneurs and other executives with MBA
student mentors. Privacy and confidentiality are also important for
CEOs who don't wish to be seen as depending on tips from from
employees with less experience. Partially for that reason, Wind
says mentors should come from outside the organization. Using
outsiders also avoids issues with other employees who see a junior
worker getting special access to the executive suite.For Kirpich, reverse mentoring has both informal and formal
aspects. She gets information about the latest software and systems
by simply unceremoniously asking questions of younger staffers she
thinks might know the answer. She also encourages and receives
unsolicited tips. The formal, public component involves inviting
younger employees to stage presentations for all members of the
company, at which they can pass on design ideas, technological
innovations or other information.But reverse mentoring isn't always especially useful. For
example, it can't help cope with a recession, Kirpich notes,
because younger employers haven't experienced one. She also
doesn't plan to seek advice on client presentations, selling,
finance or long-term strategy from her younger workers.Reverse mentoring is probably unappreciated by most
entrepreneurs, says Matt Starcevich, a Bartlesville, Oklahoma,
executive coach and mentoring trainer. Starcevich found little
reverse mentoring occurring when he conducted an online survey on
the topic last year. One reason may be that people do it without
officially naming it ""mentoring,"" but Starcevich also
suspects that many reverse mentoring initiatives withered because
they lacked clear goals and adequate structure. ""The idea is
good, but it needs help,"" he says.For her part, Kirpich sees reverse mentoring as permanently
embedded in the way Grafik does business. She fears, however, that
entrepreneurs may be biased against taking advice from
twentysomething tech experts as part of a backlash from the
bursting dotcom bubble. ""That would be a tremendous
harm,"" she says, ""if people are so jaded by the dotcom
experience that they cut out that younger voice.""The Center for Coaching and
Mentoring has online survey results and discussions about reverse
mentoring at www.coachingandmentoring.com.",Growth Strategies,2002-05-01 00:00:00
/article/51176,The Requirements of FMLA Compliance,Avoid legal problems by providing employees with the leave they're entitled to.,"Q: I employ approximately 75 people. Do I need to comply with the Family and Medical Leave Act? And if so, what does that entail?A: The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 generally requires private-sector employers with 50 or more employees to provide up to 12 workweeks of unpaid, job-protected leave, within any 12-month period, to eligible employees for certain family and medical reasons. Covered employers are also required to maintain eligible employees' pre-existing group health insurance coverage during the leave and to restore eligible employees to the same or an equivalent position at the conclusion of the FMLA leave.To be eligible for FMLA benefits, an employee must:work for a covered employerhave worked for the employer for at least 12 monthshave worked at least 1,250 hours over the previous 12 monthswork at a location in the United States or in any territory or possession of the United States where at least 50 employees are employed by the employer at a single work site, or at multiple work sites within a range of 75 milesEligible employees may be entitled to take FMLA leave for any of the following reasons:The birth and care of a newborn child of the employeePlacement with the employee of a child for adoption or foster careCare for an immediate family member (spouse, child or parent) with a serious health conditionWhen the employee is unable to work because of a serious health conditionBoth the employer and the employee have notice requirements under the FMLA. Specifically, employees seeking to use FMLA leave are required to provide 30 days' advance notice of the need to take FMLA leave when the need is foreseeable and such notice is practicable. The notice from the employee can be verbal. However, the employer may request that employees comply with its customary and usual notice and procedural requirements for requesting leave.Next Step Learn more about legal matters with Employment Law for Businessby Dawn Bennett-Alexander and Laura Pincus Hartman. Need some help choosing a lawyer? Click here.Employers may also require employees to provide medical certification supporting the need for leave due to a serious health condition, second or third medical opinions (at the employer's expense) and periodic recertification, and periodic reports during FMLA leave regarding the employee's status and intent to return to work.As for the employers' notice requirements, employers must advise the employee on whether he or she is eligible for FMLA leave within two days of making the eligibility determination and prior to the date the requested leave is to begin. If the employer fails to do so, the employee will be deemed eligible.An employer may not designate FMLA leave retroactively. That is, absence preceding the notice to the employee of the designation of the leave as FMLA leave may not be counted against the employee's 12-week FMLA leave entitlement.Some important miscellaneous provisions of the FMLA:Spouses employed by the same employer are jointly entitled to a combined total of 12 work-weeks of family leave for the birth and care of a newborn child, for placement with the employees of a child for adoption or foster care, and to care for a parent who has a serious health condition.Under some circumstances, employees may take FMLA leave intermittently--which means taking leave in blocks of time, or by reducing their normal weekly or daily work schedule.Although most employees are entitled to be returned to the same or an equivalent position at the conclusion of their FMLA leave, employers can deny job restoration to a salaried employee who is among the highest paid 10 percent of the employer's workforce, if that person is considered a ""key employee."" However, this designation must occur at the time the leave is designated.This article only addresses some of the basic requirements of the FMLA. If an employer makes the determination that it is covered by the FMLA, whether or not any of its individual employees is actually entitled to FMLA leave will depend on the particular circumstances of the employee seeking leave and will require specific case-by-case analysis. If an employer believes it is covered by the FMLA but it is not currently complying with the FMLA, or if an employer believes it will be soon be covered by the FMLA due to growth in the company, it should seek professional advice to ensure compliance.Note: The information in this column is provided by the author, not Entrepreneur.com.

/article/49854,Keep the Faithful,"Is it better to cut positions or just salaries? . . . and carry the eight . . . wait, stop calculating and think of employee morale.","						This story appears in the April 2002 issue of Entrepreneur. Subscribe  Last summer, sales were slowing at ChatSpace Inc., a 25-employee
technology company in Carlsbad, California. The company's
corporate customers were holding back on purchases, waiting to see
where the economy was headed. Although ChatSpace had a history of
strong growth, by mid-July it was clear that the company wasn't
going to hit its third-quarter projections. Two of its sales
positions were eliminated, and by mid-August the company faced the
prospect of making deeper staff cuts. But rather than go through
further layoffs, ChatSpace went with a new strategy: Everyone took
a temporary 10 percent pay cut until the company could get back on
track.""The 10 percent pay cut is roughly equivalent to two and a
half people that we would have had to eliminate out of the
group,"" says Eric Olinger, 37, president and CEO of the
3-year-old company. ""There was no one we didn't need and
didn't want to keep.""This attitude is a far cry from the downturn of 1990-91, when
employers didn't waste time trimming employee rosters to cut
costs. With all the money they've put into recruiting and
retaining talent, however, laying off people hurts employers more
today than it used to. So some are keeping their people by
postponing or lowering raises, bonuses, base salaries and
profit-sharing plans until their situations improve.Cutting UpThe trend is already surfacing in the corporate world. A survey
released in November by The Conference Board found that more than
40 percent of large companies planned to hold back on raises
throughout 2002, and some had decided to reduce or eliminate
bonuses and matching contributions to employee 401(k) accounts.Even in this new employer's market, however, entrepreneurs
fear taking this type of decision to their employees. When Olinger
and his management team met with ChatSpace's staff to outline
the reasons behind the temporary pay reduction and to explain the
company's recovery plan, he expected employees to start looking
for other jobs. But the reaction was better than he expected. No
one left. ""I was anticipating the worst, but people accepted
it,"" he says. ""I heard a few people talking about how
[the pay reduction] was saving deeper layoffs.""Paying less can present challenges if you've got a
structured performance plan in place, however. You'll need to
look at any paperwork and manuals that would create ""even a
quasi-contract"" toward benefits and pay, says Allan Weitzman,
an employment and labor partner with Proskauer Rose in Boca Raton,
Florida. Be wary of handbooks that don't reserve your right to
alter pay and benefit structures. Also review any correspondence
with employees that may have implied certain pay and benefits.
""Even an offer letter can come back to haunt you,""
Weitzman says. Speak with your accountant and attorney before
making any pay cuts.The Big PayoffA temporary pay reduction may have a quicker impact on the
bottom line. ""If you pay three or four months of severance,
it's going to take you four or five months to actually realize
the savings because you're continuing your business with a
leaner work force and your payroll hasn't changed,"" says
Bill Coleman, vice president of compensation for career Web site
Salary.com. ChatSpace didn't see any cost savings from its two
layoffs for at least three months, Olinger says. But the pay cut,
combined with a reorganization of the company's marketing and
travel expenditures, created immediate cost savings that helped the
company remain profitable in the third quarter. ""If we had not
done the pay cuts, we would have run a loss,"" he says. With
the pay cuts, company sales were a healthy $2.8 million last
year.So how do you explain a pay reduction to employees looking for
the message behind the action? First, don't let it look like a
punishment, and be fair across the board. Nothing's worse in an
entry-level employee's eyes than knowing he took a pay cut
while management is still receiving regular raises and bonuses.
Management should take the same cut, if not more. Second, be honest
about the market forces that are hurting your bottom line and how
you'll work as a team to get salaries and benefits back to
normal. Don't make promises that you can't keep, though.
Saying that a pay reduction will only last 30 days when it drags on
for months will damage morale. It's best to give yourself some
flexibility. ""Communicate with employees that we'll come
back together [after a specified period] and tell you where things
stand and what we expect to see at that point,"" Coleman
says.ChatSpace's 10 percent pay reduction lasted 45 days. While
Olinger says the company is still ""a little behind"" where
it would like to be with payroll and bonuses-it deepened the
reductions on senior management salaries during the fourth quarter
of last year-just getting employees back up to their original
salary levels has been a ""strong vote of confidence,""
Olinger says.""The company didn't lose anything because of the salary
reduction, and yet it expended less cash,"" Olinger continues.
""That's always a good scenario.""Chris PenttilaChris Penttila is a Washington, DC-based freelance journalist who covers workplace issues on her blog, Workplacediva.blogspot.com.Read more",Growth Strategies,2002-04-01 00:00:00
/article/50412,Effective Employee Reward Programs,"Don\'t just depend on ""of the month"" awards. Let employees know why they\'re being rewarded.","Q: Do ""Employee of the Month"" programs work? My competitors have them, but since my shop is rather small (25 employees), I'm not sure I should do it. What do you think?A: Employee of the Month programs are the most popular form of employee recognition in business today. Although they are, for the most part, good faith efforts by management to increase recognition, in my experience they create more problems than they solve.Many managers naively believe that EOM programs cause poor performers to try harder. While they may try a little harder at first, if they don't get the award within a couple of months, not only will they stop trying to get it, but the whole idea will also become very negative to them.The real problem with EOM is that one person's success creates another person's failure, and if the award is truly desirable, it creates destructive internal competition. It distresses me that schools have copied this horrible practice of management. Bumper stickers proclaim, ""My Child is Student of The Month at Midtown Elementary."" This does little to motivate students and certainly does nothing to promote teamwork and cooperation among classmates. It does no more for employees.These programs ultimately become a ""pass around."" Eventually everyone gets it. Of course, this breaks any connection between performance and reward so that employees know that all they really have to do is to wait long enough and they will eventually get it.In order to determine whether you should start an EOM, program just ask yourself two questions: 1) How many employees will be positively reinforced by this program? 2) How many will be punished by it? The answer to the first question is, at most, one. The answer to the second one is, many! Here is a good rule to follow: Never institute a process or program that potentially punishes more people than it reinforces.Next Step Learn how to recognize your employees without spending a bundle in ""Rewarding Employees."" 

Motivating and Rewarding Employeesby Alex Hiam will help you treat your top performers right.I have said it many times. EOM violates every known principle of effective positive reinforcement. It is not specific. People don't know what they did to get it. It is not immediate. The behavior that earned it could have occurred over a month ago and may no longer be occurring. It is not contingent on high performance. The award can be given even if everyone is performing poorly. There will still be a best performer. It is not frequent. Since only one person gets it a month, there are only 12 occasions in a year to recognize good performance. Positive reinforcement should be a daily occurrence.My advice: If you don't have an EOM program, don't start one. If you have one, get rid of it as soon as possible. In its place, institute a program where everyone can win. In other words, set a criterion for the award and recognize all who attain it. In bowling, for example, patches are awarded for any bowler who scores 500 points in three games. The team captain wants to award all the team members a patch every week. Of course they don't all get one every week. However, the captain will do whatever he can to help all achieve the recognition. Remember, your job is to help everyone become a winner.Aubrey C.

/article/50022,When You're the Butt of the Joke.,Should you talk to your employees about the jokes they make about you or just let it go?,"Q: I
recently overheard some of my employees making jokes about me, and
I don't think this was an isolated incident. It's not like
I can fire my entire staff for mocking me. I know business
isn't a popularity contest and I'm the ""boss,""
but I can't stop thinking about this incident. I want my
employees to like and respect me. Should I forget about this and go
on, business as usual, or should I talk to them about it?A: A
little touchy are we? Well, we wouldn't suggest you forget
about it, but certainly don't make a federal case of it,
either. You don't want to turn what may be some harmless fun
into a witch-hunt. All of us in positions of responsibility are the
subject of jokes and idle gossip from time to time. To put you a
little at ease: Consider the person you believe to be the most
influential person in the country, then imagine if that person has
ever been the butt of jokes. If you're thinking of the same
person we are, the answer is yes, he has been on the receiving end.
And it's not just the current resident of the White House, but
every president who ever served the United States. Most of the time
it's merely been good fun to get a laugh--take someone's
weaknesses and exaggerate them.We'd bet the same thing is happening at your company.
You're the ""boss,"" as you said, and therefore the
most likely target. In our experience, jokes made at the expense of
equal or subordinate employees tend to be malicious or
mean-spirited, while jokes aimed at the boss tend to be the
employees' way of blowing off a little steam.However, as economists are famous for saying, you could have a
problem that requires your tactful intervention. You didn't
mention the nature of the jokes you overheard. If they were merely
water-cooler jokes aimed at you, forget it--you're being too
sensitive. But if they really were not jokes, but serious attacks
on your character or management abilities, action is warranted.Next Step

Greatest Managers Do Differently by Marcus Buckingham and

 Before you send your New Management packing, make
sure you're the one with the problem.The first action is always self-examination. Were the things
said about you true at any level? If so, it's your duty to
correct your own behavior or decisions that adversely affect the
workgroup. As a manager, you have many perks and privileges; two
rights you don't have are to bring personal problems to work or
show favoritism, at least not if you want a loyal, productive
staff.If you've ruled out harmless joking but are unable to make a
connection between the comments and your behavior, you should talk
to your employees. Not all of them, and not in a group, and not
those making the jokes. Hopefully you have some employees who avoid
comedy central and can be trusted to give you candid, honest and
private feedback. Our suggestion would be to meet with them and
tell them you're concerned that you may have said or done
something to antagonize others. Ask whether there's anything
they've noticed about you, not your employees, which could
cause disruption in the workplace. If you've chosen well, they
will give it to you straight and you can make corrections.Rod Walsh and Dan Carrison are the founding partners of

/article/49618,Reducing Employee Errors,"How can you reach the lofty goal of ""zero defects""?","Q: I
have a small printing business, and employee errors are driving me
crazy. One customer rejection or one shipping error can cost me a
customer and a month's profit. I've fired people. I've
yelled and screamed. I've trained till I'm blue in the
face, and still I have errors. I know that large companies talk
about ""zero defects,"" but is that possible? Are my
expectations unrealistic?A:
Your concern about this problem is not misplaced. Customers have
zero tolerance these days for any kind of error. Ever since the
publication of Philip B. Crosby's book Quality Is Free, organizations have
realized that errors in any part of a business are extremely
expensive. Crosby estimated that the cost of quality was 25 percent
of revenue! This caught on to the extent that companies are almost
totally intolerant of any form of poor quality. ""Zero
defects"" was the battle cry of organizations large and small
for many years. When they realized that zero defects are
realistically impossible, it led to the current fad, ""Six
Sigma."" This means that Six Sigma organizations are not
satisfied unless error rates one in 1 million or less. While no one
would argue with such a goal, the problem is how to get from where
you are to there.Technically, there are only two ways to get there. One is with
positive reinforcement, and the other is negative reinforcement. In
other words, we can demand improvement (negative reinforcement), or
we can do things to cause people to be excited about making
improvement. The most common way is to demand improvement and to
fire, discipline or ""chew people out"" when they make an
error. The problem with this approach is that contrary to common
belief, it is the slow and costly way to get improvement. In my
book, Bringing Out The Best In People, I write about the
fact that negative reinforcement gives managers the ""illusion
of control,"" not real control.Next StepCheck out these other titles
by Philip Crosby:The Absolutes of LeadershipQuality Without TearsThe fastest way to make an improvement in your situation seems
the slowest. That is, you should identify the behaviors that create
high-quality or error-free output, develop a way to measure and
monitor them, and then provide positive reinforcement for
improvement. You should not measure errors, but instead track
desirable behavior like ""shipments without an error.""
Remember, you want to measure what you want people to do. This
differs from what is commonly done, which is to measure errors.
Create a graph so that you have increasing numbers, not decreasing
ones. Place the graph in an area that people frequent every day.
Try to track results daily if possible.Once you have determined the behaviors and results you want, you
need to develop a plan to positively reinforce the behaviors when
you see them and celebrate sub-goals along the way. Set small goals
in the beginning so that improvement is easy. This will allow
people to receive the positive reinforcement that will create
energy and excitement about improvement. Remember, the more you
positively reinforce, the faster the improvement. Think of positive
reinforcement in this case as any interaction with your employees
that communicates that you like, appreciate or value what they are
doing. When you reach a sub-goal, spend some time letting people
tell you what they did to make the improvement. And finally, be
patient with the small improvements. If you are, you will find that
you will make more and better progress than you believed
possible.Aubrey C. Daniels, Ph.D., founder and CEO of management

/article/48776,The Relevance of Employee Titles,"CEO, CFO, VP: Are these acronyms even important in the early days?","Q: What do employee titles mean?A: This is one of those things many new entrepreneurs waste a lot of time on. They start a company and immediately get caught up in who should be president, CEO or vice president, not understanding that in the early days, titles aren't important. Titles can become more useful as a company grows, but initially it doesn't mean much to be director of business development or VP of operations for a two-person company. When you start out, don't get caught up with titles-spend your time getting new business and making sure you deliver quality in the business you have. As your company grows, there will be plenty of time to organize your titles and positions.That said, let's take a look at how larger companies use titles. Unfortunately there isn't a lot of consistency here. Some companies give several titles to a particular person, some have a person for each title, and some change the title of a position to fit the skills of a particular person. Here are a few thoughts to help you understand titles more clearly:Board of directors: A board is a group of people elected by a corporation's shareholders to oversee its business and appoint its officers. The person who leads this group is the chairman. The CEO of a company often serves as chairman. The members of a board are called directors. Many companies also use the director title for middle-management positions such as director of human resources or director of operations.CEO/president/COO/CFO: In many companies, the CEO and president titles are filled by the same person. In the cases where they are not, a good way to think about it is that the president is an inward-facing position and the CEO is an outward-facing one. The president is responsible for running the company-managing the employees, overseeing sales and marketing, making sure the bills get paid, keeping the employees motivated, etc. The CEO is responsible for dealing with the press, vendors and strategic partners. He or she spends more time on the overall strategy of the company. The CEO would typically spend time networking, looking for chances to tell the company's story and finding business opportunities. Another way to look at this is that the CEO is responsible for articulating the company's vision/strategy and the president is responsible for executing it. In some companies, the president and COO (chief operating officer) are different people. In those cases, the two positions usually split the responsibilities described above. Many companies also have a CFO (chief financial officer) who is responsible for the overall financial health of the company.Vice president/director/manager: These are names for different management positions. In a large company, a vice president usually manages a division or at least a large group of people. In a small company, the same basic position could have any of these titles. For example, if you work for a 15-person accounting firm and your job is new business development, you would probably be equally effective as manager, director or vice president of business development.Information technology: This function can be pretty confusing because there are so many names for it, and different titles for the people who run it. Most people think of this as the group that is responsible for keeping the computers and network running and managing corporate data. The organization often has different names: IT (information technology), IS (information services or information systems), MIS (management information systems) or CIS (corporate information systems). The person in charge of this function can have many titles: chief information officer, director of information systems, vice president of information technology, etc. Some companies would also include these responsibilities under the CTO (chief technology officer) title, but most would view that position as responsible for overall product architecture or technical direction-an outward-facing job.Remember that different companies have different philosophies about titles. A vice president in one company may have the same responsibilities as a director in another company who may have the same responsibilities as a senior manager in a third company. In your company, you want to pick the title that makes the most sense to you and your customers.Keith Lowe is an experienced entrepreneur who is a founder and investor in companies in several industries.

/article/47428,New Management,"It's your way or the highway, right? So how do you get that manager you just hired not to hit the next on-ramp?","						This story appears in the January 2002 issue of Entrepreneur. Subscribe  They say the third time's a charm. That's the way it
worked for Nicole Geller, founder and CEO of GCS Inc., a 5-year-old
temporary agency and government contracts consulting practice in
McLean, Virginia. It took Geller three tries to find the right
sales manager.The first manager was too indecisive. The second manager was too
corporate-minded. But Geller, 38, found the right fit the third
time around. That sales manager is now the company's president,
helping GCS and its 50 employees accomplish healthy sales of $4
million, and Geller couldn't be happier. The past still nags at
her, however. ""I feel like I failed with two people,"" she
says. ""But I learned a lot about what kind of person I really
need.""Finding the right manager can be an exercise in trial and error.
It's estimated that 40 percent of all new managers leave the
job within 18 months, according to Manchester Inc., a business
consulting group based in the Philadelphia area. Why? Often, it can
be traced back to what is not discussed before the new manager or
executive starts the job. In fact, the seeds of failure are usually
planted within the first 100 days of a new entrepreneur-manager
relationship, says Larry Stybel, co-founder of Boston-based
consulting firm Stybel Peabody & Associates Inc., which runs a
program called First One Hundred Days to coach entrepreneurs and
their managers through the first three months of their working
alliance.Although entrepreneurs are good at setting goals and hiring for
knowledge, they often forget to mention which aspects of the
company should stay the same before their new managers start to put
new ideas into action. ""It's an incomplete package,""
Stybel says. ""The entrepreneur hasn't brought up those
'third rail' or socially taboo issues relating to the
company.""When a new manager crosses the line and tampers with a procedure
or project the entrepreneur wants left alone, things can turn ugly
very fast. Says Stybel, ""I've seen situations where at the
end of three months, both sides are no longer speaking to each
other.""Lay Some Ground RulesPrepare your potential manager by discussing his or her role as
early as possible. During the interview, go beyond your goals, says
Stybel. Think about the aspects of your company that are strictly
off-limits to change. If this person will be managing your
brother-in-law, for example, you need to work out how to navigate
the situation upfront rather than leaving it until after he or she
is hired. If you really like the way your customer service
representatives greet customers over the phone, you'd better
say so before your new customer service manager changes it.
Discussing such details ahead of time will create a mutual
understanding and help the manager avoid making major tactical
errors.Like a lot of other entrepreneurs, Geller assumed her new
managers would intuitively understand her vision of how the company
should run. So when her second manager came aboard and suddenly
wanted to take a hands-off approach with customer service, Geller
balked. This manager had hit on one of Geller's core issues,
offering each client personalized customer service. ""I really
put the kibosh on [her idea],"" she says. ""Ultimately, it
led to her not doing well and probably feeling not as
empowered."" The relationship was doomed from that point on,
and it ended within the year.Having learned from her experiences, Geller offers this advice:
Talk about your business values, ask a lot of hard questions and
listen closely. ""That's where you're going to pick up
on their skills and whether they can even converse with you in a
way that feels professional and comfortable,"" she says.
""Get to know them as people."" By the time she hired her
third sales manager, she was asking the hard questions and was more
in touch with her own third-rail issues. ""I really didn't
get into some of the tough issues [with the first two
managers],"" she says. ""I wish I would have because it
would have given me the answers right upfront.""On-the-Job TrainingYour work doesn't stop once a manager is on the job. You
have to build a relationship that goes the distance.To do that, you should start off small. Make a short list of
projects and ideas you will both avoid during the first few months.
Stybel suggests using the first 100 days to tackle easier problems,
instead of the decisions that are most likely to cause a meltdown
between an entrepreneur and a manager. ""Do the doable things
for immediate success,"" he says. ""Achieve some
wins."" You should be talking with the manager every day,
especially during the first three months.Finally, after a few months, ask new managers what they wish
they'd known about the company before they started working for
you. It could be eye-opening, not to mention useful for making
future management hires.Chris PenttilaChris Penttila is a Washington, DC-based freelance journalist who covers workplace issues on her blog, Workplacediva.blogspot.com.Read more",Growth Strategies,2002-01-01 00:00:00
/article/47340,Outsource Your Payroll,"For many businesses, payroll services offer an attractive and valuable alternative to in-house processing. Chosen correctly, they provide a less expensive, simpler means of paying your employees, filing your taxes, and performing a host of other duties these companies' sales reps can't wait to tell you about.","IntroductionEven the most meticulous and experienced professionals find that payroll can be a headache. Slap on a stiff penalty for a tax filing omission, and now we're talking a full-blown financially-induced migraine.For many businesses, payroll services offer an attractive and valuable alternative to in-house processing. Chosen correctly, they provide a less expensive, simpler means of paying your employees, filing your taxes, and performing a host of other duties these companies' sales reps can't wait to tell you about.However, choosing poorly is like starting a new job you weren't right for in the first place -- it's a hassle to leave, but if you stay, you'll be perpetually frustrated.Companies often initially process payroll themselves for any number of the following reasons:they consider in-house processing to be more cost-effective than outsourcingthey are protective of wage informationthey want to maintain control over payroll data to handle last-minute changes.In truth, smaller firms with a stable, salaried staff and minimal changes in tax obligations may well be better off processing internally; it can certainly be more convenient and efficient if your needs are straightforward. But many ultimately discover it's not all that cheap -- especially when you factor in the time spent managing the process.Plus, without the proper knowledge of payroll procedure and access to a sound payroll program, it's easy to make mistakes. Employees as well as federal, state, and local tax collection agencies need to be paid in full, on time, and in the proper manner. Usually, late payments are cause for monetary penalties.Finally, using a payroll service can ease your mind. The Internal Revenue Service has reported that one out of every three employers has been charged for a payroll mistake, with total penalties reaching into the billions of dollars. And given the ever-changing nature of tax regulations, it's easy to make an error that can grossly affect your bottom line.BuyerZone.com can help you select the right payroll service--as well as coach you on switching to a new one. In addition to offering up the nitty gritty on payroll services, we will simplify the industry and empower you with solid working knowledge to apply to your search for a provider.When to outsourceWhile the majority of U.S. businesses process paychecks internally, this is not always cost-effective. At minimum, internal payroll processing requires the purchase of a computer or manual accounting program and extensive training to use it. In addition, businesses need to keep up to date on changes in personnel, deadlines, and tax requirements on an ongoing basis.Using a payroll service generally makes sense if your payroll changes with each pay period. If your company has employees working varying amounts of hours each week or has a significant turnover rate, a payroll service can be a time-saving and cost-effective alternative to internal processing. Using a payroll service can also be helpful if you have to pay payroll taxes for multiple states.On the other hand, if your payroll expenses are quite stable, you may find handling payroll internally to be just fine for your needs.Services providedA payroll company's basic services include calculating payroll and tax obligations for each employee, printing and delivering checks, and providing management reports. Paychecks can be issued on a weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, semi-monthly or yearly payroll basis.In addition, payroll firms can offer services such as automatic check signatures, envelope stuffing, and direct deposit of checks. Payroll firms also issue W-2 forms for an additional fee of about $1 per form.Many services now offer tie-ins with 401(k) and Section 125 mutual fund plans, allowing employees to designate automatic deductions from their paychecks. And for larger companies with more complex processing needs, some payroll providers have even begun to offer integrated HR software systems that track employee benefits-related information in addition to regular payroll data.Choosing a providerBesides offering the services you require, a payroll service should offer a high level of customer service. Unlike some other business services, you will need to communicate regularly with your payroll provider.If your sales representative will not be handling your account, make sure to speak with the customer service reps to ensure you will be satisfied. Also, consider requesting references from current clients to gain a better sense of the provider's level of customer service.You should look for a payroll provider that is within reasonable driving distance, allowing you to pick up checks in case of an emergency. Also check that the company is bonded to ensure your company will not suffer from any potential financial mishandling.Filing payroll taxesMany payroll services offer the option of filing state and federal payroll taxes for your business.Typically, this service is offered at little or no cost. This is because the payroll provider will impound the tax due at the time paychecks are issued, earning interest on the funds until the money needs to be handed over to the government.Most services assume responsibility for penalties resulting from incorrect filing; however, your company may be liable for any interest charges.Keep in mind that many companies will not calculate local or city payroll taxes. Make sure to inquire about this if it is a significant issue for you.Filing electronicallyWith the Electronic Federal Tax Payment System (EFTPS) your company banks by phone with the government, transferring funds electronically rather than relying on checks to keep your ""account up to date. If your company paid more than $200,000 in taxes in any year since 1998, then you are required to pay taxes electronically through EFTPS within the following two years. If for example, your company paid over $200,000 in taxes in 1999, then by January 2001, you must pay taxes electronically.Many payroll services do offer electronic tax payments as part of their package, but in truth, electronic filing is not as difficult as it first appears, and businesses can easily enroll and learn how to do it on their own.For more information, call EFTPS Customer Service Unit at 1(800) 945-8400 or 1(800) 555-4477.Relaying informationEach pay period, payroll data has to be ""called in"" to the service provider. This can be done via telephone, fax or computer.The telephone is the traditional way of communicating information. The biggest problem is typically finding a mutually agreeable time for both people to be on the phone.A fax machine eliminates scheduling conflicts and miscommunicated facts, but can bring up security risks concerning who receives the faxes and who will oversee the fax being sent.Communicating payroll by modem is often the most efficient method, especially if you have a larger payroll.Since 1998, several national payroll providers have offered payroll data transmission over the Internet. This simplifies payroll for many businesses, allowing them to download payroll information from any computer that is Internet accessible.PricingThe market for payroll is competitive and reflects local market conditions. The basic service costs between $0.80 and $2.00 per check, plus a base account fee. The amount of the base fee depends on the pay period, with the less frequent payroll periods costing more. Over a year, however, less frequent payroll periods will cost less to maintain.Added services such as tax filing and direct deposit can cost between $4 and $9 per payroll period. With direct deposit, there is often a nominal transaction charge per check in addition to the base fee.Furthermore, there can be fees for adding or dropping employees, adjusting employee information, or setting up your account. Fees can differ dramatically across services, so it is important to check them out before signing up for a service.Since pricing for services is relatively negotiable, try to avoid multiple unnecessary charges by knowing which service features you are most interested in before choosing a payroll company. In general, watch out for providers that offer low base processing rates with expensive add-on features.Questions to askFeaturesWhat does your basic service include?How quickly can you re-run a payroll if there is a mistake?How long does the average client stay with you?

/article/46512,Rehiring Laid-Off Employees,What are the legal implications?,"Q: Several months ago, my company laid off a number of employees during a reduction in force. Can we rehire some of these former employees on a temporary basis to perform the jobs they were doing before the reduction? If so, what are the implications?A: While the answers to these questions will, at least in part, depend on individual state law as well as on whether there is a collective bargaining agreement, some general principles apply. It is crucial for employers to understand that their policies and practices relating to both reductions in force (RIFs) and recalls are regulated by federal and state laws governing job discrimination and fair employment practices. Discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age and/or disability is prohibited in layoffs and recalls.If a previously laid-off employee believes an employer has discriminatorily recalled (or failed to recall) her, she can file a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). Employers should consider ways to minimize the potential for such claims, including but not limited to the following:Implement a policy on recalling employees. If a company decides to recall employees following a RIF, how these recalls are handled will depend on the company's policy. To try to avoid potential liability, any company policy regarding recalls must be reasonable and non-discriminatory on its face as well as in its application. Points that can be included in a policy to help accomplish this goal include:Next Step Learn more about your responsibilities as an employer with The American Bar Association Guide to Workplace Law: Everything You Need to Know About Your Rights as an Employee or Employerby Barbara J. Fick.1. Placing responsibility on the employee to contact the employer to express interest when vacancies occur. This keeps the employer from assuming the administrative burden and obligation to identify positions for which laid-off employees would be interested and qualified.2. Putting a time limit on how long an employee will be entitled to preferential consideration for rehire. This will help avoid the argument from employees that the company was required to rehire them, on a preferential basis, indefinitely.3. Specifying that the company retains the discretion to consider employees' skills and its business needs ahead of seniority in deciding who to recall. Oftentimes, the order of recall reverses the order of the layoffs. In other words, the last person to be laid off is the first person recalled. However, this policy may not always be practical. Therefore, retaining discretion is helpful. Of course, employers (and all personnel involved in the recall decision) must make certain that what it labels a ""business need"" is not merely a pretext for discriminatorily recalling some employees over others.Whether the employer already has a policy or implements a new one, it should also be sure to train any and all personnel involved in the recall decisions on how to apply the policy in a non-discriminatory manner.Be specific about the terms and conditions of recall. Assuming the employer has legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for determining who it recalls and under what conditions, and absent an agreement with the employee, there are no specific legal requirements as to what terms and conditions must be offered to a recalled employee. Rather, a company's needs will dictate what jobs become available and to what extent. The company's needs will also dictate what it is willing to pay and what benefits to offer. If an employer only has a temporary need, it should make this clear at the time of rehire.Employers should keep in mind that when a former employee is recalled, whether on a temporary or non-temporary basis, the employer should make sure the employee fully understands the terms of the re-engagement. This is especially important if the terms and conditions of employment upon rehire are not the same as those under which the employee was working prior to his layoff.Note: The information in this column is provided by the author, not Entrepreneur.com.

Though to date only media companies and government agencies have been specifically targeted, business owners nationwide are taking new precautions both when sending and receiving mail.If the worst-case scenario were to happen--and you discover an anthrax infection at your business--you can be held liable. ""As a general proposition, any exposure to harmful substances in the workplace subjects an employer to liability under the state worker's compensation scheme,"" says attorney Diana P. Scott, a shareholder in the litigation and labor and employment practices of Greenberg Traurig LLP's Los Angeles office. ""This is true even in the absence of negligence by the employer.

/article/44336,Pay Up,"When the minimum wage rises, will small businesses get the downside?","						This story appears in the October 2001 issue of Entrepreneur. Subscribe  If the changing of the Senate guard is an indicator of shifting
political winds, entrepreneurs may soon pay employees higher
minimum wages. Whether it's $1 over three years, as proposed by
some Republicans, or $1.50 over 18 months, as Sen. Edward Kennedy
(D-MA) has offered, some version of a national wage increase could
pass by the fall.Many small-business organizations warn that an increase would
disproportionately hurt entrepreneurs, who generally have less cash
to cover expenses. If they can't get a high enough return for
the added investment, the result may be fewer new hires. ""My
concern is that if you make the minimum wage too high, you'll
be excluding some people from the labor market, the folks that
don't have experience or skills,"" says Ron Bird, chief
economist for the Employment Policy Foundation, a nonpartisan,
nonprofit organization that analyzes workplace trends. Raising
minimum wage, he adds, ""creates a barrier to entrepreneurship
because it adds to what you have to do to justify expanding your
business. So it has a negative effect on job creation and the
creation of new businesses.""But some research suggests small businesses have not suffered as
a result of past minimum wage increases. A 1998 study by the Jerome
Levy Economics Institute at Bard College, for example, found that
the 1997 increase from $4.75 to $5.15 affected hiring decisions at
only 6.2 percent of the small businesses surveyed. When a second
study was conducted a year later asking whether small businesses
would be affected by an increase to $6 an hour, 84.3 percent said
the hike would have no impact. Of the 15 percent that said it
would, nearly half said they would hire fewer workers, but
wouldn't decrease their staff. ""And most people who claim
that the minimum wage is going to have a detrimental effect usually
say it's going to lead to layoffs,"" says Oren M.
Levin-Waldman, who headed up the study at Jerome Levy.But the second study does suggest a ""tipping point,""
says Levin-Waldman, author of The Case of the Minimum Wage (SUNY
Press). When small-business owners were asked whether they would be
affected if the minimum wage were raised to $7.25, the percentage
who said it would have no impact decreased from 84.3 percent to
61.9 percent. ""So there's a limit to how high you can
raise the minimum wage,"" he says. ""But it also suggests
that the current $5.15 an hour is clearly not [at the
limit].""Others contend that the minimum wage increase would also create
a ripple effect throughout companies; those who today are earning
what will be minimum wage after the legislation is passed will want
increases as well. But if the money isn't there, those
employees could end up getting the short end of the stick. ""So
this is something that needs to be looked at much more
carefully,"" says Bird.Proponents of the legislation, on the other hand, say the matter
has been examined carefully enough, and a boost in the minimum wage
is long overdue. They say minimum wage workers, many of whom are
primary earners in their families, have been barely subsisting at
the poverty level for too long. According to the AFL-CIO, once an
hourly wage of $5.15 is adjusted for inflation, it's 21 percent
less than it was in 1979. ""So this would help catch the
minimum wage back up to the real value it once had,"" says an
aide to Sen. Kennedy. ""Every year the minimum wage isn't
raised, you lose ground because of inflation.""In an effort to offset the damage they fear it might do,
small-business advocates have lobbied for additional small-business
tax relief to be included in any minimum wage legislation. But it
seems unlikely in the wake of the Senate seat changes. Still, even
some who oppose the legislation say that with the talent war still
raging, and the labor market tight, a higher minimum wage probably
won't hurt most small businesses, at least in the near term.
""Although you don't know what the impact will be three
years out,"" says Susan Walthall, acting chief counsel for
advocacy at the SBA, ""it probably won't have too much of
an impact on most firms.""C.J. Prince is a New York City writer who specializes in

/article/44606,Revamping Your Bonus Program,"You've offered incentives, but your employees aren't meeting their goals. We'll help you fix your bonus program.","Q: I implemented a team bonus program several months ago. It worked great in the beginning but has recently lost its effectiveness. Even in this economy, the team goal is achievable, but they have not made it for the past three months. What should I do? Should I stop the bonus or increase it? I need help.A: I will assume that your situation requires people to work together to attain results. The research on team incentives consistently shows that they produce lower performance than individual incentives. However, there are some situations where cooperation between people is important to achieve long-term success, particularly as it relates to customer service, morale and cost control. There are several ways to set up a bonus program. Let me discuss the pros and cons of each.1. Team bonus. In this plan, all members of the team benefit equally or around some formula based on salary level or position. In this method, the best performers are almost always punished. If they work very hard to achieve the group target and discover that several members did little, then the top performers are punished because the rewards are the same for everybody. If the top performers work hard and the team doesn't make the goal because a number of the group do little (which is almost always the case), this causes the top people to resent those team members, and morale and performance suffers. Research indicates that in such cases the top performers will actually reduce effort. The advantage of this plan is ease of administration. The disadvantage is that it ultimately destroys a team or causes less than optimal performance. Because of the relatively rapid deterioration of performance, I would predict that there is a wide variance between the performance and contribution of the team members. I think that if you check, you will find some of the problems mentioned above. By the way, research shows that poor performers prefer team bonuses to individual bonuses. Top performers prefer individual incentives. It is easy to understand why in both cases.
2. Individual. Another way to set up an individual incentive or bonus plan where you need cooperation between employees is to include teamwork behaviors as a requirement for getting or maximizing the bonus. In a sales situation, you may want to give people points for sharing leads, helping scope out a proposal or helping a colleague with a sales presentation. This will eliminate one of the problems associated with this type of bonus plan: the narrow focus of the individual performer. The advantage of this plan is that only those who work hard are rewarded. In the team bonus, some people who don't work hard are often rewarded. The disadvantage of this approach is that even though people will help each other when asked, there's often a minimal concern for the success of others.Brush up on your management skills with Ben Franklin's 12 Rules of Management by Blaine McCormick. 3. Individual plus team bonus. In this format, the bulk of the bonus pool is given for the individual accomplishment but with some portion earned if the team meets its collective goal. This method ensures that the top performer will benefit from his/her labor but maximize income only from helping the group attain its goal. In many ways, this is the preferred method because it not only gets people interested in helping others, but also gives them a stake in the success of others. The advantage of this plan is that it channels discretionary effort toward not just helping others, but also focusing on things that will make them successful. The disadvantage is simply that, as with the individual plan, administration is more difficult.In sum, my recommendation is not to increase the amount of the bonus, but to change it to the ""individual plus team bonus"" plan.Aubrey C.

/article/44782,Managing Peace of Mind,"Now more than ever, this task should be your top priority.","People cannot do their best work when they are worried. This is a lesson that the terrible events of September 11 are now bringing home to us in full force. Across the country and the world, people went back to work with the conviction that doing something positive and productive is in the end the best remedy against the destructiveness of terrorism. Yet it has proved difficult to recapture our sense of balance and normalcy in the workplace. Many employees are more distracted, stressed or nervous than before.What should an entrepreneur do to help employees deal with these new stresses? A useful clue appeared in an interview with Brent Woodsworth, leader of IBM's Crisis Response Team, which is working to help the company's clients and their community around the Trade Center site right now. He pointed out that there are a lot of simple ""peace of mind"" things you can do.Before September 11, I don't think I can recall people talking about managing employees' peace of mind, but now it is obviously a necessity in many workplaces. And, as Woodsworth astutely observed, there are, in fact, many simple things we can do to help people feel more safe and secure and to ease their anxieties so that they can focus on their work and not their worries.For starters, in most workplaces, there are safety preparations and precautions that most employees don't know much about. When was the last time your employees got a thorough review of your fire safety plans and preparations, for example? Do they know where the fire alarms are and what they do when you ring them? Do they know what the options are for exiting the building? Can they quickly find a fire extinguisher or first aid kit if needed? Do they know what to do if there is a terrorist attack in the vicinity of their workplace? A lack of knowledge of such things makes the dangers more uncertain and scary. Spread clear information about them, and everyone will feel a little more secure.And by the way, this advice goes against many managers' instincts. It is easy to believe that bad things are best not spoken of, but the opposite is generally true.I am about to get on a plane (white knuckles and all) and go to Detroit to run a workshop for up-and-coming business leaders. Instead of teaching the same stuff I used to teach ""before,"" I've decided to open the workshop with a new module on managing peace of mind in the workplace. Here's what I'll be teaching:Peace of Mind Management Process1. Identify fears and anxieties.2. Match existing safeguards and resources to them.3. Find ways to communicate these matches with problem/solution messages.4. Identify any gaps in preparedness and work on them! (Include employees in this process; working on a problem increases peace of mind. Focus on availability, awareness, effectiveness of solutions.)5. Brainstorm simple ways of adding to sense of readiness. (You can do this activity early and often--order not important!)For example, some employees are now worrying about the safety of the buildings they work in. This means that to manage peace of mind, you need to help employees deal with the anxiety: ""If the building collapses in an earthquake, bombing or fire and I'm trapped, how will I get out or be rescued?"" Normally you might not spend any time thinking about such a question, but right now it would be a good investment of your leadership time to come up with some possible ideas that might help employees cope with this anxiety.A brainstormed list of possible solutions from a recent session I ran looks like this: Cell phones, whistles, fire/evacuation drills, a daily record of who is in building, first aid kits and fire extinguishers available locally, mixers/social events to ensure that everyone knows who works in building, ""buddy systems,"" emergency contacts phone list/tree, first aid training and an increased number of exits.While not all of these options may be necessary in your workplace, the point is that it is not hard to come up with options and take action. And many of these ideas are relatively cheap, easy and low-tech. (How much would it cost to make a plastic whistle available to each employee, for example?)The hard part of managing peace of mind is not thinking of things to do, but simply recognizing that you need to be thinking and talking about this issue in the first place. But one of the (many) things that's different now is that executives and business owners do need to take responsibility for managing peace of mind. And even if you are in technical compliance with safety regulations and requirements, you may well have a peace-of-mind problem in your workplace right now.Alex Hiam is the founder and director of Alexander Hiam & Associates, a management consulting firm, and a publisher of tools for corporate trainers.

/article/44530,The Rippling Effects of the Terrorist Attacks,Businesses affected by the tragedy of September 11 find grieving and rebuilding are the only ways to ensure life goes on.,"Thousands of small companies suffered enormous financial and emotional losses as a result of the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center. Every day, Banchet Bianca Jaigla's drivers delivered flowers to her biggest client, Windows on the World, the world-famous restaurant at the top of the World Trade Center. Traffic congestion in lower Manhattan on Tuesday morning prevented the last scheduled delivery before the devastating attacks.On the Friday following the attacks, Jaigla's new, 350-square-foot flower cooler was filled with the berry branches, green hydrangea, casablanca lilies and orchids that were intended to be delivered to Windows on the World the morning of September 11. ""It's kind of strange,"" said employee Dorian Butovich of the restaurant's undelivered flowers standing untouched in the cooler. ""We walk around them. No one wants to move them.""Despite the numbing shock, sadness and the loss of a major client, life and business went on last week for Jaigla and her staff of six full-time and five part-time employees. While thousands of rescue and construction workers labored at what is now called ""ground zero,"" her two trucks continued to deliver flowers to clients around the city. Fighting back tears, she kept her floral assistants busy preparing flowers for a bar mitzvah in Manhattan and a wedding in Greenwich, Connecticut. ""The minute I stop [working], I'm in mourning,"" said Jaigla. ""I get sick to my stomach--I think; I worry. When I'm busy with my work, I don't think about it so much.""Jaigla said she was grateful to have the work to take her mind off the people she knows are missing and believed dead. Though she was cheered by the news that the owner and general manager of Windows on the World survived the destruction, and that many restaurant workers also made it safely out of the building, Jaigla said she is consumed by sorrow for those whose lives were lost in the dramatic collapse. ""My main concern is for the people who were in Windows on the World,"" said Jaigla. ""That's all I can think about right now.""Like other small-business owners throughout New York City, Jaigla was doing everything she could to cheer up her employees and keep them busy. ""They are the most important thing to me,"" she said. ""Every time they stop to think, they start to cry. All I can do is hug them and say, 'It wasn't our time.' ""Although many flower orders were cancelled in the wake of the tragedy last week, Jaigla said keeping busy kept them sane. ""If we didn't have [the events] this weekend, I don't know what we'd do.""Jaigla said supplying the daily flower order and flowers for special events at the now-demolished restaurant made up about one-third of her business. She's grateful for her other well-known clients, including the Lutece and Le Bernadin restaurants as well as a number of corporate clients. Jaigla, who has been in business for 18 years, said she still plans to open a new store on Washington Street in the meat-packing district on October 24. She chose the location because it's only 10 minutes away from the site of the former World Trade Center. ""I can laugh and cry about all this,"" said Jaigla. ""But all I can do is take it one day at a time. We are all going to suffer. Hopefully, I can keep going, find more business and move forward.""Amy Kopelan, CEO and owner of Bedlam Entertainment in Manhattan, was also severely affected by the horrible tragedy. On Tuesday morning, she was dealing with the last- minute details for a high-profile event she produces called ""The Corporate State."" The event, originally scheduled for September 13, is a prestigious summit for women CEOs and senior managers. One hundred twenty-five participants, speakers and corporate sponsors from all around the United States were due to begin the conference with a private reception at the Four Seasons hotel on Wednesday evening.As soon as she heard the news of the terrorist attacks, Kopelan began making phone calls to reschedule the event. In six hours, assisted by conference calls set up by a colleague in Arizona, she had rebooked the entire event, including the hotel, flower vendors, sound technicians, photographers, keynote speakers and all the executives planning to attend. ""I managed to get through to all 125 people,"" said Kopelan, a former TV producer who is used to working under extreme pressure. ""They all said they'd be here in January.""Kopelan said everyone she contacted that life-changing morning was ""overwhelmingly supportive."" ""Everyone said, 'Whatever you need, we'll be there,"" said Kopelan. ""The program is intact, the sponsors are intact and the support team is intact.""For Kopelan, maintaining forward momentum by immediately rescheduling the event was her way to cope with disaster and uncertainty. ""My feeling is that life marches on,"" said Kopelan. ""Life has to go on.""Businesses across the country are still reeling from the calamitous and tragic events of last week. But talking about the tragic events and sharing feelings are important to the healing process. Business owners and employees need to do everything possible to keep morale high, according to Roger Herman, a certified management consultant and founder of The Herman Group in Greensboro, North Carolina. He offers these suggestions for effective leadership in the stressful days and weeks ahead:Schedule a staff meeting to discuss the impact of the events and the need to unite and endure.Offer employees time off with pay to volunteer.Make arrangements to support the families of any employees who are called to duty in the National Guard or military reserves.Offer your employees the opportunity to join you in making a donation to a charity. Make your donation in the company's name, and allow your employees to help you decide the amount and the recipient of the funds.Give employees opportunities to express their feelings at work.As soon as possible, try to return to normalcy, or something close to it.Jane Applegate is a syndicated columnist and the author of201 Great Ideas for Your Small Business.

families. Says Blythe: ""More than anything, people need to
regain a sense of control. Their reality has been shattered, and
their personal safety has been threatened. We need to offer
reassurance that the world and our surroundings can once again be
safe and manageable.""Whether you are responding to this tragedy or preparing yourself
to respond effectively during any crisis, the following steps will
hopefully help you regain some semblance of order in your
company:People matter most, and first and foremost, you have to know
where your people are and whether they are safe. Once management
has accounted for all personnel and contacted their loved ones,
they should gather the company together at any conference-type
facility as soon as possible to discuss the impact.Once gathered, the company should provide all known information
to all personnel. They should let people know what to expect in the
near future, including traumatic stress reactions they may
experience and what the company will offer the impacted individuals
and their families. It is also important for the company to ask the
employees if they have any questions and be prepared to dispel any
rumors that may have circulated.Identify all ""at-risk"" individuals--people who are
experiencing severe reactions related to the incident. Many at-risk
individuals will be easy to identify, such as victims, witnesses
and close friends or relatives of the victims. However, there are
many other people who still may be at risk, such as individuals who
have recently lost a loved one or were involved in another highly
traumatic incident. Although these individuals were not directly
related to the terrorist attacks, they still may suffer from
traumatic stress. People needing help may not always come to
you--you must seek them out and provide whatever assistance you
can.Provide professional psychological assistance to all in need.
Assistance can be provided through groups and on-site individual
assistance by qualified mental-health professionals who specialize
in dealing with traumatic stress.Maintain communications to and from all employees. It is
imperative to keep everyone up-to-date with the latest information.
One effective way in which to keep lines of communication open is
to distribute daily bulletins or other company announcements.
Especially if your company was close to the epicenter of this
horrific event, let everyone know the status of the safety of all
personnel.Assess the escalation potential. The leaders of the company
should look at exactly what has happened and brainstorm what else
could possibly happen as a result of the incident. Some questions
to consider: Does the company have any ongoing foreseeable risk,
including legal and medical implications? Keep in mind that even if
the risk is only a perceived risk by personnel, it still must be
properly addressed. What type of interruptions in production should
the company expect? What can the company do to mitigate the
aftereffects, such as absenteeism and low morale?Company leaders should start to plan for return-to-work issues.
Keep in mind, it is crucial to deal with the needs of the workers
before asking the employees to return to work as normal. If you
ignore your people's needs, you will encounter outrage and
significant morale problems.Overall, a company should be prepared, informed and responsive.
America could not be fully prepared for what happened on September
11. From here, we can only respond effectively, and it is your
responsibility to help individuals and their families begin the
long recovery process.Grace Burley is a crisis communications expert in

/article/43452,Who Hired Pottymouth?,Everybody's talking dirty these days. Is cursing out of control in your workplace?,"						This story appears in the September 2001 issue of Entrepreneur. Subscribe  You've heard it all before: the ""goddamn"" printer
jam, the ""f-ing"" fax machine, the ""asshole"" who
took the last danish. Colorful language has always been part of the
workplace, but employers and employees are increasingly unleashing
strings of profanities reminiscent of a George Carlin show. It
seems that, frankly, most people don't give a damn about what
they say at work.What's behind the surge in swearing? Some say ""desk
rage,"" the latest incarnation of Americans' apparent
inability to remain calm. In a recent national survey by Scripps
Howard News Service, 88 percent of respondents believed people are
more likely to express anger now than ever before.
""There's an escalation in rage,"" agrees workplace
communication consultant Bill Gorden. ""People don't know
how to respectfully disagree.""James O'Connor, author of Cuss Control: The Complete Book on How to Curb
Your Cursing (Three Rivers Press), believes the increase in
workplace swearing coincides with the institution of casual dress
codes and the influx of younger workers. ""Most swearing is
[by] young people working at high-tech jobs or dotcoms,""
contends O'Connor. ""Casual dress leads to lazy
language.""If your employees' mouths are filthy, there's at least
one tried and true deterrent: a bar of soap.Contact SourcesBill Gorden School of Communication, Kent State

/article/43672,Communicating With Employees,"In your quest to make your start-up fly, don't forget about the people who are helping you get things done.","						This story appears in the September 2001 issue of Startups. Subscribe  If we told you good employee communication is important,
we'd hear a good, resounding ""Duh."" And if we told
you your employees were the key to your success, you'd tell us
to stop wasting your time, because you learned that in
Entrepreneurship 101. But if we told you how to run your company
from the inside out, would we have your attention?Probably, because you're not quite sure what ""running a
company from the inside out"" means. We went to Shirley
Dreifus, chief executive of Strategic Communications Group in New
York City, to find out how an entrepreneur who's just starting
out can turn this highfalutin concept into real-life dollar
signs. NEXT STEP Boost your management
skills with Ben Franklin's 12 Rules of Management by Blaine
McCormick. First off, says Dreifus, you have to know that your employees
are your first and best marketing tool. Mistake number one that
most companies make is informing investors and customers of the
latest news but not sharing the info with employees. ""When
customers want information,"" says Dreifus, ""the employees
don't know what's going on."" That newest product
offering or latest mention of your company on the local news
shouldn't be news to your employees-keep them abreast of all
the happenings.Don't worry though-keeping employees informed doesn't
mean you'll be sentenced to a life of meeting after meeting and
memo after memo. There are several ways to keep the communication
going without taking up exorbitant amounts of time: e-mail, voice
mail, instant messages, homing pigeon (OK, maybe don't go
that far), to name a few. Dreifus suggests that even during
the super-stressful start-up phase, an entrepreneur should commit
to weekly or biweekly in-person meetings to discuss all the issues
at hand. ""Generally in a start-up, you're really
understaffed and everyone's stretched thin,"" she says.
""So making everyone feel that they're a part of the
company and keeping them informed is a great way to diffuse any
problems and get people to tell you what's really going
on.""Keeping employees appraised of all goings-on can help in other
ways as well. You know how expensive advertising can be, right?
Check out this news flash: Your employees can be walking
advertisements. ""Your employees are your best emissaries to
the public,"" says Dreifus. ""If each one of your employees
knows 10 or 20 people and they start talking to those people about
how great your product is or how great your company is, and those
10 or 20 people [spread the news], you get tremendous word-of-mouth
benefits just from keeping your employees informed. It's a
fairly inexpensive marketing tool, [yet] people don't even take
advantage of it."" TALK
BACKWhat do you do to keep the communication lines
open with your employees? Tell us at bsumag@entrepreneur.com. While you're embarking on this journey of mass
communication, remember your days as an employee. Remember how you
wanted to know what was going on with the company, but how those
messages about curbing the use of Post-its really got annoying.
""When employees start getting burdened with e-mails and voice
mails, they're not about company strategy or about where the
company is going or critical concerns,"" says Dreifus.
""[Employees] get overburdened because people start copying
them on every little thing, whether or not they need to read
it.""Building a good communication network with your employees is not
just a suggestion-because if you don't let them know what's
up, says Dreifus, ""the employee feels they're not being
considered, that they're not a part of the company."" And
that's one message you can't afford to send.",Growth Strategies,2001-09-01 00:00:00
