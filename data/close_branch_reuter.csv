Britain's biggest mortgage lender said the branch cuts were part of 200 closures announced last July, and the move was in response to changing customer behavior toward making more online transactions. The Lloyds group has more than 2,000 branches across the United Kingdom, and approximately 75,000 employees, according to its website.  The trade union Unite condemned the closures, which it said would affect 54 Lloyds branches, 22 Halifax branches and 24 Bank of Scotland branches. The continuous stream of branch closures announced by the UK's retail bank branches appears to show no signs of ending, said Rob MacGregor, Unite national officer. Lloyds earlier this week announced it would reduce some branches to just two staff with tablet computers, in response to fewer customers visiting high street sites and increasingly banking online. The new smaller branches will not have counters, with customers paying in cash and cheques through self-service machines and talking to mortgage advisers through video links. This comes as Lloyds is poised to pass a significant milestone in its recovery from the financial crisis after the government sold more shares in the lender this week and the bank expected to return to private hands next month.  A report by lawmakers last month warned Britain's poor and vulnerable people were hardest hit by bank branch closures, echoing a report by Reuters last June that showed banks were disproportionately closing branches in the lowest-income areas while expanding in wealthier ones.

James Mwangi, Equity's chief executive, told a shareholder meeting the bank had closed seven of its 12 branches in South Sudan, which has one of sub-Saharan Africa's lowest banking penetration rates. Because of uncertainty, and because of a lack of peace, we have been forced to reduce those branches, Mwangi told investors on Tuesday and later posted online. I think we now have five. Equity follows another Kenyan bank, KCB Group, which earlier this month said it was temporarily closing some branches because of the tough operating environment and economic conditions. South Sudan's three-year civil war has sharply reduced oil output, the main source of foreign exchange, causing the pound to plunge in value and inflation to soar to above 800 percent last year. Last year, that devaluation caused us to write off a loss of 6 billion Kenyan shillings ($58.14 million). It is not performance; it is what you could call an economic meltdown. The conflict erupted when President Salva Kiir fired his deputy, Riek Machar. The violence, fanned by ethnic rivalries, has sparked Africa's worst refugee crisis since the 1994 Rwandan genocide and plunged part of the country into famine. Even so, Mwangi ruled out a complete exit from the country. It's like hibernation - let's retain the licence until peace returns. Mwangi said an exodus of foreign workers, especially Kenyans and Ugandans, had also hurt business. ($1 = 103.2000 Kenyan shillings) (Reporting by George Obulutsa; editing by Richard Lough)"

Like many U.S. banks in recent years, Bank of America has been reducing its overall branch count to cut costs even as it opens new branches in select markets. New branches are typically smaller, employ more technology, and are aimed at selling mortgages, credit cards and auto loans rather than simple transactions such as cashing checks. Pace said there is one completely automated branch in Minneapolis and one in Denver, both of which are relatively new markets for the bank's consumer business. They are about a quarter of the size of a typical branch. The new branches were mentioned briefly Tuesday by Dean Athanasia, co-head of Bank of America's consumer banking unit, during a question and answer session at an investor conference, but he did not provide details. Athanasia said Bank of America will open 50 to 60 new branches over the next year, though Pace said the bank will also be closing branches in certain markets, so the 50 to 60 branches do not represent a net increase. Bank of America opened 31 new branches in 2016.

The citizens of France have trusted you with leading the country at a difficult time for Europe and the whole world community, Putin told Macron, whose staff had accused Russia during the campaign of trying to damage their candidate. The Kremlin said Putin told Macron in a congratulatory telegram: The growth in threats of terrorism and militant extremism is accompanied by an escalation of local conflicts and the destabilization of whole regions. In these conditions it is especially important to overcome mutual mistrust and unite efforts to ensure international stability and security. Late on Friday, 1-1/2 days before polls opened, Macron's campaign said it had been the target of a massive computer hack that dumped internal campaign emails online. A New York-based cyber intelligence consultancy, Flashpoint, said there were indications a hacker group with ties to Russian military intelligence was behind the attack.  Putin has repeatedly denied interfering in the elections of any foreign countries, and rejected previous allegations about Kremlin-backed hacking operations. Earlier in the campaign, a Macron aide had said Russia was mounting a campaign to disseminate fake news via cable television and social media to discredit Macron and help his rivals. Putin had spoken favorably about Macron's conservative rival Francois Fillon, who had said he wanted a reset of frayed relations with Russia. Later, after Fillon's prospects faded under the weight of a nepotism scandal, Putin took the unusual step of granting a Kremlin audience to far-right candidate Marine Le Pen, who was Macron's opponent in Sunday's run-off. She told reporters after meeting Putin that if victorious, her first act would be to think about lifting the sanctions that the European Union imposed on Russia after it annexed Ukraine's Crimea peninsula three years ago. Macron's victory extends a losing run for Putin, who had banked on political upheaval in Western capitals bringing in new leaders better disposed toward Russia. He is expected to run for re-election next year, and a lifting or easing of Western sanctions would help him secure a strong mandate from Russian voters, who are feeling the pain from an economic slowdown made worse by the sanctions.

The latest lay-offs will affect workers in divisions including retail, commercial banking, insurance, and consumer finance, the bank said on Wednesday. These follow on from about 5,500 net job cuts the bank has already made in 2016. The net total of cuts is inclusive of 145 new roles that will be created across those business areas, Lloyds said. A spokeswoman for Lloyds said all affected staff had been briefed by managers on Wednesday and the bank had notified workers' union Unite, which has been critical of past Lloyds job cut announcements. The bank also said it would close 49 branches, beginning in the first quarter of next year, and introduce a new mobile banking service in some areas affected by the branch closures. Loyds has closed 153 branches so far this year, the spokeswoman said. On Oct. 26, the bank reported third-quarter profits largely unchanged from a year ago, defying expectations of a squeeze on earnings after Britain's surprise vote in June to leave the European Union. Lloyds shares were down 0.5 percent at 0729 ET, in line with slight losses at other British banks following the result of the presidential election in the United States.

The 250 branches Spain's fifth largest bank will close are in addition to 92 branch closures over this year, the source said, and would enable Sabadell to adapt to increasing consumer demand for online services. The closures will lead to the relocation or early retirement of 800 employees, the source said. Spanish newspaper Expansion reported, however, that all would be cut from the workforce. Almost all of Spain's leading banks have started trimming their workforces and branch networks in response to rock-bottom interest rates and aggressive domestic competition that have hit their profitability, now a third of what it was before the country's financial crisis. Spain's branch network has been denser than in much of the rest of Europe - there was one branch per 1,452 people in 2014, against a euro zone average of around 2,000 - so they are an easy target for banks looking to cut costs.

Harun Kibogong told Reuters that Kenya-based KCB Group Plc , East Africa's biggest bank by assets, will temporarily close five branches, leaving ten operational. KCB was one of the first foreign banks to move into South Sudan more than a decade ago, lured by one of sub-Saharan Africa's lowest banking penetration rates and its petro-dollars. Its then-chief executive slept in a tent and opened the first branch in a shop just big enough to fit a partition and a grill. But a three-year civil war has curbed oil production, sent the economy into a tail-spin and spurred runaway inflation. We are not saying KCB is pulling out from South Sudan, Kibogong said in an interview this week. What we are doing now downsizing for survival. KCB lost 2.8 billion South Sudanese pounds in 2016, he said. He declined to specify the amount in dollars. The South Sudanese pound traded at 16 to the dollar on the black market on Friday, compared with 13 in February. The bank has operated in South Sudan since 2006. Its branches are older than the country itself, which only became independent from Sudan in 2011. Violence forced the bank to shut three branches in January 2014, a month after the war broke out. But now it is a perilous shortage of dollars and hyperinflation that topped 800 percent last year that is hampering operations. Thom Rago Ajak, the governor of the Bank of South Sudan, said the state bank was trying to tackle the country's economic difficulties. South Sudan's economy is undergoing tremendous challenges due to internal and external shocks: the current political and economic development, and low oil prices, Ajak said. The bank planned to improve information technology, human resources and develop a credit information system, he said. Such reforms, however, will not alleviate South Sudan's fundamental problems: war, the flight of foreign capital and crippled oil production. (Editing by Richard Lough)"
"https://www.reuters.com/article/britain-eu-banks-idUSL8N1I52I4","European banks warn of London exodus if told to convert branches to subsidiaries","","May 9, 2017 /  7:27 AM / 3 months ago","","PARIS/LONDON (Reuters) - European banks are privately warning they will have to shift thousands of people out of Britain if Brexit negotiations push the Bank of England to demand that they reinforce London operations with fresh capital, executives have told Reuters. These capital demands, which could amount to an estimated 40 billion euros ($43.73 billion), threaten to accelerate an exodus of bankers from the City of London that has been triggered by Britain's vote to leave the European Union. Three big European banks - Deustche Bank (DBKGn.DE), BNP Paribas (BNPP.PA) and Societe Generale (SOGN.PA) - currently operate some of their sizeable activities in Britain through a branch structure, which requires lower capital requirements. British regulators have been comfortable with this situation with Britain as part of the EU, but once Britain leaves they will want these banks have enough capital to support their business and ensure that British taxpayers are not left footing the bill in a crisis. The regulators have said European banks should be ready to set up full-blown subsidiaries in Britain and submit to Bank of England regulation if Britain and the EU cannot reach a Brexit deal. A report from Boston Consulting has estimated the switch to a full subsidiary structure could cost European banks around 40 billion euros in extra capital.  Several European banks base the bulk of their investment banking activities, such as sales and trading, in London, which Bank of England Governor Mark Carney has dubbed the investment banker of Europe.  Deutsche Bank has 9,000 staff based in Britain, BNP Paribas has around 6,500 staff in the country, where it bases the bulk of its investment banking business and Societe Generale has some 4,000 staff in Britain.   U.S. banks have until now been at the center of speculation about the impact of Brexit. Many of them have already warned of the need to potentially move thousands of staff out of London to maintain EU access after Britain leaves the EU. But attention has shifted to the European banks following  comments in April by British regulators that European banks which operate in London using EU passports, which give EU-wide market access, should set up separately capitalized subsidiaries in Britain if Britain and the EU cannot reach a deal on financial services. EU passports enable banks to operate throughout the bloc but be regulated mainly by just one member country. But passporting between the rest of the EU and Britain may be lost once Britain leaves EU in two years' time. If Carney (BoE governor) decides to make EU banks create subsidiaries ... I will buy a one way train ticket out of London and take everyone with me, one senior executive at a European bank told Reuters, speaking anonymously due to the sensitive nature of the topic.  Germany's flagship bank Deutsche Bank has already said it is considering whether it needs to move thousands of staff from London to Frankfurt following Britain's decision to leave the European Union, if it can no longer access the single market from London. Branch Versus Subsidiary A senior executive at another European bank said: We would have to reassess our options here in London in that case, referring to the potential demand to set up a subsidiary. In the U.S., the Federal Reserve takes a lot more ownership over branch structures, it's a lot more intrusive. It's therefore natural for the PRA (Prudential Regulatory Authority) to become more intrusive. Maybe they would have to force more supervision.  Investment banking activities in particular carry a lot of risk and large balance sheets, meaning regulators will want to supervise the banks' trading models closely.  Deutsche Bank’s London operations, for example, would rank among the world’s top banks in their own right, but Britain's PRA has little say over them, a senior banking official said. This is because Deutsche Bank's main regulator is BaFin in Germany. Carney has called for Britain and the EU to reach a deal to recognize each others' bank rules after Brexit, or risk a potentially damaging hit to financial services across Europe. But such recognition of financial rules across borders has not been tried before on the scale envisaged by Carney, which could make negotiations tricky. The EU may also be reluctant to forgo the jurisdiction of the bloc's highest court in policing rule breaches.  Also in the mix are EU plans to force foreign banks in the bloc to convert themselves into holding companies. This would potentially require tougher capital and liquidity requirements which could bump up costs for British banks wanting to do business across Europe after Brexit. Britain is lobbying to stop this measure while it is still an EU member. For now, EU banks are trying to keep their options as open as possible as they try to gauge the scale of their future activities in London.         We hope it's a warning and that it will not translate into anything, a senior executive at an EU banking lobby said.  The transformation to a subsidiary has a lot of consequences, on the liquidity side, capital. It will create more costs for banks. We are sure that London will remain an important financial market and it (requirements to set up subsidiary) will not probably lead banks to leave London. But it's not an incentive to expand business there. Graphic: London finance job moves - tmsnrt.rs/2qRZIxW Additional reporting by Huw Jones and John O'Donnell, Editing by Jane Merriman"

The bank, which counts South Africa's Nedbank and Qatar National Bank as shareholders, suffered a hefty $131 million pre-tax loss in 2016. Speaking to Reuters on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum for Africa in Durban, Chief Executive Officer Ade Ayeyemi said the bank's plans to expand its mobile platforms would help deliver profits. This means reducing our branch network, using technology to deliver to customers and processing transactions centrally, said Ayeyemi. We believe that this business model can deliver profitability to our shareholders. The bank reported a pre-tax profit of $75 million in the first quarter of 2017 though that was still down 17 percent from a year earlier due to high bad loan provisions. Ayeyemi, a former Citigroup executive in Africa who took over at Ecobank in 2015, said the expansion into online platforms would lead to lay offs. The bank employs more than 17,000 people. Ayeyemi also said a recovery in oil prices in 2017, which would result in higher import revenues for African economies dependent on crude sales, was a positive for the bank. Nigeria accounts for 40 percent of Ecobank's revenues and is in its second year of recession, as lower oil prices caused chronic dollar shortages that hurt businesses and households.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-banks-idUSKBN1850MN","European banks warn of London exodus if told to convert branches to subsidiaries","","May 9, 2017 /  7:27 AM / 3 months ago","","PARIS/LONDON (Reuters) - European banks are privately warning they will have to shift thousands of people out of Britain if Brexit negotiations push the Bank of England to demand that they reinforce London operations with fresh capital, executives have told Reuters. These capital demands, which could amount to an estimated 40 billion euros ($43.73 billion), threaten to accelerate an exodus of bankers from the City of London that has been triggered by Britain's vote to leave the European Union. Three big European banks - Deustche Bank (DBKGn.DE), BNP Paribas (BNPP.PA) and Societe Generale (SOGN.PA) - currently operate some of their sizeable activities in Britain through a branch structure, which requires lower capital requirements. British regulators have been comfortable with this situation with Britain as part of the EU, but once Britain leaves they will want these banks have enough capital to support their business and ensure that British taxpayers are not left footing the bill in a crisis. The regulators have said European banks should be ready to set up full-blown subsidiaries in Britain and submit to Bank of England regulation if Britain and the EU cannot reach a Brexit deal. A report from Boston Consulting has estimated the switch to a full subsidiary structure could cost European banks around 40 billion euros in extra capital.  Several European banks base the bulk of their investment banking activities, such as sales and trading, in London, which Bank of England Governor Mark Carney has dubbed the investment banker of Europe.  Deutsche Bank has 9,000 staff based in Britain, BNP Paribas has around 6,500 staff in the country, where it bases the bulk of its investment banking business and Societe Generale has some 4,000 staff in Britain.   U.S. banks have until now been at the center of speculation about the impact of Brexit. Many of them have already warned of the need to potentially move thousands of staff out of London to maintain EU access after Britain leaves the EU. But attention has shifted to the European banks following  comments in April by British regulators that European banks which operate in London using EU passports, which give EU-wide market access, should set up separately capitalized subsidiaries in Britain if Britain and the EU cannot reach a deal on financial services. EU passports enable banks to operate throughout the bloc but be regulated mainly by just one member country. But passporting between the rest of the EU and Britain may be lost once Britain leaves EU in two years' time. If Carney (BoE governor) decides to make EU banks create subsidiaries ... I will buy a one way train ticket out of London and take everyone with me, one senior executive at a European bank told Reuters, speaking anonymously due to the sensitive nature of the topic.  Germany's flagship bank Deutsche Bank has already said it is considering whether it needs to move thousands of staff from London to Frankfurt following Britain's decision to leave the European Union, if it can no longer access the single market from London. Branch Versus Subsidiary A senior executive at another European bank said: We would have to reassess our options here in London in that case, referring to the potential demand to set up a subsidiary. In the U.S., the Federal Reserve takes a lot more ownership over branch structures, it's a lot more intrusive. It's therefore natural for the PRA (Prudential Regulatory Authority) to become more intrusive. Maybe they would have to force more supervision.  Investment banking activities in particular carry a lot of risk and large balance sheets, meaning regulators will want to supervise the banks' trading models closely.  Deutsche Bank’s London operations, for example, would rank among the world’s top banks in their own right, but Britain's PRA has little say over them, a senior banking official said. This is because Deutsche Bank's main regulator is BaFin in Germany. Carney has called for Britain and the EU to reach a deal to recognize each others' bank rules after Brexit, or risk a potentially damaging hit to financial services across Europe. But such recognition of financial rules across borders has not been tried before on the scale envisaged by Carney, which could make negotiations tricky. The EU may also be reluctant to forgo the jurisdiction of the bloc's highest court in policing rule breaches.  Also in the mix are EU plans to force foreign banks in the bloc to convert themselves into holding companies. This would potentially require tougher capital and liquidity requirements which could bump up costs for British banks wanting to do business across Europe after Brexit. Britain is lobbying to stop this measure while it is still an EU member. For now, EU banks are trying to keep their options as open as possible as they try to gauge the scale of their future activities in London.         We hope it's a warning and that it will not translate into anything, a senior executive at an EU banking lobby said.  The transformation to a subsidiary has a lot of consequences, on the liquidity side, capital. It will create more costs for banks. We are sure that London will remain an important financial market and it (requirements to set up subsidiary) will not probably lead banks to leave London. But it's not an incentive to expand business there. Graphic: London finance job moves - tmsnrt.rs/2qRZIxW Additional reporting by Huw Jones and John O'Donnell, Editing by Jane Merriman"

"https://www.reuters.com/article/china-banking-risks-idUSL4N1EF2Y4","Some local PBOC branches told to check on entrusted bond agreements - sources","","December 20, 2016 /  9:27 AM / in 7 months","","SHANGHAI, Dec 20 (Reuters) - China's central bank has told some of its branches to look into entrusted bond holding agreements between some commercial banks and non-financial firms, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Tuesday. The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the banks were told to fill out forms and answer queries including bond holding periods and reasons for holding those bonds. Entrusted agreements are widely used by Chinese securities firms to obtain leverage for bond transactions in order to provide guaranteed returns they have promised investors. Some traders said it is still not clear whether the central bank would roll out relevant policies to regulate the business. It is really hard to define the so-called entrusted holding agreement business, said a trader at a commercial bank. But most people have sort of done this before. The People's Bank of China (PBOC) did not respond to a request for comment. Use of the loosely-regulated type of bond agreement has come to light following problems at Sealand Securities  whose bond-related business is under inspection by the country's securities regulator. Sealand Securities defaulted on a bond transaction with Bank of Langfang, based in northern Hebei province, following a recent tumble in bond prices, local media reported last week. The next day, Sealand Securities denied there was a default, saying it had no agreement with the bank and its company seal had been forged by two former employees. Bank of Langfang, in a statement on its website, also dismissed the media reports as rumour. China's bond market is having a bad time following the U.S. Federal Reserve's interest rate hike, and liquidity tightness has pushed the yields on Chinese treasury bonds higher. Yields on 10-year Chinese treasury bonds were up more than 15 basis points to 3.382 percent on Tuesday afternoon, compared with the previous week's close. The price of Chinese 10-year treasury futures for March delivery closed 0.17 percent higher on Tuesday. These  hit their daily downside limit of 2 percent for the first time at one point on Dec. 15, shortly after the Fed rate hike.    (Reporting by Shanghai Newsroom; Editing by Richard Borsuk)"

The citizens of France have trusted you with leading the country at a difficult time for Europe and the whole world community, Putin told Macron, whose staff had accused Russia during the campaign of trying to damage their candidate. The Kremlin said Putin told Macron in a congratulatory telegram: The growth in threats of terrorism and militant extremism is accompanied by an escalation of local conflicts and the destabilisation of whole regions. In these conditions it is especially important to overcome mutual mistrust and unite efforts to ensure international stability and security. Late on Friday, 1-1/2 days before polls opened, Macron's campaign said it had been the target of a massive computer hack that dumped internal campaign emails online. A New York-based cyber intelligence consultancy, Flashpoint, said there were indications a hacker group with ties to Russian military intelligence was behind the attack. Putin has repeatedly denied interfering in the elections of any foreign countries, and rejected previous allegations about Kremlin-backed hacking operations. Earlier in the campaign, a Macron aide had said Russia was mounting a campaign to disseminate fake news via cable television and social media to discredit Macron and help his rivals. Putin had spoken favourably about Macron's conservative rival Francois Fillon, who had said he wanted a reset of frayed relations with Russia. Later, after Fillon's prospects faded under the weight of a nepotism scandal, Putin took the unusual step of granting a Kremlin audience to far-right candidate Marine Le Pen, who was Macron's opponent in Sunday's run-off. She told reporters after meeting Putin that if victorious, her first act would be to think about lifting the sanctions that the European Union imposed on Russia after it annexed Ukraine's Crimea peninsula three years ago. Macron's victory extends a losing run for Putin, who had banked on political upheaval in Western capitals bringing in new leaders better disposed towards Russia. He is expected to run for re-election next year, and a lifting or easing of Western sanctions would help him secure a strong mandate from Russian voters, who are feeling the pain from an economic slowdown made worse by the sanctions. During the U.S. presidential campaign, Putin spoke in glowing terms about Donald Trump. U.S. intelligence officials alleged Russia actively tried to help Trump's campaign by hacking his opponents' emails. Russia has denied that. But since Trump took office, he has not delivered the promised rapprochement with Russia, instead sticking closely to the Russia policy espoused by his predecessor as president, Barack Obama.

The Brasilia-based lender, Brazil's biggest bank by assets , said in the filing that the shuttering and scaling back of selected branches, to be carried out over the course of 2017, would lead to annual savings, not counting personnel costs, of 750 million reais ($221.89 million). Of that total, the bank said, 300 million reais in savings are expected from transportation, security, rental and maintenance costs. The bank, which operates more than 5000 branches across Latin America's biggest country, said the scaling back would not hinder its ability to serve clients in the municipalities where it operates. Projected savings generated by the early retirements will be disclosed once the offer period has ended, the bank said. In a separate statement, the bank said it expects some 9,000 employees, from about twice as many who will be eligible for the program, to accept. At present, Banco do Brasil employs about 109,000 people. In a further effort to lower payroll costs, the bank will also offer shortened workdays for roughly 6,000 employees in some managerial positions. Combined, the branch reductions and personnel plans do not alter earnings guidance for 2016, the bank said. Despite a dominant presence in the Brazilian marketplace, Banco do Brasil has become less profitable in recent years in part because of unsuccessful government efforts before an ongoing recession to use it and other public lenders to spur demand for credit and thereby stimulate economic growth. As Brazil's once-booming economy tanked, however, the opposite happened, leaving banks with many bad loans and causing overall demand for credit to fall. Banco do Brasil recently cut an important profit target for the year and missed third-quarter forecasts after an unexpected build-up in loss provisions associated with a client in the oil and gas industry. In addition to its cost-cutting plans, the bank is also working toward expanding its use of digital platforms to provide more of the services it historically offered mostly at branches. $1 = 3.38 Brazilian reais.

On his 75th day in power, President Donald Trump has yet to offer any major legislation or win passage of a bill he favors, but House of Representatives Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy has notched numerous small-scale victories with his strategy. Vice President Mike Pence told business leaders at the White House on Tuesday that Trump would sign more CRA resolutions soon and roll back an avalanche of red tape from the administration of President Barack Obama, a Democrat. Since Trump took office on Jan. 20, McCarthy has led Congress in churning out 13 resolutions under the CRA killing Obama-era regulations, most of concern to business interests. Trump has signed 11 of these into law, not only rolling back the rules they targeted but also barring agencies from writing substantially similar regulations in the future. White House spokesman Sean Spicer said on Tuesday the number of resolutions signed over two months showed Trump is vastly different from past presidents in rolling back regulations. On Monday Trump signed a CRA resolution repealing broadband privacy protections. He has also signed resolutions killing rules meant to expand background checks for mentally ill gun purchasers, change public school assessments, and reduce coal waste runoff into streams. Last Friday was the deadline for introducing any new CRA resolutions on regulations enacted by Obama's administration. Now Republicans must complete voting on resolutions already in the legislative pipeline by mid-May. Democrats assail the reversals as harming the environment, education and checks on Wall Street, with many saying the regulations were killed in order to please big-money lobbyists. Representative Louise Slaughter, the senior Democrat on the Rules Committee that sends resolutions to the House floor for votes, said in an interview of course it benefits the lobbyists. But she said fumbles around healthcare and tax reform also pushed CRA resolutions to the fore. Partly I think it’s because they don’t have anything else to do, she said about Republicans' eagerness. Other than that I think it's just another 'take that Obama.' Unintended Consequences McCarthy, a Californian and the No. 2 House Republican, saw the CRA's potential before the election. Written in 1996 and successfully used only once before 2017, the law was originally meant to restore the balance of power between Congress and the federal bureaucracy. But lobbyists and lawmakers recognized it could be used as a policy weapon, if the stars aligned. Under the law, resolutions only need simple majorities in each chamber to go on for the president's signature. So one party must control both the legislative and executive branches for it to work. The law sets a short time span for introducing disapproval resolutions: 60 legislative days after a regulation is finalized, meaning it can only be used right after a president of an opposing party leaves office. The stars aligned on Nov. 8, when Republicans captured the White House, Senate and House. For weeks Republican lawmakers bombarded McCarthy with lists of regulations to repeal and lobbying groups laid plans. The first disapproval resolutions were introduced on Jan. 30.

Italy's central bank announced in August it was starting proceedings to shut down AS PrivatBank's local arm after finding breaches of money-laundering regulations following inspections carried out between March 16 and April 6. The Bank of Italy said AS PrivatBank would not be allowed to carry out any further operations in the country beyond letting clients withdraw savings or transfer them to other banks. In a statement on its webpage, PrivatBank said the new Board of AS PrivatBank had decided to close down the Italian branch after an assessment of economic activities of the bank's branch network. It said it had decided on the suspension of the branch on September 19 and had notified the Bank of Italy. In a separate statement also on Wednesday the bank said AS PrivatBank would strengthen its fight against money-laundering.   (Reporting by Valentina Za and Stephen Jewkes; Editing by Adrian Croft)"

It is the second bank branch of the state-controlled firm to run afoul of U.S. financial authorities, after its New York branch was fined $180 million for lax compliance and anti-money laundering violations in August. Mega Financial, which has close ties to Taiwan's government, has been under scrutiny since about 200 of its customers were named in the so-called Panama Papers, a massive leak of documents from a Panamanian law firm that put the spotlight on the shadowy world of offshore companies used to avoid tax. President Bruce L.Y. Yang said financial regulators had uncovered problems with internal controls at the Chicago branch of Mega International Commercial Bank, known as Mega Bank. The Chicago branch has to improve some deficiencies in regulatory compliance, Yang said. He added that the branch manager had been replaced, but it was unclear if the bank would face a fine. Mega Bank said in a statement on Saturday that local regulators found deficiencies at the Chicago branch during a regular annual inspection at the start of this year. Mega Bank head office determined there were problems with procedures and internal controls at the branch and voluntarily replaced the Chicago branch manager in June, while urging the branch to make improvements, the statement said.  The manager was not replaced at the request of the U.S. regulators, it said.  Yang, the president of both the parent holding company and the bank, one of Taiwan's biggest lenders, said its chairman, Michael C.S. Chang, would travel to Chicago, New York and Canada next week. Terry Horstman, a spokesman for the Illinois state banking regulator, whose jurisdiction includes Chicago, declined to comment on whether the agency had examined or probed the bank. At this point in time, there is no public enforcement action against Mega International Commercial Bank's branch in Chicago by the Illinois Department of Financial & Professional Regulation's banking division, Horstman said. Chang told a news conference earlier this week that Mega Bank's overseas branches were coming under greater scrutiny by regulators abroad following critical lapses involving suspect transactions between its New York and Panama branches. Chang said the branches underwent annual inspections but regulators, including those in the United States, Canada and Panama, have become more stringent about them in the wake of the fine the New York State Department of Financial Services slapped on Mega's New York branch in August. The New York regulator had found lax compliance and anti-money laundering violations involving Panama transactions. Mega Bank has branch offices in Los Angeles, Chicago and New York.

The Florence court hearing the case gave four employees of the Milan branch of China's fourth biggest bank a suspended two-year prison sentence for failing to report illicit money transfers. Florence prosecutors leading the so-called River of Money investigation alleged that more than 4.5 billion euros ($4.78 billion) was smuggled to China from Italy between 2006 and 2010 by Chinese people living mainly in Florence and nearby Prato. About half of the money was sent via BOC, the prosecutors said. The court also ordered BOC to pay back 980,000 euros which it said it had earned through the illegal operations. According to the prosecutors, the proceeds sent to China came from a series of illegal activities, including counterfeiting, embezzlement, exploitation of illegal labour and tax evasion. Bank of China said in a statement it had not committed any crime and was not admitting guilt by agreeing to pay the fine, which was a way of closing the case and saving time. The settlement is due to our desire to avoid a long trial and allow the Milan branch of Bank of China to concentrate on developing its business, the statement said.

The U.N. report sent to the Security Council and released this week identified Glocom as a front company run by North Korean intelligence agents that sells battlefield radio equipment in violation of UN sanctions. Glocom is operated by the Pyongyang branch of a Singapore-based company called Pan Systems, said the U.N. report compiled by its panel of experts on compliance with sanctions on North Korea. The panel cited an invoice and other information it obtained. Pan Systems Singapore's Managing Director Louis Low, 79, said he knew about Pan Systems Pyongyang but did not set it up or operate it. In written answers to U.N. questions about its links to North Korea, seen by Reuters, he said he did not know about Pan System Pyongyang's alleged involvement in the arms trade. In an email response to questions from Reuters, a spokesperson for Singapore's ministry of foreign affairs did not say whether any authority was investigating Pan Systems: I am unable to provide information on our current internal processes. The Singapore Government will not hesitate to prosecute individuals/entities that fail to comply with Singapore legislation giving effect to measures prescribed by the UN Security Council Resolutions (UNSCRs), the spokesperson said. The government was closely studying the report and will take the necessary steps to ensure Singapore's compliance, said the spokesperson, who did not want to be named. The U.N. panel in its report recommended sanctions against Pan System Pyongyang.  For graphic on 'Glocom's connections to North Korea' click: tinyurl.com/hlmahtr Intelligence Agency Low told Reuters last week he had not been approached by Singapore authorities about the report and that he copied the foreign ministry into his correspondence with the U.N in December of last year. How come we are involved in so many things which we do not even know or heard of? Your assumptions are wrong. It is not true. Pan Systems Pyongyang is not a Branch of Pan Systems (S) Pte Ltd, Low wrote to the U.N. sanctions panel. The U.N. report, citing undisclosed information it obtained, said Pan System Pyongyang and Glocom were controlled by members of the Reconnaissance General Bureau, the North Korean intelligence agency tasked with overseas operations and weapons procurement. This shows how the Bureau enables its key agents to generate revenues for its operations through such networks, the report said. Pan Systems Pyongyang had a network of bank accounts, front companies and agents, mostly located in China and Malaysia, to procure components and sell completed systems, the report said. Pan Systems Pyongyang used Malaysia as a base for its key representative abroad and for the companies that have acted on its behalf, the report said. Low told the U.N. and Reuters that he did not know about the existence of a Pan Systems branch in Malaysia. A joint venture he had in Malaysia went bankrupt 25 years ago and he hasn't had an office there since then, Low told Reuters. Malaysia, which for years has been one of North Korea's few friends outside China, on Saturday rejected any suggestion it may have violated U.N. sanctions on North Korea after Reuters reported that its spy agency had been running an arms sales operation in the country.

Britain's largest mortgage lender is examining steps to turn its branch in the German capital into a subsidiary and may apply for a license to do so later this year, the sources said. Lloyds, which declined to comment, is the only major British retail lender without a subsidiary in another EU country and it would be the first major lender to commit to Berlin as a hub to access the rest of the continent after Britain quits the EU. Many other European banks are considering Frankfurt, the country's main financial hub and the home of the European Central Bank, as the preferred destination. Lloyds, which has almost all of its assets in Britain, has been examining how to retain its EU clients and maintain access to the European payments system. Banks are expected to announce more concrete plans for how they will adapt to Brexit in the coming months after Prime Minister Theresa May confirmed in a speech in January that Britain would leave the European single market. For Lloyds, the German capital's appeal is that it already has the bank's main European hub with a full management team in place, including the finance, risk and human resources staff required of a full subsidiary.     Therefore, in terms of staff, the Berlin branch would only need to change the status of those roles to meet legal requirements for a subsidiary, rather than having to transfer more people, according to one of the sources. Lloyds operates in Germany via the Bank of Scotland brand, which it acquired in 2008 as part of the takeover of HBOS and would still likely need to capitalize the new entity in line with regulatory requirements, the sources said.      Franz von L'Estocq, the managing director for Bank of Scotland in Germany, is based in Berlin, where the bank offers savings accounts, private banking and consumer and car loans.  The bank had previously explored setting up a subsidiary in both Frankfurt and Amsterdam. Last month UBS (UBSG.S) and HSBC (HSBA.L), two of Europe's biggest banks, warned they could each move around 1,000 jobs out of London in the clearest sign yet of how financial firms are preparing for the disruption.

Westpac consulted with staff about the closures during meetings at the branches attended by First Union members and representatives, the union said. The New Zealand subsidiary of the Sydney-headquartered bank declined to confirm whether any closures were being considered. A proposal regarding a number of branches is currently with staff for their consideration and feedback, a Westpac spokesman said in an email to Reuters, without elaborating on the proposal or number of branches. Customers, as they are around the world, are changing the way they bank and we are continually reviewing how to best meet their evolving needs, the spokesman said in the statement. Online transactions at Westpac New Zealand have risen more than 60 percent over the past five years. First Union said branches Westpac was considering closing were mostly in rural areas, though some were in the cities of Christchurch and Palmerston North. The bank will consult staff over the next two weeks and decide by the end of September, with affected banks closing by October-end, First Union finance organiser Tali Williams said. The union and local mayors would oppose any closures, she said. It's very out of the blue, Williams told Reuters. Local business and farmers who are making very big financial decisions are in these communities and need to make sure they're talking face to face with someone.

Financial services, the largest sector of the South African economy at 20 percent of nominal GDP, have long been perceived as being dominated by the country's big four banks. The government aims to address this through radical economic transformation, which is understood locally to mean nationalisation and ownership transfers to the black majority. It's not going to be a normal bank like the big four. It’s going to be a developmental bank to deal with the market that is not being served at the moment, South African telecommunications minister Siyabonga Cwele told Reuters on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum for Africa on Thursday. The big four banks, Standard Bank , FirstRand , Barclays Africa and Nedbank control about 90 percent of the market. It's a higher risk, but we are not saying we are going to be reckless in our lending but we must take that risk of funding entrepreneurs with small loans, Cwele added. Unsecured lending in South Africa is seen as lucrative but risky after the collapse of lender African Bank in 2014 triggered a central bank bailout, but giving a banking licence to the country's Post Office (SAPO) would allow it to use its 1,500 branches to provide credit and other financial services to millions of people without assets. We are going to need a very strong risk management system, Cwele said. The issue of financial inclusion is part of radical economic transformation. We are not talking about reckless access to finance. A 2016 survey by Finscope found that about 11 percent of the adult population were financially excluded or unbanked, accounting for more than 4.3 million adults. SAPO's Postbank has around 1.4 billion rand ($104 million) in excess capital, already enough to meet regulatory minimum requirements for a bank and the Post Office plans to list the business as a bank by July. Its positive financial position contrasts with SAPO as a whole, which is supported by a 4.4 billion rand ($290 million) state guarantee and is set to record a loss of more than 1 billion rand in the 2015/16 financial year. In the previous financial year it lost 1.5 billion rand after industrial action prompted major clients to pull out. (Editing by Alexander Smith)"

Shareholders at Masraf Al Rayan, Barwa Bank IPO-BABK.QA and International Bank of Qatar were committed to pushing ahead with the deal despite the current embargo by some of Qatar's Arab neighbours, the sources said. There is no hesitation. If anything, the situation [the GCC dispute] makes the need for banking sector consolidation more acute, said one of the sources. None of the banks were available to comment. A shake-up has long been mooted in the Qatari banking sector given that 18 local and international commercial banks serve a population of 2.6 million. The argument for consolidation has become more compelling now that lower oil and gas prices has trimmed state spending, curtailing deposit growth and revenue generation. The more than two-week travel and diplomatic boycott by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt could further dent bank performance if the dispute drags on, say analysts. Masraf Al Rayan, which is the acquiring bank, was holding discussions with the other two lenders to finalise the valuation of the deal, the sources said. Other matters will be agreed by the board of the newly-merged bank including the potential impact on the three banks' existing branch network and staffing, said the soources. In December, Reuters reported that the trio had begun merger talks which, if successful, would create the Gulf state's second-largest bank. The new bank, which would be run in compliance with Islamic banking principles, would have assets worth around 160 billion riyals ($43.6 billion).

Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates have sent a 13-point list of demands apparently aimed at dismantling their tiny but wealthy neighbor's two-decade-old interventionist foreign policy which has incensed them. Kuwait is helping mediate the dispute. A Qatari government spokesman said Doha was reviewing the list of demands and that a formal response would be made by the foreign ministry and delivered to Kuwait, but added that the demands were not reasonable or actionable. This list of demands confirms what Qatar has said from the beginning – the illegal blockade has nothing to do with combating terrorism, it is about limiting Qatar’s sovereignty, and outsourcing our foreign policy, Sheikh Saif al-Thani director of Qatar's government communications office, said in a statement.  A Qatar semi-government human rights body said the demands  were a violation of human rights conventions and should not be accepted by Qatar. Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani had said on Monday that Qatar would not negotiate with the four states until economic, diplomatic and travel ties cut this month were restored. The countries that imposed the sanctions accuse Qatar of funding terrorism, fomenting regional unrest and drawing too close to their enemy Iran. Qatar rejects those accusations and says it is being punished for straying from its neighbors' backing for authoritarian hereditary and military rulers. The uncompromising demands leave little prospect for a quick end to the biggest diplomatic crisis for years between Sunni Arab Gulf states, regional analysts said. The demands are so aggressive that it makes it close to impossible to currently see a resolution of that conflict, said Olivier Jakob, a strategist at Switzerland-based oil consultancy Petromatrix.    Ibrahim Fraihat, Conflict Resolution Professor at the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies, forecast a prolonged stand-off. Qatar will reject the demands as a non-starter, he said,  and its neighbors had already escalated as far as they were likely to go. Military action remains unlikely at the moment so the outcome after the deadline would be a political stalemate ... Washington, which is a close military ally of countries on both sides of the dispute, has called for a resolution. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Qatar's neighbors should make their demands reasonable and actionable. Related CoverageQatar tries to reopen neighbors' skies at special U.N. hearing June 30Factbox: Arab states issue ultimatum to Qatar to meet list of demandsTen Days to Comply An official from one of the four nations, who gave details of the demands on condition of anonymity, told Reuters the offer would be void unless Qatar complied within 10 days. The UAE has said sanctions could last for years. Qatar, the world's richest country per capita, says the sanctions amount to a blockade, but it has ample reserves to weather the storm.  The dispute is a big test for the United States, which has a large base in Qatar housing the headquarters of its Middle East air power and 11,000 troops. President Donald Trump has backed the sanctions, even as his Defense and State departments have tried to remain neutral, resulting in mixed signals. Trump called Qatar a funder of terrorism at a very high level, only for his Pentagon to approve selling it $12 billion of warplanes five days later. The most powerful country in the region to back the Qatari side in the dispute has been Turkey, whose President Tayyip Erdogan has his roots in an Islamist political party similar to movements that Qatar has backed in the region. Days after the sanctions were imposed, Turkey rushed through legislation to send more troops to its base in Qatar as a sign of support. The Al Jazeera Media Network logo is seen on its headquarters building in Doha, Qatar June 8, 2017.Naseem Zeitoon - RTX39N4RDefence Minister Fikri Isik rejected the demand to close the base, saying it would represent interference in Ankara's relations with Doha. Instead, Turkey might bolster its presence. Strengthening the Turkish base would be a positive step in terms of the Gulf's security, he said. Re-evaluating the base agreement with Qatar is not on our agenda. Qatar has used its vast wealth over the past decade to exert influence abroad, backing factions in civil wars and revolts across the Middle East. It infuriated Egypt's present rulers and Saudi Arabia by backing a Muslim Brotherhood government in Cairo that ruled for a year until it was deposed by the army in 2013. Qatar's state-funded satellite broadcaster Al Jazeera became hugely popular across the Middle East, but has long infuriated Arab governments used to exercising firm control over the media in their countries. Jazeera hit back at the closure order, calling it nothing but an attempt to silence the freedom of expression in the region. Stop Interfering The demands, handed to Qatar by mediator Kuwait, tell Qatar to stop interfering in the four nations' domestic and foreign affairs and refrain from giving Qatari nationality to their citizens, the official from one of the sanctioning states said. Slideshow (3 Images)They also include severing ties with the Muslim Brotherhood, Islamic State, al Qaeda, Hezbollah, and Jabhat Fateh al Sham, formerly al Qaeda's branch in Syria, and the surrender of all designated terrorists on Qatari territory. Qatar denies it has relationships with terrorist groups or shelters terrorists. It was ordered to scale down diplomatic relations with Iran, limit its commercial ties and expel members of Iran's Revolutionary Guards. Qatar denies they are there. The sanctioning countries demanded Qatar pay them reparations for any damage or costs incurred due to Qatari policies. Compliance with the demands would be monitored, with monthly reports in the first year, then every three months the next year, then annually for 10 years, the official said.  Although Reuters was told about the contents of the ultimatum by an official from one of the sanctioning countries, UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash accused Qatar of leaking the demands. There is a price for the years of plotting and there is a price to return to the neighborhood, Gargash said on Twitter. The leak (of demands) seeks to derail mediation. Qataris who spoke to Reuters described the demands as unreasonable, particularly the closure of Jazeera, which millions of Arabs see as an important outlet for voices willing to challenge the region's authoritarian rulers, but which neighboring governments call a conduit for Islamist propaganda. Imagine another country demanding that CNN be closed, 40-year-old Haseeb Mansour, who works for telecom operator Ooredoo, said. A Lot on the List Abdullah al-Muhanadi, a retired public sector worker shopping for groceries in Doha on Friday morning, said the boycott must be lifted before negotiations to resolve the dispute could start. There's a lot on the list that is simply not true or unreasonable, so how can we comply? he said. There are no IRGC (Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps) elements in Qatar and the agreement with Turkey is a long-standing diplomatic agreement so we cannot ask them to leave. Qatar has only 300,000 citizens enjoying the riches produced by the world's largest exports of liquefied natural gas. The rest of its 2.7 million people are foreign migrant workers, mostly manual laborers employed on vast construction projects that have crowned the tiny desert peninsula with skyscrapers as well as stadiums for the 2022 soccer world cup. The sanctions have disrupted its main routes to import goods by land from Saudi Arabia and by sea from big container ships docked in the United Arab Emirates. But it so far has avoided economic collapse by quickly finding alternative routes, and it says its huge financial reserves will meet any challenges. Qatar says the sanctions have also brought personal hardship for its citizens who live in neighboring countries or have relatives there. The countries that imposed the sanctions gave Qataris two weeks to leave, which expired on Monday.

A Rapid Response team stormed the Nineveh governorate complex in an overnight raid that lasted more than an hour, killing dozens of Islamic State fighters, spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Abdel Amir al-Mohammadawi said. The buildings, already in ruins, were not being used by Islamic State, but their capture is a landmark in the push to retake the militants' last major stronghold in Iraq, now restricted to the heavy populated western half of Mosul. Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi flew into to Mosul to visit the troops fighting to oust Islamic State from the city in which it declared its sprawling caliphate in 2014. Iraqis shall walk tall when the war is over, Abadi told state TV as he arrived. Islamic State snipers continued to fire at the main government building after it was stormed, restricting the movements of the soldiers, and forces pushing further into western Mosul came under rifle and rocket fire. The fighting is strong because most of them are foreigners and they have nowhere to go, said the head of a sniper unit for the Rapid Response, al-Moqdadi al-Saeedi.

The game is up, Isler told Reuters at the Qayyara West Airfield, south of the city. They have lost this fight and what you're seeing is a delaying action. Iraq's Counter Terrorism Service (CTS), which spearheaded the assaults that won back east Mosul, was on Tuesday moving into the western half of the city, the final and trickiest battleground in the nearly five-month campaign due to the dense civilian population living in its narrow streets. A disabled Iraqi girl who flees her home waits in a street for a truck to carry her to a safe place, as Iraqi forces battle with Islamic State militants, in western Mosul, Iraq March 7, 2017.Suhaib SalemStreet by Street The CTS forces had fought their way well into the Mansour neighborhood and were trying to advance street by street, sending heavy fire on IS sniper positions, a Reuters correspondent visiting the special forces' front lines reported. Federal Police units arrived at a house that CTS forces were stationed in but had to move out, one-by-one, to a neighboring building as IS rocket fire hit homes nearby. One CTS operative on the ground said he thought it would take a few hours to retake Mansour, one of Mosul's biggest neighborhoods which lies southwest of the old city and could serve as a base to advance into the historic center. Slideshow (19 Images)U.S. special forces were seen walking between buildings in the same area, some carrying assault rifles with scopes and silencers. Helicopters attacked targets just to the north and thick smoke filled the sky from various explosions.  Dozens of civilians streamed out of the Mamoun district toward the CTS troops as machinegun fire rang out in the background, adding to a wave of people displaced from Mosul that now numbers 211,000, 40,000 of whom fled last week alone, U.N. agencies say. Some 750,000 people were estimated to live in west Mosul when the offensive began on Feb. 19. Among the symbolic buildings retaken overnight was one that had served at Islamic State's main court, known for sentences including stonings, throwing people off roofs and chopping off hands, reflecting the group's hardline ideology.    The militants looted the central bank when they took over the city in 2014 and took videos of themselves destroying  archaeological artifacts. Traffic in antiquities that abound in the territory under their control, from Palmyra in Syria to Nineveh in Iraq, was one of their main sources of income. The number of Islamic State fighters in Mosul was estimated at 6,000 at the start of the offensive on Mosul on Oct. 17, by the Iraqi military which estimates that several thousands have been killed since. Lined up against them is a 100,000-strong force of Iraqi troops, Kurdish peshmerga fighters and Iranian-trained Shi'ite Muslim paramilitary groups.

The BfV domestic intelligence agency also confirmed that a December cyber attack against the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) used the same tools seen in a 2015 hack of the German parliament that was attributed to the APT28 Russian hacking group. Russia denies being involved in any cyber warfare targeting Western governments and institutions. Government spokesman Steffen Seibert said Germany would use all possible means to investigate the spread of fake news on the Internet, adding the best response was greater transparency. We are dealing with a phenomenon of a dimension that we have not seen before, Seibert told a regular government news briefing. Last month BfV said it had seen a wide variety of Russian propaganda tools and enormous use of financial resources to carry out disinformation campaigns aimed at destabilizing the German government. The OSCE, whose 57 members include most European nations, Russia and the United States, also said last month it had been the target of a cyber attack, but declined to comment on a report in French newspaper Le Monde that it was launched by APT28. Commenting on the cyber attacks, German foreign ministry spokesman Martin Schaeffer said: We take the incidents related to possible hacking attacks against the OSCE very seriously, and we also take other cases very seriously. It is obvious that everything must be done to prevent and impede such incidents as much as possible in our sphere, in our domain, he told the same news briefing. Hans-Georg Maassen, president of the BfV intelligence agency, told Germany's DPA news agency at the weekend that the agency's analysis showed the OSCE hack had been conducted using the same attack infrastructure as the Bundestag hack blamed on APT28. A spokesman for the agency confirmed the remarks. The Kremlin denounced on Monday a U.S. intelligence report that Russia had tried to influence the U.S. election in favor of Republican Donald Trump, and said no evidence had been produced to show Russian officials were involved. German officials said Berlin had looked into creating a separate branch of the 500-person government press office that would specifically evaluate and respond to fake news items. But that effort is in the early stages and may not result in any concrete steps given concerns about the government appearing to try to manage news in an election year, according to sources familiar with the matter. Chancellor Angela Merkel and her conservative bloc hope to win a fourth four-year term in September.

It is the second bank branch of the state-controlled firm to run afoul of U.S. financial authorities, after its New York branch was fined $180 million for lax compliance and anti-money laundering violations in August. Mega Financial, which has close ties to Taiwan's government, has been under scrutiny since about 200 of its customers were named in the so-called Panama Papers, a massive leak of documents from a Panamanian law firm that put the spotlight on the shadowy world of offshore companies used to avoid tax. President Bruce L.Y. Yang said financial regulators had uncovered problems with internal controls at the Chicago branch of Mega International Commercial Bank, known as Mega Bank. The Chicago branch has to improve some deficiencies in regulatory compliance, Yang said. He added that the branch manager had been replaced, but it was unclear if the bank would face a fine. Mega Bank said in a statement on Saturday that local regulators found deficiencies at the Chicago branch during a regular annual inspection at the start of this year. Mega Bank head office determined there were problems with procedures and internal controls at the branch and voluntarily replaced the Chicago branch manager in June, while urging the branch to make improvements, the statement said.  The manager was not replaced at the request of the U.S. regulators, it said.  Yang, the president of both the parent holding company and the bank, one of Taiwan's biggest lenders, said its chairman, Michael C.S. Chang, would travel to Chicago, New York and Canada next week. Terry Horstman, a spokesman for the Illinois state banking regulator, whose jurisdiction includes Chicago, declined to comment on whether the agency had examined or probed the bank. At this point in time, there is no public enforcement action against Mega International Commercial Bank's branch in Chicago by the Illinois Department of Financial & Professional Regulation's banking division, Horstman said. Chang told a news conference earlier this week that Mega Bank's overseas branches were coming under greater scrutiny by regulators abroad following critical lapses involving suspect transactions between its New York and Panama branches. Chang said the branches underwent annual inspections but regulators, including those in the United States, Canada and Panama, have become more stringent about them in the wake of the fine the New York State Department of Financial Services slapped on Mega's New York branch in August. The New York regulator had found lax compliance and anti-money laundering violations involving Panama transactions. Mega Bank has branch offices in Los Angeles, Chicago and New York.

The heightened inspections come after the New York branch of Mega International Commercial Bank, known as Mega Bank, was fined $180 million last month by the New York State Department of Financial Services (DFS) for lax compliance and anti-money laundering violations, involving Panama transactions. Currently, a lot of countries are closely inspecting Mega Bank's local branches, said Michael C.S. Chang, speaking at a news conference. These are regular annual inspections, but after this case happened, the authorities have become more stringent, Chang said, naming U.S., Canada and Panama authorities as among those stepping up scrutiny. Mega Bank will actively communicate with regulators, said Chang, who is also the chairman of Mega Bank. He said Mega is reviewing all operations and procedures at its overseas branches and may consider streamlining or closing branches in jurisdictions that are considered high risk. He said the New York branch would remain intact. The bank said in a statement issued Wednesday that it did not follow regulatory procedures in reporting suspect transactions between its New York and Panama branches and is currently conducting a full review of lapses that led to breaching anti-money laundering rules in the United States. There are, indeed, major deficiencies and shortcomings at the bank as pointed out by the DFS. As for the large volume of transactions in the past, we are still making inventory checks, according to Mega Bank's statement.    (Reporting by Liang-sa Loh; Writing by J.R.

We are still consolidating, said a credit trader. It looks like some short positions need to be covered in high-yield sovereign benchmark issues like Indonesia. Indonesia's 2046s were more than a point higher today, at a cash price of 102.7, and the 2026s two-thirds of a point higher, yielding 4.1%. Philippine 2041s jumped 2 points to 98.1, yielding 3.8%. Sri Lanka's 2021s rose a quarter of a point. Another trader said the Mongolia 2021s and 2022s had seen more selling lately, following the sovereign's downgrade by Moody's to Ca1 from B3. Fitch also cut the sovereign's rating today, to B- from B. The Asia ex-Japan iTraxx investment grade index was 3bp tighter, at 110bp/117bp. In recent financial issues, Bank of China's Green secured 2019s were at Treasuries plus 88bp, around 7bp tighter from pricing, but China Development Bank Hong Kong branch's November 2021s were at Treasuries plus 81bp, having slipped from an issue spread of 70bp.

Fischer, speaking to the Economic Club of New York, mapped out a world where low growth hamstrings central banks from effective recession-fighting, and said the U.S. economy may face longer and deeper recessions in the future if interest rates remain stuck at current low levels. Asked about the notion of raising the Fed's inflation goal to 3 percent from the current 2 percent, the No. 2 U.S. central banker said he was not enthusiastic about such tinkering. We are very close to our targets of maximum sustainable employment and 2-percent inflation, he said. To change that target if you are so close, that's a problem. The dollar and stocks fell slightly while U.S. Treasury yields added to earlier declines after Fischer's speech, in which he also said the Fed should not aim to overshoot its employment target with too much stimulus.  On Friday, long-dated bond yields also rose after Chair Janet Yellen said the Fed may need to run a high pressure economy to heal damage from the 2007-2009 recession. Possible Year-End Hike The Fed raised interest rates from near-zero in December, its first monetary policy tightening in nearly a decade, and it has since stood pat as U.S. economic growth weakened, with risks seen to have grown overseas. Still, policymakers expect to hike rates again before year end. San Francisco Fed President John Williams set off debate both within and outside the central bank when, over the summer, he floated the concept of lifting the inflation target to boost spending and investment. If some terrible fit of pessimism were to hit the economy we might find ourselves in deep trouble, but we are not there, Fischer said. I'd be very reluctant to raise the inflation target at this moment. Nonetheless, Fischer acknowledged that having very low interest rates makes monetary policy more difficult, especially if faced with a recession. Though Fed officials would still have tools such as quantitative easing and forward guidance if rates remain low, he said, these alternatives are not perfect substitutes for conventional policy. The limitation on monetary policy imposed by low trend interest rates could therefore lead to longer and deeper recessions when the economy is hit by negative shocks. 'Not Simple However, it is not that simple for the Fed to coax interest rates higher in a world where, central bankers believe, an aging population, weak demand and low investment may have undercut the country's and the world's economic potential, Fischer said. Many of the forces holding down growth, such as demographics, are beyond the reach of policy. And hopes of boosting productivity or investment may rest more with other branches of government that could boost spending at their discretion, Fischer said. Fischer did not comment specifically on the likelihood of a rate increase at the Fed's November or December meetings.   He said he had tried to quantify the implications for monetary policy, and the results were not encouraging. A decline in longer-run trend growth in gross domestic product, for example, may have cut as much as 1.2 percentage points from the expected long-run federal funds rate. Demographic trends, weak investment and slower overseas growth were pulling it down even more. The closer that long-run rate comes to zero, the less room policymakers will have in the future to counter any downturn.

Westpac will close 19 branches, while ANZ said it was planning to close seven. The decisions underscored the efforts banks are making globally to cut costs and ramp up technology and automated services as customers increasingly shift to online banking. We consider these branches are no longer viable, a situation that is unlikely to improve as the number of customers using branches continues to drop steadily, an ANZ spokesman said in an email. The branches were spread across the country and were largely in small towns and rural areas with smaller customer bases than more populous urban areas. Customers are rapidly changing the way they bank, Westpac said in a written statement. Online transactions at Westpac New Zealand have risen more than 60 percent over the past five years.

Britain's largest retail bank aims to save 400 million pounds ($528.56 million) by end-2017 by axing a further 3,000 jobs and closing an additional 200 branches to protect its earnings and dividends against the effects of lower-for-longer interest rates. Lloyds, rescued in a 20.5 billion pound taxpayer bail-out during the financial crisis, is the first major British bank to report results since the referendum and is the most exposed to any downturn in the British economy. Chief Executive Officer Antonio Horta-Osório is searching for ways to prop up Lloyds' dividend, one of its key attractions, and sustain profit growth in its main UK consumer and commercial lending market, still reeling from the Brexit result on June 24. While the business will remain highly capital generative, it is possible that this capital generation may be somewhat lower in future years than previously guided, the bank said in a statement on Thursday. So far this year, Lloyds has already said it would cut about 4,000 positions from its 75,000-strong workforce and has closed nearly 100 branches this year. The bank said it would look to sell off unwanted properties to increase income. Lloyds remains a no growth bank, Ian Gordon, an analyst at Investec, said. Its revenue outlook is flattish, hence its costs need to fall faster. The bank also said Britain's financial watchdog had opened an investigation into how it treated customers who had difficulty repaying their mortgages and said it had set aside 350 million pounds for compensation. Chief Financial Officer George Culmer said he could not provide more details because the investigation was confidential. Lloyds' shares were down 4.1 percent at 53.41 pence by 1253 GMT partly in response to the bank's caution on future capital generation and its possible impact on dividends. Profit Britain's vote to leave the EU came at the end of the bank's first half, so the likely impact on lending volumes will not become clear until the third quarter and beyond. Horta-Osorio said the bank's strategy to grow revenues in a low rate environment would involve expanding in car finance, credit cards and insurance. Lloyds reported a forecast-beating first-half statutory pretax profit of 2.45 billion pounds ($3.3 billion) in the six months to June 30. This was more than double profits achieved in the same period last year, partly because the bank did not have to set aside money for loan insurance mis-selling. Income for the first half of the year came in at 8.9 billion pounds, just below the 2015 figure. The bank said its net interest margin - a key performance measure - had widened to 2.74 percent over the period. It affirmed previous guidance of about 2.7 percent for the full year. A rise in troubled loans by almost a third to 254 million pounds took the shine off the profit beat and robust margin performance and offered a glimpse of tougher times that might lie ahead. Lloyds said it would pay an interim dividend of 0.85 pence, up 13 percent on last year. The government has put on hold plans to sell its remaining stake in Lloyds in the aftermath of the EU vote, according to people familiar with the process. Lloyds' shares have lost about a quarter of their value since the vote. ($1 = 0.7568 pounds) Editing by Sinead Cruise and Jane Merriman"

Executives at JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), the country's largest bank, say each branch earns about $1 million in annual profit, but takes a decade to reach its full potential.  Chase bankers regularly scrutinize data on branch foot traffic and what customers do while inside to determine whether a location should remain open, shut down or shrink.  The bank has shut 265 locations since 2013, roughly 5 percent of its network, but executives insist that branches remain essential for JPMorgan's relationships with customers. They are the best way to sell clients many products and services ranging from mortgages to investment advice, according to Gordon Smith, JPMorgan's head of consumer and community banking.  Often I will be asked why don't we just accelerate closings. Why don't we close 400 or 500 branches? Smith said at the 2016 investor day. The answer is that customers won't go there.  John Elmore, vice chairman of community banking and branch delivery at U.S. Bancorp, says branches are especially important for small businesses that need to deposit cash frequently, prefer to negotiate loans in person, or want strategic advice.

Their ATMs can perform more sophisticated tasks and banks have developed nifty mobile apps for routine banking needs. They are even experimenting with digital loan underwriting.  Yet customers still expect contact with bank staff and JPMorgan recently had to hire more tellers after customer complaints.

Taiwan's Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) also said it expects to complete its local investigation within two weeks. The comments come after New York's state financial regulator fined Mega's New York banking unit $180 million for violating anti-money laundering regulations, including lax attention to risk exposure in Panama. We'll need consent from U.S. regulators to inspect the branches, FSC Chairman Ding Kung-Wha said at a news briefing. If all goes smoothly, our people will leave for the United States next Monday. The inspection is to discover what led to the fine and what the unit is working on to improve related issues, Ding said, declining to elaborate. The FSC's Banking Bureau received a visit from the U.S. Federal Reserve in October to discuss topics such as financial technology, also known as fintech, said Banking Bureau Director General Austin Chan at the same press conference.We did not talk about Mega, Chan said. A Federal Reserve spokesman declined to comment. Earlier on Thursday, Taiwan's cabinet said it would tighten some of the island's anti-money laundering regulations to conform more closely to international standards.

Trump said he had sacked FBI Director James Comey - who had been leading an investigation into the Trump 2016 presidential campaign's possible collusion with Russia to influence the election outcome - over his handling of an email scandal involving presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. But Democrats immediately accused Trump of having political motives, piquing investors' aversion to risk, and sending the dollar down as much as 0.6 percent against the yen, a currency that investors favour at times of uncertainty. By 0752 GMT, though, the strong risk appetite that has dominated global markets this week appeared to be returning, and the dollar edged back above 114 yen, close to the previous day's high of 114.325. Both realised and implied volatility have fallen sharply since Emmanuel Macron defeated the anti-EU Marine Le Pen in France's presidential run-off on Sunday, as worries over European political risk have faded and focus has returned to central bank policy. The Swiss franc, another safe-haven currency, fell to its lowest in seven months on Tuesday and stayed close to that at 1.09575 francs per euro, flat on the day. Commerzbank currency strategist Esther Reichelt, in Frankfurt, though, said risk appetite could only drive the currency market so far before new drivers were needed. Dollar strength could materialize more, given the more benevolent risk environment, but that can only move the market for so long – you always need new impetus, she said. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, had hit a three-week high of 99.688 on Tuesday, but it slipped 0.2 percent to 99.415 on Wednesday. U.S. political uncertainty has tended to weigh on the dollar in recent months, on the view that a divided Congress could derail Trump's promised tax reform and stimulus programme. The 'Trump trade' lifted the dollar after the election, but now we have to see if he can deliver on all of his promises, said Bart Wakabayashi, branch manager for State Street Bank and Trust in Tokyo. The euro edged up 0.1 percent against the yen to 124.31 , close to Monday's one-year high of 124.58.

The demands aimed at ending the worst Gulf Arab crisis in years appear designed to quash a two decade-old foreign policy in which Qatar has punched well above its weight, striding the stage as a peace broker, often in conflicts in Muslim lands. Doha's independent-minded approach, including a dovish line on Iran and support for Islamist groups, in particular the Muslim Brotherhood, has incensed some of its neighbours who see political Islamism as a threat to their dynastic rule. The list, compiled by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Egypt and Bahrain, which cut economic, diplomatic and travel ties to Doha on June 5, also demands the closing of a Turkish military base in Qatar, the official told Reuters. Turkey's Defence Minister Fikri Isik rejected the demand, saying any call for the base to be shut would represent interference in Ankara's relations with Doha. He suggested instead that Turkey might bolster its presence. Strengthening the Turkish base would be a positive step in terms of the Gulf's security, he said. Re-evaluating the base agreement with Qatar is not on our agenda. Qatar must also announce it is severing ties with terrorist, ideological and sectarian organisations including the Muslim Brotherhood, Islamic State, al Qaeda, Hezbollah, and Jabhat Fateh al Sham, formerly al Qaeda's branch in Syria, the Arab official said, and surrender all designated terrorists on its territory. Qatar Won't Negotiate Under Boycott The four Arab countries accuse Qatar of funding terrorism, fomenting regional instability and cosying up to revolutionary theocracy Iran. Qatar has denied the accusations. Qatari officials did not reply immediately to requests for comment. But on Monday, Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani said Qatar would not negotiate with the four states unless they lifted their measures against Doha. The countries give Doha 10 days to comply, failing which the list becomes void, the official said without elaborating, suggesting the offer to end the dispute in return for the 13 steps would no longer be on the table. The demands are so aggressive that it makes it close to impossible to currently see a resolution of that conflict, said Olivier Jakob, a strategist at Switzerland-based oil consultancy Petromatrix. Several Qataris who spoke to Reuters described the demands as unreasonable. Imagine another country demanding that CNN be closed, said 40-year-old Haseeb Mansour, who works for telecom operator Ooredoo. Abdullah al-Muhanadi, a retired public sector shopping for groceries in Doha on Friday morning, said the boycott must be lifted before negotiations to resolve the dispute could start. There's a lot on the list that is simply not true or unreasonable, so how can we comply? he said. There are no IRGC (Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps) elements in Qatar and the agreement with Turkey is a long-standing diplomatic agreement so we cannot ask them to leave. The demands, handed to Qatar by mediator Kuwait also require that Qatar stop interfering in the four countries' domestic and foreign affairs and stop a practice of giving Qatari nationality to citizens of the four countries, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Qatar must pay reparations to these countries for any damage or costs incurred over the past few years because of Qatari policies, he added. Any resulting agreement to comply with the demands will be monitored, with monthly reports in the first year, then every three months the next year, then annually for 10 years, the official said without elaborating. U.S. President Donald Trump has taken a tough stance on Qatar, accusing it of being a high level sponsor of terrorism, but he has also offered help to the parties in the dispute to resolve their differences. Turkey has backed Qatar during the three-week-old crisis. It sent its first ship carrying food aid to Qatar and dispatched a small contingent of soldiers and armoured vehicles there on Thursday, while President Tayyip Erdogan spoke with Saudi Arabia's leaders on calming tension in the region.

Trading was pretty quiet, although we continued to see some buying of Chinese asset-management companies' 10-year bonds, said a Hong Kong-based trader. The Asia ex-Japan iTraxx investment-grade index was little changed at 83.5bp/85.25bp. The bonds of Australian major banks largely showed little adverse impact of Moody's one-notch downgrades to Aa3, with stable outlooks, of its ratings on the issuers. The newly priced floating-rate notes of ICBC, Hong Kong branch, were hovering at reoffer, said the trader. The Chinese lender priced US$300m floaters of 3 years at 3-month Libor plus 77bp and US$400m notes of 5 years at Libor plus 87bp. Road King Infrastructure's newly US$300m 7.00% perpetuals, which were priced at par, traded up and were bid at a cash price of around 100.3 in the afternoon. Noble Group's 6% perpetual bonds, callable in 2019, plunged more than 5 points to a cash price of 10 bid. This was after the commodity trader said it would delay the payment of a coupon due on the perps. The coupon is due on June 24, but payable on June 26, the next working day. Its 8.75% 2022s fell around 2 points to 35.5/37.5, according to Tradeweb. Gome Electrical's 5% 2020s were flat at 100.25, even though the company announced plans for a tap of up to US$100m of the issue. David Tan, chief investment officer at Allianz Global Investors' Asia Pacific fixed income, remains positive on Asia high-yield credits as these bonds continue to offer attractive returns, while default rates are low. With the unpredictability surrounding the Trump administration, we expect market volatility to escalate. Against the uncertain backdrop, we believe an actively managed Asian fixed income portfolio can continue to offer decent yield pick-up with relatively lower volatility within the broader emerging market universe, supported by Asia's improved fundamentals, Tan said.

Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates have sent a 13-point list of demands apparently aimed at dismantling their tiny but wealthy neighbour's two decade-old interventionist foreign policy which has incensed them. Qatar did not immediately comment, but Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani had said on Monday Qatar would not negotiate with the four states until economic, diplomatic and travel ties cut this month were restored. The countries that imposed the sanctions accuse Qatar of funding terrorism, fomenting regional unrest and drawing too close to their enemy Iran. Qatar rejects those accusations and says it is being punished for refusing to hew to regional powers' policy of supporting authoritarian, military and hereditary rulers. The uncomprimising demands leave little prospect for a quick end to the biggest diplomatic crisis for years between Sunni Arab Gulf states, regional analysts said. The demands are so aggressive that it makes it close to impossible to currently see a resolution of that conflict, Olivier Jakob, a strategist at Switzerland-based oil consultancy Petromatrix, said. Washington, which is a close military ally of countries on both sides of the dispute, had called for a resolution: Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Qatar's neighbours should make their demands reasonable and actionable. Ten Days to Comply An official from one of the four nations, who gave details of the demands on condition of anonymity, told Reuters the offer would be void unless Qatar complied within 10 days. The UAE has said sanctions could last for years. Qatar, the world's richest country per capita, says the sanctions amount to a blockade, but it has ample reserves to weather the storm. The dispute is a big test for the United States, which houses the headquarters of its Middle East air power and 11,000 troops at a large base in Qatar. President Donald Trump has backed the sanctions, even as his Defense and State Departments have tried to remain neutral, resulting in in mixed signals. Trump called Qatar a funder of terrorism at a very high level, only for his Pentagon to approve selling it $12 billion of warplanes five days later. The most powerful country in the region to back the Qatari side in the dispute has been Turkey, whose President Tayyip Erdogan has his roots in an Islamist political party similar to movements that Qatar has backed in the region. Days after the sanctions were imposed, Turkey rushed through legislation to send more troops to its base in Qatar as a sign of support. Defence Minister Fikri Isik rejected the demand to close the base, saying it would represent interference in Ankara's relations with Doha. Turkey might bolster its presence instead. Strengthening the Turkish base would be a positive step in terms of the Gulf's security, he said. Re-evaluating the base agreement with Qatar is not on our agenda. Qatar has used its vast wealth over the past decade to exert influence abroad, backing factions in civil wars and revolts across the Middle East. It infuriated Egypt's present rulers and Saudi Arabia by backing a Muslim Brotherhood government in Cairo that ruled for a year until it was deposed by the army in 2013. Qatar's state-funded satelite broadcaster Al Jazeera became hugely popular across the Middle East, but has long infuriated Arab governments used to exercising firm control over the media in their countries. Stop Interfering The demands, handed to Qatar by mediator Kuwait, tell Qatar to stop interfering in the four nations' domestic and foreign affairs and refrain from giving Qatari nationality to their citizens, the official from one of the sanctioning states said. They also include severing ties with the Muslim Brotherhood, Islamic State, al Qaeda, Hezbollah, and Jabhat Fateh al Sham, formerly al Qaeda's branch in Syria, and the surrender of all designated terrorists on Qatari territory. Qatar denies it has relationships with terrorist groups or shelters terrorists. It was also ordered to scale down its diplomatic relations with Iran, limit its commercial ties and expel members of Iran's Revolutionary Guards from its territory. Qatar denies they are there. The sanctioning countries demanded Qatar pay them reparations for any damage or costs incurred due to Qatari policies. Compliance with the demands would be monitored, with monthly reports in the first year, then every three months the next year, then annually for 10 years, the official said. Although Reuters was told about the contents of the ultimatum by an official from one of the sanctioning countries, UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash accused Qatar of leaking the demands. He said this clearly reflects the depth of the crisis as a result of the damage caused by (Qatar’s) policies. There is a price for the years of plotting and there is a price to return to the neighbourhood, Gargash said on Twitter. The leak (of demands) seeks to derail mediation. Qataris who spoke to Reuters described the demands as unreasonable, particularly the closure of Jazeera, which millions of Arabs see as an important outlet for voices willing to challenge the region's authoritarian rulers, but which neighbouring governments call a conduit for Islamist propaganda. Imagine another country demanding that CNN be closed, 40-year-old Haseeb Mansour, who works for telecom operator Ooredoo, said. A Lot on the List Abdullah al-Muhanadi, a retired public sector worker shopping for groceries in Doha on Friday morning, said the boycott must be lifted before negotiations to resolve the dispute could start. There's a lot on the list that is simply not true or unreasonable, so how can we comply? he said. There are no IRGC (Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps) elements in Qatar and the agreement with Turkey is a long-standing diplomatic agreement so we cannot ask them to leave. Qatar has only 300,000 citizens enjoying the riches produced by the world's largest exports of liquefied natural gas. The rest of its 2.7 million people are foreign migrant workers, mostly manual labourers employed on vast construction projects that have crowned the tiny desert peninsula with skyscrapers as well as stadiums for the 2022 soccer world cup. The sanctions have disrupted its main routes to import goods by land from Saudi Arabia and by sea from big container ships docked in the United Arab Emirates. But it so far has avoided economic collapse by quickly finding alternative routes, and it says its huge financial reserves will meet any challenges. Qatar says the sanctions have also brought personal hardship for its citizens who live in neighbouring countries or have relatives there. The countries that imposed the sanctions gave Qataris two weeks to leave, which expired on Monday. Additional reporting by Tom Finn and Tom Arnold in Doha, and

"https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-fed-fischer-idUSL1N1CN0WE","Fed 'very close' to employment, inflation goals: Fischer","","October 17, 2016 /  4:18 PM / 9 months ago","","NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve is very close to its U.S. employment and inflation targets, Fed Vice Chair Stanley Fischer said on Monday, as he warned against making rash changes to the policy framework in an effort to boost economic growth. Fischer, speaking to the Economic Club of New York, mapped out a world where low growth hamstrings central banks from effective recession-fighting, and said the U.S. economy may face longer and deeper recessions in the future if interest rates remain stuck at current low levels. Asked about the notion of raising the Fed's inflation goal to 3 percent from the current 2 percent, the No. 2 U.S. central banker said he was not enthusiastic about such tinkering. We are very close to our targets of maximum sustainable employment and 2-percent inflation, he said. To change that target if you are so close, that's a problem. The dollar and stocks fell slightly while U.S. Treasury yields added to earlier declines after Fischer's speech, in which he also said the Fed should not aim to overshoot its employment target with too much stimulus.  On Friday, long-dated bond yields also rose after Chair Janet Yellen said the Fed may need to run a high pressure economy to heal damage from the 2007-2009 recession. Possible Year-End Hike The Fed raised interest rates from near-zero in December, its first monetary policy tightening in nearly a decade, and it has since stood pat as U.S. economic growth weakened, with risks seen to have grown overseas. Still, policymakers expect to hike rates again before year end. San Francisco Fed President John Williams set off debate both within and outside the central bank when, over the summer, he floated the concept of lifting the inflation target to boost spending and investment. If some terrible fit of pessimism were to hit the economy we might find ourselves in deep trouble, but we are not there, Fischer said. I'd be very reluctant to raise the inflation target at this moment. Nonetheless, Fischer acknowledged that having very low interest rates makes monetary policy more difficult, especially if faced with a recession. Though Fed officials would still have tools such as quantitative easing and forward guidance if rates remain low, he said, these alternatives are not perfect substitutes for conventional policy. The limitation on monetary policy imposed by low trend interest rates could therefore lead to longer and deeper recessions when the economy is hit by negative shocks. 'Not Simple However, it is not that simple for the Fed to coax interest rates higher in a world where, central bankers believe, an aging population, weak demand and low investment may have undercut the country's and the world's economic potential, Fischer said. Many of the forces holding down growth, such as demographics, are beyond the reach of policy. And hopes of boosting productivity or investment may rest more with other branches of government that could boost spending at their discretion, Fischer said. Fischer did not comment specifically on the likelihood of a rate increase at the Fed's November or December meetings.   He said he had tried to quantify the implications for monetary policy, and the results were not encouraging. A decline in longer-run trend growth in gross domestic product, for example, may have cut as much as 1.2 percentage points from the expected long-run federal funds rate.

RBS, which is 73-percent state-owned, is in the midst of a major restructuring that includes reducing the size of its retail network as part of an aggressive cost-cutting programme. The latest job losses mean RBS will have eliminated more than one in 10 positions at its UK branch network in the past two months at a time the country's third-largest lender is faltering in its aim to be ranked best for customer service. RBS has cut about 1,350 positions out of a workforce of 12,000 people in its branch network since mid-March and has closed more branches than any other British lender in the past two years. The employees affected by the latest cuts work in Scotland, Wales or southwest England, according to the people close to the process. This is nothing short of a year-long cull of local branches across the country, said Rob MacGregor, national officer at the Unite union. RBS seem to be sending a message that properly staffed branch services are only for the privileged. The bank, which was rescued with a 45.5 billion pound ($66 billion) taxpayer bailout at the height of the financial crisis, is also cutting a further 20 branches, the sources said, taking the total to 52 closures so far this year. We review our branch network regularly to make sure the services we provide are appropriate for each local community, based on customer usage and other ways to bank in the local area, a spokesman for RBS said. RBS came bottom of more than 30 lenders for customer satisfaction in a poll this year by Britain's largest consumer body Which?, despite pledges to improve its reputation after going bust during the global financial crisis. Customers also voted RBS the worst British bank for a second year in a row in separate survey by the price comparison website uSwitch in September, with consumers putting it last for customer trust and value for money. At its annual shareholder meeting in Edinburgh last week, Chief Executive Ross McEwan justified the closure of more branches saying they were expensive and being used less as more people banked online. McEwan said the number of people going into branches had dropped by half on average since 2010, while the number of people making transactions online had jumped fourfold The use of transactions at counters is a bygone day in most cases, he told the meeting. Unfortunately, that is the harsh reality that we have to live with. $1 = 0.6919 pounds

Spain has long been among the European countries with the most bank branches per head of population and many lenders still have larger than average networks, even after cutting staff and shutting outlets in the wake of a deep financial crisis in 2012. Like peers worldwide, Spanish lenders are also trying to cope with a shift to online and mobile-based business, as well as with rising expenses derived from regulatory demands to boost capital and risk controls. There is also the threat of nascent fintech rivals exploiting new technology opportunities. Banks in Spain, like in the rest of the Eurozone, suffer the consequences of low interest rates, increased competition for a limited amount of new business, and the threat from fintech entrants, Citi analysts said in a note. In the absence of consolidation (for the moment), cost cutting in Spain is one of the very few levers left to maintain/increase earnings, the Citi analysts noted. If the announcement comes to pass, Santander will have fired the starting shot on another round of cost-cutting in Spain. Of Santander's 3,467 branches in Spain, the plan is to close around 450, the source said. Many are very small and nearly three quarters have between one and three workers, the source added, without detailing how many employees many be at risk of redundancy or the timeframe for the closures. Santander declined to comment. The bank will shut 425 branches before the end of this year, according to a statement posted late on Thursday on the website of the country's largest union, Comisiones Obreras. Santander's corporate centre, which serves as its central planning unit and manages other businesses, will also be subject to cuts, the source familiar with the discussions said. Around 1,000 Santander employees out of just over 30,000 in Spain could be affected by the branch closures and changes to the corporate centre, Expansion newspaper reported on Friday, without saying where it got the information. Other European banks, including in France and Britain, have also been shutting branches or grouping smaller offices into bigger, refurbished ones than can offer a range of services. Santander will also be upgrading some 350 larger offices this year, fitting them with more modern ATMs, the source said.

Four of six species of great apes are now rated critically endangered, or one step away from extinction, by threats such as hunting and a loss of forests to farmland from West Africa to Indonesia, according to the annual list by wildlife experts. Eastern gorillas, revised from a lesser category of endangered, join their sister species, the Western gorilla, and both species of orangutan which were already on the list as critically endangered. The other two species of great apes, chimpanzees and bonobos, are rated endangered. To see the Eastern gorilla – one of our closest cousins – slide towards extinction is truly distressing, said Inger Andersen, director general of the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) which compiles the Red List. FILE PHOTO --  An endangered silverback mountain gorilla from the Bitukura family, walks inside a forest in Bwindi Impenetrable National Park in the Ruhija sector of the park, about 550 km (341 miles) west of Uganda's capital Kampala, May 24, 2013.Thomas Mukoya/File PhotoMillions of people died in fighting in the mineral-rich east of Democratic Republic of Congo from 1996 and 2003 and militias and miners often hunted gorillas for food. The main population of Eastern gorillas, the biggest primates weighing up to about 200 kg (440 lb), tumbled to an estimated 3,800 animals in 2015 from 16,900 in 1994, according to the report issued at an IUCN congress in Hawaii. A smaller branch of the Eastern gorilla family - the mountain gorilla - has fared better with the population rising to 880 from perhaps 500 in Rwanda, Uganda and eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. Chimpanzees were most able to adapt to a loss of forest habitats to oil palm plantations or other farms, while gorillas and orangutans were less flexible. Chimps get by even if there is only a remnant of a forest, Elizabeth Williamson, of the IUCN species survival commission for primates, told Reuters. They can raid crops and steal fruit from farms - gorillas and orangutans don't.  Among other changes, the IUCN said the population of plains zebra in Africa had fallen to about 500,000 animals from 660,000, also because of hunting for their meat and stripy skins. That put the species on a watchlist as near threatened after being of least concern. Reporting By Alister Doyle; editing by Ralph Boulton"

"https://www.reuters.com/article/britain-banks-lending-idUSL4N19L3XH","British bank branch closures cut small business lending in half","","June 29, 2016 /  11:00 PM / in a year","","LONDON, June 30 (Reuters) - British banks' closure of hundreds of branches in the last three years has more than halved lending to small businesses in the areas affected, research on Thursday showed, ahead of a debate in parliament about the impact of the cuts. Britain's biggest banks HSBC, Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group  have been steadily shrinking their branch networks to cut costs while investing in online and mobile banking services. Research by campaign group Move Your Money suggested many customers were losing out as a result, with lending to small local businesses down by 63 percent in towns and villages that had lost a bank branch. The impact on communities following the closure of their last bank branch was even more striking, with a 104 percent drop in lending growth to small businesses, according to the research, based on data from the British Bankers' Association. The UK's biggest banks are abandoning communities across the country, and today for the first time we can see the incredible damage that is happening, Fionn Travers-Smith, campaign manager for Move Your Money, said. The impact of branch closures on lending in specific areas had not been closely tracked until the British Bankers' Association began releasing information in 2013 about local lending patterns. This marked a government push to increase transparency and encourage competition between banks. The Move Your Money study is one of the first to make use of that data to map how the closures have affected lending. Politicians from the main political parties have arranged to debate the issue in parliament later on Thursday and are expected to demand a tightening of the rules that govern branch closures and that banks do more to help customers affected. RBS, Lloyds, Barclays and HSBC did not respond to requests for comment. A spokesman for the British Bankers' Association said banks have signed up to protocols aimed at minimising the impact of branch closures, including partnering with post offices to offer services and carrying out impact studies before closures. Banks are determined to leave no one behind, he said. Reuters earlier this month reported that Britain's largest banks are disproportionately closing branches in the lowest-income areas while expanding in wealthier ones. The analysis found more than 90 percent of the branch closures were in areas where the median household income is below the British average of 27,600 pounds ($39,042). Banks could face more pressure on costs after Britain's vote last week to leave the European Union, potentially creating the biggest upheaval for the country's banking industry since the 2007-2009 financial crisis. The vote for Brexit has led to predictions of a recession and earnings downgrades that hit bank shares. Academics and campaign groups say Britain should enact tougher legislation like in the United States which requires banks to maintain branches and lending in poorer areas. The U.S. Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 is designed to reduce discriminatory lending against low-income areas by requiring banks to lend in communities where they are chartered. The U.S. law also has the power to block opening of new branches elsewhere if a bank does not comply.      (Editing by Sinead Cruise and Jane Merriman)"

Closing bank branches is politically sensitive, particularly in Europe, with a backlash in countries including France, Spain and Britain where opponents say remote areas or regions where people are less well off have been targeted. A Reuters analysis showed British banks are disproportionately closing branches in the lowest-income areas, while expanding in wealthier ones. The Bank for International Settlements, which represents the world's major central banks, said that now banks have reinforced their capital reserves, it is time for them to focus on profits. Persistently low interest rates, anemic economic growth and too many souring loans on balance sheets were holding back a recovery in profits, meaning banks need to pursue other ways to lift revenues, the BIS said in its annual report. It will be critical to cut excess capacity. One gauge of potential overcapacity is the density of bank branches. Lenders in Europe are already taking action. Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) and Spain's Santander (SAN.MC) are among the latest major European banks most recently looking to make significant branch closures. BIS figures in the report showed the number of bank branches per 100,000 adults in Spain and Italy was 60 to 70, compared with fewer than 40 in Japan and the United States. Its comments chime with European regulators who say Europe is overbanked, suggesting that lenders should consolidate sooner rather than later to tackle poor profitability. The BIS said the scale of cuts so far have been rather limited compared with past crises.  After the onset of the Nordic banking crisis in 1991, banks in Finland cut the number of branches by more than 40 percent within four years and slashed operating expenses by half. The Basel Committee of global banking regulators, based at the BIS in Basel, Switzerland, is completing its post-crisis bank capital rules, which lenders say will lead to Basel IV or another step-up in costly requirements. Banks say pressure from regulators to hold higher levels of capital is making a return to sustainable profitability harder, but the BIS report rejects this argument. The BIS says higher capital levels translate into better credit ratings for banks, helping to push down funding costs and increase availability of credit for the economy. There was ample room for Basel when it comes to finalizing these requirements, as research showed that additional bank capital yields sizeable economic benefits if phased in gradually, the report added.

The number of branches operated by the major banking groups in the UK has halved in the last 20 years and following political pressure a new rule was set last year that requires banks to assess the impact on local communities of a branch closure. HSBC (HSBA.L) may close the highest number with about 200 branches set to go this year, the people said. That is about a fifth of the bank's UK branches and a third more than it closed last year.Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L) and Barclays (BARC.L) are also planning to close about 100 branches each, the people said.The bank closures will accelerate the death of the British high street, said Derek French, director of the Campaign for Community Banking. This will particularly have a knock on impact on local businesses and the elderly. HSBC, RBS and Barclays said in separate statements they were reducing their branch networks as customers visit less frequently in favor of banking online or via mobile.

The number of branches operated by the major banking groups in the UK has halved in the last 20 years and following political pressure a new rule was set last year that requires banks to assess the impact on local communities of a branch closure. HSBC (HSBA.L) may close the highest number with about 200 branches set to go this year, the people said. That is about a fifth of the bank's UK branches and a third more than it closed last year.Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L) and Barclays (BARC.L) are also planning to close about 100 branches each, the people said.The bank closures will accelerate the death of the British high street, said Derek French, director of the Campaign for Community Banking. This will particularly have a knock on impact on local businesses and the elderly.

Britain's largest retail bank announced plans to save 400 million pounds by end-2017 by axing a further 3,000 jobs and closing an additional 200 branches to protect its earnings and ambitious dividend profile against lower-for-longer interest rates. Chief Executive Officer Antonio Horta-Osório is searching for ways to prop up shareholder returns and sustain profit growth in Lloyds' core UK consumer and commercial lending market, still reeling from the Brexit result on June 24. Given the uncertainty, it is too early to determine the impact on our formal longer term guidance at this stage, the bank said in a statement. However, while the business will remain highly capital generative, it is possible that this capital generation may be somewhat lower in future years than previously guided. So far this year, Lloyds has already said it would cut about 4,000 positions from its 75,000-strong workforce. The bank also said it would look to streamline its non-branch property portfolio by around 30 percent by the end of 2018. Lloyds reported a first-half statutory pretax profit of 2.45 billion pounds ($3.3 billion) in the six months to June 30, more than double the sum achieved in the same period last year. That figure was just ahead of the 2.35 billion pound average estimate of 15 analysts surveyed by the bank. Income for the first half of the year came in at 8.9 billion pounds, just below the 2015 figure. The bank said its net interest margin (NIM) - a key performance measure that tracks the difference between what Lloyds receives in interest and lends out to customers - had widened to 2.74 percent over the period. It affirmed previous guidance of about 2.7 percent for the full financial year. But a rise in impairments by almost a third to 254 million pounds took the shine off the profit beat and robust NIM result and offered a glimpse into tougher times to come. Lloyds, rescued in a 20.5 billion pound taxpayer bail-out during the financial crisis, is the first major British bank to report results since the referendum and is the most exposed to any downturn in the British economy. But as the vote to leave the EU came at almost the end of the bank's fiscal first half, the likely impact on lending volumes will remain unclear until the third quarter and beyond. Lloyds said it will pay an interim dividend of 0.85 pence, up 13 percent on last year. This leaves it with a common equity tier 1 ratio, a measure of financial strength, of 13 percent after the payout.   ($1 = 0.7588 pounds)   (Editing by Sinead Cruise)"

Spain has long been among the European countries with the most bank branches per head of population and many lenders still have larger than average networks, even after cutting staff and shutting outlets in the wake of a deep financial crisis in 2012. Like peers worldwide, Spanish lenders are also trying to cope with a shift to online and mobile-based business, as well as with rising expenses derived from regulatory demands to boost capital and risk controls. There is also the threat of nascent fintech rivals exploiting new technology opportunities. Spain's largest bank has 3,467 domestic branches and plans to close around 450 of those, the lender's Chief Executive Jose Antonio Alvarez said in the memo sent to employees. Nearly three-quarters of those have between one and three workers, according to the memo, though no details of how many employees many be at risk of redundancy or the time frame for the closures. Inevitably these measures will lead to a reduction in the number of people in the corporate centre and Santander Spain, Alvarez said. The transformation process involves taking difficult decisions, but it is essential to ensure our leadership in the coming years. Unions expect to discuss the restructuring process next week, one of the country's main unions UGT said in a statement. Around 1,000 Santander employees out of just over 30,000 in Spain could be affected by the branch closures and changes to the corporate centre, Expansion newspaper reported on Friday without citing sources. Other European banks, including in France and Britain, have also been shutting branches or grouping smaller offices into bigger, refurbished ones than can offer a range of services. Santander will also be upgrading some 350 larger offices this year, fitting them with more modern cash machines, the CEO said. Low interest rates are squeezing European banks' margins, while increased competition for a limited amount of new business and the threat of new fintech companies are also forcing lenders to consolidate, Citi analysts said. In the absence of consolidation (for the moment), cost cutting in Spain is one of the very few levers left to maintain/increase earnings, Citi said in a note.

The closing of the branches leaves the securities dealer, one of the few independent firms left in Canada's competitive wealth management space, with another 16 branches that will remain open. It said it will retain about 180 advisory teams. This initiative will allow us to make additional investments in markets where we see the most opportunity for future growth, John Rothwell, president of Canaccord Wealth Management's Canadian unit, said in a statement. Canaccord said the 16 branches it chose to close accounted for just 16 percent of the firm's C$13.1 billion ($13.4 billion) in client assets in the Canadian wealth management division, while the 16 branches to remain open accounted for the rest. After these branch reductions, it is expected Canaccord Wealth Management will operate on a near break-even basis in current market conditions. All branches remaining open have the capabilities to be consistently profitable and Canaccord is committed to their continued success and growth, the company said in a statement. It also announced on Monday it would add to its British wealth management platform with the purchase of the wealth management business of Eden Financial Ltd, a boutique private client investment management business, for C$20.3 million in cash. The purchase will result in a C$5.2 million in restructuring charges in the third quarter. With global financial market turmoil hurting business, Canaccord said in August it had a first quarter net loss of C$20.6 million, or 24 Canadian cents a share.

Ed Needham, a member of Occupy Wall Street's New York media team, said he had found no connection between the incident and his movement. It doesn't sound like something that we would do, he said. New York City police officers stand guard outside a Wells Fargo bank branch that received suspicious envelopes containing white powder, in New York City April 30, 2012. The company has closed three branches in the city that received the packages, a company spokesman said on Monday.Lee CelanoA spokesman for Wells Fargo said its branches would remain closed pending further investigation by the police. The branch locations include Third Avenue and 47th Street; Madison Avenue and 34th Street; and Broadway and 85th Street. Since it was launched eight months ago, Occupy Wall Street has targeted U.S. financial policies it blames for the yawning income gap between rich and poor - between what they called the 1 percent and the 99 percent. More than 500 protesters demonstrated at the bank's annual shareholder meeting in San Francisco last week to express anger over foreclosures, executive compensation and corporate taxes. Among other large banks, spokesmen for Bank of America Corp and JPMorgan Chase & Co said they had not closed any branches on Monday due to suspicious envelopes. A Citigroup spokesman had no immediate comment. San Francisco-based Wells Fargo is the fourth-largest U.S. bank by assets.

JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) said it had reopened 587 Chase branches, about 55 percent of the total in the states of New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Nearly 60 percent of the New York City-based bank's 3,200 automated teller machines in the area were running. Citigroup Inc (C.N), as of mid-day Wednesday, had re-opened 55 percent of its nearly 300 branches in and around New York City. Some 70 percent of 1,500 automated teller machines in the area were working. Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) said that nearly 90 percent of its nearly 1,200 branches in Maryland, Virginia, Washington, D.C., Delaware, Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey and Connecticut had re-opened. Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) said about 75 percent of its 1,700 banking centers in the Northeast were functioning again. It had 13 branches open in Manhattan and planned to have several more open on Thursday. It was also deploying mobile ATMs in the area. At least 134 of the 183 Morgan Stanley (MS.N) brokerage offices that were closed had reopened by mid-morning, the company said. The offices that remained closed either lacked electricity or were inaccessible due to flooding or other damage. Most of the closed offices were in New Jersey and New York, with some in Connecticut. Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) opened both its headquarters in lower Manhattan and its office across the river at 30 Hudson Street in Jersey City, New Jersey, on Wednesday. Goldman offices in Princeton, New Jersey, and Greenwich, Connecticut, were open for some employees, while others worked remotely. Staff in the securities division - especially those who live in Manhattan - generally came into the office, though the lack of public transportation and traffic made commutes longer than usual. Goldman's two main buildings in the New York area, on opposite sides of the Hudson River, sustained some flooding but no serious damage from the hurricane, a representative said. Citigroup's lower Manhattan buildings used for trading and investment banking remain closed. The company said on Tuesday night that it would update information on access to those Greenwich Street buildings later this week. A Citigroup spokeswoman said the company is using back-up offices to continue to do business.

Citi, the last major international bank with a countrywide presence in Greece, will cut its network to 21 branches from 37 by shutting all branches outside Athens and Thessaloniki, it said in a statement on Wednesday. About 170 jobs will go, nearly a tenth of the lender's total workforce in the country. The current business and economic environment requires adaptability... we will focus more on investment, deposit products and credit cards, a spokeswoman for Citi's Greek operations said. Other foreign banks such as Credit Agricole and Societe Generale have sold the Greek businesses they bought during the country's economic boom, when lending expanded at double-digit rates following Greece's entry into the euro. But since Greece's debt crisis took hold in late 2009, lending has shrunk and non-performing loans have soared partly as a result of austerity measures under the country's international bailout and also from the country's deepest recession since World War II. Citi, which entered Greece in 1964, had a smaller-scale presence than the French banks and did not buy a local lender. Several other foreign companies have pulled out of Greece completely because of the crisis, including French retail giants Fnac, Carrefour and Saturn Hansa, the consumer electronics unit of German retailer Metro. U.K.-based coffee shop chain Costa Coffee suspended operations at its ten Greek stores earlier this week. Other foreign firms, such as Swedish furniture maker IKEA, are cutting wages. Still, lower labour costs, as a result of austerity measures imposed by the country's international lenders, may be beginning to attract logistics and manufacturing jobs. Computer giant Hewlett Packard agreed last week to use Greece's biggest port as a transport hub for southeast Europe and North Africa. Consumer products giant Unilever also plans to shift part of its manufacturing to Greece from other European countries, the government said last week."

    PIPELINE
    Argentine electric utility company Albanesi has picked banks to meet
investors as it seeks to market a possible 144A/Reg S US dollar bond.
    Fixed-income investor meetings started last week through global coordinators
and joint bookrunners Credit Suisse and JP Morgan. UBS has also been selected as
a joint bookrunner. Expected ratings are B3/B+ by Moody's and Fitch.
    
    The Province of Chubut has wrapped up investors meetings after mandating
Bank of America Merrill Lynch and BNP Paribas ahead of a potential US
dollar-denominated bond sale.
    It is seeking to raise US$500m through amortizing notes due 2026, according
to Moody's, which assigned a B3 rating to the issue earlier this month. The
notes will be secured by a percentage of hydrocarbon royalties to be paid by the
Argentine branch of Pan American Energy to the province, the rating agency said.
    
    Argentine power company Pampa Energia plans to hire four banks to lead a new
international bond sale that will refinance debt taken out to fund its
acquisition of Petrobras's Argentine assets.
    The company plans to hire Deutsche Bank, Citigroup, ICBC and Banco Galicia
to lead the bond sale, which will refinance a US$700m bridge loan extended by
the same lenders.
    
    Mexican real-estate developer Grupo GICSA has finished investor meetings
through JP Morgan and Santander. The company had been marketing a US dollar
bond, which is expected to be rated BB/BB-.
    
    Bolivia is hoping to sell an up to US$1bn 10-year bond in the coming months,
according to Economy Minister Luis Arce Catacora. Proceeds would go mainly
towards investment in healthcare, specifically hospitals. Bolivia is rated BB by
S&P; and Fitch and one notch lower at Ba3 by Moody's.

Several of Britain's biggest lenders are in the throes of branch closure programmes to cut costs and signed up to the industry-wide agreement in March 2015. The protocol set out a number of requirements, including a pre-closure assessment, engagement with local communities, publication of an impact assessment and ensuring continued provision of alternative ways to bank. The BBA review will check whether banks are complying with the protocol and may make recommendations to amend procedures, if appropriate. More and more of us are adopting digital services to manage our money while on the move, without having to travel to a branch, Anthony Browne, Chief Executive of the BBA, said. It is important, however, that customers still have access to banking services if a local bank branch closes for commercial reasons.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/cyber-heist-bangladesh-philippines-idUSL3N1AM1DM","Bangladesh team in Manila says close to recovering only fraction of heist money","","August 5, 2016 /  7:40 AM / in a year","","MANILA, Aug 5 (Reuters) - A Bangladesh central bank team visiting Manila to recover $81 million stolen from its account in New York said it was close to getting back $15 million of the loot frozen by the Philippines, but first has to prove ownership of the cash to its hosts. Unknown cyber criminals tried to steal nearly $1 billion from Bangladesh Bank's account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in February, and succeeded in transferring $81 million to four accounts at Manila's Rizal Commercial Banking Corp , which was then laundered through the city's casinos, according to investigators. Only about $18 million, including around $2.7 million frozen by the Philippines' casino regulator, has been accounted for. The Philippines' Department of Justice (DoJ) has asked the Bangladesh Bank delegation to file a legal document staking its claim to $15 million of that, but the casino money will have to be pursued separately, said two sources close to the visiting team. We are in the final stages of recovering the $15 million, but for the rest we hope a (Philippines) senate hearing on the issue resumes so that we can get to know more details about the case, said John Gomes, Bangladesh's ambassador to the Philippines, who is helping the bank representatives on a four-day visit to Manila ending Friday. The last Philippines Senate hearing into the heist ended in May as a new government came to power under President Rodrigo Duterte. No date has been announced for a resumption. Bangladeshi officials say the money was able to disappear into the casino industry in the Philippines because of systemic failures at RCBC, not just individual error by some of its officers. RCBC's then president Lorenzo Tan told a Senate hearing in March that the incident was some judgment error from the people on the ground. The Bangladeshi delegation consists of Debaprosad Debnath and Abdul Rab from Bangladesh Bank's financial intelligence unit, and Bangladesh Bank lawyer Ajmalul Hossain. They have already met the DoJ and officials from the anti-money-laundering council in Manila, and will be seeing central bank officials on Friday. The team has prepared an affidavit citing a letter by the New York Fed to the Philippines' central bank, in which the Fed said the money was stolen from Bangladesh Bank's account. The affidavit will be given to the DoJ to file with a court, the sources said. Gomes told Reuters late on Thursday he hoped the $15 million would be returned in a month. He will hold a press conference on the issue later on Friday. Prove It Ricardo J. Paras III, chief state counsel of the DoJ, told Reuters that it has already drafted court documents to begin recovery of the $15 million, but it was important for Bangladesh to prove it is their money. The Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation (PAGCOR), a government body that regulates casinos in the country, has promised to cooperate with Bangladesh Bank to help it recover the $2.7 million it has frozen, Gomes said. The money is with Solaire (Resort and Casino), PAGCOR President Alfredo Lim told Reuters. It will put us in a bad light if the money is not immediately released to them. Solaire, operated by Bloomberry Resorts Corp, has said about $29 million of the funds came to the casino and most was transferred to the accounts of two junket operators. Solaire did not immediately return requests for comment. The Bangladeshi sources said they were writing to President Duterte, whom Gomes has already met, formally seeking his help to recover all of the stolen money. Duterte spokesman Ernesto Abella said Bangladesh Bank should reach out to the president soon. The fight against drugs takes priority over all, but this does not mean to say that (Duterte) ignores (other things), Abella said. The sources said Bangladesh Bank would take RCBC to court if these efforts fail to bear fruit. It is relying on internal RCBC documents to buttress its assertion that the bank's Jupiter Street branch in Manila ignored suspicions raised by some RCBC officials when the money was first remitted to the accounts on Feb. 5, and then delayed acting on requests from RCBC's head office to freeze the funds on Feb. 9. RCBC said in a statement to Reuters: Bangladesh should finish its own investigation to determine who the culprits were before concluding the theft was an outside job, without fault on their part.

Wednesday's announcement brings the total cuts announced so far to 5,530 since Lloyds' announced in October 2014 that it would cut about 10 percent of its staff over three years due to the increasing popularity of online banking and the automation of some back office functions. The bulk of the reductions are across Lloyds' retail businesses, although the group's commercial banking, consumer finance and legal units will also see cuts, said a spokesman at employee trade union Unite, which has been consulted. The lender, which is closing branches from this June, said it would create about 170 new roles across its retail, commercial banking and legal divisions. Shares in Lloyds were trading around two percent lower at 15.20 GMT, outperforming a weaker broader market for European banking stocks. $1 = 0.6866 pounds

Local banks and foreign lenders servicing the Irish economy have shut branches and shed thousands of jobs since the crisis hit in 2008. Ulster has already made hundreds of redundancies and last year announced a second round of job cuts involving the departure of 950 staff. It had cut 1,000 jobs in 2009. The latest redundancies were delayed by an IT failure at the bank last June, which cost Ireland's third-largest lender tens of millions of euros in compensation after salaries failed to appear in accounts and customers' household bills went unpaid. Ulster said on Thursday it was reviewing its 226 branches, which are spilt between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, and expected to be able to provide customers with further details of the closures in the next few weeks. It said it would close around 20 branches and sub offices in Ireland this year as a result of the review. Rival Allied Irish Banks, Ireland's second-largest bank, is closing a number of branches as it trims its workforce by almost 20 percent, while permanent tsb is shutting 17 percent of its 92 branches. Denmark's Danske Bank closed its network of branches last year, although it continues to serve customers through telephone and mobile banking. Bank of Ireland, the only domestic Irish lender to avoid falling under full state control, has not closed any branches since the crisis, despite also cutting its staff numbers substantially.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/european-banks-branches-idUSL6N0MZ0YR20140411","Top European banks close or sell 5,300 branches in 2013","","April 11, 2014 /  1:00 PM / 3 years ago","","LONDON, April 11 (Reuters) - Europe's top banks shut or sold 5,300 branches last year and the closures are likely to accelerate as customers embrace speedy online banking over traditional face-to-face contact. Yet many lenders are holding back from massive cuts for fear of choking off a source of new business, alienating older customers and sparking a political backlash in isolated regions. Branch closures are greeted with dismay when communities are left without a local bank. But they reflect an online revolution that is transforming the way people do everything from buying holidays and comparing insurance prices to borrowing library books and renting DVDs. They are also an ideal way for lenders to cut costs and build up more capital after the financial crisis. The figure on closures or sales last year was compiled by Reuters based on year-end statements from 26 of Europe's 30 largest listed banks. The other four do not disclose the figures routinely and would not provide them. As many as 40 percent of Europe's bank branches are expected to close between 2013 and 2020 as the digitalisation of banking takes hold, says consultancy firm Bain & Company. That would mean 65,000 fewer branches across the EU, based on European Central Bank data showing there were almost 218,000 bank branches across the region at the end of 2012. It's only the start of branch closures, said Bain's head of global retail banking, Dirk Vater. I've been a banking consultant for more than 20 years. For the first time, we'll really see some dramatic changes... The industry will be disrupted. The most drastic cuts have come in Spain, where many banks are still struggling to recover from a property crash and debt crisis and have taken a hatchet to costs. A September 2013 study by Deutsche Bank analysts found Spain had more branches per person than any other market they track. Bankia, cobbled together from seven failed Spanish regional banks and bailed out in 2012, has slashed 37 percent of its network, or 1,100 branches in 2013. The other four Spanish banks in the top 30 - Santander , CaixaBank, BBVA and Banco Popular Espanol - cut a combined 1,774 branches. Some went as banks sold foreign units, but most cuts were in Spain. Bank branch networks need to keep shrinking, Maria Dolores Dancausa, CEO of mid-sized Bankinter, said at a Madrid conference in April. I don't know if I would dare predict if that will be by half or if it needs to be more than half. Italy, Cyprus and Germany were also singled out for special mention as being over-branched in the Deutsche report, but banks from those countries, with the exception of Italy's UniCredit, cut at a slower rate than the 6 percent contraction across the 26 European banks. Branchless World? Online banks have already shown it is possible to do without an established retail network and traditional lenders are scaling up their online networks. The shift to internet banking means fewer people are choosing to visit their local bank. Royal Bank of Scotland, which has more branches than grocery chains Asda and Sainsbury's combined, said it has seen a 30 percent fall in branch transactions since 2010. Deutsche Bank analysts say retail banks can cut their expenses by up to 15 percent over the medium term by cutting branches and repositioning those that remain into smaller offices with fewer staff. Industry newcomers are embracing a branchless world. Metro Bank founder Anthony Thomson this week announced an online-only  UK bank dubbed 'Atom' to launch in 2015. Yet some banks have decided bricks-and-mortar networks are a vital part of their business and are not cutting deeply. Deutsche's head of European banks research, Jason Napier, believes a UK bank can get by with as few as 500 branches in the long term. But Lloyds has 2,254 and has committed to keeping them all open under a strategic plan that runs to the end of this year. In Germany, another market singled out as over-banked, Commerzbank cut just 0.43 percent of its network last year and executives have recently spoken of the bank's total commitment to its branch network. Cutting branches means fewer staff, lower business rents  and other overheads and can yield quick cash from the sale of valuable land and buildings. But it is not cheap to do. They've got exit costs relating to personnel and leases ... with branches and employment both sensitive (political) issues, said Napier. Ipads, Coffee, Armchairs Ian Walsh, global head of retail banking at Boston Consulting Group, said the future of bank branches wasn't just about closing them. Banks are looking to optimise their branch networks rather than eliminate it, he said. BNP Paribas added plant-covered wall, iPads for customer use and a touchscreen desk at its refurbished flagship branch near the Paris Opera in 2011. Visits to the branch had increased 40 percent by last year, the bank said. Virgin Money, one of a handful of challenger banks emerging in Britain, last month opened its fourth lounge for customers, where they can drink free coffee and fruit juice or biscuit, use iPads or watch television from an armchair. You can even play the piano or a board game. But staff do not process any banking transactions. There is free Wifi and customers get help logging onto their online accounts, but there are no tellers or ATMs. Walsh said relatively few bank customers want to do everything online and most still want branches for face-to-face conversations about complex products such as mortgages. RBS is refurbishing 250 branches to remove counters so staff can talk more easily to customers and investing 600,000 pounds in five extra mobile banks for clients with no branch on their doorstep, an approach long tried and tested in Spain. Efficiencies like mobile branches and part-time outlets can work well, Walsh said, but slashing branches can be dangerous. If you close branches .... before you ensure you still have reach into those customers, you risk cutting off the blood supply to the bank, said Walsh. We are bullish about the importance of branches as a key channel in retail banking.

In all six cases, the substance turned out to be non- hazardous, and in one case, the powder was identified as corn starch, a police spokesman said. Four of the mailed envelopes contained an identical note, which included the language Happy May Day, the spokesman said. The incident comes on the eve of a planned day of protests organized by the Occupy Wall Street movement and labor groups across the country. According to a website called maydaynyc.org, demonstrations are planned in New York City against the corporations who rule our city. Ed Needham, a member of Occupy Wall Street's New York media team, said he had found no connection between the incident and his movement. It doesn't sound like something that we would do, he said. A spokesman for Wells Fargo said its branches would remain closed pending further investigation by the police. The branch locations include Third Avenue and 47th Street; Madison Avenue and 34th Street; and Broadway and 85th Street. Since it was launched eight months ago, Occupy Wall Street has targeted U.S. financial policies it blames for the yawning income gap between rich and poor - between what they called the 1 percent and the 99 percent. More than 500 protesters demonstrated at the bank's annual shareholder meeting in San Francisco last week to express anger over foreclosures, executive compensation and corporate taxes.

JPMorgan Chase & Co said it had reopened 587 Chase branches, about 55 percent of the total in the states of New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania.

Citigroup Inc, as of mid-day Wednesday, had re-opened 55 percent of its nearly 300 branches in and around New York City. Some 70 percent of 1,500 automated teller machines in the area were working. Wells Fargo & Co said that nearly 90 percent of its nearly 1,200 branches in  Maryland, Virginia, Washington, D.C., Delaware, Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey and Connecticut had re-opened. Bank of America Corp said about 75 percent of its 1,700 banking centers in the Northeast were functioning again.

At least 134 of the 183 Morgan Stanley brokerage offices that were closed had reopened by mid-morning, the company said. The offices that remained closed either lacked electricity or were inaccessible due to flooding or other damage. Most of the closed offices were in New Jersey and New York, with some in Connecticut. Goldman Sachs Group Inc opened both its headquarters in lower Manhattan and its office across the river at 30 Hudson Street in Jersey City, New Jersey, on Wednesday. Goldman offices in Princeton, New Jersey, and Greenwich, Connecticut, were open for some employees, while others worked remotely. Staff in the securities division - especially those who live in Manhattan - generally came into the office, though the lack of public transportation and traffic made commutes longer than usual.

As part of a reorganisation into three business units, the bank said it would reduce operating costs by about 10 percent by closing the branches and shedding 250 posts. Once lauded as the only lender to avoid a state bailout due to its lack of exposure to commercial property developers, permanent tsb (PTSB) was effectively nationalised last year chiefly due to its high proportion of loss-making mortgages that track the European Central Bank's low interest rate. The bank, which like other lenders has been unable to access traditional wholesale funding during Ireland's banking crisis, won approval from Dublin's EU/IMF lenders last month to secure a viable future by moving bad assets off its balance sheet. We face significant challenges; however we are very confident about our future prospects once this restructuring plan has been implemented, Jeremy Masding, chief executive of permanent tsb said in a statement on Tuesday. Masding, who took charge earlier this year, said the bank's chief objective was to secure funding for its core banking business while minimising the losses from its loan book. Masding told a parliamentary committee last week that the bank's proportion of owner-occupier loans in arrears for more than 90 days stood at 14 percent, the highest in the sector.

The all-share deal will cost Santander around 260 million euros ($340.84 million) and will include merging unlisted private banking division Banif. Together the three brands have around 4,664 offices in Spain. We have a significantly different context, with a strong concentration in the sector and we are in a market with low growth rates, said Santander's Chief financial officer Jose Antonio Alvarez, explaining the move to cut costs. Job losses stemming from the branch closures, a sensitive subject in a country where one in four is unemployed, would be implemented gradually, the bank said, without giving details. Banesto, currently the country's seventh biggest lender with 100 billion euros in assets, had 8,303 employees at the end of September. Santander, which expects to close the deal to buy out the 10 percent of Banesto it does not already own next May, said the integration would generate savings of 520 million euros for the group by the third year of the merger. It's the right decision to try to cut costs in a market where revenues are barely growing and with Banesto trading at cheap mutiples or 0.4 times book value it makes sense, said Juan Pablo Lopez, analyst at Portuguese broker Espirito Santo. The name Banesto, founded in May 1902, will disappear in three years. The lender was bought by Santander in 1994 for around 1.9 billion euros. Spain's banks, hit by a slump in the property market and prolonged recession, are having to cut costs and trying to rid themselves of around 185 billion euros of toxic property assets. Still there are concerns that the industry may need more support as Spain has one of the highest deficits in the euro zone. In June, Spain was granted a European credit line of around 100 billion euros, of which they have accepted around 40 billion euros to date, to help shore up the balance sheet of its weaker savings banks hit by the burst of a decade-long housing bubble. Santander, the euro zone's biggest bank by market capitalisation, is one of the strongest capitalised banks in Spain, with a core capital ratio above 10 percent at the end of September. The bank said it would carry out the merger through a swap of its own treasury shares for Banesto shares, valuing the latter at 2.56 billion euros or 3.73 euros a share, 24.9 percent more than the closing price on Friday. Banesto shares closed up 18.43 percent bringing its total market value to 2.4 billion euros, while Santander dropped 1.19 percent. Santander's Alvarez said decisions about which branches will close will be based on efficiency and Banesto branches would not necessarily take the brunt of the closures. The Santander group's combined market share of branches in Spain would increase from 10 percent in 2008 to 13 percent in 2015, as its b r anch cuts over the next three years would be less than the forecast decline in the sector. Santander said the absorption of Banif, a completely owned unit of the Group, would reinforce Santander's specialised private banking network in Spain. Banif, whose integrated model of private banking sets it apart from its competitors, has 36 billion euros of assets under management and 550 employees in 52 branches. Santander's share value has risen over 10 percent this year but is still lagging behind some of its European peers due to the uncertainty which has surrounded Spanish banks lately. The full buyout of Banesto would add value from the start and increase earnings per share by 3 percent in the third year, Santander said. $1 = 0.7628 euros

Banks are suffering from higher bad loan provisions and lower profits because of the crisis, deepened by Western sanctions over Moscow's role in the Ukraine conflict and lower oil prices. Raiffeisenbank said the decision to close seven branches in six of the far east's main cities was taken because of the low potential for developing its customer base in the region, which is sparsely populated and largely served by Russian banks. In the current environment, it is important to be efficient and profitable, the bank said in a statement. In the development of our sales network, we will focus on those cities where our offices show sufficient profitability. Foreign banks have been cutting their exposure to Russia, once considered one of the world's fastest growing banking markets, since the crisis hit last year, driving the rouble down against the dollar and fuelling capital flight. Raiffeisenbank said it was considering the possible sale of its loan portfolio and customer segment of small and micro businesses, and was doing all it could to support its customers. On Thursday, Standard & Poor's rating agency said the Russian banking system could see its bad loans rise to 17-23 percent this year from around 8 percent last year, and that profit for the sector was seen at close to zero. Russia has been forced to support many of its banks with capital injections and other measures after its largest lenders were all but cut off from global financial markets by European Union and U.S. sanctions.

Citi, the last major international bank with a countrywide presence in Greece, will cut its network to 21 branches from 37 by shutting all branches outside Athens and Thessaloniki, it said in a statement on Wednesday. About 170 jobs will go, nearly a tenth of the lender's total workforce in the country. The current business and economic environment requires adaptability... we will focus more on investment, deposit products and credit cards, a spokeswoman for Citi's Greek operations said. Other foreign banks such as Credit Agricole and Societe Generale have sold the Greek businesses they bought during the country's economic boom, when lending expanded at double-digit rates following Greece's entry into the euro. But since Greece's debt crisis took hold in late 2009, lending has shrunk and non-performing loans have soared partly as a result of austerity measures under the country's international bailout and also from the country's deepest recession since World War II. Citi, which entered Greece in 1964, had a smaller-scale presence than the French banks and did not buy a local lender. Several other foreign companies have pulled out of Greece completely because of the crisis, including French retail giants Fnac, Carrefour and Saturn Hansa, the consumer electronics unit of German retailer Metro. U.K.-based coffee shop chain Costa Coffee suspended operations at its ten Greek stores earlier this week. Other foreign firms, such as Swedish furniture maker IKEA, are cutting wages. Still, lower labour costs, as a result of austerity measures imposed by the country's international lenders, may be beginning to attract logistics and manufacturing jobs. Computer giant Hewlett Packard agreed last week to use Greece's biggest port as a transport hub for southeast Europe and North Africa. Consumer products giant Unilever also plans to shift part of its manufacturing to Greece from other European countries, the government said last week."

But they are up against fierce competition from local Chinese FinTech players -- companies which are not banks but which offer digital platforms for financial services from fund management to credit card processing, peer-to-peer lending and crowdfunding.  In China, the big story is that a lot of these FinTech innovators are scaling to such a degree that they're the core financial relationship that a lot of particularly young Chinese consumers have, said James Lloyd, Asia-Pacific FinTech leader at consulting firm EY.

Britain's largest mortgage lender, rescued in a 20.5 billion pound ($29.7 billion) taxpayer bail-out during the financial crisis, is midway through a plan to close hundreds of branches and axe about a tenth of its workforce to cut costs. There has been no consultation on branch closures worthy of the name, one shareholder said at the company's annual meeting in Edinburgh, accusing the bank of backtracking on a pledge to help rural communities thrive. Your salary increase alone would pay for a branch to be open, the shareholder told the chairman, prompting applause from fellow investors. Blackwell said the bank was responding to the changing needs of its customers, many of whom were abandoning visits to local branches in favour of online and mobile banking. We have to sensibly balance the needs of individuals in a local community with the way other people are doing their banking via screens and the online network, Blackwell said, adding that Lloyds had closed fewer branches than its rivals. We expect to keep the largest branch network in the UK. The British Bankers' Association said last week it had  launched an independent review aimed at minimising the impact of branch closures on customers, amid concerns whole communities could be left without access to a bank. People want reasonable local access to a bank with a real person behind the counter...Five hours on a Tuesday is a joke but we have all stopped laughing, said another shareholder. Lloyds bucked the downward trend among major British lenders last month, maintaining flat first quarter revenue and cutting bad debts despite a tough economic environment. Chief Executive Officer Antonio Horta-Osório is looking to shed thousands of jobs to streamline the business, support   dividend payments and boost the share price so the government can revive a plan to sell its remaining 9 percent stake.

The two lenders agreed in March to a long-awaited deal which will form a bank with 171 billion euros in assets, more than 2,400 branches and around 25,000 staff. The agreement followed pressure from the government in Rome for mergers to strengthen the country's ailing banking sector. Such tie-ups are seen as a way to help Italian lenders improve profitability and better cope with 360 billion euros ($408 billion) of troubled loans from a protracted recession. Banco Popolare and BPM plan to nearly double their combined net income before extraordinary items to 1.1 billion euros  ($1.25 billion) in 2019, helped by 320 million euros in cost cuts and 140 million euros in additional revenues. The planned job cuts will be carried out through voluntary redundancies and talks with unions, which traditionally are influential shareholders in BPM, will start by Tuesday. The banks also plan to sell loans totalling 8 billion euros where creditors are deemed insolvent over a period of three years to lower the share of gross problem loans to 18 percent of total lending, from 25 percent. A dedicated unit will be set up to manage loans which are unlikely to ever be repaid. The pace of bad loan sales has been the main sticking point in thorny talks with European Central Bank supervisors. The ECB granted the deal a preliminary approval only after Banco Popolare committed to raising 1 billion euros in a share issue that will be launched in early June in order to boost provisions to cover 62 percent of most problematic loans' value. That coverage ratio is set to fall back to 59 percent by 2019 due to bad loan sales as  disposals will start with loans with the lowest residual value - and highest coverage - in an effort to minimise losses. Despite billions of euros of writedowns, Italian banks on average still value bad loans above their market prices - which mirror the significant returns required by buyers. BPM CEO Giuseppe Castagna, who will head the new entity, said the merged bank had committed to the ECB to match the   coverage levels of Italy's top three banks: Intesa Sanpaolo , UniCredit and Monte dei Paschi.

The benchmark 100-share index of the Pakistan Stock Exchange  ended 0.14 percent lower, or down 54.51 points, at 38,415.31. Volatility prevailed as the index juggled between +136 and -131 points to fall by 55 points amid profit-taking witnessed across the board, said Ahmed Saeed Khan, an equity trader at JS Securities. Oil stocks were down as global oil prices fell. Oil prices were down on Tuesday after a strong two-day rally abated amid volatility fed in part by a vote later this week in Britain that will determine whether the country will leave the European Union. National Refinery Ltd and Byco Petroleum Pakistan Ltd were the biggest losers, falling 1.38 and 1.54 percent, respectively. Profit-taking was seen in the banking sector that remained mostly negative throughout the day despite the news of China easing rules for Pakistani banks to operate in the country, Khan said. The ministry of commerce said in a televised press conference on Monday that Pakistan's largest bank, Habib Bank Ltd, had received approval to open a branch in the Chinese city of Urumqi, the first South Asian bank to be granted such a licence. The biggest loser was Bank Alfalah Ltd, which fell 3.30 percent. Cement sectors stocks too lost ground, with DG Khan Cement Company falling 1.14 percent.

The bank has more branches in and around New York than in other areas like Florida that are more commonly hit by hurricanes. And, with the city's subways damaged, getting employees around will be tough, said Emmett Vollenweider, a native of Louisiana who worked through the damage left by Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Irene, among others. The bank prepared for the storm days ago by restocking 3,200 automated teller machines in the region with currency. If there are large power outages, cash is king, Vollenweider said. While some of the 1,050 Chase branches in the area were open over the weekend, all were closed on Tuesday after super-storm Sandy slammed the region with hurricane-force winds on Monday, bringing flooding that crippled New York's subway system and closed financial markets for two days. Chase's initial goal is to reopen 100 or so branches that the bank previously identified as hub locations that can be reached by the greatest numbers of customers, even if not as conveniently as before the storm. These locations must also be within reach of enough employees to staff them. The company has lined up 150 generators and diesel fuel to power the branches, plus extra security guards to handle crowds that may form when branches reopen. The bank has hundreds of people out inspecting buildings and hundreds more trying to reach employees to learn who will be able to get to work, Vollenweider said Executives at other major banks face similar tasks. Officials at Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) said 770 of their stores in mid-Atlantic and northeastern states were closed. Citigroup Inc (C.N) had about 400 branches in the path of the storm.

SocGen, France's second-biggest listed bank, could shut down 400 branches out of the 2,221 it has in France, Les Echos said, adding that there had been no decision yet. SocGen told Reuters it planned to close about 40 branches this year but could not confirm the number mentioned by Les Echos for the next five years. We have already started to progressively optimise our network of branches by shutting down a few dozen per year (about 40 planned in 2015), the bank said in an email. We will present a detailed plan of our new 2020 model, including information on our branches, before year-end. SocGen said last week it planned to cut 420 staff in France as part of a drive to save 850 million euros ($950 million) between 2015 and 2017. Banks across Europe are reviewing their workforce numbers with the aim of cutting costs as lending margins are squeezed. SocGen said in 2014 it employed 51,794 people in France.

Rolando de Leon de Alba, general manager of Banconal, told Reuters he had received the request from Panamanian banker Moises Cohen. The matter will be considered, he said, without giving details of when a decision could be made. Cohen told Reuters the idea was to create a Banconal branch in New York to act as correspondent for Panamanian banks. The New York Department of Financial Services will review an application from Banconal if it receives one, a spokesman said. Panama's financial sector has been under pressure to improve transparency since the massive data leak known as the Panama Papers embarrassed several world leaders this month and focused attention on the operations of offshore financial centers. France in April threatened to put Panama on its tax haven blacklist, just two months after the isthmus nation was removed from the gray list of the Paris-based Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an international anti-money laundering body. Since Panama came onto the FATF list in 2014, at least 21 correspondent accounts for Panamanian banks have been canceled, according to the Panamanian finance ministry. The Panama Papers revelations have increased risks for U.S.-based banks providing services to Panamanian counterparts needing to transact in dollars, said Alma Angotti, a director at Navigant Consulting and anti-money laundering expert. Risk factors on the minds of U.S. banks could include exposure to money laundering and corruption, Angotti said.

Last year's sharpest cuts were largely contained to the embattled periphery. Crisis-stricken Greece saw one of the biggest contractions in 2012, shedding 5.7 percent of its outlets, as mergers of local banks led to 219 branch closures. The trend is expected to continue into 2013 as Piraeus (BOPr.AT) shuts some of the 312 branches it snapped up from stricken Cypriot lenders in March.

The appointment of NIC Bank, a mid-tier bank, would ensure customers receive more of their deposits after the closed bank's shareholders failed to support a proposal for swiftly reopening Imperial, the central bank said in a statement. Three small or medium-sized banks in Kenya have been closed in less than a year, unnerving investors. The central bank has said financial issues were specific to the banks concerned and did not pose a systemic risk to the economy of the East African nation, which is a regional financial centre. Earlier this year, the central bank said clients with deposits of up to 1 million shillings ($9,886.31) would receive funds in full, while those with larger deposits would have to wait for investigations to end to determine the fate of their funds. NIC, appointed by state receiver Kenya Deposit Insurance Corporation (KDIC), would oversee disbursement of a maximum of 1.5 million shillings to remaining depositors once a court rules, likely on July 4, to lift the suspension of payments. More deposit payments could be made after that following the completion of due diligence by NIC, which would assume a portion of the remaining deposits and other assets and liabilities, including a majority of Imperial's staff and branches. Central Bank of Kenya Governor Patrick Njoroge told a news conference that NIC was not acquiring Imperial Bank, and also said a moratorium on new bank licences remained in place. $1 = 101.1500 Kenyan shillings

Even in the current rate environment, deposits are a very good business, Chief Financial Officer Doug Braunstein said at an investor conference after being asked by a stock analyst if the company would consider spending less on new branches. The company's 5,600 U.S. branches, second in number only to Wells Fargo & Co's (WFC.N), have been important to the company's 18 percent growth in deposits, to $1.1 trillion, over the last 18 months, Braunstein said. This year the company has been adding 150 branches to its total. Besides catering to individuals with bank accounts, credit cards and home loans, branches support the company's services to small and mid-sized companies and its offerings of investment products to the affluent. Branches are core to our business, Braunstein said. Stock analysts and institutional investors have been increasingly pressing bank executives to justify building and maintaining branches when profit margins on deposits are at historic lows and when the Internet and mobile phones allow people to make more purchases without cash or make deposits without going to a bank. Some banks, notably Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), have been closing branches to save money. But Braunstein, speaking at a Goldman Sachs conference, argued that this is a time for JPMorgan to spend to take market share of deposits and use branches to cement its relationships with customers. When the Federal Reserve allows lending rates to rise again, JPMorgan will make more money, he said. To the extent the rate environment normalizes over time - and it may take some time to do so - there is going to be significant upside, he said. Taking questions on other topics, Braunstein said that big banks are in better shape to undergo next year's round of Federal Reserve stress tests of their capital plans, which can call for spend cash dividends and stock buybacks. Compared with past stress tests, bank portfolios are of high quality because a lot of bad loans have been written off. Banks have also had time to earn money and build up their capital cushions. And they have learned how to improve their test scores by going over past results and talking with examiners, he said. The chance of failing the stress tests has also been reduced because in the current round the Federal Reserve will allow failing banks a chance to submit a more cautious plan, he noted. The Fed has said it will publicly disclose plans that are rejected and resubmitted. Bank of America Chief Executive Brian Moynihan, at the same conference earlier in the day, said he plans to avoid having to redo his bank's plan. Braunstein also said that fourth-quarter revenue from capital markets is running 15 percent to 20 percent below that of the third quarter but should still be higher than a year earlier. He reaffirmed past assessments from JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon that JPMorgan should be able to make $24 billion in annual profit in more normal times. In recent years the company has fallen short of the goal as it recognized losses on mortgages and credit card loans, and received lower rates of interest on loans. In 2011, JPMorgan reported $19 billion in net income. JPMorgan shares were down 0.6 percent at $40.57 on Tuesday at the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

It only comes once a month and won't take them anywhere, but they're mostly happy with the service. The bus, parked up alongside a van selling frozen fish, is a mobile bank run by bailed-out Spanish lender Bankia (BKIA.MC) to serve remote areas with no branches. Inside it looks much like any other small branch, but for the elastic bands that keep the furniture in place when it's on the move. Martin, a 71-year-old villager, would prefer more frequent visits, like the weekly service that used to be provided by the local bank that merged into Bankia. It's not normal to have to take cash out for the whole month. What if it gets stolen? he said. This is the front-line reality of banking cuts across Europe, where lenders from Italy to France to Bulgaria, brought low by economic turmoil, are slashing costs and services. Banks have shut about 20,000 branches across Europe in the last four years, including 5,500 last year and 7,200 in 2011, according to a Reuters analysis of European Central Bank data. That represents the closure of about 8 percent of Europe's branches since the financial crisis, and the cull is expected to continue for many years. Banks are shrinking bloated domestic networks to improve efficiency and cutting overseas branches even more sharply, and a mobile phone and internet banking boom is accelerating the shift away from a traditional banking model, even if it risks leaving some customers adrift. The cuts have been most severe in Spain, unraveling years of expansion by regional savings banks, which had landed it with the biggest network in Europe. Its branch numbers were down 17 percent by the end of 2012 from four years earlier. But at just over 38,200 branches, Spain still had more branches per head than any country in Europe - one for every 1,210 people. A European bailout of weak lenders last year, including Bankia, was conditional on them shrinking further. In remote areas such as Maderuelo, 150 kilometers (95 miles) from Madrid, many are grateful they have the bus. Elsewhere, newcomers to the service might not count themselves so lucky; in the eastern region of Valencia, the bank is rolling out the bus service for the first time as it cuts over 1,000 sites across the country. A Catalyst in Spain Other countries such as France are also ripe for cuts. France had the most branches in Europe by the end of last year, with nearly 38,450, or one for every 1,709 people, behind only Spain and Cyprus per person. Cyprus had one branch per 1,265 people, and its banks, rocked by links to the tumbling Greek economy, also have to shrink after an EU bailout. Many banks admit they are not cutting branches as quickly as they should, wary of putting off clients just as bank earnings are recovering, and fearful of a public or political backlash in countries like Britain, where some of the biggest lenders were rescued by the taxpayer. Customers wait for their turn to enter a bank bus during its monthly call on customers in the village of Maderuelo, central Spain, June 4, 2013.Sergio Perez (SPAIN - Tags: BUSINESS)When you close a branch, you run the danger of losing at least a few clients, said Paris-based Fabrice Asvazadourian, global co-head of financial services at consultant Roland Berger. It's the moment that gives people an excuse to consider switching banks. French banks are cutting branches at a slower pace than Spanish peers, trimming only 79 in 2012, according to ECB data. It had shed less than 3 percent of its network in the four years to the end of 2012, while 5 percent of UK branches and more than 8 percent of German ones pulled down the shutters for the last time. The number of branches plummeted by a third in Denmark and by a quarter in the Netherlands. A flurry of Spanish bank mergers in the past three years in part explains the deep cuts. A 2008 property crash that gutted banks' earnings and led to a European rescue added urgency to the cull as the economy fell into recession for the best part of the last five years. The country shed nearly 700 more branches in the first three months of 2013, data from the Bank of Spain showed. Villagers wait for their turn inside a bank bus during its monthly call on customers in the village of Corral de Ayllon, central Spain, June 4, 2013. Picture taken June 4, 2013.Sergio PerezIn Spain, the economic problems have been a catalyst. Perhaps without that things could have carried on the way they were for a little longer, said a Madrid-based banker from Barclays (BARC.L). Rise of the Internet Subsidizing unprofitable branches is a luxury few can now afford. Branches account for around 60 percent of retail banking costs, including property and refurbishment spending as well as staff pay, Deutsche Bank researchers estimated. Formats such as internet banking are adding to the incentive to shut outlets. These could yield 15 billion to 20 billion euros in extra earnings by 2021 for European banks, according to consultants McKinsey and industry body the European Financial Management and Marketing Association. In France, major banks such as BNP Paribas (BNPP.PA), Societe Generale (SOGN.PA) and Credit Agricole (CAGR.PA) have made clear their intention to cut costs as retail revenues are squeezed by belt-tightening consumers. In Britain, with a branch network one-third of France's or Spain's, banks have almost halved branch numbers since 1990. Senior bankers privately say a network of 700-800 outlets would be an optimal size for a bank covering all of Britain. None of the big five have so few. Lloyds (LLOY.L) has three times that (2,260), and Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L) more than twice (1,750), excluding almost 1,000 branches they are already selling between them. Cuts across Europe should allow banks to improve the branches that remain, and many are targeting a look and feel akin to the stores of consumer electronics powerhouse Apple (AAPL.O), combining tellers and technology. But it's a transition that risks leaving millions of clients behind, unless banks keep up minimal physical services. In Corral de Ayllon, a Spanish village of 60-odd inhabitants near Maderuelo, where most people are farmers or pensioners, changing habits will be hard. Like many in the village, retired local farmer Tomas Aribas withdraws cash using account booklets and fears that in future the banking service might be inaccessible to him and his neighbors. We'd have to learn about the Internet to be able to use it, he said. Additional reporting by Christian Plumb in Paris, Laura Noonan and Steve Slater in London; Editing by Will Waterman"

The Fed has said it will publicly disclose plans that are rejected and resubmitted. Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan, at the same conference earlier in the day, said he plans to avoid having to redo his bank's plan. Braunstein also said that fourth-quarter revenue from capital markets is running 15 percent to 20 percent below the third quarter, but should still be higher than a year earlier. He reaffirmed past assessments from JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon that JPMorgan should be able to make $24 billion in annual profit in more normal times. In recent years the company has fallen short of the goal as it recognized losses on mortgages  and credit card loans and received lower rates of interest on loans.

It only comes once a month and won't take them anywhere, but they're mostly happy with the service. The bus, parked up alongside a van selling frozen fish, is a mobile bank run by bailed-out Spanish lender Bankia to serve remote areas with no branches. Inside it looks much like any other small branch, but for the elastic bands that keep the furniture in place when it's on the move. Martin, a 71-year-old villager, would prefer more frequent visits, like the weekly service that used to be provided by the local bank that merged into Bankia. It's not normal to have to take cash out for the whole month. What if it gets stolen? he said. This is the front-line reality of banking cuts across Europe, where lenders from Italy to France to Bulgaria, brought low by economic turmoil, are slashing costs and services. Banks have shut about 20,000 branches across Europe in the last four years, including 5,500 last year and 7,200 in 2011, according to a Reuters analysis of European Central Bank data. That represents the closure of about 8 percent of Europe's branches since the financial crisis, and the cull is expected to continue for many years. Banks are shrinking bloated domestic networks to improve efficiency and cutting overseas branches even more sharply, and a mobile phone and internet banking boom is accelerating the  shift away from a traditional banking model, even if it risks leaving some customers adrift. The cuts have been most severe in Spain, unravelling years of expansion by regional savings banks, which had landed it with the biggest network in Europe. Its branch numbers were down 17 percent by the end of 2012 from four years earlier. But at just over 38,200 branches, Spain still had more branches per head than any country in Europe - one for every 1,210 people. A European bailout of weak lenders last year, including Bankia, was conditional on them shrinking further. In remote areas such as Maderuelo, 150 kilometres (95 miles) from Madrid, many are grateful they have the bus. Elsewhere, newcomers to the service might not count themselves so lucky; in the eastern region of Valencia, the bank is rolling out the bus service for the first time as it cuts over 1,000 sites across the country. A Catalyst in Spain Other countries such as France are also ripe for cuts. France had the most branches in Europe by the end of last year, with nearly 38,450, or one for every 1,709 people, behind only Spain and Cyprus per person. Cyprus had one branch per 1,265 people, and its banks, rocked by links to the tumbling Greek economy, also have to shrink after an EU bailout. Many banks admit they are not cutting branches as quickly as they should, wary of putting off clients just as bank earnings are recovering, and fearful of a public or political backlash in countries like Britain, where some of the biggest lenders were rescued by the taxpayer. When you close a branch, you run the danger of losing at least a few clients, said Paris-based Fabrice Asvazadourian, global co-head of financial services at consultant Roland Berger. It's the moment that gives people an excuse to consider switching banks. French banks are cutting branches at a slower pace than Spanish peers, trimming only 79 in 2012, according to ECB data. It had shed less than 3 percent of its network in the four years to the end of 2012, while 5 percent of UK branches and more than 8 percent of German ones pulled down the shutters for the last time. The number of branches plummeted by a third in Denmark and by a quarter in the Netherlands. A flurry of Spanish bank mergers in the past three years in part explains the deep cuts. A 2008 property crash that gutted banks' earnings and led to a European rescue added urgency to the cull as the economy fell into recession for the best part of the last five years. The country shed nearly 700 more branches in the first three months of 2013, data from the Bank of Spain showed. In Spain, the economic problems have been a catalyst. Perhaps without that things could have carried on the way they were for a little longer, said a Madrid-based banker from Barclays. Rise of the Internet Subsidising unprofitable branches is a luxury few can now afford. Branches account for around 60 percent of retail banking costs, including property and refurbishment spending as well as staff pay, Deutsche Bank researchers estimated. Formats such as internet banking are adding to the incentive to shut outlets. These could yield 15 billion to 20 billion euros in extra earnings by 2021 for European banks, according to consultants McKinsey and industry body the European Financial Management and Marketing Association. In France, major banks such as BNP Paribas, Societe Generale and Credit Agricole have made clear their intention to cut costs as retail revenues are squeezed by belt-tightening consumers. In Britain, with a branch network one-third of France's or Spain's, banks have almost halved branch numbers since 1990. Senior bankers privately say a network of 700-800 outlets would be an optimal size for a bank covering all of Britain. None of the big five have so few. Lloyds has three times that (2,260), and Royal Bank of Scotland more than twice (1,750), excluding almost 1,000 branches they are already selling between them. Cuts across Europe should allow banks to improve the branches that remain, and many are targeting a look and feel akin to the stores of consumer electronics powerhouse Apple , combining tellers and technology. But it's a transition that risks leaving millions of clients behind, unless banks keep up minimal physical services. In Corral de Ayllon, a Spanish village of 60-odd inhabitants near Maderuelo, where most people are farmers or pensioners, changing habits will be hard. Like many in the village, retired local farmer Tomas Aribas withdraws cash using account booklets and fears that in future the banking service might be inaccessible to him and his neighbours. We'd have to learn about the Internet to be able to use it, he said."

The Outlook is Stable.  The rating reflects the financial strength of parent The Hongkong and Shanghai  Banking Corporation Limited (HKSB; 'AA'/Negative), given that HSBCSL is a branch of HKSB and is part of the same legal entity as HKSB. Thus, Fitch believes that  support from HKSB would be forthcoming if required, subject to any regulatory  constraints on remitting money into Sri Lanka. HKSB is rated above Sri Lanka's  IDR of 'BB-'/Stable.   HSBCSL's National Long-Term Rating is at the highest end of the National Rating  scale. A downgrade of HSBCSL rating could result from HKSB's rating falling  below Sri Lanka's IDR. Any changes to Fitch's expectation of support from HKSB  could be negative for the rating.  Management indicates that although Sri Lanka is not among HSBC's 22 priority  markets, as an important network market, HSBC is committed to investing in Sri  Lanka.   Fitch expects the pace of lending at HSBCSL to remain close to the 23% credit  ceiling imposed by the regulator. Lending remains largely to corporates (70% of  loans at end-2011) reflecting the branch's traditional focus. The remainder  comprises the non-corporate sector that includes credit cards (13%).  The branch's gross non-performing loan (NPL) ratio decreased to 2.5% at end-H112 and end-2011 from 3.6% at end-2010, reflecting an improved operating environment alongside close credit monitoring. HSBCSL's provisioning policy is conservative, with specific provision coverage of NPLs of 78% at H112 and end-2011.  HSBCSL's equity/assets ratio increased to 10.5% at end-H112 and 9.7% at end-2011 from 8.5% at end-2010 through the retention of profit. The last repatriation of  profit to the head office took place in 2010; such repatriations depend on the  bank's capital requirements each year.   The branch's net interest margin (NIM) improved to 5.9% (annualised) in H112  after dropping to 5.1% in 2011, reflecting an increase in market interest rates  and the lifting of the interest rate cap on credit card loans. In addition, as  part of the HSBC group, the branch continues to benefit from low funding costs.  Pre-tax return on assets increased to 5.6% (annualised) from 3.7% in 2011,  reflecting a rebound in NIM and increased foreign exchange income as seen across the sector.   Fitch notes that although deposits remain the primary source of funding for  HSBCSL (54% of funding at end-H112), their share has been decreasing from a high of 71% at end-2007.    Established in 1892, HSBCSL is Sri Lanka's largest foreign bank branch and the  sixth-largest licensed commercial bank, accounting for 5.7% of banking sector  assets at end-2011. It is the largest issuer of credit cards in Sri Lanka,  accounting for 25% of cards in use and 42% of outstanding credit.   (Caryn Trokie, New York Ratings Unit)"

The state-backed bank is considering options for these branches because European competition authorities have ordered RBS to sell them as a consequence of a 45.5 billion pound ($67.80 billion) bailout by the British government during the 2008 financial crisis. The talks on Monday are effectively a pre-sale dialogue between prospective shareholders and RBS. Former Tesco director Andrew Higginson, tipped to run the business after its spin-off, is hosting the meeting to find out the type of bank these asset management firms are prepared to put their investors' cash into, the sources said. If you can make a clear case of what you feel constitutes a good business - the loans you're happy to remain on the books and what needs to be hived off - it means that you will get a business that you genuinely like, said one source. The source spoke on condition of anonymity and declined to identify other investment managers taking part because of the sensitivity of the situation. RBS declined to comment. The new business, which would revive the British banking brand of Williams & Glyn's, will be composed of 315 branches. A plan to sell these branches to Spain's Banco Santander  fell through in October. RBS chief executive Stephen Hester said last month that a lack of buyers for UK bank assets meant a stock market sale of the business was now RBS's baseline plan. The bank has said it expected to ask for an extension to an end-2013 deadline to sell the branches. One head of equities at a large British fund manager who has attended earlier meetings about a stock market listing of the branches said the quality of assets, the valuation under discussion and the proposed management structure, were all spurring potential interest. We don't get too excited one way or another on these things because so many have slipped up ... but there's a chance this time so we'll have a proper look at it, the investor said. Rising equity markets across Europe have spurred a revival  in new stock market listings this year reflecting renewed appetite for new shares among fund managers. British insurer esure and estate agent Countrywide Holdings are both pursuing listings while house builder Crest Nicholson  returned to the stock market in February. "

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lloyds-nbnk-idUSBRE83B0UR20120412","NBNK back with new bid for Lloyds bank branches","","April 12, 2012 /  2:10 PM / 5 years ago","","LONDON (Reuters) - New British banking venture NBNK NBNK.L has made a fresh bid for 632 Lloyds (LLOY.L) bank branches, putting it back in a race with shops-to-banking group The Co-Op, whose offer has run into regulatory problems. NBNK said it was offering an alternative demerger plan for the Lloyds branches, which are estimated to be worth between 1 billion-1.5 billion pounds ($1.6 billion-2.4 billion). It wants to buy the branches and potentially float them so that Lloyds' shareholders -- including the UK taxpayer -- could receive cash and/or shares in a new, listed banking group. Lloyds has been ordered by European regulators to sell the branches by November 2013 as payback for a bail-out with taxpayers' money during the 2008 credit crisis, which left Britain owning a 40 percent stake in Lloyds. NBNK has not yet started talks with Lloyds due to the exclusivity period between Lloyds and Co-Op. NBNK, which has a current market capitalization of around 45 million pounds, is confident it can raise the money to pull off a Lloyds branch deal. We have strong support from investors in achieving our objectives and we are confident that we can raise the money, obviously at the right price, Chief Executive Gary Hoffman told Reuters. The one thing I won't talk about is the price that we've offered, he said, adding that people had speculated that this could involve a fundraising of up to 2 billion pounds. Hoffman also said the assets could be worth in excess of 1.5 billion pounds. Lloyds shares were up 1.7 percent in early afternoon trade, outperforming a flat European banking sector .SX7P and a 0.4 percent rise in Britain's benchmark FTSE 100 index .FTSE. The details of NBNK's offer are sketchy. As a trade buyer with an existing business, it would make more sense to do a deal with the Co-Op, but I don't think the Co-Op can actually deliver, said Shore Capital analyst Gary Greenwood. Lloyds said it remained in exclusive talks with Co-Op. NBNK had lost out on the deal last year when Co-Op became the preferred bidder. But both Lloyds and Co-Op said last month that the deal was proving complicated and Co-Op warned it could walk away. Britain's financial regulator raised concerns that Co-Op, which is yet to appoint a chief executive for its financial services division, lacked the necessary experience to manage one of the country's biggest retail banking networks. Complicated Deal A sale of the Lloyds retail branches would create Britain's seventh-biggest bank, and as such this has attracted a lot of scrutiny from British authorities. It would mark an important step in Britain's plans to sell its 40 percent Lloyds stake and 82 percent holding in rival bailed-out lender Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L) back to the private sector. NBNK pledged that its plan would not result in any redundancies or branch closures, and that NBNK had the necessary skills to integrate the various banking software systems. Hoffman was also confident that a stock market listing of the new bank would attract investors, despite market volatility. If you invest in Barclays (BARC.L), HSBC (HSBA.L), or RBS or Lloyds, then only about 20 pence of every pound you invest goes into UK retail banking. The rest goes into investment banking or asset management or corporate banking or Brazil or Greece or Spain or Italy or whatever, he said. Over many years, the returns in UK retail banking have been much higher than group returns. If you can produce a pure UK retail play, with very good ROE (return on equity), without dilution coming from the rest of the group, then it is an attractive proposition for investors, he added. NBNK was set up in 2010 by former Lloyd's of London insurance head Peter Levene to buy up British banking assets. It has been also linked with a takeover of the British operations of Australia's NAB (NAB.AX). Hoffman declined to comment on NAB but said NBNK would have to close if it failed to pull off a takeover. Ultimately, if there is a not a large acquisition available, we would close.

A 1.65-billion-pound ($2.6 billion) deal to sell the branches collapsed last month after Spanish bidder Santander (SAN.MC) said the process of carving out the business from RBS had proved more difficult than expected. RBS, ordered to sell the branches as a condition of winning European approval for a state bailout during the 2008 financial crisis, has sent new sales documents to prospective buyers, and is hoping to draw up a shortlist next month. Strategically we want to enter into the SME (small and medium-sized enterprise) space. If there's anything I could do that would accelerate our strategy it would be of interest, Nationwide Chief Executive Graham Beale told Reuters on Tuesday. Within that context, RBS is something which we will watch very carefully. Beale said Nationwide was running the rule over the branches but would only proceed if it was convinced the complexities involved in executing a deal could be overcome. There are clearly some enormous complexities there, otherwise that deal would have been done. We need to understand just what those issues are before we can be committal on the point, he said. Beale said he anticipated difficulties in separating the business from RBS as it was not a standalone entity but an amalgamation of assets embedded in a whole host of systems. Funding No Problem Beale said Nationwide would have no problem funding the transaction if it chose to proceed with a bid. If we were to do the RBS transaction, of all the things I'd be concerned about, funding wouldn't be one of them. If you look at the strength of our balance sheet, we've got one of the strongest solvency ratios in the industry, he said. Santander agreed to buy the RBS branches in August 2010 but technology and separation issues pushed back the original December 2011 completion date and the bank eventually concluded a deal could not be reached in a reasonable timeframe. Sources close to the matter have said businessman Richard Branson's Virgin Money and U.S. private equity firm J.C. Flowers are also interested in the branches. Corsair Capital, led by former Standard Chartered (STAN.L) chairman Mervyn Davies, and a joint venture between Blackstone and Anacap, the backers of new bank Aldermore, have made expressions of interest as well, sources have said. Any deal, however, is expected to fall short of the price agreed with Santander. RBS wants to have a shortlist of possible buyers in place by the middle of December and will then look to cut that down to two serious bidders, sources have said. It is planning a stock exchange listing of the business if a sale can't be agreed. UBS is advising RBS on the sale process. Nationwide also said it had set aside a further 45 million pounds to compensate customers mis-sold loan insurance, joining rivals in stepping up provisions and taking its total compensation bill to 173 million pounds. The cost of the compensation for the rising level of payment protection insurance (PPI) claims, along with higher impairment charges in Nationwide's commercial lending division, led to a decline in first-half underlying profit to 151 million pounds, against 181 million pounds the previous year. Britain's financial services industry could face a total bill of more than 15 billion pounds to cover compensation payouts for one of the country's biggest mis-selling scandals. PPI policies were typically taken out alongside a personal loan or mortgage to cover repayments if customers fell ill or lost their job, but they were often sold to people who would not have been eligible to claim on the policies.

Greek banks, which have been closed for weeks as the near-bankrupt country negotiates a bailout deal with international creditors, face liquidity problems and are bracing for a deep overhaul including closures or mergers. They will probably open again next week, propped up by  emergency funding from the European Central Bank announced on Thursday.    As part of an earlier bailout agreement, Greek lenders committed to restructuring their operations, selling off assets held in the Balkans and focusing on their domestic market.  As part of Friday's agreement, Alpha will be allowed to repatriate around 100 million euros ($108.5 million) of funds from Bulgaria, bank officials said. Unlike all other Greek-owned banks in Bulgaria that are subsidiaries under the supervision of the Bulgarian central bank, Alpha operates as a branch, meaning the central bank in Sofia cannot exercise full control over the lender.       Eurobank runs a subsidiary in Bulgaria known as Postbank, while Alpha bank runs a network of outlets there that are controlled from Athens, which have been allowed to stay open despite bank closures and capital controls in Greece.    Completion of the proposed transaction is expected by end of 2015 following the execution of definitive transaction documentation and the obtaining of all approvals required, the two banks said in a joint statement. The proposed transaction is capital neutral for Alpha Bank and is fully aligned with its commitment to focus its operations only on its core markets, they said. Bulgaria is vulnerable to the fallout from the debt crisis unfolding in its European Union neighbor, as more than a fifth of Bulgaria's banking assets are owned by Greek lenders. The deal will increase Bulgaria's central bank controls over Alpha Bank's operations and assets in the country, something that each central bank prefers, said Georgi Ganev of Sofia-based think-tank the Centre for Liberal Strategies.  It is possible that the deal will also decrease some of the risks that stem from the fact that Alpha Bank is a branch and not a subsidiary, Ganev added. Eurobank Bulgaria had assets worth 5.9 billion levs (3 billion euros) at the end of March and posted a first-quarter net profit of 20.8 million levs. Writing by Matthias Williams; Editing by Jason Neely and David Holmes"

Chief Executive Antonio Horta-Osorio and Chairman Win Bischoff will answer questions from the Treasury Select Committee (TSC) about why the deal, which would have created a challenger to Britain's dominant lenders, fell through after lengthy negotiations. Since the talks ended in April, the financial health of the Co-operative Bank has come under scrutiny, with rating agency Moody's downgrading its credit rating to junk status and warning it might need taxpayer support - something the bank has denied. Industry and political sources said lawmakers want to get to the bottom of why the talks were allowed to proceed for so long at a time when Co-op Bank's capital position was so precarious. Industry sources say the bank is facing a capital shortfall of up to 1 billion pounds ($1.6 billion). There had been strong cross-party political support for the Co-op to play a bigger role in UK banking because of the firm's ethical credentials. The Co-operative is Britain's biggest mutual business, owned not by private shareholders, but by more than 6 million individuals. Industry sources had expressed doubt about the deal's viability for several months prior to it collapsing, mainly citing concerns over how the Co-op would meet regulatory capital requirements. Co-op's new Chief Executive Euan Sutherland has overhauled the group's senior management in recent weeks, appointing a group finance director and a chairman and chief executive at Co-op Bank. Andy Haldane, a member of the Bank of England's Financial Policy Committee (FPC), on Tuesday told the TSC, which oversees the work of Britain's finance ministry, that the Moody's downgrade of Co-op Bank had been a surprise to almost everyone. It's clear that further needs to be done to put Co-op into a situation of resilience and sustainability and my colleagues at the PRA (Prudential Regulation Authority) are working closely with Co-op's new management on just that, he said, referring to another part of Britain's financial regulatory setup.

Juncker, whose appointment to head the European Union's executive was strongly opposed by British Prime Minister David Cameron, said Jonathan Hill will become the European Union's  first dedicated financial services commissioner, giving him huge influence over the City of London and rivals Paris and Frankfurt. Cameron's spokesman said the appointment of Hill, who was leader of Britain's upper house of parliament, the House of Lords, will ensure that the voice of EU members from outside the euro zone will be fully represented in the bloc's wider single market. Financial services is a very significant sector here in the UK  so we welcome that and look forward to working with Lord Hill and the entire Commission-designate, the spokesman said. London is the 28-country bloc's biggest financial centre. Britain, one of the most Eurosceptic countries in the bloc, has become more antagonistic towards Brussels as supervision of banks and markets shifts increasingly to the EU level. This loss of national power has fueled a surge in support for British anti-EU party UKIP, prompting Cameron to promise a referendum on membership of the EU in 2017 if he is still prime minister after national polls next year. It's a very good appointment for the City, Chris Cummings, chief executive of TheCityUK, which promotes Britain as a financial centre. In the context of British membership of the EU, it demonstrates that other member states are keen to listen to the reform perspective Britain has put forward, Cummings said. Cameron has urged the EU to push harder for growth as the euro zone, Britain's biggest export market, stutters. Simon Lewis, chief executive of the Association for Financial Markets in Europe, a banking lobby, said Hill's appointment recognises the importance of Europe's capital markets at a crucial moment, as an unprecedented array of new regulatory measures reach the implementation phase. Olive Branch Hill, a public relations consultant and former chief of staff to former UK prime minister John Major, will oversee one of Juncker's core projects: to create a capital markets union that will expand markets such as asset-backed securities to fund economic growth as banks regroup after the financial crisis. His remit will help ease growing concerns in the City that the euro zone countries will call the shots from November under new EU voting rules which will give the currency union a ready-made qualified majority to push through pan-EU laws. In addition, the bulk of lawmakers in the new European Parliament's two main parties, the centre right EPP - from which Britain's Conservatives exited - and the socialists, are drawn mainly from euro zone countries like Germany, Italy and Spain. Also from November, the European Central Bank becomes the direct supervisor for the euro zone's biggest banks which represent the bulk of banking assets in the EU, giving it enormous clout in financial policy and rule making. While the EU has approved a welter of new regulation since the 2007-09 financial crisis forced European taxpayers to prop up banks, many of the rules have yet to be fully implemented. Key pieces of controversial legislation still remain to be approved at a time when the City worries that Britain's influence in Brussels has weakened after Cameron's failed attempt to stop Luxembourger Juncker. This is a significant economic portfolio - particularly given President Juncker's pledge to create a capital markets union, said Simon Walker, director general of Britain's Institute of Directors, an industry lobby. Entrusting this commitment along with financial services to a UK Commissioner is a clear demonstration that British influence in Brussels is far from waning, Walker said.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-obama-iran-idUSTRE80C26V20120113","Obama's olive branch to Iran turned into sanctions hammer","","January 13, 2012 /  8:39 PM / 6 years ago","","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama entered the White House in 2009 carrying an olive branch for Iran, determined to show the world that Washington would not play the villain in a relationship marked by blood and bitterness over three decades. Obama chose his words with excruciating care in reaching out to Iran publicly and privately, including through secret letters to Iran's Supreme Leader. The new president emphasized he wanted a new beginning with a country that called the United States the Great Satan and was branded by his predecessor as part of an axis of evil. Obama intended to go the extra mile on engagement, his aides said, so if the gambit failed, allies and adversaries alike could not point the finger at the United States as the bad guy. Instead, they would rally behind the effort to pressure Iran. Three years later, tensions over Iran's nuclear program have escalated to their highest level in years. Tehran is threatening to block the Strait of Hormuz and the chances of a miscalculation that could lead to a military clash - and a global oil crisis - appear to be rising. Diplomacy has given way to harsher tactics, with Obama and his European allies trying to isolate the Islamic republic with the toughest sanctions ever. Interviews with U.S. officials reveal a strategy of watching and waiting and a belief that the West's leverage over Iran may grow as Tehran feels the heat from the sanctions and popular upheaval in the Middle East. One official also predicted that the neighboring government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, a key Iranian ally, would ultimately collapse, adding to the worries of Iran's leaders. It's our assessment that the Assad regime is not going to survive, White House deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes told Reuters. The fall of the Assad regime would substantially impact Iran's strategic position in the world and the region. The combination of those sanctions and the demise of the Assad regime is a level of pressure that the Iranian government has never been under before, he said. The White House insists that the United States is not pursuing a strategy of seeking regime change. We are absolutely not, Rhodes said. It's very much the policy of the United States to change Iran's behavior through our sanctions and through isolation, not to change the Iranian regime. Obama remains open to talks with Iran, aides say. But after years of disappointment, with a U.S. election looming, and with Congress and allies like Israel lobbying him to stand tough, Washington sees the next move as Tehran's, officials and European diplomats say. How Obama arrived at this point is a story of peace offers made and rebuffed, a crushed revolution on Tehran's streets, and dashed hopes for a civilian nuclear deal. At the start of the 2012 U.S. election year, Iran and its suspected quest for a nuclear bomb is firmly at the top of Obama's foreign policy priorities. Reaching Out Obama began with outreach - some of it unusually direct. Early in his term, the president sent a personal letter to Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khameini, who holds ultimate power, to show the seriousness of the outstretched hand. A letter from the president was the clearest signal of our intentions that we could possibly make, a U.S. official said. The United States and Iran do not have formal diplomatic ties. Obama was closely involved in writing the letter that took account of their differences on nuclear and other issues, made clear there were two paths, and expressed a desire for a different kind of relationship, officials said. It was also a test to see if a serious dialogue could begin. Related CoverageFactbox: What next for Congress on Iran sanctions?And in an unprecedented March 2009 Persian New Year message to the people and leaders of Iran, Obama repeatedly referred to the Islamic Republic of Iran. It was a recognition of the formal name of the government and a signal that regime change was not the U.S. policy. The intention was to show a U.S. president who is not playing the villain in Iranian politics, Rhodes said. When you have a U.S. president who is not playing that role and saying look we've had a difficult history, let's look forward, the regime loses one of its most powerful propaganda tools, he said. But Khamanei's response to Obama's 2009 letter contained nothing encouraging that the administration could act on. A second letter was sent to Khameini tied to that response. Turning Away Late in 2009, Obama's policy began to shift. In September, he took to the world stage at a Group of 20 summit in Pittsburgh, flanked by the leaders of Britain and France, and revealed that Iran was building a secret nuclear fuel plant underground near the holy city of Qom. The previous evening, Obama made sure his aides had briefed Russian and Chinese officials, who had not known about the facility. In October, in direct talks in Geneva, the United States and its allies offered nuclear fuel for a civilian nuclear reactor in Tehran. In exchange, Iran would ship its enriched uranium outside the country, where it would be rendered unusable for a potential nuclear weapon. Iran never picked up on the offer. The final straw when Iran declared in February 2010 that it would begin enriching uranium up to 20 percent. By the end of 2009, we were fully shifted to the notion of pursuing a U.N. Security Council resolution with more sanctions, one official said. Obama's critics and political opponents assert that his initial outreach was dangerous and displayed a lack of judgment. Leading Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney in November accused Obama of naïveté in his efforts to engage Tehran. Obama's approach to dealing with Iran's nuclear ambitions was a case study in botched diplomacy, he said in an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal. Current and former Obama aides disagree sharply. There was never any illusion or naïveté about who the regime was. There was never any assumption that we would pursue this regardless of their behavior, said Dennis Ross, a top White House adviser on Middle East policy until last month. If they weren't prepared to be responsive, then the assumption always was this will make it easier for us to mobilize real pressure against them, he said. Obama was also criticized as missing a golden opportunity when the largest street protests in the Islamic republic's history broke out after Iran's disputed June 2009 election. The protests, ultimately quashed with violence, did appear to catch the White House by surprise. But aides defended the muted U.S. response. We knew that too overt an embrace in some ways could hurt the Iranian opposition, said Jim Steinberg, former deputy secretary of state. Especially when it looked like they had a chance of prevailing, we didn't want to undercut them and strengthen the hand of the hardliners. A Soft War? U.S.-Iran tensions continued to ratchet up, and a string of events made it look to the outside world like an undeclared soft war was under way. The United States accused Iran's shadowy Quds Force in a plot to assassinate the Saudi ambassador to Washington. The Stuxnet computer virus attacked centrifuges at Iran's Natanz enrichment facility. Iran accused Israel and the United States. Late last year, the United States lost a spy drone in Iran, unmasking an aggressive surveillance program. There have been unexplained explosions at an Iranian missile depot and four nuclear scientists have been killed in Iran - the latest on Wednesday. We had absolutely nothing to do with the deaths of any of these scientists or the missile depot. Things exploding in Iran do not have anything to do with the United States, a U.S. official said. Iran reacted to those events and the stepped-up economic sanctions as if under siege. It threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz, a major oil shipping lane. They feel themselves under threat internally. They talk about the soft overthrow and the covert war that is being waged, said John Limbert, a professor of Middle East studies at the U.S. Naval Academy. U.S. officials downplayed the possibility that Iran would follow through on its threats. Iran has threatened to close the Strait before, usually when its leaders feel international pressure, another U.S. official said on condition of anonymity. It's doubtful Iranian leaders want an all-out war, but they'll continue to agitate and push the envelope in ways they believe advance their national interests, the official added. Waiting for Iran Obama is still open to an Iranian overture for serious negotiations on its nuclear program, officials say. Indeed, that is the ultimate goal of the pressure strategy, they say. We have a number of ways to communicate our views to the Iranian government, and we have used those mechanisms regularly on a range of issues over the years, White House National Security Council spokesman Tommy Vietor said. But any message that we have delivered to the Iranian government would be the same as what we've said publicly, Vietor said. For now, Obama is focused on new sanctions that target Iran's central bank and oil sales. We are already seeing ... a really substantial impact on the Iranian economy, the Iranian currency, Rhodes said. The next step for us is making sure that as we do that there is continued space for the Iranian government to take a different path, rather than simply seeing our pressure as an end of itself. But with Iran announcing it has begun enrichment at the protected underground site near Qom, and Israel not ruling out a unilateral strike on Iran's nuclear sites, time may be short. U.S. intelligence agencies say there is no evidence that Iran has decided to move forward with building a nuclear weapon. But experts point out it is taking steps to lay the groundwork so it can move quickly if that decision is made. If Iran decided to move forward, it would be about a year away from having a crude nuclear explosive device, David Albright, president of the Institute for Science and International Security, said. They still don't know quite how to move forward without getting caught, he said. Additional reporting by Arshad Mohammed and Warren Strobel; Editing by Doina Chiacu"

A target date fund is a type of mutual fund that adjusts its allocations based on a specific target date, typically changing holdings to become more conservative as the date approaches. From 2009 to 2011, the average asset-weighted target date fund allocation to commodities, real estate and Treasury inflation-protected securities more than doubled to 7.2 percent from 3.6 percent, according to the study, conducted by BrightScope Inc., which researches and rates 401(k) plans. Some target date funds have more than a quarter of their allocations dedicated to these asset classes, according to BrightScope. For example, institutional shares of the Allianz Global Investor Solutions 2015 Fund had 40.7 percent of its portfolio in commodities, TIPs and real estate, up from 24.7 percent in 2009. Fidelity Investments' Freedom Income Fund had 14.7 percent in these asset classes in 2011, up from 2.3 percent in 2009. The shift is significant because many target-date managers do not invest in any commodities, real estate or TIPs, said Eddie Alfred, vice president of data and research at BrightScope. For firms like Allianz, much of that increase in allocation is due to managers investing more in TIPs. We have shortened our longer Treasury exposure and upped our TIPs exposure because the 10-year Treasury has really lost purchasing power, said Mark Hathaway, portfolio specialist. An increasing number of target-date fund managers are looking at areas like TIPs because they are concerned about the long-term implications of inflation on returns, said Josh Charlson, an analyst at Morningstar Inc. Investors and advisers just need to understand how their managers are using these asset classes and what their expertise is, he said. Even TIPS carry their own kinds of risks. At the same time, many target date managers are increasing their allocation to exchange-traded funds, according to BrightScope. Franklin Resources' Franklin Templeton Investments, The Hartford Financial Services Group, ING Index Solutions and Nationwide Financial are among the managers that have increased their allocation to ETFs over the past couple of years, according to BrightScope. Given recent regulations that require greater disclosure of 401(k) plan fees to employers and plan participants, more firms may add ETFs because they can be cheaper than their mutual fund counterparts, said Brooks Herman, head of research at BrightScope. From 2009 to 2011 expenses on target date funds decreased to 0.72 percent From 0.75 percent. Meanwhile, some firms have gotten out of target date funds altogether. In the past few months, Oppenheimer Funds, Goldman Sachs Asset Management and Columbia Funds have announced or have closed their target date funds after failing to gain significant assets. Columbia has $196 million in target date fund assets, Oppenheimer has $624 million, and Goldman Sachs has $67 million, according to BrightScope. The new trend shows how difficult it is for asset managers to gain market share in the target date fund space, Alfred said. The largest record keepers of 401(k) plans essentially act as gate keepers over which funds go into these plans, and many of them, like Fidelity, Vanguard and T. Rowe Price Group have their own target date funds which they put in plans, he said. Fidelity, Vanguard and T. Rowe have 75 percent of the target date funds space, he said. Everyone else is competing for scraps. (BrightScope corrects billions to millions in paragraph 16) Reporting by Jessica Toonkel; Editing by Walden Siew, Leslie Adler and Kenneth Barry"

The attack caused no casualties or damage but forced the facility to be closed as a precaution, though state energy company Sonatrach said Algeria's gas production had not been affected. This operation has destroyed your claims to have defeated 'terrorism' as you like to describe it, the Islamist militant group said in a statement directed at the Algerian government and Western oil companies. Even if your Western masters believed you were in control previously, how will you justify your position now?  Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb has claimed several attacks across the region recently, including an assault on a resort in Ivory Coast on Sunday that killed 18 people it said was revenge for a French offensive against Islamist militants in the Sahel. Algeria, emerging from its own 1990s war with Islamist fighters that killed 200,000, has become an important partner in the Western campaign against Islamist militancy. The OPEC nation is also a major gas supplier to Europe. Attacks in the North African country are rarer since it ended its civil war, but al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and fighters allied with Islamic State are still active, mostly in the remote south and mountains east of Algiers.

Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said Paris was determined to press ahead with Berlin on stronger economic governance in Europe to resolve the debt crisis -- a persistent German demand but a divisive issue for the ruling Socialist Party in France, where many are reluctant to cede more authority to Brussels. President Francois Hollande's policy of showing sympathy to debt-laden nations like Italy and Spain as they face more austerity demands has stirred concern in some quarters that he is not closely enough aligned with Germany's Angela Merkel. Yet Ayrault, a German speaker who has input on bilateral issues, said Paris was keenly focused on relations with Berlin, the euro zone's top economy and effective paymaster. The next phase of European construction will only be possible thanks to Franco-German agreement, Ayrault told an annual conference of France's Medef business chamber. The Franco-German couple is more necessary than ever. But as Paris and Berlin lay plans for closer economic union, they should not shut out the views of other EU partners, Ayrault said, adding that Italy in particular must play a driving role. His comments, which seemed aimed at silencing any concerns about the Franco-German relationship, were echoed by other senior cabinet members. Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius told a meeting of French ambassadors that the Paris-Berlin axis was crucial to Europe. Finance Minister Pierre Moscovici, meanwhile, told Les Echos newspaper that, while there had been a period of apprenticeship, relations with Berlin were now working well. Officials in Berlin have suggested that Hollande, who won power in May with a campaign against German-led austerity, has recognized that he needs to work closely with Berlin to resolve the four-year-old euro zone crisis. The French have finally realized that they need us to get things done in Europe, one senior German official said this week, after a meeting between Moscovici and his German counterpart Wolfgang Schaeuble in Berlin on Monday. Moscovici told Les Echos he had set up a Franco-German working group with Schaeuble to forge a common position on euro zone issues and competitiveness. We are ready to go further in European integration provided each step includes a further element of solidarity. That is why we have not dropped the idea of pooling national public debts, he was quoted as saying. Determined to Keep Greece in Euro Last weekend, Hollande followed Merkel's firm line after meeting with Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras in Paris, saying Greece must show its commitment to reform before receiving further aid from Europe. Ayrault, however, made it plain that France continues to favor further support for southern Europe. Integration with solidarity that means, in the short term, that we are determined to do everything to keep Greece in the euro zone, he told the conference. It also means strengthened stabilization mechanisms for our partners in southern Europe. In this context we must push ahead quickly with a banking union, he said, referring to plans for joint European bank supervision. Ayrault said that, with the euro zone's debt crisis weighing heavily on France's economy, his government's top priority was to restore stability to Europe and this meant France must stick scrupulously to its own EU deficit-cutting commitments. He reiterated that France was determined to retain its financial credibility by hitting its 3 percent deficit target next year, though he recognized that this would require paring back spending next year. The government needs to find some 30 billion euros ($38 billion) in deficit cuts next year, half of which it has said will come from spending. But budget restraint alone is not enough, we see that today in the countries of southern Europe: without growth, nothing is possible, he said. Ayrault also sought to comfort corporations alarmed by billions of euros in tax rises in this year's budget, telling the Medef conference that an upcoming tax reform would help to improve France's flagging competitiveness -- an apparent reference to plans to reduce social charges on labor.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-financial-bankers-equity-idUSBRE84R08920120528","Bankers branch out as equity activity dries up","","May 28, 2012 /  9:26 AM / 5 years ago","","LONDON (Reuters) - Faced with depressed share sale activity in Europe this year, investment bankers are having to find other ways to justify their salaries and avoid potential redundancies. Deepening concern over the euro zone has sent investors running for cover, and with stock markets choppy, companies have been reluctant to launch equity offerings for fear of having to sell their stock cheap. This has left investment banks who run such deals facing a big drop in income and looking to other activities to make up the gap, from building future client relationships to offering alternative fundraising services. The total amount raised in equity capital markets (ECM) in Europe so far this year is just $57 billion, down 37 percent on the same period last year, according to Thomson Reuters data. Initial public offerings (IPOs), particularly vulnerable to volatile markets because of the length of time they take to complete, have been the biggest casualty, with proceeds tumbling 79 percent year-on-year. Other than stock market debuts by Swiss group DKSH (DKSH.S) and Dutch cable firm Ziggo ZIGGO.AS in March, the largest European listings since July 2011, the region has seen little flotation activity of any note this year. Overall fees paid to underwriters running European ECM deals - which also includes rights issues and convertible bonds - are down 41 percent on the same period last year at $894.5 million, while total IPO fees have dropped 73 percent to just $125 million, according to data from Freeman Consulting and Thomson Reuters. While German chemicals firm Evonik is pushing ahead with plans for a multi-billion dollar listing next month, bankers said others were waiting to see the outcome of the Greek elections on June 17 before making a final decision. And with the summer break fast approaching, there is unlikely to be much activity until at least September. So far the sector has avoided widespread job cuts, with banks keen not to disadvantage themselves should there be a turnaround in market sentiment. It is a long lead-time business, so people are reluctant to cut back, said one senior ECM banker. Unsustainable Model? For now, bankers are redistributing their efforts to busier areas and spending more time courting companies. It is about going out there and seeing companies which might float this year, next year or the year after, spending more time trying to drum up business even if it's not near-term business, said one London-based banker. One of the main complaints around the IPO market last year was that investors wanted to see companies earlier ... That means you can at least be busier at the front end. But some say that even pitching for new business is slowing, with bankers spending less time on the road and companies looking more closely than before at their alternative options. Those banks with a strong international presence are able to focus their efforts on taking firms to markets which have been more bouyant, such as New York, while others are spending more time on pre-IPO financing, or redistributing people to busier parts of the business, such as restructuring. Bankers are increasingly being given multiple geographies to cover, said Stephane Rambosson, managing partner of advisory and executive search firm Veni Partners and a former ECM banker, while those people banks are keen to keep may be moved into broader advisory roles. In the past, sometimes each of the large countries had a managing director, now they have often pulled them together, Rambosson said. They also need to have ever-broader sets of skills to include equity-linked and strategic derivatives as well. So-called strategic equity solutions, an area which includes activities such as margin lending - or lending to finance investments in shares and managed funds - and structured derivatives options, is also becoming a bigger part of ECM departments' work, bankers said. While bankers said other regions, such as the United States and Hong Kong, are also now showing signs of slowing, their ECM budgets for the year as a whole will have been cushioned by having had a better first half. But with fees in Europe having fallen over the last few years, to much lower levels than in the United States, and with an increasing number of banks working on each deal - meaning fees have to be split more ways - some feel staffing levels in Europe, at around 30 to 50 people in the ECM departments of larger banks, are unsustainable. With natural attrition rates much lower than usual, cuts are becoming more likely, bankers said. There is also expected to be a greater push to share resources between ECM and other investment banking teams such as M&A;, or within capital markets groups, which would also include debt financing. I just can't see how we are going to sustain the current model, at least in Europe, Rambosson said. If the European market continues to be slow, ECM teams to me are way too big, and if I were heading up an investment bank I would definitely push for integration. Editing by David Holmes"

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-usa-zarif-idUSBRE96S0VO20130729","Iran nominee seen as olive branch to United States","","July 29, 2013 /  7:20 PM / 4 years ago","","DUBAI/PARIS (Reuters) - If Iranian President-elect Hassan Rouhani wanted to signal his determination to rebuild relations with the United States and strike a grand bargain, he could hardly do better than pick Mohammad Javad Zarif as his foreign minister. Iranian news agencies reported on Monday that Zarif, a former ambassador to the United Nations and Tehran's leading connoisseur of the U.S. political elite, is set to be in the cabinet Rouhani will announce after taking office on Sunday. A source close to Rouhani confirmed Zarif will be nominated as foreign minister. A fluent English speaker who earned his doctorate at the University of Denver, Zarif has been at the center of several secret negotiations to try to overcome 35 years of estrangement between Washington and Tehran, diplomats said. Those talks failed because of deep mistrust on a range of disputes from Iran's secretive nuclear program and support for anti-Israeli militants to U.S. sanctions and hopes of engineering regime change in Tehran. Zarif's elevation, however, suggests the moderate new president is keen to make another try at breaking the deadlock. He was always trying to do what was possible to improve relations in a very intelligent, open and clear way, said a senior Western diplomat who had repeated dealings with Zarif. This is someone who knows the United States very well and with all the frustrations of the past is still someone they know in Washington, he said. The usual caveats about Iran apply: under the Islamic Republic's complex institutional set-up, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei calls the shots in foreign and security policy and controls the nuclear program, which Western powers say is aimed at developing atomic weapons. The foreign minister ranks roughly fourth in the foreign policy pecking order, after Khamenei, the head of the National Security Council, who also serves as Iran's chief nuclear negotiator, and the president. Nevertheless, assuming he is confirmed by Iran's prickly, conservative-dominated parliament, Zarif's appointment would be a strong gesture of positive intent towards the United States. The two countries have had no official ties since 1980 after Iranian students occupied the U.S. embassy in Tehran, taking 52 diplomats hostage in protest against Washington's admission of the former Shah after he was toppled by the Islamic revolution. Contact Book Zarif's Washington contact book includes Vice President Joe Biden, Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel and a who's who of U.S. national security officials on both sides of the aisle. The soft-spoken career diplomat resigned from the nuclear negotiating team after hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was elected in 2005. In 2007, he returned from New York after five years as Iran's permanent representative to the United Nations and found himself out of favor as his country turned its back on the notion of seeking better ties with the West and Ahmadinejad sidelined English-speaking diplomats. Since then, Zarif has been in a holding pattern, nominally senior adviser to the foreign minister from 2007 to 2010, then from 2011 international director of Islamic Azad University, a network of educational institutions established by ex-president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, his political patron. Rafsanjani, who is also Rouhani's mentor, has long favored a pragmatic rapprochement with the United States, but Khamenei has stamped on all such efforts since he succeeded the founder of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, in 1989. Dennis Ross, a veteran U.S. diplomat who served as President Barack Obama's top Middle East adviser until 2011, said Zarif had shown a willingness to negotiate in good faith and his appointment would be seen in Washington and Europe as an indication that Rouhani wants to do business with the West. But he cautioned that the question remained whether this would translate into an easing of Tehran's resistance to curbing its nuclear drive. Zarif is not someone who does favors for the United States, Ross said. He fits the category of a sign or signal until you see Iran actually doing something. Brent Scowcroft, national security adviser to President George H.W. Bush, described Zarif as reasonable but said much would depend on how much leeway he is given. Western diplomats said Zarif was a central negotiator in the last major effort to negotiate a grand bargain between Tehran and Washington that began after the September 11, 2001, attacks on the United States and foundered in mid-2003. U.S. newspapers published in 2007 the bare text of a draft agreement, put together in secret talks in Paris, Geneva and New York, that would have established negotiations between the two countries on all outstanding issues. While the draft fell short of an agreement on substance, it noted both sides' expectations on issues such as assurances that Iran's nuclear program has no military capability, and assurances that the United States would act against anti-government People's Mujahideen activists based in Iraq. The texts are authentic, said a Western diplomat who was involved in the back-channel talks, confirming that Khamenei had given the green light for negotiations to go ahead. Hostage Negotiator Years earlier, as a junior diplomat Zarif was involved in negotiations to win the release of U.S. hostages held by pro-Iranian gunmen in Lebanon, according to the memoirs of former U.N. envoy Giandomenico Picco. Even though the United States did not make a promised reciprocal goodwill gesture at the time, Zarif remained committed to improving ties. In Washington, Trita Parsi, president of the pro-dialogue National Iranian American Council, said Zarif has been involved in multiple U.S.-Iranian negotiations, including talks on Afghanistan after the U.S.-led 2001 invasion, and Tehran's 2003 proposal for a grand bargain with the United States. Based on my interviews with him, (Zarif) was involved in the drafting of it, Parsi said of that offer of a comprehensive new start, which then President George W. Bush's administration spurned. Veteran U.S. diplomat James Dobbins, the U.S. point man at a 2001 Bonn conference that formed a new Afghan government after the overthrow of the Taliban, credited Zarif with a pivotal, positive role in the diplomacy - and with a sense of humor. Dobbins - now the State Department's special envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan - recalled in 2007 testimony to the U.S. Congress how Zarif, then a deputy foreign minister, persuaded the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance to drop its demand for control of an outsize proportion of Afghan ministries. The Northern Alliance delegate remained obdurate. Finally, Zarif took him aside and whispered to him for a few moments, following which the Northern Alliance envoy returned to the table and said: ‘Okay, I agree. The other factions can have two more ministries. And we can create three more, which they can also have.' We had a deal, Dobbins recalled. Zarif had achieved the final breakthrough without which the (Hamid) Karzai government might never have been formed.

Last year's cuts come after 7,200 branches were axed in 2011, according to data analysed by Reuters from European Central Bank statistics. Banks across Europe have been closing branches in a bid to trim operating costs and improve their battered earnings. Consumer take-up of online and telephone banking services has accelerated the trend. The data show EU banks cut 8 percent of branches in aggregate in the four years to the end of 2012, leaving 218,687 branches, or one for every 2,300 people. Last year's sharpest cuts were largely contained to the embattled periphery. Crisis-stricken Greece saw one of the biggest contractions in 2012, shedding 5.7 percent of its outlets, as mergers of local banks led to 219 branch closures. The trend is expected to continue into 2013 as Piraeus shuts some of the 312 branches it snapped up from stricken Cypriot lenders in March. Spain, where massive loan losses have put banks under fierce pressure to cut costs, lost 4.9 percent, or 1,963, of its branches in 2012. Ireland's branch network contracted by 3.3 percent and is expected to shrink again in 2013, while Italy's network was 3.1 percent smaller by the end of the year. Branch numbers were on the rise in some eastern European countries including Poland (up 4 percent), the Czech Republic (up 2.3 percent) and Lithuania (up 1.8 percent). In Britain, the ECB data showed the number of branches remained little changed at 11,870. The ECB gathers data on lenders' branch networks across the EU, and the data Reuters reviewed included the 27 EU member states at the end of 2012. Croatia has since become the 28th member. ECB data can differ from statistics from national banking groups, depending on criteria for inclusion."

Facing a challenging revenue environment and  stricter capital requirements, U.S. banks will likely focus on branch network  rationalization as a critical aspect of cost restructuring efforts. A number of large U.S. banks have cut the number of branches in recent years,  particularly as mobile banking options have expanded and the frequency of  customer branch visits has fallen sharply. Branch operating costs are a  significant component of a bank's total cost structure, given their large  staffing and real estate requirements. This is particularly true in  heavily-overbanked cities such as Chicago, where the ratio of branches to  customers remains extremely high. We believe rationalization initiatives undertaken by banks with high  branch-related costs, will continue as the industry operating environment  remains tough. However, much of the rationalization process will involve a  redesign of branch footprints, functions and labor requirements rather than a  sole focus on branch closings. We think the branch of the future could look very  different, with a shift in emphasis to technology in place of direct contact  with bank personnel. Despite their declining importance as a customer contact point, branches remain  important for U.S. banks in such areas as mortgage origination and investment  management, where a complete cut-over to digital relationships is unlikely.  Increased use of technology to expand customer touch points could ultimately  serve as a new growth model, with branches continuing to play a part in  solidifying customer relationships. Successful execution of branch network rationalization will require significant  investment to outfit the branches of the future with customer interfaces that  can eventually drive savings in labor and real estate costs. We think the larger  U.S. banks are best positioned to complete this transition successfully. Higher  near-term capital costs, driven by technology investment, will likely be offset  by lower branch network operating costs over time.

The bank was reacting to reports it would shut 400 UK branches, or a quarter of its network, as part of more cost cuts that would be announced in fourth quarter results on Feb. 11. Barclays dismissed that, but said it would take a 330 million pound ($547 million) charge in its results to cover litigation and regulation penalties. We have consistently been clear that, over time, there will be fewer traditional branches as we move to provide banking services to customers where and when they find it most convenient, a spokesman said. This will be driven by the needs of our customers and, therefore, there is not a target for a number of branches to be closed, nor a time frame for such action. Barclays has the third biggest branch network in Britain, with 1,593 branches, behind only Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland. Those three banks, and others, are expected to pare their branch networks as customers increasingly use internet and mobile platforms and lenders try to raise profitability. Barclays is trialling smaller sites in Asda  supermarkets, which could replace some traditional branches. The Sunday Telegraph this week said Barclays could cut 400 UK branches and 40,000 staff, but said that would be over six years, citing sources at the bank. The banking industry is going through what I like to call a 100-year transformation, Barclays Chief Executive Antony Jenkins said last week in Davos. But any branch closures could spark a political and public backlash, especially in small communities with few banks. Barclays said it will never leave a community without the ability to transact. Jenkins is due to lay out a final phase of his overhaul plan at next month's results and set new targets on how staff conduct themselves as he tries to improve culture following a string of industry scandals. He aims to cut 1.7 billion pounds in annual costs under a strategic overhaul - dubbed Project Transform - he unveiled a year ago, which involved axing 3,700 jobs, pruning the investment bank and shutting nearly one in three branches in continental Europe. He is attempting to find more cost cuts, and Barclays will  cut several hundred jobs in its investment bank, a person familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. Jenkins will set out eight commitments for the bank to achieve by 2018. He said last week these would form the last piece in this big transformation he is making at the bank. "

Some 32 percent of U.S. bank customers use mobile banking at least once a month, half-again as many as last year, consulting firm Accenture said in a survey released on Tuesday. Of those who took out a car loan, 21 percent did so online, double the portion the year before. Twenty-five percent went online for a home mortgage, up from 15 percent. The shifts came even as almost four out of five people said they will visit bank branch offices just as frequently, if not more so, five years from now. Branch closings would be inconvenient, two-thirds said. Half said they would switch banks because of a branch closing. Having people want more digital banking and branches too, means trouble for bank executives, said Michael Goodson, an Accenture managing director for financial services. There is a risk of moving too slowly and a risk of moving too quickly, in terms of alienating customers, Goodson said. Accenture found that customers feel little loyalty to banks and would likely switch to a more appealing competitor if they thought the change would not be difficult. Branch real estate and staff cost the top 25 U.S. banks about $50 billion a year, more than information technology, call centers or other operating expenses, according to Accenture. Processing deposits digitally can cost 95 percent less than using human tellers. Gordon Smith, chief executive for consumer banking at JPMorgan Chase & Co, said at an investor conference last week that the company is adding about 100 branches a year to its network of 5,652, up 7 percent from 2010 and second in size only to Wells Fargo & Co's 6,217 locations. Branches continue to attract customers and deposits, Smith said. Still, JPMorgan's pace of building is one-third its former rate and the new branches are smaller and have 20 percent fewer employees. Bank of America has reduced its count by 10 percent since 2010 to 5,243. Full-service banks could lose as much as 35 percent of their market share to more digitally-adept peers and newcomers by 2020, said Wayne Busch, head of Accenture's banking practice in North America.

Britain's fourth-largest bank is expected to cut about 30-40 jobs as a result of the closure of the three branches, one of the sources told Reuters. The sources declined to be named as they are not authorised to speak to the media. In December last year, Barclays said it would stop making retail loans as part of its new strategy to focus only on wealth management and corporate and investment banking operations in India. We took a decision then to sharpen our focus in India on corporate and investment banking and wealth management and to reduce over time our retail banking presence to a core network of branches serving the high net worth individuals segment, Barclays said in a statement on Tuesday. The Barclays branches that will be closed are in Rajahmundry in southern India, and Ahmednagar and Junagadh in western part of the country, the sources said. One of the sources said it may shut some other smaller branches over the next few months. Foreign banks in India face stiff competition from local  rivals such as top lender State Bank of India and No. 2 ICICI Bank, and have managed to capture only a small share of the country's retail banking business."

The bank reported a pretax loss of 75.8 million pounds ($126 million), compared with an 844.6 million pound loss in the same period the previous year.  Britain's seventh-biggest lender, which has 4.7 million customers, came close to collapse last year after a 1.5 billion pound capital shortfall was exposed. A recapitalization saw the Co-operative Group's ownership of the bank fall to 20 percent.  The bank said on Friday it had cut its payroll by 21 percent in the past year to 5,860 and closed 46 branches, reducing its branch network by 16 percent since the start of the year.

BOC President Chen Siqing met senior executives at the bank's Zhejiang branch this month and demanded the branch not be a drag on the country's fourth-biggest lender, said the three sources with direct knowledge of the matter.

Right now the Japanese market is the most exciting in the world, Daiwa CEO Takashi Hibino told a briefing for media and analysts, crediting Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's policies to fix the economy with sparking growing interest in the stock market. There is no bigger business opportunity out there. Japan's Nikkei average closed on Thursday at 15,037.24, near five-and-a-half year highs reached in a rally of 70 percent over the past six months. While the expansion plan for Daiwa's 123-branch network has yet to be officially approved by the brokerage's management, Hibino said Daiwa would mainly add satellite branches, which are typically smaller and cost less to operate than large, flagship branches. It would also boost by about 50 percent its staffing at branches and call centres, currently around 4,000, Hibino said, and add several billions of yen to its fixed cost base. Last month SMBC Nikko Securities, Japan's third-largest brokerage, unveiled plans to add 25 new branches over the next three years for an increase of about 20 percent. Industry leader Nomura Holdings Inc has not disclosed any plans to add to its nationwide network of around 180 branches. Japanese brokerages reported bumper profits in the latest quarter with the Nikkei upswing pumping up their bread-and-butter businesses of broking stocks and mutual funds. Hibino said he was optimistic that Abe's reflationary economic policies would accelerate a shift of Japanese household financial assets, collectively equal to $15 trillion, out of savings accounts and into the markets. Japanese now have 13 percent of their assets in marketable securities. If doubled to 28 percent - the average of Britain, Germany, France, Italy and Canada - that would unleash a 236 trillion yen pool of capital for investment, Daiwa said.

Some 32 percent of U.S. bank customers use mobile banking at least once a month, half-again as many as last year, consulting firm Accenture said in a survey released on Tuesday. Of those who took out a car loan, 21 percent did so online, double the portion the year before. Twenty-five percent went online for a home mortgage, up from 15 percent. The shifts came even as almost four out of five people said they will visit bank branch offices just as frequently, if not more so, five years from now. Branch closings would be inconvenient, two-thirds said. Half said they would switch banks because of a branch closing. Having people want more digital banking and branches too, means trouble for bank executives, said Michael Goodson, an Accenture managing director for financial services. There is a risk of moving too slowly and a risk of moving too quickly, in terms of alienating customers, Goodson said. Accenture found that customers feel little loyalty to banks and would likely switch to a more appealing competitor if they thought the change would not be difficult. Branch real estate and staff cost the top 25 U.S. banks about $50 billion a year more than including information technology, call centers or other operating expenses, according to Accenture. Processing deposits digitally can cost 95 percent less than using human tellers. Gordon Smith, chief executive for consumer banking at JPMorgan Chase & Co, said at an investor conference last week that the company is adding about 100 branches a year to its network of 5,652, up 7 percent from 2010 and second in size only to Wells Fargo & Co's 6,217 locations. Branches continue to attract customers and deposits, Smith said. Still, JPMorgan's pace of building is one-third its former rate and the new branches are smaller and have 20 percent fewer employees. Bank of America has reduced its count by 10 percent since 2010 to 5,243. Full-service banks could lose as much as 35 percent of their market share to more digitally-adept peers and newcomers by 2020, said Wayne Busch, head of Accenture's banking practice in North America. The companies that take customers, Busch said, could include banks that are online only and retailers that partner with financial institutions.

Even in the current rate environment, deposits are a very good business, Chief Financial Officer Doug Braunstein said at an investor conference after being asked by a stock analyst if the company would consider spending less on new branches. The company's 5,600 U.S. branches, second in number only to Wells Fargo & Co's, have been important to the company's 18 percent growth in deposits, to $1.1 trillion, over the last 18 months, Braunstein said. Thi s year the company has been adding 150 branches to its total. Besides catering to individuals with bank accounts, credit cards and home loans, branches support the company's services to small and mid-sized companies and its offerings of investment products to the affluent. Branches are core to our business, Braunstein said. Stock analysts and institutional investors have been increasingly pressing bank executives to justify building and maintaining branches when profit margins on deposits are at historic lows and when the Internet and mobile phones allow people to make more purchases without cash or make deposits without going to a bank. Some banks, notably Bank of America Corp, have been closing branches to save money. But Braunstein, speaking at a Goldman Sachs conference, argued that this is a time for JPMorgan to spend to take market share of deposits and use branches to cement its relationships with customers. When the Federal Reserve allows lending rates to rise again, JPMorgan will make more money, he said. To the extent the rate environment normalizes over time - and it may take some time to do so - there is going to be significant upside, he said. Taking questions on other topics, Braunstein said that big banks are in better shape to undergo next year's round of Federal Reserve stress tests of their capital plans, which can call for spend cash dividends and stock buybacks. Compared with past stress tests, bank portfolios are of high quality because a lot of bad loans have been written off. Banks have also had time to earn money and build up their capital cushions. And they have learned how to improve their test scores by going over past results and talking with examiners, he said. The chance of failing the stress tests has also been reduced because in the current round the Federal Reserve will allow failing banks a chance to submit a more cautious plan, he noted. The Fed has said it will publicly disclose plans that are rejected and resubmitted. Bank of America Chief Executive Brian Moynihan, at the same conference earlier in the day, said he plans to avoid having to redo his bank's plan. Braunstein also said that fourth-quarter revenue from capital markets is running 15 percent to 20 percent below that of the third quarter but should still be higher than a year earlier. He reaffirmed past assessments from JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon that JPMorgan should be able to make $24 billion in annual profit in more normal times. In recent years the company has fallen short of the goal as it recognized losses on mortgages  and credit card loans, and received lower rates of interest on loans. In 2011, JPMorgan reported $19 billion in net income. JPMorgan shares were down 0.6 percent at $40.57 on Tuesday at the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange."

However, industry sources had expressed doubts for several months about the viability of the deal, mainly citing concerns about how the Co-op would meet regulatory capital requirements. Co-op chief executive Peter Marks said in a statement that the deal would not currently deliver a suitable return in a reasonable timeframe and with an acceptable level of risk. This should serve as yet another warning to (finance minister) George Osborne that his economic plan is failing and he must urgently act to kickstart our flatlining economy, said Chris Leslie, a lawmaker from the opposition Labour party. Lloyds Must Sell Branches Lloyds was ordered to sell the branches by European regulators as a condition of receiving state aid during the 2008 financial crisis when Britain pumped 20.5 billion pounds into the bank leaving taxpayers holding a 39 percent stake. Industry sources said Lloyds will almost certainty need to request that EU regulators extend the November 2013 deadline they have set for a sale, which analysts expect to be granted. A flotation of the branches is unlikely to be possible until the second half of 2014, sources have said. Industry sources also said Lloyds has been hit with about 1 billion pounds in costs associated with the failed deal. The bank made underlying pretax profit of 2.6 billion pounds in 2012 and the Verde business, which comprises the branches for sale, has been making around 200 million pounds a year in profit, according to analysts. Lloyds had prepared to operate the branches as a separate business from August, using the TSB brand which disappeared from the high street in 1995 when TSB and Lloyds merged. Verde has around 5 million customers and represents about 6 percent of all bank branches in Britain. Britain's Big Five lenders - Lloyds, HSBC, Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland and Santander UK hold 83 percent of current accounts. Co-op's 150 year old banking business has only 2 percent. A source close to the Co-op said there was no truth in speculation that it would now pull out of banking. Its other businesses include supermarkets, funeral services, travel and pharmacy. Co-op's general insurance business was put up for sale last month in a move to bolster its capital but it has so far failed to find a buyer. Co-op's future strategy will be shaped by incoming chief executive Euan Sutherland who takes the helm on May 1. Sutherland joins Co-op from European home improvement retailer Kingfisher. The challenge they've got is how can they grow the banking operation because it is fairly clear to me that it is a bit short on capital, said Shore Capital analyst Gary Greenwood. With banks facing increasingly burdensome regulation and with low interest rates constraining profitability, Sutherland, who has spent his career in retail, might want to focus on that side of the business rather than banking, said analysts. Co-op Bank made a loss of 674 million pounds last year. The other businesses in the group also struggled as the UK recession continue to bite. Lloyds shares closed up 1.7 percent at 51.9 pence a share after a rise of 71 percent in the last 12 months. "

Ghizzoni said 110 of these branches will be shut by the end of 2013, with savings of 15 million euros ($20 million) a year in terms of real estate costs. UniCredit, which has already closed 800 branches in Italy since 2009, currently has around 3,600 branches in its home base. Ghizzoni said that at current levels, the spread between Italian 10-year government bonds and equivalent German Bunds was still unsustainable, even if it was much lower than at where it stood at the height of the euro zone debt crisis. No one is talking about it any longer, but at 270, 280, 290 basis points the spread is unsustainable. Either it goes down or it creates serious problems for the Italian economy, for banks and companies, he told reporters. He said the spread would be one of the key problems for the next Italian government after the Feb. 24-25 parliamentary elections. He said the latest polls showing the gap closing between rival parties were a reason to be a little more concerned. Italy needs political stability, he said.

The three restaurants - on Moscow's Manezh square, under the walls of the Kremlin, at Pushkin Square and on Prospect Mira - have been closed since last week on the orders of the watchdog, Rospotrebnadzor. The court rulings confirmed that decision. Rospotrebnadzor has introduced sweeping checks, including unscheduled inspections, at McDonald's restaurants across the country. On Wednesday it ordered the temporary closure of a fourth branch in the capital - the sixth nationwide. Russian businessmen have said the crackdown is linked to the crisis over Ukraine, which has soured U.S.-Russian relations and led to a round of sanctions and trade restrictions. Rospotrebnadzor has denied that its actions are politically motivated. McDonald's said it would appeal the court rulings, which ordered the three Moscow branches to be closed for 90 days. We do not agree with the courts' decisions and will appeal them according to established procedures. We will continue to take care of our employees and do everything we can to continue successful operations in Russia, said a spokeswoman for the U.S. firm in Russia. A lawyer representing McDonald's in the court, Maksim Titarenko, was also quoted as saying the courts' decisions to close the branches were unjustified. The court has ordered the maximum penalty under this article of the administrative offences code although there are no grounds for it, Interfax news agency quoted Titarenko as saying. A court in the Urals region delivered a similar ruling on Wednesday when it ordered the closure of a McDonald's restaurant in the city of Yekaterinburg for 85 days, backing the food safety watchdog's decision the day before. McDonald's operates 440 restaurants in Russia and considers the country one of its top seven markets outside the United States and Canada, according to its 2013 annual report. Almost 1 million people a day visit its restaurants in Russia.   (Reporting by Maria Kiselyova; Additional reporting by Natalia Shurmina in Yekaterinburg; Editing by Louise Heavens and Pravin Char)"

They're still waiting. Two sources close to the process said part-nationalised RBS had given bidders for the 316 branches no substantial feedback since offers were submitted in mid-December, even though they had initially been told the field would be narrowed to a short list or a preferred bidder by mid-January. One of the sources said bidders had been told informally in mid January that it would be at least February before RBS gave any update on their offers and no due diligence or other work was in train. The delay represents the latest setback in a lengthy sale process that was derailed in October after a 1.65 million pound ($2.6 million) offer from Spain's Santander collapsed when the process of carving out the business proved too onerous. Indeed, a sale may prove so problematic that RBS is forced back to the less-preferred option of a stock market flotation for the chain, likely to take longer to organise and which would be prone to the usual vagaries of stock market mood afflicting any new share offering. RBS has been ordered to sell the branches in return for receiving a 45.5 billion pound bailout during the 2008 financial crisis which left British taxpayers owning 81 percent of the bank. The latest bidding round attracted offers from Richard Branson's Virgin Money and, jointly, U.S. private equity houses JC Flowers and Apollo. But bids fell well short of Santander's offer and RBS is exploring alternatives. The bank is trying to tempt Britain's largest member-owned financial institution Nationwide back into the process, sources have said. Nationwide did not submit a proposal in December but sources say it has continued to talk informally with RBS. Dual Track RBS declined to comment on the sale process, as did UBS, which is advising the bank on the sale. Virgin Money, JC Flowers and Nationwide also declined to comment. One source close to the process told Reuters RBS was adopting a dual track approach, examining options for both an outright sale and stock-market listing of the business. Yet the source said it could take up to six months for the bank to make a decision. At that point, it is likely to ask Britain's Treasury to request the European Union extends a deadline for RBS to sell the branches by the end of 2013. An extension of the deadline would give RBS more time to prepare for a flotation, if it is unsuccessful in pulling off a direct sale, which sources said is still its preferred option. The business has been ring-fenced and run under separate management so the process of spinning it off would be relatively straightforward. Dubbed Rainbow, it made an operating profit of 186 million pounds in the first six months of the year. Analysts said the lack of credible buyers means RBS is likely to need more time to achieve a sale and will have to accept a much reduced price. The simple truth is that there ... aren't many obvious potential buyers for this particular asset, hence why, in likelihood, RBS will have to crystalise a loss to achieve disposal, said Investec analyst Ian Gordon. Rival Lloyds Banking Group has also struggled to sell around 630 branches it was ordered to sell following a bailout which left it 40 percent state-owned. It has agreed terms to sell the branches to the Co-operative Group  but has yet to complete the sale."

RBS is preparing the business, code named Rainbow, for a stock market flotation but is open to the idea of first selling substantial stakes to strategic investors prior to an initial public offering. The investor would then stay on as a dominant force in the floated company after the IPO. The bank must sell 315 branches as a condition of receiving a 45.5 billion pound ($69.2 billion) government rescue in 2008 which left it 82 percent state-owned. Industry sources said RBS is considering proposals from 3 sets of investors who could serve as the strategic partner. One consortium is led by private equity firms Centerbridge and Corsair and has backing from the Church of England's investment fund, while another comprises several of Britain's biggest investment firms and is led by former Tesco finance director, Andy Higginson. A third proposal has been submitted by British private equity firm Anacap Financial Partners, in conjunction with U.S. private equity group, Blackstone (BX.N). RBS could also pursue a stock market flotation of the branches on its own without having additional investors on board, the sources said. RBS is not yet favoring a particular proposal. All bids have their merits and it is too early to say which bidder is most likely to succeed, said one source close to the sale process. RBS is aiming to tell potential investors what its plans are in the next month, the sources said, although that timetable is not set in stone. An IPO could happen any time in the next two years, the sources said, but the bank would like to go earlier to avoid competing against a glut of impending bank share sales. The government is planning to start selling its shares in Lloyds Banking Group soon while Lloyds is looking to spin off 630 branches via a stock market flotation. The deal adds to an increasingly busy block of UK bank assets seeking investment or new capital over the next year, raising questions of whether the market will be swallow everything. Spain's Santander (SAN.MC) and Virgin Money, the financial group that is part of Richard Branson's empire, are both planning to float their UK businesses. The sale of the RBS branches was halted in October when Santander (SAN.MC) pulled out of a deal to buy the whole portfolio for 1.65 billion pounds. RBS has said a sale this year is now unlikely, meaning it will have to ask European regulators to extend a December 2013 deadline.

The cuts, announced in a stock exchange filing, are designed to boost profitability at the Islamic lender. Bank Asya has laid off 1,708 staff and closed 80 branches, out of the 5,074 staff and 281 branches it had at the end of 2013. The bank swung to a 301 million lira ($133 million) net loss in the third quarter partly due to a rise in bad loans, but said last week its underlying operations were healthy. Its shares, which are on the Istanbul stock exchange watch list, meaning they are restricted to a few hours of trading a day, fell more than 5.5 percent in afternoon trade. The lender is caught up in a feud between Erdogan and Fethullah Gulen, the Islamic cleric whose sympathisers founded the bank. Erdogan has long accused Gulen - now based in the United States - of seeking to overthrow him and has pledged to purge institutions such as the police and judiciary of his supporters. Seeking to show loyalty to Erdogan, depositors including state-owned firms and institutions withdrew 4 billion lira, or some 20 percent of Bank Asya's total deposits, earlier this year, according to media reports. The bank has declined to comment on those figures, but said in its third-quarter results that overall deposits had almost halved to 10 billion lira since the start of the year. Its assets of 16.5 billion lira were down 40 percent. Analysts said the staff and branch cuts could put Bank Asya on a surer footing if the political storm also calms. It's not abnormal that the branch number is going down. They lost 40-45 percent of their deposits. Otherwise they would struggle to control their operating expenses, said Deniz Invest analyst Sadrettin Bagci. It could even be seen as positive news from an operational perspective ...

Banks across Europe are reducing branch networks to improve profitability in a weak economic environment and as the online  banking boom accelerates the shift away from a traditional banking model. Societe Generale, France's second-biggest listed bank, started a 6-to-8-months long experiment with opening hours in the first half of this year. The summer closures are a part of that, a spokeswoman at SocGen said. The spokeswoman declined to give the number of branches involved or further details of the summer closures, but added that as part of the experiment, some may be closed for half days or closed completely through the summer in order to regroup forces at bigger sites. Societe Generale's 3,161 branch network as of 2013 was already 2 percent smaller than in 2010. The number of online connections to its services has more than tripled over the last four years. The number of clients who visited a French bank branch several times per month plummeted to 17 percent in 2013 from 52 percent in 2010, a survey by the country's banking association showed in May. The French travel most in the last month of summer, according to studies by the Economy Ministry, and in Ile de France, the area around and including Paris which accounts for a third of the bank's retail revenue, drops sharply during August as city dwellers leave for the coast and the countryside. Grocery stores, bakeries and real estate agencies all close for several weeks one after another as clients disappear. The results of SocGen's experiments will be discussed with the unions, the spokeswoman said. Societe Generale's management is doing some experiments to see how the network may evolve in the future, rather than waiting for the consequences of the changing customer behavior, said Philippe Fournil, CGT union representative. Officials of other major French banks were unable to say whether they had plans to copy SocGen's move. BNP Paribas, which has a smaller retail network in France, targets 210 million euros in investments over the next three years to adapt its 2,139 branches in France to the changing climate. BNP has cut the number of branches by 5 percent since 2010. European lenders, like SocGen and BNP are boosting their own online business to counter low-cost Internet-competitors. BNP launched a Europe-wide online bank called Hello bank! last year and SocGen bought out minority holders of its online bank brand Boursorama. BPCE, the second-biggest retail bank, has launched two online banking brands since 2010. Credit Agricole, the largest retail lender in France, was not available for a comment.

The sources could not confirm or deny a report in The Sunday Telegraph newspaper that NBNK was planning a fresh 1.5 billion pound ($2.4 billion) offer for the 632 branches which Lloyds has been forced to sell by European regulators. Last year, NBNK lost out to Co-Op - a mutually-owned conglomerate whose businesses include a supermarket chain and a financial services arm - in the battle to become Lloyds' preferred acquirer of the branches. Lloyds has been in exclusive talks with Co-Op over the sale, but both companies admitted last week the deal was proving to be complicated, signaling a deal may take longer than planned and could even fall apart. Lloyds, 40 percent owned by the British government after a state bailout during the 2008 credit crisis, also reiterated it was still keeping open the option of spinning off the 632 branches and listing them on the stock market. In December, credit ratings agency Standard & Poor's cut its outlook on Co-Op due to the risks associated with the Lloyds deal. Other analysts have said Co-Op may need to raise money through a debt issue to fund the acquisition, estimated to be worth some 1 billion pounds. Analysts are expected to seek more details on how the deal - which has been codenamed Project Verde - is progressing when the Co-Op reports its annual results on March 29. The sale of Lloyds' Verde assets would create Britain's seventh-biggest bank, with the assets representing 4.6 percent of personal current or checking accounts and 5 percent of the mortgage market. European regulators ordered Lloyds to sell the assets as payback for its 2008 state bailout, and Lloyds has said it is on track to complete a transfer of the bank branches before the end of 2013. NBNK was set up in 2010 to acquire British banking assets, and the company has also been linked with NAB UK, with sources having told Reuters that the Australian bank is likely to position its UK bank assets for sale.

Making smart credit decisions is critical now as the auto lending business heats up. U.S. consumers have $1 trillion of automobile loans outstanding, up from about $700 billion in the first quarter of 2010, according to data from the New York Federal Reserve. That represents much steeper growth than credit card loans, which have remained essentially flat. The fourth-largest U.S. bank has 56 branches for car and dealer financing, including one it recently opened in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, said Dawn Martin Harp, head of dealer services. The branches, called regional business centers serve car dealers exclusively. The bank is planning to add more offices, including one in the Southwest by the end of the year, but has no specific number that it is targeting, Martin Harp said.  The branches are not just sales offices. They include credit officers who approve or deny loans. Having credit officers who are in the regions where they are lending ensures that they know their customers better, Martin Harp said. It's a differentiator for us, she said. She added that the pace of growth depends on opportunities in different communities and in the overall car loan market. With the market's growth in recent years, regulators and bankers have grown concerned about risk in the sector. Wells Fargo's Chief Executive John Shrewsberry said on the bank's first-quarter earnings call in April that auto lending has gotten to be a more competitive market, adding, we've picked our spots, I think, a little bit more delicately.  On the second-quarter call in July, he said the sector is nonetheless providing a big opportunity because so many cars are being sold. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, one of the major U.S. banking regulators, said in a report earlier this year that it is closely watching auto lending, noting that extended rapid growth is difficult to maintain and can sometimes mask early signs of weakening credit quality.  Wells is taking a different tack from competitors including Ally Financial Inc (ALLY.N) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), which have centralized their auto lending operations to cut costs.     Reporting by Dan Freed; Editing by Alan Crosby"

The bank, whose Irish branches swelled to 270 before the bursting of a property bubble brought it and its rivals to their knees, did not specify how many it would close, only that a number of its services would move to local post offices. Our distribution network will be enhanced by the new An Post (Irish post office) initiative ... Regrettably, this means that the number of branches will reduce as part of the move to lower costs, the bank said in an internal strategy document seen by Reuters. Forced to ditch its international ambitions after a humbling 20 billion euro ($24.76 billion) bailout, AIB was effectively nationalised last year and is in the process of axing 2,500 jobs - almost 20 percent of its workforce - and cutting salaries by up to 15 percent. The bank said in the document that the take-up for its early retirement scheme had been particularly strong and as a result, it did not anticipate the need for further job cuts before the current severance programme ends in 2014. The bank also said Fergus Murphy, former chief executive of the EBS building society that was folded into AIB last year, will take over as head of products in a simplifying of its management structure. Chief executive David Duffy said he would be making further appointments in the near term and reiterated that in tandem with cost reductions, the bank will be adjusting the pricing of its lending products more in line with competitors and its own costs. We need to take steps which will ensure AIB is not dependent on State support - and instead is a bank that is largely deposit funded, Duffy told staff in the document. It is important that we can make this transition and attract new investors, allowing us to return funds to our shareholders and the taxpayer."

"https://www.reuters.com/article/rbs-santander-idUSL1E8LE49E20121014","UPDATE 1-RBS under pressure after collapse of branch sale","","October 14, 2012 /  11:57 PM / 5 years ago","","By Matt Scuffham LONDON, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Shares of Royal Bank of Scotland  are set to open lower on Monday following the shock decision by Spain's Santander to pull out of a deal to buy 316 branches from the part-nationalised British bank. The collapse of the deal, late on Friday, was a major blow to RBS, coming at a critical juncture in its recovery plan and could push back the time frame for taxpayers to see a return on the 45 billion pounds Britain pumped into the bank to keep it afloat. Although Richard Branson's Virgin Money has emerged as a possible alternative bidder, RBS faces a tough task to clinch a sale by a 2013 deadline and will likely have to lower the 1.65 billion pound ($2.65 billion) asking price. U.S. private equity entrepreneur Christopher Flowers is also interested in a potential bid, with the firm keen to expand its small regional lender One Savings Bank, according to the Financial Times on Monday. RBS was ordered by European authorities to sell the branches, which have 1.8 million customers, as a condition of being bailed out by the government during the 2008 financial crisis. It could now ask for the deadline to be extended or to be allowed to keep the branches. Sources told Reuters that RBS had received interest from Virgin Money, which lost out to Santander in the original auction, and others since Friday. Another possible bidder is NBNK, the venture to buy UK banking assets that was set up by former Lloyd's of London insurance head Peter Levene and led by ex-Barclays executive Gary Hoffman. However, NBNK is being wound up after losing out to the Co-op in a battle to buy more than 600 branches from Lloyds Banking Group and would need to reverse that process. Co-op's preoccupation with integrating the branches it purchased from Lloyds makes it an unlikely bidder. Metro Bank said on Sunday it was focused on organic growth, while Tesco Bank said it had no interest in buying branch networks. Sweden's Handelsbanken, which is expanding rapidly in Britain, declined to say if it was interested in the branches but stressed that its focus in the UK was on growing organically. RBS received a welcome boost last week when it successfully completed the initial public offering of its insurance arm Direct Line and later this month could exit a costly government insurance scheme. But those milestones risk being overshadowed because the bank is expected to be next in line to be hit with a big fine for the manipulation of Libor global interest rates. Santander's retreat will save it some capital and avoid a big increase in its British loan book and exposure at a time of strain in its domestic market and scrutiny of its capital and funding. Santander has been shedding assets and on Thursday sold 2.5 billion euros of loans to Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Shares of RBS closed on Friday at 270.9 pence, meaning UK taxpayers are currently sitting on a loss of 21 billion pounds. "

NBNK said it was offering an alternative demerger plan for the Lloyds branches, which are estimated to be worth between 1-1.5 billion pounds ($1.6-2.4 billion). It wants to buy the branches and potentially float them so that Lloyds' shareholders -- including the UK taxpayer -- could receive cash and/or shares in a new, listed banking group. Lloyds has been ordered by European regulators to sell the branches by November 2013 as payback for a bail-out with taxpayers' money during the 2008 credit crisis, which left Britain owning a 40 percent stake in Lloyds. NBNK has not yet started talks with Lloyds due to the exclusivity period between Lloyds and Co-Op. NBNK, which has a current market capitalisation of around 45 million pounds, is confident it can raise the money to pull off a Lloyds branch deal. We have strong support from investors in achieving our objectives and we are confident that we can raise the money, obviously at the right price, Chief Executive Gary Hoffman told Reuters. The one thing I won't talk about is the price that we've offered, he said, adding that people had speculated that this could involve a fundraising of up to 2 billion pounds. Hoffman also said the assets could be worth in excess of 1.5 billion pounds. Lloyds shares were up 1.7 percent in early afternoon trade, outperforming a flat European banking sector and a 0.4 percent rise in Britain's benchmark FTSE 100 index. The details of NBNK's offer are sketchy. As a trade buyer with an existing business, it would make more sense to do a deal with the Co-Op, but I don't think the Co-Op can actually deliver, said Shore Capital analyst Gary Greenwood. Lloyds said it remained in exclusive talks with Co-Op. NBNK had lost out on the deal last year when Co-Op became the preferred bidder. But both Lloyds and Co-Op said last month that the deal was proving complicated and Co-Op warned it could walk away. Britain's financial regulator raised concerns that Co-Op, which is yet to appoint a chief executive for its financial services division, lacked the necessary experience to manage one of the country's biggest retail banking networks. Complicated Deal A sale of the Lloyds retail branches would create Britain's seventh-biggest bank, and as such this has attracted a lot of scrutiny from British authorities. It would mark an important step in Britain's plans to sell its 40 percent Lloyds stake and 82 percent holding in rival bailed-out lender Royal Bank of Scotland back to the private sector. NBNK pledged that its plan would not result in any redundancies or branch closures, and that NBNK had the necessary skills to integrate the various banking software systems. Hoffman was also confident that a stock market listing of the new bank would attract investors, despite market volatility. If you invest in Barclays, HSBC, or RBS or Lloyds, then only about 20 pence of every pound you invest goes into UK retail banking. The rest goes into investment banking or asset management or corporate banking or Brazil or Greece or Spain or Italy or whatever, he said. Over many years, the returns in UK retail banking have been much higher than group returns. If you can produce a pure UK retail play, with very good ROE (return on equity), without dilution coming from the rest of the group, then it is an attractive proposition for investors, he added. NBNK was set up in 2010 by former Lloyd's of London insurance head Peter Levene to buy up British banking assets. It has been also linked with a takeover of the British operations of Australia's NAB. Hoffman declined to comment on NAB but said NBNK would have to close if it failed to pull off a takeover. Ultimately, if there is a not a large acquisition available, we would close. "

Britain's financial watchdog has so far blocked the branch sale, a move one Financial Services Authority insider last week said was due to worries the eclectic board of the food-to-funerals conglomerate lacked the nous to manage one of the country's biggest retail banking networks. I cannot predict right now whether we will get to the end on this, Peter Marks, chief executive of mutually owned Co-Op, told reporters on a conference call on Thursday. There are a number of regulatory and economic issues that we have to be clear about, before we make a transaction. Marks said the Co-Op would decide whether to go ahead with its bid for the 632 Lloyds branches in weeks rather than months. The Co-Op, which expanded its small presence in financial services by acquiring the Britannia Building Society, would be catapulted to Britain's seventh-biggest bank with the Lloyds deal. Regulators have been looking closely at the bid because of the proposed new bank's importance to consumers. The FSA was expected to want reassurances that the Co-Op has strong enough capital, an experienced board and adequate systems and business plan before it gives the go-ahead. The Co-Op still needs to appoint a permanent chief executive for its financial services arm, and analysts also say it would have to tap the bond markets to raise funds for the acquisition. Marks said there were no concerns over the Co-Op's corporate governance systems or the company's funding capabilities, and added that the group had a chief executive for its financial services business waiting in the wings. This is nothing to do with our ability to run a bank or our governance, he said, adding the company remained in constructive talks with Lloyds and the FSA. Nbnk Lies in Wait Regulators have ordered Lloyds to sell the branches as payback for the company's state bailout by the British government during the 2008 credit crisis, which left Britain with a 40 percent stake in Lloyds after it pumped around 20 billion pounds into the bank. Lloyds shares fell 1.3 percent to 33.99 pence in mid-morning trade, still well below the average 63 pence price at which the British taxpayer effectively acquired its stake in the bank. Espirito Santo analyst Shailesh Raikundlia said a collapse of the Co-Op deal would only hurt Lloyds' shares in the short term, as the bank still had a good chance of disposing of the branches, either through an initial public offering (IPO) or a sale to new British banking venture NBNK NBNK.L. Lloyds has always kept a fallback option of spinning off the assets and then listing them on the stock market through an IPO, while NBNK, which lost out to the Co-Op last year in the bid to become Lloyds' preferred partner in the branch deal, remains interested. However, Oriel Securities analyst Mike Trippitt cautioned that NBNK might face the same regulatory concerns as the Co-Op. This looks like a regulatory own-goal. They want to increase competition in banking, but if you set the regulatory barrier so high, you end up deterring new entrants, he said. Lloyds has to sell the branches by 2013, a task which has been code-named Project Verde. On their own, they represent 4.6 percent of UK personal current or checking accounts and 5 percent of the mortgage market. A sale would mark an important step in Britain's longer-term plans of selling off its Lloyds holding and its 82 percent stake in rival bailed-out lender Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L), which like Lloyds has also been ordered to sell a string of assets.

SKS' business in Andhra Pradesh, which was a microfinance hub earlier, has been hit after the state government imposed a set of restrictive laws in October 2010 curtailing microfinance activity. The move scared away many sector investors and prompted some  small to mid-sized lenders to the poor to shut shop. SKS, which employs 3,400 people in Andhra Pradesh, will cut  1,200 jobs, the company said in a statement, adding that it has decided to close 78 of the 180 branches it operates in the state. The lender said it was not planning to close its business in Andhra Pradesh, where its loan portfolio shrunk to 2.36 billion rupees ($43.94 million) in the March quarter from 13.11 billion rupees a year ago as it was forced to write off some credit. The microfinance business in Andhra Pradesh has come to a standstill, M.R. Rao, chief executive officer of SKS, said in the statement, adding that its business in the state would remain cash neutral due to the prevailing market conditions. SKS' loss in the January-March quarter more than quadrupled to 3.3 billion rupees, reflecting the sliding fortunes of the country's beleaguered microfinance sector. It has been posting losses for the last six quarters. The company, however, said on Thursday it was not facing any liquidity or solvency issues and that it had healthy cash and bank balances. SKS has been beset with slowing business and a boardroom struggle that has sent its stock plummeting after a successful initial public offering in 2010 in which it raised $358 million. It saw the exit of its founder Vikram Akula in November 2011. Shares in SKS, which the market values at $122 million, fell 0.1 percent on Thursday to 88.60 rupees, while the broader Mumbai market dropped 0.4 percent. The stock is down 92 percent since its market debut. $1=53.7 Indian rupees

Britain's financial regulator has held up the branch sale, a move one insider at the watchdog last week said was due to worries the eclectic board of the food-to-funerals conglomerate lacked the necessary experience to manage one of the country's biggest retail banking networks. I cannot predict right now whether we will get to the end on this, Peter Marks, chief executive of mutually owned Co-Op, told reporters on a conference call on Thursday. Talks with both Lloyds and the FSA (Financial Services Authority) are ongoing and we are working constructively with both parties. There is no certainty that we will reach a final agreement, he said. There are a number of regulatory and economic issues that we have to be clear about, before we make a transaction. Marks said Co-Op was conducting thorough due diligence on the deal, in order to avoid a situation such as Royal Bank of Scotland's disastrous role in the 2007 takeover of Dutch bank ABN AMRO, which nearly led to the collapse of RBS. One obstacle to a takeover has been a funding gap between the assets and liabilities in the branches, while the deal would also incur expensive integration costs. Analysts have also said Co-Op might have to tap the debt markets for capital to fund the deal, which could impact the group's overall financial position. Credit rating agency Fitch said the deal remained a highly risky one for the Co-Op, which also reported on Thursday group operating profit of 585 million pounds ($927.25 million), with profit of 54 million pounds at its Co-Operative Bank unit. While the deal - if completed - offers the potential to transform Co-Op's business, an acquisition of this scale comes with considerable financial, execution and integration risks, Fitch said in a research note. Marks said the Co-Op would decide whether to go ahead with its bid for the 632 Lloyds branches in weeks rather than months. The Co-Op, which expanded its small presence in financial services by acquiring the Britannia Building Society, would be catapulted to Britain's seventh-biggest bank with the Lloyds deal. The FSA has been looking closely at the bid because of the proposed new bank's importance to consumers. The FSA was expected to want reassurances that the Co-Op has strong enough capital, an experienced board and adequate systems and business plan before it gives the go-ahead. Marks said he had no concerns over the Co-Op's corporate governance systems or the company's funding capabilities, and added that the group had a chief executive for its financial services business waiting in the wings. This is nothing to do with our ability to run a bank or our governance, he said. Nbnk Lies in Wait Regulators have ordered Lloyds to sell the branches as payback for the company's state bailout by the British government during the 2008 credit crisis, which left Britain with a 40 percent stake in Lloyds after it pumped around 20 billion pounds into the bank. Lloyds shares fell 2.9 percent to 33.42 pence in late afternoon trade, still well below the average 63 pence price at which the British taxpayer effectively acquired its stake in the bank. Espirito Santo analyst Shailesh Raikundlia said a collapse of the Co-Op deal would only hurt Lloyds' shares in the short term, as the bank still had a good chance of disposing of the branches, either through an initial public offering (IPO) or a sale to new British banking venture NBNK. Lloyds has always kept a fallback option of spinning off the assets and then listing them on the stock market through an IPO,   while NBNK, which lost out to the Co-Op last year in the bid to become Lloyds' preferred partner in the branch deal, remains interested. However, Oriel Securities analyst Mike Trippitt cautioned that NBNK might face the same regulatory concerns as the Co-Op. This looks like a regulatory own-goal. They want to increase competition in banking, but if you set the regulatory barrier so high, you end up deterring new entrants, he said. Lloyds has to sell the branches by 2013, a task which has been code-named Project Verde. On their own, they represent 4.6 percent of UK personal current or checking accounts and 5 percent of the mortgage market. A sale would mark an important step in Britain's longer-term plans of selling off its Lloyds holding and its 82 percent stake in rival bailed-out lender Royal Bank of Scotland, which like Lloyds has also been ordered to sell a string of assets. Investment banks Credit Suisse and Barclays are advising the Co-Op on the Lloyds deal, while Lloyds is being advised by JP Morgan Cazenove and Citi."

Britain's regulator is taking a tough line and requiring the mutually owned conglomerate Co-Operative Group to strengthen its systems and board to prepare for the deal. Several analysts have warned it might have a hard task in taking on and integrating the Lloyds branches. I think the Lloyds' statement is a warning shot to the Co-Op. It doesn't feel like a done deal, said Oriel Securities analyst Mike Trippitt. Lloyds said on Thursday it was making progress in its talks with the Co-Operative over the deal, codenamed Project Verde. However, given that this is a substantial business and a highly complex transaction, the group now anticipates providing a further update in Q2 2012, it added. Lloyds said last year it had started exclusive talks to sell the branches to the Co-Op - a conglomerate whose businesses range from a retail supermarket division to financial services. But it has always kept open the option of spinning off the assets and then listing them on the stock market, in case it could not pull off a sale, and one analyst said the chances of an initial public offering (IPO) had increased. I think it's edging more towards an IPO. It doesn't surprise me that it's been held up, said Shore Capital analyst Gary Greenwood. Lloyds reiterated on Thursday that while its preferred option remained a sale of the assets to the Co-Op, it would keep the fall-back option of an IPO. It remains our preference to sell the Verde business to The Co-operative Group. In addition, the group is continuing to prepare for a divestment through an initial public offering, Lloyds said. Co-Op also said it was making progress on the deal, but echoed Lloyds by noting the complexities of the transaction. Fsa Wants Reassurances Britain's Financial Services Authority (FSA) is expected to want reassurances that the Co-Op has strong enough capital, an experienced board and adequate systems and business plan before it gives a go-ahead for the deal. In December, credit ratings agency Standard & Poor's cut its outlook on Co-Op due to the risks associated with the Lloyds deal. Other analysts have said Co-Op may need to raise money through a debt issue to fund the acquisition, estimated to be worth some 1 billion pounds ($1.6 billion). Lloyds, which is part-owned by the British government and last year announced plans to cut 15,000 jobs, said it would create around 500 new posts in the Verde business. Co-Op beat off rival bidder NBNK - a new bank venture set up to acquire banking assets - in the Verde bid process last year. Acquiring the Lloyds branches would mark a further expansion in Co-Op's banking business after it bought Britannia Building Society in 2009. The sale of the Lloyds' Verde assets would create Britain's seventh-biggest bank, with the assets representing 4.6 percent of personal current or checking accounts and 5 percent of the mortgage market. They contributed about 500 million pounds of pretax profit in 2008 and income of about 1.4 billion. Lloyds said it remained on track to complete the transfer of the bank branches before the end of 2013, in line with a timetable laid out for the sale by the European Commission. European regulators ordered Lloyds to sell the assets as payback for getting a state bailout during the 2008 credit crisis, which left Britain with a 40 percent stake in the group. A sale of the Verde retail branch assets would mark an important step towards Britain's longer-term plans of selling off its 40 percent Lloyds holding and its 82 percent stake in rival bailed-out lender Royal Bank of Scotland. Lloyds shares closed down 1.7 percent at 35.25 pence - still well below the average 63 pence price at which the British taxpayer acquired its stake in the bank. "

Making smart credit decisions is critical now as the auto lending business heats up. U.S. consumers have $1 trillion of automobile loans outstanding, up from about $700 billion in the first quarter of 2010, according to data from the New York Federal Reserve. That represents much steeper growth than credit card loans, which have remained essentially flat. The fourth-largest U.S. bank has set up 56 branches for car and dealer financing, most recently one in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, said Dawn Martin Harp, head of dealer services. The bank is planning to add more offices, including one in the Southwest by the end of the year, but has no specific number that it is targeting, Martin Harp said. The branches are not just sales offices. They include credit officers who approve or deny loans. Having credit officers who are in the regions where they are lending ensures that they know their customers better, Martin Harp said. It's a differentiator for us, she said. She added that the pace of growth depends on opportunities in different communities and in the overall car loan market. With the market's growth in recent years, regulators and bankers have grown concerned about risk in the sector. Wells Fargo's Chief Executive John Shrewsberry said on the bank's first-quarter earnings call in April that auto lending has gotten to be a more competitive market, adding, we've picked our spots, I think, a little bit more delicately. On the second-quarter call in July, he said the sector is nonetheless providing a big opportunity because so many cars are being sold. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, one of the major U.S. banking regulators, said in a report earlier this year that it is closely watching auto lending, noting that extended rapid growth is difficult to maintain and can sometimes mask early signs of weakening credit quality. Wells is taking a different tack from competitors including Ally Financial Inc and JPMorgan Chase & Co, which have centralized their auto lending operations to cut costs.

Sheikh Khalid Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, a member of the Abu Dhabi royal family, joined Prince Andrew, The Duke of York, to open the office at One Hyde Park, the 1 billion pound luxury Candy and Candy development located near the Harrods department store. Trad Al Mahmoud, chief executive of ADIB Group, said the bank was hoping to attract clients from the UAE who use London as their base for business and personal transactions and who desire Islamic finance services, based on principles such as a ban on interest and pure monetary speculation. This launch signifies the merging of our Islamic financial values with the advanced financial infrastructure and ecosystem of the UK, said Mahmoud. The UK is the largest Islamic finance centre in Europe, with 19 billion dollars out of global assets of 1.7 trillion dollars and is home to five fully sharia-compliant banks, data from the UK Islamic Finance Secretariat (UKIFS) estimates. Although there are now 22 banks in Britain licensed to conduct Islamic finance transactions, ADIB is the first UAE-based financial institution to receive a banking operation licence from the UK Financial Services Authority (FSA). Britain's largest standalone sharia bank, Bank of London and the Middle East (BLME), is awaiting regulatory approval to move in the reverse direction to tap into the close ties between the oil-rich Gulf and the UK. It is aiming to start operations in the Gulf, initially with a representative office this year, and a branch or subsidiary in the longer term, Chief Executive Humphrey Percy told Reuters in an interview. Earlier in May, ADIB warned that profit growth for the rest of the year would be subdued as it posted flat income for the first quarter of 2012 and warned of the impact of the global financial crisis and euro zone uncertainty on its business. One Hyde Park, completed just over a year ago, is one of London's most expensive retail and residential developments, housing the most expensive flat in Britain, sold for 136 million pounds ($213.24 million). Investors seeking safe havens for their cash have flocked to central London, stoking demand for the best shop units in the British capital's prime shopping streets. It was built by Project Grande (Guernsey) Ltd, a joint venture between Christian Candy's company CPC, and Waterknights, a company owned by the prime minister of Qatar, Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr Al-Thani. It is also home to a Rolex outlet and a store selling McLaren's new sports car."

The amendments include an increase in programme size from  USD3bn to USD7bn, and the addition of other branches of BOCOM outside Mainland  China as programme issuers. Fitch believes the amendments do not represent  material changes that will affect the credit ratings of the programme.  The ratings confirmed by Fitch are based on the documents and information  provided to us by the issuer and are subject to receipt of final closing  documents.

RBS is preparing the business, code named Rainbow, for a stock market flotation but is open to the idea of first selling substantial stakes to strategic investors prior to an initial public offering. The investor would then stay on as a dominant force in the floated company after the IPO. The bank must sell 315 branches as a condition of receiving a 45.5 billion pound ($69.2 billion) government rescue in 2008 which left it 82 percent state-owned. Industry sources said RBS is considering proposals from 3 sets of investors who could serve as the strategic partner. One consortium is led by private equity firms Centerbridge and Corsair and has backing from the Church of England's investment fund, while another comprises several of Britain's biggest investment firms and is led by former Tesco finance director, Andy Higginson. A third proposal has been submitted by British private equity firm Anacap Financial Partners, in conjunction with U.S. private equity group, Blackstone. RBS could also pursue a stock market flotation of the branches on its own without having additional investors on board, the sources said. RBS is not yet favouring a particular proposal. All bids have their merits and it is too early to say which bidder is most likely to succeed, said one source close to the sale process. RBS is aiming to tell potential investors what its plans are in the next month, the sources said, although that timetable is not set in stone. An IPO could happen any time in the next two years, the sources said, but the bank would like to go earlier to avoid competing against a glut of impending bank share sales. The government is planning to start selling its shares in Lloyds Banking Group soon while Lloyds is looking to spin off 630 branches via a stock market flotation. The deal adds to an increasingly busy block of UK bank assets seeking investment or new capital over the next year, raising questions of whether the market will be swallow everything. Spain's Santander and Virgin Money, the financial group that is part of Richard Branson's empire, are both planning to float their UK businesses. The sale of the RBS branches was halted in October when Santander pulled out of a deal to buy the whole portfolio for 1.65 billion pounds. RBS has said a sale this year is now unlikely, meaning it will have to ask European regulators to extend a December 2013 deadline."

Presenting a tough business plan for the next five years,  the cooperative lender -- one of 13 Italian banks under the supervision of the European Central Bank -- said it would close a total of 130 branches. That is 60 more than initially planned and comprises 24 percent of its network. It will also cut 430 jobs or just under eight percent of its workforce. Based in the wealthy north-eastern Veneto region, the bank has lost nearly 1.2 billion euros in the 18 months through June because of heavy writedowns on risky loans and on the value of past acquisitions. Its core capital (CET 1) ratio, which measures a bank's financial strength, fell to 8.37 percent at the end of June,  below a minimum 10 percent set by the ECB. That prompted plans for the cash call which should take place next April. The lender, which is also planning to float on the Milan bourse in January to raise funds, said on Wednesday the ratio would rise to 13.5 percent from 2018, and that it planned to return to profit next year. Veneto Banca is one of 10 cooperative lenders affected by a government reform that makes it easier for this type of bank to be taken over and aims to strengthen the sector by boosting earnings and efficiency. The bank, which has hired Rothschild  as an adviser, is set to ditch its cooperative status and transform into a joint-stock company as required by the new law at a shareholder meeting in early December. Merger Options Bankers say Banco Popolare, Italy's fourth largest bank and also based in the Veneto region, has explored the possibility of a tie-up with Veneto Banca. However Banco Popolare appears more likely to strike a deal with UBI, the country's fifth largest bank and a stronger partner. Some bankers do not rule out a three-way merger although it would be difficult to pull off. Veneto Banca has also been hit by a probe into whether it misled regulators by lending money to customers so that they bought its own shares. A similar investigation has also targeted fellow unlisted Veneto-based lender Banca Popolare di Vicenza. An ECB review of risk levels among euro zone lenders found both Veneto Banca and Popolare Vicenza fell short of new requirements set by the regulator, and placed them in band fourth out of five - with band one seen as the strongest, according to a source familiar with the matter. In its new plan, Veneto Banca said it was targeting a net profit of 160 million euros and a CET 1 ratio of 14 percent in 2018. We see a small return to profit next year, around 10-15 million euros, said the bank's newly-appointed CEO Cristiano Carrus.  ($1 = 0.8765 euros)   (Writing by Silvia Aloisi; Editing by Keith Weir)"

A 1.65-billion-pound ($2.6 billion) deal to sell the branches collapsed last month after Spanish bidder Santander  said the process of carving out the business from RBS had proved more difficult than expected. RBS, ordered to sell the branches as a condition of winning European approval for a state bailout during the 2008 financial crisis, has sent new sales documents to prospective buyers, and is hoping to draw up a shortlist next month. Strategically we want to enter into the SME (small and medium-sized enterprise) space. If there's anything I could do that would accelerate our strategy it would be of interest, Nationwide Chief Executive Graham Beale told Reuters on Tuesday. Within that context, RBS is something which we will watch very carefully.

There are clearly some enormous complexities there, otherwise that deal would have been done. We need to understand just what those issues are before we can be committal on the point, he said. Beale said he anticipated difficulties in separating the business from RBS as it was not a standalone entity but an amalgamation of assets embedded in a whole host of systems. Funding No Problem Beale said Nationwide would have no problem funding the transaction if it chose to proceed with a bid. If we were to do the RBS transaction, of all the things I'd be concerned about, funding wouldn't be one of them. If you look at the strength of our balance sheet, we've got one of the strongest solvency ratios in the industry, he said. Santander agreed to buy the RBS branches in August 2010 but technology and separation issues pushed back the original December 2011 completion date and the bank eventually concluded a deal could not be reached in a reasonable timeframe. Sources close to the matter have said businessman Richard Branson's Virgin Money and U.S. private equity firm J.C. Flowers are also interested in the branches. Corsair Capital, led by former Standard Chartered  chairman Mervyn Davies, and a joint venture between Blackstone and Anacap, the backers of new bank Aldermore, have made expressions of interest as well, sources have said. Any deal, however, is expected to fall short of the price agreed with Santander. RBS wants to have a shortlist of possible buyers in place by the middle of December and will then look to cut that down to two serious bidders, sources have said. It is planning a stock exchange listing of the business if a sale can't be agreed. UBS is advising RBS on the sale process. Nationwide also said it had set aside a further 45 million pounds to compensate customers mis-sold loan insurance, joining rivals in stepping up provisions and taking its total compensation bill to 173 million pounds. The cost of the compensation for the rising level of payment protection insurance (PPI) claims, along with higher impairment charges in Nationwide's commercial lending division, led to a decline in first-half underlying profit to 151 million pounds, against 181 million pounds the previous year. Britain's financial services industry could face a total bill of more than 15 billion pounds to cover compensation payouts for one of the country's biggest mis-selling scandals. PPI policies were typically taken out alongside a personal loan or mortgage to cover repayments if customers fell ill or lost their job, but they were often sold to people who would not have been eligible to claim on the policies.

Greek banks, which have been closed for weeks as the near-bankrupt country negotiates a bailout deal with international creditors, face liquidity problems and are bracing for a deep overhaul including closures or mergers. They will probably open again next week, propped up by  emergency funding from the European Central Bank announced on Thursday. As part of an earlier bailout agreement, Greek lenders committed to restructuring their operations, selling off assets held in the Balkans and focusing on their domestic market. As part of Friday's agreement, Alpha will be allowed to repatriate around 100 million euros ($108.5 million) of funds from Bulgaria, bank officials said. Unlike all other Greek-owned banks in Bulgaria that are subsidiaries under the supervision of the Bulgarian central bank, Alpha operates as a branch, meaning the central bank in Sofia cannot exercise full control over the lender. Eurobank runs a subsidiary in Bulgaria known as Postbank, while Alpha bank runs a network of outlets there that are controlled from Athens, which have been allowed to stay open despite bank closures and capital controls in Greece. Completion of the proposed transaction is expected by end of 2015 following the execution of definitive transaction documentation and the obtaining of all approvals required, the two banks said in a joint statement. The proposed transaction is capital neutral for Alpha Bank and is fully aligned with its commitment to focus its operations only on its core markets, they said. Bulgaria is vulnerable to the fallout from the debt crisis unfolding in its European Union neighbour, as more than a fifth of Bulgaria's banking assets are owned by Greek lenders. The deal will increase Bulgaria's central bank controls over Alpha Bank's operations and assets in the country, something that each central bank prefers, said Georgi Ganev of Sofia-based think-tank the Centre for Liberal Strategies. It is possible that the deal will also decrease some of the risks that stem from the fact that Alpha Bank is a branch and not a subsidiary, Ganev added. Eurobank Bulgaria had assets worth 5.9 billion levs (3 billion euros) at the end of March and posted a first-quarter net profit of 20.8 million levs. ($1 = 0.9217 euros)   (Writing by Matthias Williams; Editing by Jason Neely and David Holmes)"

Officials from Richard Stockton College in nearby Galloway Township, said in a statement they plan to convert some of the 1.4 million square foot building into dormitory space.  The Showboat has 1,329 hotel rooms and sits on 28 beachfront acres. Four Atlantic City casinos have closed this year, and city officials have struggled find uses for the shuttered buildings.  The former casino floor would be converted to administrative offices. Theaters at the building would, under the college's plans, house facilities for dance, music and drama programs, the school said. One of the three towers will remain a hotel holding some 479 rooms opening sometime in the spring of 2015. The college said dorm rooms could be used as hotel rooms during summer months, when demand is high and most students are away from campus.  The college said the purchase price is far less expensive than new construction. The purchase was announced in November. Gaming companies, fearing new competition, have typically inserted deed restrictions prohibiting new owners from re-opening the properties as casinos. The diversification of activities available in AC stands to benefit all of the city's stakeholders, said Caesars Entertainment CEO Gary Loveman in a statement. Caesars Entertainment closed Showboat in August, even though it was profitable, to try to consolidate Atlantic City's deteriorating gaming market. Stockton College purchased the Seaview Resort in Galloway Township in 2010 for $20 million. It uses part of the property to train students in hospitality and generate revenue for the college, and to house students. Reporting by Daniel Kelley in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Editing by Eric M.

An extension of the Commission's November 2013 deadline would give Lloyds more time to prepare an initial public offering for the branches if it is unsuccessful in pulling off a direct sale, which banking sources say is its preferred option. The Commission ordered Lloyds to sell the branches as pay back for receiving s tate aid in the 2008 financial crisis, leaving the UK government with a 40 percent stake. But Lloyds is discovering the difficulties of being a forced seller and risks running out of options having ended exclusive talks with mutually-owned The Co-Operative Group last month. A rival bidder NBNK may also run up against regulatory issues. Lloyds can go for an EC extension as it's not their fault they've had difficulties finding a buyer. They have as good a case as anyone to ask for an extension, said a source close to the discussions. There are a lot of issues around the sale and an IPO is not a foregone conclusion for 2013. Lloyds' sale, code named Project Verde, would fetch up to 1.5 billion pounds ($2.4 billion) and create Britain's seventh-biggest bank, with a 4.6 percent share of current accounts and 5 percent of mortgages. The UK market is dominated by four major players -- Barclays, HSBC, RBS  and Lloyds. The Commission is not averse to extending deadlines for asset sales providing companies can provide a strong enough reason that a lack of progress is through no fault of their own. Last year, Belgian banking and insurance group KBC  was given more time to sell assets and modify parts of its restructuring plan. Dutch financial services group ING, which had to sell assets after receiving state aid, is renegotiating its restructuring with the European Commission having won a court challenge against an EU ruling, potentially reducing the extent of disposals it needs to make. Quick Exit Although Lloyds is publicly pushing ahead with its twin approach of preparing for an IPO while continuing to engage with both Co-Op and rival bidder NBNK, banking sources say an outright sale remains the preferred option because it would offer Lloyds a clean and quick exit. I would call it an M&A-led; dual track. There is definitely more focus on the M&A;, one equity capital markets banker told Reuters. Another equity capital markets banker said Lloyds still had a long way to go before it would be ready to push ahead with a flotation and questioned whether such a move was desirable given the current lack of investor appetite for IPOs. I think there is some work to do before it goes down that route, the banker said. I think if there is a buyer for the whole piece out there you don't take the market risk, you go with that. London has had only a trickle of new listings activity over the last year, with no float raising more than $1 billion since commodities trader Glencore in May 2011. With stock markets buffeted by the euro zone debt crisis, bankers remain cautious over the outlook for market debuts this year, warning that investors remain very selective about what they are willing to buy in to and at what price. But shops-to-banking group Co-Op's offer to buy the branches has been plagued by regulatory concerns and there is increasing scepticism whether it can overcome them. The Financial Services Authority (FSA) is seeking reassurances over the capital position and structure of the Co-Op and whether its board has the experience to run a major bank. Fledgling banking venture NBNK, meanwhile, has yet to convince Lloyds management of the merits of its rival bid. Lloyds will not begin talks with NBNK, run by former Northern Rock executive Gary Hoffman, until it is satisfied the start-up will get regulatory clearance for a deal, which will depend largely on the perception of its capital strength. Paul Mumford, a fund manager at Cavendish Asset Management, said Lloyds' frustrations illustrated the difficulties of being a forced seller of assets and questioned the rationale behind the Commission's directive. What happens if they can't get the branches away and how does it place them in terms of the regulatory situation?, he asked. It's all very well saying we're going to take a load of branches away from Lloyds and then flog them on but the actual mechanics of doing it doesn't seem to be quite as easy. A spokeswoman for Lloyds said it was continuing to work towards the November 2013 deadline and preparing for both a sale to a third party or an IPO if that can't be achieved."
"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nikko-smbc-idUSBRE93K0EB20130421","SMBC Nikko bets on Abenomics, plans first new branches in five years","","April 21, 2013 /  9:41 PM / 4 years ago","","TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's SMBC Nikko Securities will expand its domestic retail branch network by more than 20 percent over the next three years as it bets that the new premier's economic policies will lift the stock market further, the head of the country's third-largest brokerage said. Tetsuya Kubo, who became president of the brokerage arm of banking group Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc (SMFG) (8316.T) this month, said he wanted to open 25 new branches as part of an effort to increase retail client assets by one-third, to 30 trillion yen ($302 billion), by 2016. The aggressive shift in strategy for SMBC Nikko, which has 109 branches and has not opened a new one in five years, could also mean tougher competition for Nomura Holdings Inc (8604.T) and Daiwa Securities Group Inc (8601.T), Japan's two largest securities firms which have about 180 and 120 branches, respectively. Kubo, 59, said there was a need to invest in the brokerage's retail network after years of tight cost controls under the previous owner Citigroup Inc (C.N), which sold the franchise, known as Nikko Cordial, to SMFG in 2009. Nikko is strong in retail but for the past several years we didn't really put resources into branches and staff, Kubo, previously chief financial officer of SMFG, told Reuters in an interview last week. His comments were embargoed for release on Monday. To be a winner over the long term there is a need to increase staff, Kubo said. Earlier this month, the company announced it would boost overall staffing by 600, to 8,600, under a three-year business plan. A Different Look Kubo said he was confident that bold fiscal and monetary steps under Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, aimed at pulling the economy out of deflation, would continue to push stock prices higher. He would not be surprised, he said, if the Nikkei stock average .N225 reached 16,000 by the end of 2013. That would be a gain of another 20 percent for the benchmark from its close on Friday at 13,316.48, after already rallying some 50 percent since Abe was tipped as a candidate for premier in mid-November. Kubo also noted a marked increase in interest from foreign investors during the final months of his tenure as the banking group's CFO, when the aggressive economic stimulus espoused under Abenomics set stocks rising and the yen tumbling. While it was normal to be called on by asset managers in charge of Japan, he also started to get requests for meetings from global managers of equity funds. There was a different look in their eyes. They wanted to know what was happening in Japan, what had changed, he said. Japanese individuals, which park the bulk of their $15 trillion worth of savings in bank deposits and other low-yielding instruments, have been a particularly hard sell for Japanese stock brokers and asset managers. Memories still linger of the collapse of Japan's asset bubble two decades ago, which hit retail investors hard. Kubo sees SMBC Nikko's ties to its parent bank, which owns 100 percent of the broker, as a key advantage over independent securities firms such as Nomura and Daiwa in tapping the renewed retail investor interest in stocks. The brokerage has attracted 1 trillion yen in assets through referrals from SMFG bank clients since becoming part of Japan's third-largest banking group, Kubo said. Of the 7 trillion yen increase in retail assets the brokerage is targeting over the next three years, it hopes to capture another 1 trillion yen through such referrals from SMFG, which has 10 times the number of accounts as SMBC Nikko, he said.

Western officials are increasingly pointing the finger of blame at Sinai Province, which has focused on killing Egyptian soldiers and police since the military toppled President Mohamed Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood in 2013 after mass protests. If solid evidence emerges it attacked the aircraft, that would instantly propel the group to the top of the jihadi ladder, with one of the deadliest attacks since al Qaeda flew planes into the World Trade Center in New York in 2001. If a bomb knocked Airbus A321 (AIR.PA) out of the sky, that would challenge Egypt's assertions that it had brought under control militants who have carried out high-profile attacks on senior government officials and Western targets. Security experts and investigators have said the plane is unlikely to have been struck from the outside and Sinai militants are not believed to have any missiles capable of striking a jet at 30,000 feet. Sinai Province is partly the product of Egypt's efforts to eliminate militancy, which has threatened the most populous Arab country for decades, according to the intelligence sources. The three officials, who closely follow the Sinai-based insurgency, say many of its fighters fled to Syria after Mursi was removed and then army chief Abdel Fattah al-Sisi unleashed security forces on Islamists, both moderate and radical. Sinai Province's leader - a 42-year-old former clothes importer known by his nom de guerre Abu Osama al-Masri - studied at Al-Azhar, a 1,000-year old Egyptian center for Islamic learning that supports the government, said the officials. But like others who learned in a center known for its moderation, he was radicalized and took up arms in Sinai before heading to Syria with about 20 followers when security forces clamped down on Islamists after Mursi's departure, the sources said. 'They Became Experts' There, he and the other fighters gained experience that would prove useful upon their eventual return to the Sinai, when they were approached by Islamic State and embraced its goal of creating a caliphate across the Muslim world.  It seems they were mesmerized by Islamic State's mysterious Iraqi leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, said the officials.  Islamic State sent arms and cash by boat from Iraq to neighboring Libya, where militants have thrived in the chaos that followed the fall of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011, said another intelligence official. A porous border then enabled Baghdadi's supporters to travel to Sinai, on the other side of Egypt, to deliver the goods to Islamist militant comrades, the officials added. Other militants taught them how to evade capture and they learned how to shoot accurately and assemble bombs, said one of the intelligence officials, speaking on condition of anonymity. They became experts.     Will McCants, director of the Center for Middle East Policy at the Washington-based Brookings Institution, said that not a lot is known about the working relationship between the Islamic State's Sinai affiliate and the movement's central leadership.  But the Egyptian group – like other affiliates – appears to enjoy considerable autonomy. The state security crackdown launched against the Muslim Brotherhood and other Islamists has gained the Islamic State's Sinai branch significant local support, allowing its fighters to hide and operate among ordinary people, he said. Secretive During Mursi's time, security officials allege, militants from al Qaeda, including some who had traveled from as far away as Afghanistan, had a free hand in Sinai. They included about 4,000 fighters who would form the core of Sinai Province, which was called Ansar Beyt al-Maqdis before declaring its support for Islamic State last year, said the officials. The crackdown on Islamists by Sisi - now president - led to many militants being killed, jailed or fleeing for countries like Syria and Libya. Sinai Province now consists of only hundreds of militants scattered into groups of 5-7 men, which have few links to reduce the chances of capture, said the officials. They are very secretive, one of the intelligence officials said. Each cell doesn't know about other cells. Another said: It's a small number of militants but it takes just one person to carry out a suicide bombing. Last year, security officials said Masri and a few other leaders had been killed.  He later appeared in a video purported to prove he is alive and reaffirmed his loyalty to Baghdadi. Masri could be seen kneeling beside weapons he said were seized from 30 Egyptian soldiers killed in an attack.  A military armored personnel carrier burned in the background.

Saakashvili struck a conciliatory tone in remarks to thousands of supporters at their first big rally since his party was swept from power by Ivanishvili's opposition movement in a parliamentary election last October. The defeat set up a tense situation in the Caucasus state, a conduit for pipelines pumping Caspian Sea energy westward and a platform for geopolitical rivalry between the United States and Russia, which fought a brief war with Georgia in 2008. Saakashvili is barred by term limits from seeking re-election this autumn and the president's powers have already been reduced, but his United National Movement wants to remain relevant. I'd like to extend a hand of friendship to them, Saakashvili said of Ivanishvili's government, addressing more than 10,000 supporters in the centre of the capital Tbilisi. If we, your opposition, are optimistic, you should be optimistic too - and not angry, he said. But he got a cool reception from Ivanishvili's camp. Saakashvili could not become a president of the whole country. He is just a leader of one political team - and this team, as well as he himself, are in the past, said Eka Beselia, a lawmaker from Ivanishvili's Georgian Dream coalition. The rally was framed as a new start for Saakashvili's party and a show of support for the pro-Western course set by the president, who was first elected after leading the peaceful Rose Revolution protests in 2003 that swept out the old guard. Saakashvili cultivated close relations with Washington, and his efforts to bring Georgia into NATO were one of the factors that led to the five-day war with Russia in 2008. Ivanishvili, a billionaire who made his fortune in Russia, fought off suggestions from Saakashvili during the parliamentary election campaign that he was a Kremlin stooge. Demonstrators echoed that theme on Friday, holding posters that read, Any country but Russia - no way, but the West, Bidzina, go home! and Georgia's choice is Europe. Ivanishvili has pledged to make relations with the West a priority, following in Saakashvili's footsteps, but says he also wants to improve ties with Moscow. Russia recently agreed to open its market to Georgian wine and mineral water, which were banned in 2006 as tensions increased, and Ivanishvili wants an investigation into the war to see whether Saakashvili was partly to blame.

Will McCants, director of the Center for Middle East Policy at the Washington-based Brookings Institution, said that not a lot is known about the working relationship between the Islamic State's Sinai affiliate and the movement's central leadership. But the Egyptian group - like other affiliates - appears to enjoy considerable autonomy. The state security crackdown launched against the Muslim Brotherhood and other Islamists has gained the Islamic State's Sinai branch significant local support, allowing its fighters to hide and operate among ordinary people, he said. Secretive During Mursi's time, security officials allege, militants from al Qaeda, including some who had travelled from as far away as Afghanistan, had a free hand in Sinai. They included about 4,000 fighters who would form the core of Sinai Province, which was called Ansar Beyt al-Maqdis before declaring its support for Islamic State last year, said the officials. The crackdown on Islamists by Sisi - now president - led to many militants being killed, jailed or fleeing for countries like Syria and Libya. Sinai Province now consists of only hundreds of militants scattered into groups of 5-7 men, which have few links to reduce the chances of capture, said the officials. They are very secretive, one of the intelligence officials said. Each cell doesn't know about other cells. Another said: It's a small number of militants but it takes just one person to carry out a suicide bombing. Last year, security officials said Masri and a few other leaders had been killed. He later appeared in a video purported to prove he is alive and reaffirmed his loyalty to Baghdadi. Masri could be seen kneeling beside weapons he said were seized from 30 Egyptian soldiers killed in an attack. A military armoured personnel carrier burned in the background. A tribal leader in the Sinai told Reuters he had recently noticed pro-Islamic State militants driving around in new Toyota Land Cruisers. Some had Apple computers. It seems they are getting more and more ambitious, he said. Additional reporting by Jonathan Landay in Washington; Editing

Juncker, whose appointment to head the European Union's executive was strongly opposed by British Prime Minister David Cameron, said Jonathan Hill will become the European Union's  first dedicated financial services commissioner, giving him huge influence over the City of London and rivals Paris and Frankfurt. Observers had expected Hill to have a junior role in energy. Cameron's spokesman said the appointment of Hill, who was leader of Britain's upper house of parliament, the House of Lords, will ensure that the voice of EU members from outside the euro zone will be fully represented in the bloc's wider single market. Financial services is a very significant sector here in the UK ... so we welcome that and look forward to working with Lord Hill and the entire Commission-designate, the spokesman said. London is the 28-country bloc's biggest financial centre. Britain, one of the most Eurosceptic countries, has become more antagonistic towards Brussels as supervision of banks and markets shifts increasingly to the EU level. This loss of national power has fuelled a surge in support for British anti-EU party UKIP, prompting Cameron to promise a referendum on membership of the EU in 2017 if he is still prime minister after national polls next year. It's a very good appointment for the City, said Chris Cummings, chief executive of TheCityUK, which promotes Britain as a financial centre. In the context of British membership of the EU, it demonstrates that other member states are keen to listen to the reform perspective Britain has put forward, Cummings said. Cameron has urged the EU to push harder for economic growth as the euro zone, Britain's biggest export market, stutters. Simon Lewis, chief executive of the Association for Financial Markets in Europe, a banking lobby, said Hill's appointment recognises the importance of Europe's capital markets at a crucial moment, as an unprecedented array of new regulatory measures reach the implementation phase. Britain's opposition Labour party said Hill cannot be commissioner just for the City of London but for all European citizens who still feel shockwaves from the financial crisis. Hill faces a tough hearing in the European Parliament which is keen to keep cracking down on bankers. I don't know if it's a joke or a provocation. This is unacceptable, said Philippe Lamberts, co-leader of parliament's Green bloc, said. Juncker wanted to offer a present to David Cameron to help prevent a Brexit (British exit). Who is Lord Hill? His background is lobbying and he has no known competence in the subject matter and that's a wrong message, Lamberts added. Hill will oversee the euro zone's new banking union, which may irritate lawmakers from the currency area. Britain has challenged an EU cap on bankers' bonuses -- mostly affecting those working in London -- in the bloc's top court. But Hill will have to defend EU rules as part of his job. He will also effectively report to more senior commissioners who could stamp out any attempts to go soft on finance. Olive Branch Hill, a public relations consultant and former chief of staff to former UK prime minister John Major, will oversee one of Juncker's core projects: to create a capital market union that will expand areas such as asset-backed securities to fund economic growth as banks regroup after the financial crisis. His remit will help ease growing concerns in the City that the euro zone countries will call the shots from November under new EU voting rules which will give the currency union a ready-made qualified majority to push through pan-EU laws. In addition, the bulk of lawmakers in the new European Parliament's two main parties -- the centre-right EPP, which Britain's Conservatives have quit, and the socialists -- are drawn mainly from euro countries like Germany, Italy and Spain. Also from November, the European Central Bank becomes the direct supervisor for the euro zone's biggest banks, which represent the bulk of banking assets in the EU, giving it enormous clout in financial policy and rule making. While the EU has approved the bulk of new regulation since the 2007-09 financial crisis forced European taxpayers to prop up banks, many of the rules have yet to be fully implemented. Controversial legislation still remains to be approved. After Cameron's failed attempt to stop Luxembourger Juncker, the City worries that Britain's influence in Brussels has weakened. This is a significant economic portfolio -- particularly given President Juncker's pledge to create a capital markets union, said Simon Walker, director general of Britain's Institute of Directors, an industry lobby. Entrusting this commitment along with financial services to a UK Commissioner is a clear demonstration that British influence in Brussels is far from waning, Walker said.

A target date fund is a type of mutual fund that adjusts its allocations based on a specific target date, typically changing holdings to become more conservative as the date approaches. From 2009 to 2011, the average asset-weighted target date fund allocation to commodities, real estate and Treasury inflation-protected securities more than doubled to 7.2 percent from 3.6 percent, according to the study, conducted by BrightScope Inc., which researches and rates 401(k) plans. Some target date funds have more than a quarter of their allocations dedicated to these asset classes, according to BrightScope. For example, institutional shares of the Allianz Global Investor Solutions 2015 Fund had 40.7 percent of its portfolio in commodities, TIPs and real estate, up from 24.7 percent in 2009. Fidelity Investments' Freedom Income Fund had 14.7 percent in these asset classes in 2011, up from 2.3 percent in 2009. The shift is significant because many target-date managers do not invest in any commodities, real estate or TIPs, said Eddie Alfred, vice president of data and research at BrightScope. For firms like Allianz, much of that increase in allocation is due to managers investing more in TIPs. We have shortened our longer Treasury exposure and upped our TIPs exposure because the 10-year Treasury has really lost purchasing power, said Mark Hathaway, portfolio specialist. An increasing number of target-date fund managers are looking at areas like TIPs because they are concerned about the long-term implications of inflation on returns, said Josh Charlson, an analyst at Morningstar Inc. Investors and advisers just need to understand how their managers are using these asset classes and what their expertise is, he said. Even TIPS carry their own kinds of risks. At the same time, many target date managers are increasing their allocation to exchange-traded funds, according to BrightScope. Franklin Resources' Franklin Templeton Investments, The Hartford Financial Services Group, ING Index Solutions and Nationwide Financial are among the managers that have increased their allocation to ETFs over the past couple of years, according to BrightScope. Given recent regulations that require greater disclosure of 401(k) plan fees to employers and plan participants, more firms may add ETFs because they can be cheaper than their mutual fund counterparts, said Brooks Herman, head of research at BrightScope. From 2009 to 2011 expenses on target date funds decreased to 0.72 percent From 0.75 percent. Meanwhile, some firms have gotten out of target date funds altogether. In the past few months, Oppenheimer Funds, Goldman Sachs Asset Management and Columbia Funds have announced or have closed their target date funds after failing to gain significant assets. Columbia has $196 million in target date fund assets, Oppenheimer has $624 million, and Goldman Sachs has $67 million, according to BrightScope. The new trend shows how difficult it is for asset managers to gain market share in the target date fund space, Alfred said. The largest record keepers of 401(k) plans essentially act as gate keepers over which funds go into these plans, and many of them, like Fidelity, Vanguard and T.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-cenbank-exclusive-idUSKCN0Y92K9","Exclusive: Brazil's central bank closely monitoring nine banks - document","","May 18, 2016 /  6:25 PM / a year ago","","BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's central bank has placed nine banks under special surveillance and is closely monitoring the liquidity and stability of their operations, according to an undated internal bank document reviewed by Reuters.         The document, labeled as a presentation prepared for a May 19 meeting of the central bank's financial stability committee, which coordinates regulation of the banking system, says the small banks under surveillance include Banif, Maxima, Ficsa, Gerador, Pottencial, BPN Brasil, Mercantil do Brasil (BMEB4.SA) and Pan (BPAN4.SA).     The heightened scrutiny reflects regulators' concerns, outlined in the document, that excessive leverage, recurring losses, tough-to-sell assets or reputational risks could eventually threaten the lenders' stability.     The list also includes BTG Pactual (BBTG11.SA), Latin America's largest investment bank, which was plunged into turmoil by the arrest of its founder Andres Esteves in November in a corruption probe. Esteves has since been released and the bank has implemented a recovery program.     The institutions under surveillance have little or no presence in the retail banking market and are focused instead on niche markets such as mortgages, payroll lending and mid-cap corporate loans.     Still, the close monitoring and, in some cases, limits on new lending and dividends, reflect regulators' determination to keep the Brazilian banking system well capitalized as the worst downturn in decades tightens credit and increases defaults.      A spokesman for the central bank said in a statement that due to secrecy rules and in line with its governance guidelines, the central bank will not make any public comments on the situation of financial institutions.     The central bank spokesman declined to answer questions about the document reviewed by Reuters. Told of its contents, he said, without providing specifics, that the information was incomplete, out of context and included elements that did not correspond to reality.       Several banks named in the document confirmed they had been in touch with the central bank, addressing its concerns and strengthening their balance sheets through asset sales, improved lending practices or, in one instance, the sale of the bank. Other lenders declined to comment.     Close surveillance by the central bank does not mean that a bank's solvency is in question, according to a former central bank official familiar with the surveillance regime. The regulatory presentation itself distinguishes between three ascending levels of concern color-coded yellow, orange and red, without spelling out specific criteria for each category.     The former central bank official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that having more than a half dozen banks on the list was worrying. There are always banks under surveillance and you would expect the list to grow in an economic recession, the former official added. The chances of getting off the list easily also depend on the economy.     Together, the nine institutions group just 2.6 percent of the loans in Brazil's financial system, according to December central bank data.       Despite a contraction of 3.8 percent in Latin America's largest economy last year, Brazil's banking system has remained robust. The 130 banks in Brazil saw their return on equity rise to 15.4 percent last year, from 13.0 percent in 2014.     While data shows non-performing loans increasing this year, the average regulatory capital level for Brazilian banks stands at 16.3 percent, according to central bank data, comfortably above the global benchmark of 8 percent under Basel rules.       'Under Control'     The Brazilian unit of Madeira-based bank Banif was the only bank in the document listed in the red category corresponding to the highest level of concern. Portuguese authorities undertook a 2.2 billion euro bailout of its parent bank in December.       Brazil's central bank stepped in to demand a recovery plan from Banif earlier this year after observing problems with its balance sheet, strain on its cash flow and a reliance on illiquid assets such as real estate, the presentation said.     Banif told Reuters in a statement that its situation was absolutely under control, with indicators inside regulatory norms and a restructuring process almost complete.      The central bank report indicated three small banks - Maxima, Ficsa and Gerador – raised a secondary level of concern, labeled orange in the presentation. A table in the document showed those were the only three banks under surveillance whose capital levels late last year fell short of the 11 percent minimum regulatory capital ratio established under Brazil's Basel regulations.     The document also said that Maxima lent money without observing principles of selectivity, liquidity and guarantees, but did not elaborate.      In a statement to Reuters, Maxima said the central bank's questions about loans had been clarified and resolved. Maxima said its decision to focus exclusively on real estate lending in recent years has affected its results but its loan book was showing improvement and its Basel capital ratio improved to 12.79 percent in February.     In the case of Gerador, the central bank document flagged deteriorating equity, resulting in the violation of various operating limits.     Gerador's Chairman Paulo Macedo told Reuters that shareholders had decided to sell the bank and were working transparently with the central bank so depositors did not suffer any losses.      Brazilian lender Agiplan agreed to buy Gerador this month with plans to inject 80 million reais and rename it Banco Agiplan once the acquisition was approved by the central bank.     Freezing Salaries      Ficsa was one of three banks in the document where the central bank had applied preventive prudential measures, a term for regulators' discretionary limits on banking operations, which were not specified in Ficsa's case.  Ficsa has been deleveraging since it suspended operations in 2012, the bank said in a statement, adding that its partners were open to a possible opportunity to sell.     The central bank also applied preventive prudential measures to Banif and BTG Pactual, including the suspension of executive pay raises, bonuses and dividends beyond minimum legal limits, according to the report. None of the three banks commented on the measures.       BTG Pactual, along with Pan, Pottencial, Mercantil do Brasil and BPN Brasil, were covered under the lowest level of concern” in the presentation.     The report on BTG Pactual focused on withdrawals by investors after Esteves' arrest in a sweeping corruption probe stemming from state-run oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4.SA).      Esteves was released from house arrest in late April and has returned to Latin America's largest investment bank as a senior partner advising on strategic issues. BTG Pactual has been executing a plan to improve its liquidity, including the sale of credit portfolios and stakes in companies.     BTG Pactual and BPN declined to comment on the central bank surveillance described in the report. Pottencial did not respond to questions on the matter. Pan and Mercantil said their business models were solid. Mercantil added that its business was expanding, with plans to open 20 new branches this year.

China's largest private shipbuilder, which expects to post a significantly higher first-half loss when it reports results next week, has suffered from a drastic slump in orders amid a global shipping downturn. It also diversified into building drilling rigs, used in oil exploration, in 2013. Rongsheng said on Thursday it had, through a subsidiary, bought a 60 percent share in New Continental Oil & Gas Co. Ltd for HK$ 2.184 billion ($281.82 million). New Continental, together with Kyrgyzstan's national oil company, operates four oilfields in the country. In the announcement, which came after Hong Kong markets shut, Rongsheng said it will finance the deal by issuing 1.4 billion shares at a premium of 12.23 percent to its Thursday closing share price of HK$ 1.39 per share. Given the relatively adverse market conditions for shipbuilding industry for the time being, the acquisition can assist the group in diversifying operations and broadening its source of revenue, Rongsheng said in the statement. The company expects to realise a dramatic increase of oil output through upgrade and consolidation of the existing exploration technology and thereby to generate steady operating cash flows, it said. The oilfields, in the Central Asian country of Kyrgyzstan that borders China, sit adjacent to the Fergana Valley where Rongsheng said a recent third-party reserve survey had found abundant oil and gas resources. The geological reserve of crude oil in such oilfields amounted to 276 million tons in aggregate, the firm said. Rongsheng last year appealed to the government for financial help. In March it agreed with banks to extend loans and other financing.  (1 US dollar = 7.7496 Hong Kong dollar)   (Reporting by Brenda Goh; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman)"

Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said Paris was determined to press ahead with Berlin on stronger economic governance in Europe to resolve the debt crisis -- a persistent German demand but a divisive issue for the ruling Socialist Party in France, where many are reluctant to cede more authority to Brussels. President Francois Hollande's policy of showing sympathy to debt-laden nations like Italy and Spain as they face more austerity demands has stirred concern in some quarters that he is not closely enough aligned with Germany's Angela Merkel. Yet Ayrault, a German speaker who has input on bilateral issues, said Paris was keenly focused on relations with Berlin, the euro zone's top economy and effective paymaster. The next phase of European construction will only be possible thanks to Franco-German agreement, Ayrault told an annual conference of France's Medef business chamber. The Franco-German couple is more necessary than ever. But as Paris and Berlin lay plans for closer economic union, they should not shut out the views of other EU partners, Ayrault said, adding that Italy in particular must play a driving role. His comments, which seemed aimed at silencing any concerns about the Franco-German relationship, were echoed by other senior cabinet members. Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius told a meeting of French ambassadors that the Paris-Berlin axis was crucial to Europe. Finance Minister Pierre Moscovici, meanwhile, told Les Echos newspaper that, while there had been a period of apprenticeship, relations with Berlin were now working well.    Officials in Berlin have suggested that Hollande, who won power in May with a campaign against German-led austerity, has recognised that he needs to work closely with Berlin to resolve the four-year-old euro zone crisis. The French have finally realised that they need us to get things done in Europe, one senior German official said this week, after a meeting between Moscovici and his German counterpart Wolfgang Schaeuble in Berlin on Monday. Moscovici told Les Echos he had set up a Franco-German working group with Schaeuble to forge a common position on euro zone issues and competitiveness. We are ready to go further in European integration provided each step includes a further element of solidarity. That is why we have not dropped the idea of pooling national public debts, he was quoted as saying. Determined to Keep Greece in Euro Last weekend, Hollande followed Merkel's firm line after meeting with Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras in Paris, saying Greece must show its commitment to reform before receiving further aid from Europe. Ayrault, however, made it plain that France continues to favour further support for southern Europe. Integration with solidarity that means, in the short term, that we are determined to do everything to keep Greece in the euro zone, he told the conference. It also means strengthened stabilisation mechanisms for our partners in southern Europe. In this context we must push ahead quickly with a banking union, he said, referring to plans for joint European bank supervision. Ayrault said that, with the euro zone's debt crisis weighing heavily on France's economy, his government's top priority was to restore stability to Europe and this meant France must stick scrupulously to its own EU deficit-cutting commitments. He reiterated that France was determined to retain its financial credibility by hitting its 3 percent deficit target next year, though he recognised that this would require paring back spending next year. The government needs to find some 30 billion euros ($38 billion) i n deficit cuts next year, half of which it has said will come from spending. But budget restraint alone is not enough, we see that today in the countries of southern Europe: without growth, nothing is possible, he said. Ayrault also sought to comfort corporations alarmed by billions of euros in tax rises in this year's budget, telling the Medef conference that an upcoming tax reform would help to improve France's flagging competitiveness -- an apparent reference to plans to reduce social charges on labour. We welcome the prime minister's speech...but speeches are not enough: we imperatively need in the coming weeks a pro-business budget for France, Medef chief Marisol Parisot told a news conference."

The attack caused no casualties or damage but forced the facility to be closed as a precaution, though state energy company Sonatrach said Algeria's gas production had not been affected. This operation has destroyed your claims to have defeated 'terrorism' as you like to describe it, the Islamist militant group said in a statement directed at the Algerian government and Western oil companies. Even if your Western masters believed you were in control previously, how will you justify your position now?  Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb has claimed several attacks across the region recently, including an assault on a resort in Ivory Coast on Sunday that killed 18 people it said was revenge for a French offensive against Islamist militants in the Sahel. Algeria, emerging from its own 1990s war with Islamist fighters that killed 200,000, has become an important partner in the Western campaign against Islamist militancy. The OPEC nation is also a major gas supplier to Europe. Attacks in the North African country are rarer since it ended its civil war, but al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and fighters allied with Islamic State are still active, mostly in the remote south and mountains east of Algiers.

Officials from Richard Stockton College in nearby Galloway Township, said in a statement they plan to convert some of the 1.4 million square foot building into dormitory space. The Showboat has 1,329 hotel rooms and sits on 28 beachfront acres. Four Atlantic City casinos have closed this year, and city officials have struggled find uses for the shuttered buildings. The former casino floor would be converted to administrative offices. Theaters at the building would, under the college's plans, house facilities for dance, music and drama programs, the school said. One of the three towers will remain a hotel holding some 479 rooms opening sometime in the spring of 2015. The college said dorm rooms could be used as hotel rooms during summer months, when demand is high and most students are away from campus. The college said the purchase price is far less expensive than new construction. The purchase was announced in November. Gaming companies, fearing new competition, have typically inserted deed restrictions prohibiting new owners from re-opening the properties as casinos. The diversification of activities available in AC stands to benefit all of the city's stakeholders, said Caesars Entertainment CEO Gary Loveman in a statement. Caesars Entertainment closed Showboat in August, even though it was profitable, to try to consolidate Atlantic City's deteriorating gaming market. Stockton College purchased the Seaview Resort in Galloway Township in 2010 for $20 million. It uses part of the property to train students in hospitality and generate revenue for the college, and to house students.

The ratings on Mizuho Corporate Bank reflect its financial profile on a consolidated basis, in addition to the consolidated financial profile and market position of its parent, Mizuho Financial Group Inc.

The ratings also acknowledge Mizuho Corporate Bank's close business links with affiliated group companies and Mizuho FG's control of the group's organizational structure and capital allocation. As the second-largest bank in Japan, Mizuho FG has maintained a solid domestic franchise, which leads us to our strong assessment of its business position. The group's strength lies in its intensive network in metropolitan areas as well as a broad range of services including investment banking, international operations, and asset management. We view Mizuho FG's capital and earnings as moderate compared to its peers, based on our expectation that the risk-adjusted capital (RAC) ratio will improve but remain around 6.0%-7.0% over the next two years. Our risk position assessment for Mizuho FG is adequate. We expect the volume and performance of Mizuho FG's loan portfolio to remain stable. Mizuho FG's funding, which mainly comes from deposits, is stable and its reliance on wholesale funding is low. Its liquidity position is strong, in our opinion, given its sizable amount of highly liquid assets, such as cash and government bonds.

The bank is considering applying for a licence to serve U.S. clients from the United States, two industry lawyers with knowledge of the matter told Reuters. A source close to Swiss regulator FINMA said the bank told the body that it was looking into opening a U.S. branch. If successful, the strategy could become a template for other banks in the U.S. taxman's sights, the legal sources said. They are saying, in effect, that they will work together with the regulators to resolve any overhanging problems, and broadening their way into the U.S. market at the same time, said a Zurich-based investment consultant who works closely with the bank. Bank Frey's head of private banking, Stefan Buck, and lawyer Edward Paltzer, a partner at law firm Niederer Kraft & Frey, were charged in April with helping American clients to hide millions of dollars in offshore accounts to avoid paying taxes. Frey, one of the smaller Swiss private banks, with less than 2 billion Swiss francs ($2.14 billion) under management, said last month that it was the Swiss Bank No.1 named in the indictment against Buck and Paltzer. Several Swiss banks, including Credit Suisse and Julius Baer, are under investigation for helping wealthy Americans to evade tax.

Bank Frey's acting chief executive Flavio Battaini declined to comment on whether the bank plans to apply for a U.S. licence.

India's slowest economic growth in a decade and a weakened rupee have weighed on the balance sheets of heavily leveraged Indian companies, including those that have raised money from Indian lenders in offshore centres such as Singapore. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) is looking more closely at the books of the local operations of some Indian banks to assess the credit quality of loans made from the branches to Indian companies, bankers said. There is an enhanced degree of oversight by the Monetary Authority of Singapore on Indian Banks in the recent days, S.S. Mundra, chairman and managing director of state-run Bank of Baroda, told Reuters. They are closely keeping a tab on the NPA (non-performing asset) levels and looking at the quality of assets financed. An MAS spokesman said it does not comment on our dealings with individual financial institutions The regulator has in some cases suggested that banks re-classify some loans as non-performing assets, two bankers said, speaking on condition of anonymity. MAS is analysing the credit exposures taken by banks and is ensuring that we steer clear from lending to Indian firms they are hearing adverse reports about, said a top executive at an Indian state bank, declining to be identified. Singapore is a significant offshore centre for Indian finance and is the second-largest source of foreign investment flows into India, with 9.2 percent of its population of Indian origin. Offshore Funds Indian banks have in recent years been building up their presence in Singapore, Dubai and Hong Kong in order to serve large populations of non-resident Indians as well as Indian companies looking to raise funds offshore. They (regulators) perceive that risks in Indian banks' operations are higher, said another top executive at an Indian bank with operations in Singapore. Banking sources said the intensity of MAS audits varied based on an individual bank's circumstances. Some Indian banks with operations in Singapore said they had not seen any stepped-up oversight from the regulator there. This is a normal inspection and MAS does it once in two years. They have covered our bank and have not made any observations. There were no concerns regarding NPAs or lending to any companies, said Vijaylakshmi Iyer, chairwoman and managing director of Bank of India. Hemant Contractor, who heads the overseas operations of State Bank of India, the country's largest lender, also said the MAS had made a regular inspection of the bank and that there had been no specific observations made, nor was there anything unusual about such inspections. Due diligence and regulatory oversight has definitely increased after the financial crisis, not just in Singapore but across the globe, he said. An official at the Reserve Bank of India was not aware of increased scrutiny of Indian banks by the MAS but said such efforts would be justified during times of stress. The Reserve Bank steps up monitoring of banks' books during difficult times. It is not necessary that the MAS will inform us about their actions, the official said, declining to be identified.

On Monday, Ebtisam al-Arrayed, head of regulatory policy at the central bank, told Reuters that the regulator had yet to make a decision about Future Bank after placing it under its administration last year, along with Iran Insurance Co - the Bahrain branch of an Iranian insurer. At that time the regulator said the moves were to protect the rights of depositors and policyholders. Calls to the two companies offices in Bahrain on Tuesday were not answered. Future Bank, based in Manama, is a commercial bank which was founded as a joint venture between two Iranian banks - Bank Saderat and Bank Melli - and Bahrain's Ahli United Bank, according to its website. The bank's assets stood at 569.4 million dinars ($1.51 billion) at the end of September 2015, according to the latest financial statement on the bank's website. Bahrain's central bank has not elaborated on its reasons for the action, which has highlighted the risks to Iran's business interests from heightened political tensions in the Gulf. Earlier this month Bahrain said it was cutting diplomatic ties with Iran, following its neighbour Saudi Arabia in severing ties with Tehran after Iranian protesters angered by the Sunni Muslim kingdom's decision to execute a leading Shi'ite cleric, attacked its mission there.

The pipeline is designed to carry Russian gas to Europe, bypassing Ukraine - through which existing pipelines carry nearly half the gas that Europe buys from Russia. The project faces stiff resistance from some EU and U.S. officials, who want Europe to reduce its reliance on Russian energy. U.S. and EU sanctions imposed on Russia over its annexation of Ukraine and subsequent actions have so far been limited to asset freezes and travel bans on individuals and companies closely linked to Russian President Vladimir Putin or to Russia's annexation of Crimea, and on pro-Russian separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine. Neither Gazprom nor its managers have been targeted. Gazprom Chief Executive Alexei Miller is a longstanding ally of Putin's. OMV said the two companies aimed to get the necessary permits by the end of 2015, make the first gas deliveries in 2017 and fully commission the spur, with half the capacity of the main pipeline, by January 2018. Both Gazprom and OMV have warned against broadening Western sanctions, saying they could disrupt gas exports to Europe. Asked about the potential effect of sanctions, an OMV spokesman said: We cannot foresee what will happen in the short term but, in the long term, we are convinced of South Stream's contribution to European security of supply. Italy's Saipem, already contracted to work on one of four parallel South Stream pipelines due to cross the Black Sea, said on Tuesday it had won a 400 million euro ($554 million) order to work on another of the pipelines. The European Union, concerned about Russia's dominant role in supplying a third of the bloc's gas, says South Stream does not comply with EU regulations on ownership and third-party access, regardless of bilateral agreements between Russia and some EU countries. But some EU leaders see South Stream as a solution to the potential for more problems following disruptions to the gas flow through Ukraine in 2006 and 2009. South Stream's path from the Bulgarian Black Sea coast through Serbia and Hungary to the Baumgarten gas hub in Austria is close to the route that the now-abandoned OMV-led Nabucco West gas pipeline would have taken, transiting some of the countries most dependent on Russian gas. The main branch of the 2,400-km (1,500-mile) pipeline is planned to continue from Hungary through Slovenia to Italy. The European Union has placed the approval process for the project on hold following Russia's annexation of Crimea and said it might take years to give the necessary permissions. Gazprom and OMV said they had already established a legal basis for the Austrian section of South Stream in an intergovernmental agreement between Russia and Austria signed in April 2010.

Greece has been rushing to wrap up the deal in a bid to protect its battered banking system from the fallout from a plan to impose a levy on bank deposits in Cyprus, but its efforts have been held up by delays in Nicosia in approving the tax. Euro zone finance ministers excluded the Greek branches of Cypriot banks from the controversial tax included in the island's international bailout on condition that those units would be transferred to Greek banks. The Greek government is ready to conclude the transfer of Cypriot bank operations in the country to Greek banks in a few hours, a senior government official told Reuters on Tuesday. But we have to wait for the parliament in Cyprus to vote. The leaders of Greece's three-party ruling coalition are due to meet later on Tuesday, with the Cyprus issue expected to feature high on the agenda. The official said Alpha Bank and Piraeus Bank  had expressed interest in absorbing the Cypriot operations in Greece and that there was also a plan B, without providing details. Such a plan could involve Hellenic Postbank, a small lender controlled by the country's bank bailout fund Hellenic Financial Stability Fund, if interest by other lenders is deemed unsatisfactory, bankers have said. The three Cypriot banks with operations in Greece - Bank of Cyprus, Cyprus Popular Bank (CPB) and Hellenic Bank - have about a 10 percent share of the banking market based on loans and about 8 percent of deposits. They operate as branches of their Cypriot parents and not as subsidiaries, meaning they are regulated by Cyprus's central bank, which also provides them with funding through its emergency liquidity assistance (ELA) facility. Their ELA exposure stems primarily from their Greek operations and covers their funding gap - the difference between assets and liabilities. The Greek units have higher loan-to-deposit ratios compared to their Cypriot parents. Together they run a network of just over 300 branches in Greece and employ about 5,000 people. Their combined loan portfolio tops 20 billion euros, according to analysts. The biggest of the three is Bank of Cyprus, which has a network of 181 branches in Greece. The branches of the three Cypriot banks will stay closed on Tuesday and Wednesday, in line with the extended bank holiday in Cyprus. Shares of Bank of Cyprus and CPB, which are also listed in Athens, will not trade over those two days. Athens has rushed to reassure savers in Greece they will not be affected by the Cypriot levy and that the country's banking system is stable and there was little indication of panic as Greek banks reopened on Tuesday after a three-day weekend. We don't have withdrawals because of the Cypriot issue, a senior bank executive said. It's like any other day - we don't see any differences. Bankers said there was no rush to withdraw savings on Tuesday although concerns remain that the tax on deposits may reverse a trend of deposit inflows back into the Greek banking system since fears of a Greek euro exit began to fade. Overall, the situation is calm, said the treasurer of a Greek bank. We have had phone calls from clients of Cypriot banks asking us what interest rate we can offer if they move their money to our bank. But I don't see any trend developing of withdrawals from Greek banks.   (Editing by Deepa Babington/Jeremy Gaunt)"

Eurobank, like other Greek banks battered by the country's debt crisis, has been selling operations outside its home market to shore up a capital base hit by huge sovereign debt writedowns. Austrian lender Raiffeisen Bank International said on Monday it paid 30 million less than originally announced last year for the majority stake after an agreed indirect reduction in the price. The implied price/book multiple for 100 percent amounts to 1.5 and may become lower, depending on Polbank's equity per closing statements. Polbank, founded in 2006, has grown to a network of 323 branches with 3,000 employees. It has a 7 percent share in Poland's retail banking market and 2.3 percent of deposits. Analysts in Warsaw said the consolidation trend was likely to continue. We have lower growth in the sector, tighter lending policy, which makes banks think of consolidation and restructuring, IDM SA banking analyst Michal Sobolewski said. Eurobank said the Polbank sale increased its core tier 1 capital ratio 100 basis points, or by capital equivalent 450 million euros, without disclosing where the ratio stood. Exercising its option to sell the remaining 30 percent stake in Polbank to RBI will mean an additional payment in the next few months of 1.3 billion euros, made up of the price for the stake plus liquidity that will be freed up, Eurobank said. RBI is fighting domestic peer Erste Group Bank for the spot as emerging Europe's No.2 lender behind Italian lender UniCredit. Eurobank, Greece's second-largest lender, lost 5.5 billion euros in 2011, hit by debt swap writedowns.

In a keynote speech to a selected audience of businessmen and members of his ruling Fidesz party, Orban said his reforms were irreversible and had laid the foundations for a new Hungary. We have stood and will stand for Hungary and Hungarians, in  a determined and unshakeable way, but always reasonably. We are ready to fight if needed, but also to agree in the interest of the country, he said. His conservative government faces vital aid talks with the European Union and IMF that Hungary needs to avert a market crisis and potential insolvency. Hungary wants an international credit line of 15 to 20 billion euros to rebuild market confidence before it has to borrow nearly 5 billion euros, on top of regular forint-debt refinancing, to pay back bondholders and an earlier IMF/EU loan package this year. Orban is struggling to repair tattered ties with the EU so it can secure the creditline, after his government was sharply criticised for reforms that critics say threaten the independence of the media, the judiciary and the central bank. The changes, rammed through parliament with Fidesz' huge parliamentary majority, came on top of unorthodox economic policies which have repeatedly unnerved investors over the past two years. Under pressure from a plunging forint currency and Brussels, Orban backed down in January and pledged to change some of the laws passed late last year. That represented a political defeat for the prime minister, whose Fidesz party has seen its public support decline sharply, even though it remains the strongest political force in the central European country of 10 million. Economic Woes The European Commission gave Orban until Feb. 17 to address concerns over new laws or face legal action and the risk of more delay in aid talks. He referred to the need for the agreement with the IMF, it was clear from his speech in several points that he would like to reach a deal, said Zoltan Kiszelly, a political analyst. Kiszelly said Orban also sent a clear message to the middle class, which is Fidesz' core voter base and also to undecided voters who account for more than half of the population, by defending the flat rate 16 percent income tax. Orban says the flat tax encourages people to work and pay their taxes, while critics say it favours the rich and put a huge hole in the budget while it has not helped the economy. Late last month Orban said he would bring a new law on the central bank in line with EU demands on nearly all contested points, prompting a big rally in Hungarian markets and pushing the forint close to a four-month high. But after a string of ratings downgrades to junk status, yields on Hungarian debt are still stuck above 8 percent. In his speech Orban also pledged fiscal discipline as Hungary targets a budget deficit of 2.5 percent this year. A sharp economic slowdown could jeopardise this goal, however. With the economy stagnating, many ordinary Hungarians are already feeling the pinch of austerity previously pushed through. But the IMF likely to seek further spending cuts under a new funding deal, leaving Orban with a political dilemma. In neighbouring Romania, Prime Minister Emil Boc resigned on Monday after protests against austerity measures taken under a similar International Monetary Fund-led aid deal. Some voters were fatalistic about the government's room for manoeuvre. He (Orban) can say what he wants, the important things are decided in Brussels anyway. We fought this freedom fight so fiercely we now find that the EU and the IMF dictates to us again, Marcell Koves, 23, a student, said. Carpenter Jozsef Gyore, 32, said he was worried by the economic slowdown, especially in the construction sector which has seen a 40 percent plunge in orders since November 2010. They should do something, especially with the construction sector. (Despite) all these great reforms the economy is yet to get back on track, he said."
"https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSFit93817820151027","Fitch Affirms Close Brothers at 'A'; Outlook Stable","","October 27, 2015 /  4:36 PM / 2 years ago","","(The following statement was released by the rating agency) LONDON, October 27 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Close Brothers Group's  (CBG) and its wholly owned banking subsidiary Close Brothers Limited's (CBL)  Long-Term Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) at 'A' with Stable Outlooks. Their  Viability Ratings (VRs) have been affirmed at 'a'. A full list of rating actions  is at the end of this rating action commentary. KEY RATING DRIVERS  IDRS, VRS AND SENIOR DEBT CBG's and CBL's IDRs reflect the group's resilient business model, which is  based on secured lending, short maturity loans, small ticket size and a longer  maturity profile of funding compared to lending. As a result of this strategy,  the group has been able to mitigate the higher risk nature of the bank's SME  loan book and report a track record of strong performance through the cycle. CBG (the group's parent holding company) runs several businesses out of separate  subsidiaries, of which the largest by assets and earnings is the banking one,  CBL. Other group subsidiaries operate in asset management and securities trading  but are smaller in importance in terms of capital usage and profit generation.  However, they are cash generative, and in Fitch's opinion, do not pose  significant additional risk to the group. The group's securities business,  Winterflood Securities Limited, is a leader in market marking FTSE and AIM  listed stocks (by number of UK stocks covered) and has been consistently  profitable over the years. Asset management, undertaken through Close Asset  Management Holdings Limited, had GBP10.8bn of total client assets in FYE15.  After undergoing a complete restructuring, it has reported a third year of  profits and is undergoing a gradual and measured expansion.   CBL and CBG's ratings are aligned given the absence of double leverage at CBG,  and the high fungibility of capital and liquidity between the parent and the  bank. CBL provides asset, insurance premium, invoice, motor and property finance and  benefits from the high margins available in these segments. Business origination  is largely through brokers in premium finance, motor dealers in motor finance,  but also through own branches (around 50 across the UK) in other segments. CBL's  track record is strong and risk is mitigated by the secured nature of lending,  management's expertise and generally conservative underwriting standards and  controls. Some risk could stem from the fast loan book growth over the past five  years (8.5% in the year to end-July 2015, FYE15), although CBL's business model  implies growing counter-cyclically, to benefit during periods of low credit  supply in the market. We expect growth rates to moderate as competition among  lenders returns.  Asset quality at the bank has continued to improve since its deterioration  during the crisis (FYE15: impaired loans/ gross loans at 3% at Group level;  peaked at 11.4% at FYE09) thanks to the favourable operating environment in the  UK, completions and sale of property loans extended before January 2009 and  write-offs in the property and asset finance books. Loan impairment charges  (LICs) reduced to 0.8% of average loans in FY15 (FY14: 0.9%), which compares  with an average loss rate over the past 25 years of 1.5%. Credit losses are  compensated by strong margins, and LICs only consumed 16% of pre-impairment  profit in FY15. We believe reserve coverage of impaired loans is adequate at  around 35% given the secured nature of lending, while the unreserved part  accounts for a low proportion of Fitch Core Capital at Group level (FYE15: 12%). The bank's business model also benefits from maintaining a strong liquidity  buffer, comprising GBP1.1bn of Bank of England reserves and gilts (13.3% of  total assets) at FYE15, which Fitch believes it needs to maintain given the low  proportion of deposits that it can consider core, and also to deal with any  loan, particularly in the property sector, which begins to repay later than  expected. The bank has access to the Bank of England contingency liquidity  facilities and has also accessed the government's Funding For Lending Scheme  during the year. The bank's funding is reasonably diversified comprising retail  deposits (sourced online), corporate deposits, secured and unsecured debt and  bank facilities. The average maturity of term funding is longer than that of  lending (FYE15: weighted average of 31 and 14 months, respectively).  Capitalisation is adequate for CBG's credit profile with a fully loaded Basel  III ratio of 13.7% at FYE15 and leverage is very low with a reported leverage  ratio of 10.2%. Capital is supported by strong internal capital generation. CBL  has historically kept its core Tier 1 ratio at around 11%, upstreaming the  excess to the group. Senior unsecured debt is issued through CBG and through an issuing vehicle Close  Brothers Finance Plc. Debt issued through Close Brothers Finance Plc is  guaranteed by CBL. KEY RATING DRIVERS - SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR Fitch does not rely on the possibility of extraordinary support being made  available to the group by the UK government in its ratings. RATING SENSITIVITIES IDRS, VRS AND SENIOR DEBT Negative pressure on CBL's and CBG's ratings could arise if management increases  its risk appetite, which could be in the form of aggressive lending growth in  relatively new niches, reducing the gap between funding and loan maturity or  continuing strong loan growth despite increases in competition, which may imply  lower margins. The ratings would also be sensitive to weakening capitalisation,  deterioration in asset quality and/or a weaker funding and liquidity position.  Upside potential is limited given the relatively higher risk, albeit  well-managed, businesses, in which it is involved. CBG and CBL's ratings are broadly sensitive to the same factors. However, for  CBG the continued absence of double leverage is also a key rating consideration.  Senior debt ratings are sensitive to the same considerations above. KEY RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES - SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR  Fitch does not expect any changes to the  Support Rating and Support Rating  Floor given the low systemic importance of the group as well of the legislation  in place which would enable the institution to be bailed in, in case of need.

For many Israelis, the last two weeks' bloodshed has been close to home and unpredictable - lone-wolf attacks different from the suicide bombings of the Palestinian uprising a decade ago or rocket salvoes in the 2014 Gaza war. It is very, very tense. You suspect anyone you see, every person who is suspicious, said George Azaria, a resident of Jerusalem, where in some places Israeli paramilitary police reinforcements appear to outnumber locals or tourists. Past conflict may have felt remote to many Israelis, but the current violence has been spearheaded by Jerusalem Palestinians, stirring solidarity protests among Israeli Arabs - populations that mix freely with the country's majority Jews. One man accused of a stabbing spree in Raanana, north of Tel Aviv, worked for the municipality. Another Palestinian used a car issued by his employer, Israel's main telephone company, to ram a bus stop, then got out to hack pedestrians with a cleaver, killing one and wounding six before being shot dead. Israeli vendors say pepper spray is selling briskly. The local branch of Groupon is offering cut-resistant protective vests at a 50 percent discount. A woman from the town of Ashdod said she and other parents would stand outside their children's school on Wednesday as human shields.  Encouraged by jittery mayors, the government is weighing issuing more civilian gun licenses. Eligibility criteria generally favor those who have served in the military - common for Israeli Jews, much less so for Arabs exempted from the draft. Civil War? Some commentators are alarmed at a growing atmosphere of vigilantism. Some Palestinian attackers have been beaten by crowds after being subdued and there have been two reprisal knifings by Jews - one wounding four Arabs, the other injuring a Jew mistaken for an Arab. In the next stage, more Israelis will take to the streets and take the law into their own hands, and we have no shortage of hotheads, cautioned Alex Fishman, security correspondent for Israel's top-selling daily Yedioth Ahronoth. This terrorism of individuals could become a civil war: Jews against Arabs. So far, the Palestinian attacks have killed seven Israelis, and the police response or army confrontations with stone-throwers in the occupied West Bank and the Gaza frontier have killed 31 Palestinians. Far greater death tolls were inflicted during previous Intifadas, or Palestinian revolts. But many Israelis think the latest wave of conflict will escalate. With U.S.-brokered peace talks stalled since mid-2014, 41.5 percent of Israelis see a third Intifada erupting within a year, according to a poll by the Israel Democracy Institute and Tel Aviv University; 88.8 percent expect it within three years.   Muslim anger over stepped-up Jewish visits to Jerusalem's al-Aqsa mosque compound unites supporters of Western-backed Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and rival Hamas Islamists who run the Gaza Strip. The compound site is revered by Jews as the site of two destroyed biblical temples.   According to a poll for the Israeli parliament's TV station, 57 percent of Israelis believe the conflict is about religion, against 38 percent who see vying territorial claims as the cause.  Asked if a peace deal is possible in the foreseeable future, 65 percent of respondents said no and 22 percent said yes.   Writing by Dan Williams; Editing by Jeffrey Heller and Andrew Roche"

The two spent the next 10 years trading side by side, until Thomas moved upstairs to begin trading on computer screens. Thomas, a third-generation CBOT trader now back practicing law and trading on the side, is a member of one of the better-known trading families in Chicago's 167-year history of futures trading. Over time, 24 Cashmans worked on the CBOT trading floor, all tracing their roots to the first Cashman on the floor: George, who came to the CBOT after high school in the late '40s. He later bought seats for his brothers Gene and Ed, both Chicago policemen at the time. It made it easier for me to break into the markets, but on the other hand I had that responsibility to live up to the family reputation, said Thomas, speaking ahead of the planned closure of Chicago's futures pits, expected as soon as July 6.  The whole family dynamic added to the honor of the system. I would never do anything to put a black mark on my family. The Cashmans and other multigenerational trading families were a hallmark of Chicago's commodity pits, their flailing arms and unique hand gestures a signature of the Chicago Board of Trade and its longtime rival, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.   The closure of open-outcry futures trading is bringing an end to surprisingly close connections among traders that have characterized the Chicago exchanges for decades. In addition to the Cashmans, other prominent families included the names Stern, Brennan, Carey, O'Connor, Pietrzak, King, Hollander and Williams. They created a community atmosphere, said Libby Mahoney, a historian with the Chicago History Museum, which has an exhibit focused on the Chicago pits. There was a familiarity between the traders and that came from being handed down amongst many families. The face-to-face encounters they had with each other created other connections that weren't family but they became professional connections, said Mahoney. You're going to see them the next day and the next day - you can build that kind of trust. A Lifetime in the Pits Tom Cashman, standing on the edge of the corn pit last month, recalled the morning in 1973 when his client, Cook Grain, ordered him and two other brokers into the pit. I bought a couple million bushels, and they said keep going, he said. As the market spiked that day, they bought contracts that controlled about 28 million bushels of soybeans. Only later did he learn the supplies were part of secret grain sales to the then-Soviet Union. Tom Cashman, 76, is the last family member to go to the CBOT grain floor every day. His sons Thomas and Brendan, 48 and 43, still trade futures and options in Chicago, but both do so in front of electronic screens. Tom's uncles sponsored him as CBOT member in the 1960s, and he traded through historic market events like the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, the meltdown of the Chernobyl nuclear plant and the Black Friday market crash of 1987. If you had family it was automatic: start as a runner, meeting people at different firms and working your way to branch out to your own firm, the senior Cashman said. The current patriarch of another longtime Chicago trading family, John Pietrzak, bought his CBOT seat in 1979, exactly 30 years after his father bought a seat. His grandfather started as a runner at the exchange in 1913 after a neighbor, seeing the boy hard at work cutting his grass, offered him a job as clerk on the trading floor. By the time it was Pietrzak's turn to try his hand at trading, Tom Cashman's uncle, Gene, intervened on behalf of Pietrzak at the bank to help him get a $200,000 loan to buy his CBOT seat. It just so happens my grandfather had sponsored Gene Cashman for membership, Pietrzak recalled with a smile. For floor trader families, necessity often meant opportunity. Kelly King, the only child of fabled corn broker Richard Whitey King, began working on the trading floor in 1988 at age 15. A drought hit that summer, and with grain prices soaring, her father pressed Kelly King into service, handling the avalanche of paper orders coming into the pit. She was hooked. It was rocking, said King, the first and only remaining female corn broker in the pit. Completely insane. King said she intends to stop trading once the pits close. She has obtained her real estate broker's license and is partnering with a friend. On Feb. 6, when CME Group Inc, parent of the Chicago futures exchanges, held a meeting to inform traders of the decision to close the pits, a few complained loudly. Five months later, though, most sound sanguine about the pit closures. All stories have to come to an end. The markets will still go on, said Thomas Cashman. If you can figure out a way to participate then you can still be part of the game. Glenn Hollander, a CBOT trader for 40 years, says he transacts his grain deals electronically now. Hollander is a third-generation trader, and his son, David, joined the family cash grain business, Hollander & Feuerhaken, in 2002. Hollander said he will miss being able to read the trade flow in the grain pits from his perch nearby, trading on a screen near the edge of the soybean options pit. There's lot of expertise and a lot of history that is going to be lost, a lot of understanding of why the market is doing something, he said. I think open-outcry died because as electronics came in the people who were afraid of them didn't embrace them. And pit traders just got swept away like a tsunami.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-swissbank-wegelin-idUSBRE9020O020130104","Swiss bank Wegelin to close after guilty plea","","January 4, 2013 /  3:11 AM / 5 years ago","","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wegelin & Co, the oldest Swiss private bank, said on Thursday it would shut its doors permanently after more than 2 1/2 centuries, following its guilty plea to charges of helping wealthy Americans evade taxes through secret accounts. The plea, in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, marks the death knell for one of Switzerland's most storied banks, whose original European clients pre-date the American Revolution. It is also potentially a major turning point in a battle by U.S. authorities against Swiss bank secrecy. A major question was left hanging by the plea: Has the bank turned over, or does it plan to disclose, names of American clients to U.S. authorities? That is a key demand in a broad U.S. investigation of tax evasion through Swiss banks. It is unclear whether the bank was required to turn over American client names who held secret Swiss bank accounts, said Jeffrey Neiman, a former federal prosecutor involved in other Swiss bank investigations who is now in private law practice in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. What is clear is that the Justice Department is aggressively pursuing foreign banks who have helped Americans commit overseas tax evasion, he said. Charles Miller, a Justice Department spokesman, declined to comment immediately. Wegelin admitted to charges of conspiracy in helping Americans evade taxes on at least $1.2 billion for nearly a decade. Wegelin agreed to pay $57.8 million to the United States in restitution and fines. Otto Bruderer, a managing partner at the bank, said in court that Wegelin was aware that this conduct was wrong. He said that from about 2002 through about 2010, Wegelin agreed with certain U.S. taxpayers to evade the U.S. tax obligations of these U.S. taxpayer clients, who filed false tax returns with the IRS. Initially Vowed to Resist When Wegelin last February became the first foreign bank in recent memory to be indicted by U.S. authorities, it vowed to resist the charges. The bank, founded in 1741, was declared a fugitive from justice when its Swiss-based executives failed to appear in U.S. court. The surprise plea effectively ended the U.S. case against Wegelin, one of the most aggressive bank crackdowns in U.S. history. Once the matter is finally concluded, Wegelin will cease to operate as a bank, Wegelin said in a statement on Thursday from its headquarters in the remote, small town of St. Gallen next to the Appenzell Alps near the German-Austrian border. But the fate of three Wegelin bankers, indicted in January 2012 on charges later modified to include the bank, remains up in the air. Under criminal procedural rules, the cases of the three bankers - Michael Berlinka, Urs Frei and Roger Keller - are still pending., Although Wegelin had about a dozen branches, all in Switzerland, at the time of its indictment, it moved quickly to wind down its business, partly through a sale of its non-U.S. assets to regional Swiss bank Raiffeisen Gruppe. A corporate indictment can be a death knell. In 2002, accounting firm Arthur Andersen went out of business after being found guilty over its role in failed energy company Enron Corp. A 2005 Supreme Court ruling later overturned the conviction, but it was too late to save the company. The logo of the Swiss Wegelin bank is pictured at the headquarters building in St. Gallen, January 29, 2012.Miro KuzmanovicWegelin, a partnership of Swiss private bankers, was already a shadow of its former self - it effectively broke itself up following the indictment last year by selling the non-U.S. portion of its business. Dozens of Swiss bankers and their clients have been indicted in recent years, following a 2009 agreement by UBS AG, the largest Swiss bank, to enter into a deferred-prosecution agreement, turn over 4,450 client names and pay a $780 million fine after admitting to criminal wrongdoing in selling tax-evasion services to wealthy Americans. 'Wake-Up Call' William Sharp, a tax lawyer in Tampa, Florida, with many U.S. clients of Swiss banks, said Wegelin's plea should serve as a wake-up call to the world banking community servicing U.S. clients to takes steps to ensure compliance with U.S. law. Sharp called Wegelin's change of heart shocking. Banks under U.S. criminal investigation in the wider probe include Credit Suisse, which disclosed last July it had received a target letter saying it was under a grand jury investigation. Zurich-based Julius Baer and some cantonal, or regional, banks are also under scrutiny, sources familiar with the probes previously told Reuters. So are UK-based HSBC Holdings and three Israeli banks, Hapoalim, Mizrahi-Tefahot Bank Ltd and Bank Leumi, sources also said previously. Those banks have not commented on the inquiries. In a statement after the plea, Assistant U.S. Attorney General Kathryn Keneally said it was a top Justice Department priority to find those who continue to shirk their tax obligations, as well as those who help them and profit from it. The best deal now for these folks is to come in and 'get right' with the IRS, before either the IRS or the Justice Department finds them, she said. Under its plea, Wegelin agreed to pay the $20 million in restitution to the IRS as well a civil forfeiture of $15.8 million, the Justice Department said. Wegelin also agreed to pay an additional $22.05 million fine, the Justice Department said. U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff, who must approve the monetary penalties, set a hearing in the case for March 4 for sentencing. Last year, the U.S. government separately seized more than $16 million of Wegelin funds in a UBS AG account in Stamford, Connecticut, via a civil forfeiture complaint. Since Wegelin has no branches outside Switzerland, it used UBS for correspondent banking services, a standard industry practice, to handle money for U.S.-based clients. In court papers, Bruderer said that Wegelin believed it would not be prosecuted in the United States for this conduct because it had no branches or offices in the United States and because of its understanding that it acted in accordance with, and not in violation of, Swiss law and that such conduct was common in the Swiss banking industry. The case is U.S. v. Wegelin & Co et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 12-cr-00002.

At the peak of Liberia's outbreak, the world watched in alarm as patients died on the pavement outside hospitals in the capital Monrovia while the government failed to build treatment centres and recruit staff fast enough. With hundreds of new Ebola cases each week, overstretched officials worked hard to respond to the unprecedented epidemic. By January the country was just days away from declaring its ocean-front capital free from the virus. Then officials discovered an itinerant charcoal trader had brought it back to the sprawling suburbs. A series of mistakes in the immediate aftermath of her arrival in St. Paul's Bridge, mostly by frightened patients, led to more than 100 contacts dispersed across three counties. Health officials intervened quickly to address them, preventing another major flare-up of the epidemic. It required a combination of detective work and an almost military element, said Dr. Philippe Maughan, senior operations administrator at the humanitarian branch of the European Commission. Getting from 100 to ten cases is much easier than getting from ten to zero. Liberia has accounted for more than 4,000 of the 10,000 dead from Ebola across West Africa. It will not officially be declared Ebola-free by the World Health Organization (WHO) until it goes 42 days without a case. But the 21-day period is important because it spans the incubation period of the virus. And last week the country released its last known patient, a resident of Monrovia's riverside St. Paul's Bridge community where the virus once spread quickly among narrow streets. A massive influx of international aid, including crucial U.S. military assistance, helped Liberia to turn the tide of the outbreak. But, notes Tariq Riebl, Oxfam's Ebola response manager in Liberia, What got us to the endgame is that communities took things into their own hands. First Running, Now Reporting Liberian health reports reviewed by Reuters show the behaviour of some residents of St. Paul's Bridge was partly behind the explosion in contacts. Among the most notorious incidents was a policewoman,  referred to only as VZ in official reports, who helped her son skip quarantine. In another incident, an Ebola-positive man evaded officials and remained at large until he was stabbed in a robbery in Monrovia's Red Light District, leaving a trail of police officers and gangsters at risk of contamination. They did not trust anyone and did not believe they were carriers of Ebola, said Reverend John Sumo, head of social mobilization in the Ebola response, adding the problem was exacerbated by a leadership struggle in the local community that distracted officials from providing support to families and food to those quarantined, the reports showed. When alarming reports began to circulate, government and international health officials quickly provided faster and closer surveillance, as well as prioritising the education of locals about the disease. They worked with police officials, village chiefs, elders and international aid workers to get people talking to each other, and also appointed a local contact tracer - responsible for tracking down people close to the latest cases - for blocks of the St Paul's Bridge community. Thanks to this success, Liberia's last eight cases all came from established contacts, the aid officials said. Oxfam's Riebl noted that in recent months the rising number of Ebola patients referring themselves as authorities had more success in engaging communities. By contrast, although the epidemic is waning in neighbouring Sierra Leone and Guinea, contact tracing there remains weak. Last week, only 14 percent of new cases in Guinea came from established contacts and resistance to healthcare workers is commonplace. However, even if Liberia is declared Ebola-free, imported cases are possible from the region's poorly-policed borders where communities that have not so far been exposed to the disease still have misconceptions about it. The World Health Organisation also warns that only 40 percent of non-Ebola health facilities in the capital have an effective system of triage - the process by which highly-contagious Ebola patients are safely identified. It is important to invest in preparedness for a possible reappearance, said Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, WHO's regional director for Africa.    (Writing by Emma Farge; Editing by Sophie Walker)"
"https://www.reuters.com/article/fitch-affirms-close-brothers-at-a-outloo-idUSFit82532020141112","Fitch Affirms Close Brothers at 'A'; Outlook Stable","","November 12, 2014 /  5:12 PM / 3 years ago","","(The following statement was released by the rating agency) LONDON, November 12 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Close Brothers Group's  (CBG) and its wholly owned banking subsidiary Close Brothers Limited's (CBL)  Long-Term Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) at 'A' with Stable Outlooks. Their  Viability Ratings (VRs) have been affirmed at 'a'. A full list of rating actions  is at the end of this rating action commentary. KEY RATING DRIVERS - IDRS, VRS AND SENIOR DEBT  CBG's and CBL's IDRs reflect the group's so far resilient business model, which  is based on secured lending, short maturity loans, small ticket size and a  longer maturity profile of funding compared to lending. In Fitch's view, this  mitigates the higher risk nature of the bank's SME loan book and has resulted in  a track record of strong performance through the cycle.  CBG (the holdco) runs several businesses from separate subsidiaries, of which  the largest by assets and earnings is the banking one, CBL. Other group  subsidiaries operating in asset management and securities trading are smaller,  but generally cash generative, do not have any debt, and in Fitch's opinion, do  not pose significant additional risk to the group. CBL and CBG's ratings are  aligned given the absence of double leverage, and the high fungibility of  capital and liquidity between the parent and the bank.  CBL provides asset, insurance premium, invoice, motor and property finance and  benefits from the high margins available in these segments. Business origination  is largely through brokers in premium finance, motor dealers in motor finance,  but also through own branches (around 50 across the UK) in other segments. The  track record is strong and risk is mitigated by the secured nature of lending,  management's expertise and generally conservative underwriting standards and  controls. Some risk could stem from the fast loan book growth over the past four  years (14% in the year to end-July 2014, FYE14), although CBL's business model  implies growing counter-cyclically, to benefit during periods of low credit  supply in the market. We expect growth rates to moderate as competition among  lenders returns.  Asset quality at the bank has continued to improve since the moderate  deterioration it suffered during the crisis (FYE14: impaired loans/ gross loans  at 3%; peaked at 11.4% at FYE09) thanks to the favourable operating environment  in the UK, completions and sale of property loans extended before January 2009  and write-offs in the property and asset finance books. Loan impairment charges  (LICs) reduced to 0.9% of average loans in FY14 (FY13: 1.3%) which compares with  an average loss rate over the past 25 years of 1.5%. Credit losses are  compensated by strong margins, and LICs only consumed 18% of pre-impairment  profit in FY14. We believe reserve coverage of impaired loans is adequate at  around 30% given the secured nature of lending, while the unreserved part  accounts for a low proportion of Fitch Core Capital (FYE14: 14%). Capitalisation is adequate for CBG's credit profile with a fully loaded Basel  III ratio of 13.1% at FYE14 and a leverage ratio of 9.2%. Capital is supported  by strong internal capital generation. CBL has historically kept its core Tier 1  ratio around 11%, upstreaming the excess to the group. The bank's funding is reasonably diversified comprising customer deposits  (although the bulk of them are attracted online), secured and unsecured debt and  bank facilities. Liquidity risk is mitigated by the maturity of funding being  longer than that of lending. (FYE14: weighted average of 30 and 14 months,  respectively). The group maintains a strong liquidity buffer, comprising  GBP1.2bn of Bank of England reserves and gilts (16% of total assets) at FYE14,  which Fitch believes it needs to maintain given the low proportion of deposits  that can be considered core, at the bank. The bank has access to the Bank of  England contingency liquidity facilities.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - IDRS, VRS AND SENIOR DEBT Negative pressure on CBL's and CBG's ratings could arise if management increases  its risk appetite, which could be in the form of aggressive lending growth in  relatively new niches, reducing the gap between funding and loan maturity or  continuing strong loan growth despite increases in competition, which may imply  lower margins. The ratings would also be sensitive to weakening capitalisation,  deterioration in asset quality and/or a weaker funding and liquidity position.  Upside potential is limited given the relatively higher risk, albeit  well-managed, businesses, in which it is involved. CBG and CBL's ratings are broadly sensitive to the same factors. However, for  CBG the continued absence of double leverage is also a consideration. KEY RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES - SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR  Fitch does not rely on the possibility of extraordinary support being made  available to the group by the UK government in its ratings.

The World Health Organization also warns that only 40 percent of non-Ebola health facilities in the capital have an effective system of triage – the process by which highly-contagious Ebola patients are safely identified.  It is important to invest in preparedness for a possible reappearance, said Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, WHO's regional director for Africa.  Writing by Emma Farge; Editing by Sophie Walker"

Of the 86 detainees who have been cleared for transfer or release, 56 are from Yemen, where al Qaeda has a dangerous presence. There are 80 more prisoners who are not cleared and an unknown number of those are Yemeni as well. Most of the Yemeni prisoners were captured more than a decade ago. Previously, they were a smaller percentage of the detainees, which included higher numbers of Afghans and Saudis. But as the United States worked out agreements with other countries to transfer detainees to their homelands, it remained reluctant to do so with Yemen because of security concerns. Repatriation of Yemeni prisoners was halted in 2010 after a man trained by militants in Yemen attempted to blow up a U.S.-bound plane in 2009 with a bomb concealed in his underwear. The Obama administration so far has been skeptical that Yemen is stable enough to receive the transfers. Officials fear the consequences of a repatriated Yemeni eventually attacking the United States or its interests. Yemen is home to an al Qaeda wing that was once described by Washington as the movement's most dangerous branch. Impoverished and turbulent, Yemen is located next door to the world's top oil exporter, Saudi Arabia, and major crude shipment routes. Militants allied to al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula took advantage of Arab Spring chaos in Yemen in 2011 to seize control of some towns in the country's south. They were pushed from those towns last year but continue to fight government forces. Recent developments, however, appear to have triggered reconsideration in Washington. Yemen's new president, Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, has made tackling militants a top priority. Related CoverageGuantanamo prisoners tune in for Obama's speech on their fateSupporters of shutting down Guantanamo said they were encouraged by Obama's pledge on transfers to Yemen but noted that he included heavy caveats during his wide-ranging speech on Thursday on how the United States will narrow its global war on terror. When renewing his pledge to close Guantanamo, Obama said, I am lifting the moratorium on detainee transfers to Yemen, so we can review them on a case by case basis. To the greatest extent possible, we will transfer detainees who have been cleared to go to other countries. Wells Dixon, a senior attorney at the Center for Constitutional Rights, a New York organization that has represented a number of Guantanamo prisoners, said he was not encouraged by Obama's statements. While I welcome his lifting the ban on transfers to Yemen, and his renewed commitment to closing the prison, I am deeply troubled by his comment that cleared detainees will be released only 'to the extent possible,' Dixon said. What does that mean? Are men going to be released and reunited with their families or not? If men are not released soon, especially to Yemen, the crisis at Guantanamo will worsen and men will die. They cannot be let down again; it's cruel and inhumane, he said. Retired Rear Admiral Don Guter, who served as the judge advocate general and was the Navy's top judge on September 11, 2001, praised the move to lift the ban on Yemeni transfers. That's really created paralysis on that issue so removing that moratorium is a great step, Guter said. Mohammed Albasha, a spokesman for the Yemeni Embassy in Washington, said in a statement that the Yemeni government will work with the United States to ensure the safe return of detainees and work toward their rehabilitation. Timing of Transfers Calls on Obama to close the Guantanamo Bay camp have risen as a hunger strike at the U.S. naval base in Cuba lingers. Prisoners are in the fourth month of their strike to protest the failure to resolve their fate after 11 years of detention. More than 100 people have joined the protest and 32 have lost so much weight that they are being force-fed. Transferring prisoners to Yemen was one of several steps Obama announced to move toward closing the prison. Other moves included designating a site in the United States for military commissions, and including a new senior envoy at the State Department and Defense Department to oversee transfers. Lifting the ban does not mean transfers to Yemen will immediately take place. Current law requires the Defense Department to certify for each transferred prisoner that the destination country is not a state sponsor of terrorism and would take action to make sure the individual would not threaten the United States. Unless those provisions are removed or expire, they would have to be followed. No prisoners have been certified yet so it is not known how long the process takes. Obama called on Congress to lift those and other restrictions that it placed on prisoner transfers starting in 2011. If it were so inclined, Congress could do this in the coming months as it works on defense legislation. The restrictions have had bipartisan support in the past. The youngest of all the remaining Guantanamo prisoners is a Yemeni named Hassan Mohammed ali bin Attash, who is 26 or 27 and is an alleged al Qaeda member accused by the United States of being part of Osama bin Laden's security detail. He is not among those cleared for release or transfer; the United States wants to continue holding him indefinitely. Some Republican reaction to Obama's speech showed it may be difficult for Obama to secure congressional support for lifting the restrictions on transfers. What's changed in Yemen? asked Republican Senator Kelly Ayotte, who wants Guantanamo to stay open. I think this issue of transferring to Yemen is very troubling, given the history we have with Yemen and terrorist activity there.

The two spent the next 10 years trading side by side, until Thomas moved upstairs to begin trading on computer screens.  Thomas, a third-generation CBOT trader now back practicing law and trading on the side, is a member of one of the better-known trading families in Chicago's 167-year history of futures trading. Over time, 24 Cashmans worked on the CBOT trading floor, all tracing their roots to the first Cashman on the floor: George, who came to the CBOT after high school in the late '40s. He later bought seats for his brothers Gene and Ed, both Chicago policemen at the time.  It made it easier for me to break into the markets, but on the other hand I had that responsibility to live up to the family reputation,” said Thomas, speaking ahead of the planned closure of Chicago’s futures pits, expected as soon as July 6. The whole family dynamic added to the honor of the system. I would never do anything to put a black mark on my family.  The Cashmans and other multigenerational trading families were a hallmark of Chicago’s commodity pits, their flailing arms and unique hand gestures a signature of the Chicago Board of Trade and its longtime rival, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The closure of open-outcry futures trading is bringing an end to surprisingly close connections among traders that have characterized the Chicago exchanges for decades.  In addition to the Cashmans, other prominent families included the names Stern, Brennan, Carey, O’Connor, Pietrzak, King, Hollander and Williams. “They created a community atmosphere, said Libby Mahoney, a historian with the Chicago History Museum, which has an exhibit focused on the Chicago pits. There was a familiarity between the traders and that came from being handed down amongst many families.”  “The face-to-face encounters they had with each other created other connections that weren’t family but they became professional connections,” said Mahoney. “You’re going to see them the next day and the next day – you can build that kind of trust.”   A Lifetime in the Pits  Tom Cashman, standing on the edge of the corn pit last month, recalled the morning in 1973 when his client, Cook Grain, ordered him and two other brokers into the pit. “I bought a couple million bushels, and they said keep going,” he said. As the market spiked that day, they bought contracts that controlled about 28 million bushels of soybeans. Only later did he learn the supplies were part of secret grain sales to the then-Soviet Union.  Tom Cashman, 76, is the last family member to go to the CBOT grain floor every day. His sons Thomas and Brendan, 48 and 43, still trade futures and options in Chicago, but both do so in front of electronic screens.  Tom's uncles sponsored him as CBOT member in the 1960s, and he traded through historic market events like the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, the meltdown of the Chernobyl nuclear plant and the Black Friday market crash of 1987.  “If you had family it was automatic: start as a runner, meeting people at different firms and working your way to branch out to your own firm,” the senior Cashman said.  Thomas J. Cashman (C) is joined by his two sons Thomas F. Cashman (L) and Brendon Eugene Cashman on the Chicago Board of Trade grain trading floor in Chicago, Illinois, United States, June 9, 2015.Jim YoungThe current patriarch of another longtime Chicago trading family, John Pietrzak, bought his CBOT seat in 1979, exactly 30 years after his father bought a seat. His grandfather started as a runner at the exchange in 1913 after a neighbor, seeing the boy hard at work cutting his grass, offered him a job as clerk on the trading floor.  By the time it was Pietrzak’s turn to try his hand at trading, Tom Cashman’s uncle, Gene, intervened on behalf of Pietrzak at the bank to help him get a $200,000 loan to buy his CBOT seat.  “It just so happens my grandfather had sponsored Gene Cashman for membership,” Pietrzak recalled with a smile.  For floor trader families, necessity often meant opportunity. Kelly King, the only child of fabled corn broker Richard Whitey King, began working on the trading floor in 1988 at age 15. A drought hit that summer, and with grain prices soaring, her father pressed Kelly King into service, handling the avalanche of paper orders coming into the pit.  Slideshow (4 Images)She was hooked.  “It was rocking,” said King, the first and only remaining female corn broker in the pit. “Completely insane.”  King said she intends to stop trading once the pits close. She has obtained her real estate broker's license and is partnering with a friend.  On Feb. 6, when CME Group Inc (CME.O), parent of the Chicago futures exchanges, held a meeting to inform traders of the decision to close the pits, a few complained loudly. Five months later, though, most sound sanguine about the pit closures.  “All stories have to come to an end. The markets will still go on,” said Thomas Cashman. “If you can figure out a way to participate then you can still be part of the game.”  Glenn Hollander, a CBOT trader for 40 years, says he transacts his grain deals electronically now. Hollander is a third-generation trader, and his son, David, joined the family cash grain business, Hollander & Feuerhaken, in 2002.  Hollander said he will miss being able to “read” the trade flow in the grain pits from his perch nearby, trading on a screen near the edge of the soybean options pit.  “There’s lot of expertise and a lot of history that is going to be lost, a lot of understanding of why the market is doing something,” he said. “I think open-outcry died because as electronics came in the people who were afraid of them didn’t embrace them. And pit traders just got swept away like a tsunami.”  Editing by David Greising and Matthew Lewis"
"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-swissbank-wegelin-idUSBRE9020O020130103","Swiss bank Wegelin to close after guilty plea","","January 3, 2013 /  8:46 PM / 5 years ago","","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wegelin & Co, the oldest Swiss private bank, said Thursday it would shut its doors permanently after more than two and a half centuries following its guilty plea to charges of helping wealthy Americans evade taxes through secret accounts. The plea, in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, marks the death knell for one of Switzerland's most storied banks, whose original European clients pre-date the American Revolution. It is also a potentially major turning point in a battle by U.S. authorities against Swiss bank secrecy. A major question was left hanging by the plea: has the bank turned over, or does it plan to disclose, names of American clients to U.S. authorities? This is a key demand in a broad U.S. investigation of tax evasion through Swiss banks. It is unclear whether the bank was required to turn over American client names who held secret Swiss bank accounts, said Jeffrey Neiman, a former federal prosecutor involved in other Swiss bank investigations who is now in private law practice in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. What is clear is that the Justice Department is aggressively pursuing foreign banks who have helped Americans commit overseas tax evasion, he said. Charles Miller, a Justice Department spokesman, declined to comment immediately. Wegelin admitted to charges of conspiracy in helping Americans evade taxes on at least $1.2 billion for nearly a decade. Wegelin agreed to pay $57.8 million to the United States in restitution and fines. Otto Bruderer, a managing partner at the bank, said in court that Wegelin was aware that this conduct was wrong. Speaking in a thick Swiss-German accent, he said that from about 2002 through about 2010, Wegelin agreed with certain U.S. taxpayers to evade the U.S. tax obligations of these U.S. taxpayer clients, who filed false tax returns with the IRS. Initially Vowed to Resist When last February Wegelin became first foreign bank in recent memory to be indicted by U.S. authorities, it vowed to resist the charges. The bank, founded in 1741, was declared a fugitive from justice when its Swiss-based executives failed to appear in U.S. court. The surprise plea effectively ended the U.S. case against Wegelin, one of the most aggressive bank crackdowns in U.S. history. Once the matter is finally concluded, Wegelin will cease to operate as a bank, Wegelin said in a statement Thursday from its headquarters in the remote, small town of St. Gallen next to the Appenzell Alps near the German-Austrian border. But the fate of three Wegelin bankers, indicted in January 2012 on charges later modified to include the bank, remains up in the air. Under criminal procedural rules, the cases of the three bankers - Michael Berlinka, Urs Frei and Roger Keller - are still pending. Wegelin, a partnership of Swiss private bankers, was already a shadow of its former self - it effectively broke itself up following the indictment last year by selling the non-U.S. portion of its business. Dozens of Swiss bankers and their clients have been indicted in recent years, following a 2009 agreement by UBS AG, the largest Swiss bank, to enter into a deferred-prosecution agreement, turn over 4,450 client names and pay a $780 million fine after admitting to criminal wrongdoing in selling tax-evasion services to wealthy Americans. 'Wake-Up Call' William Sharp, a tax lawyer in Tampa, Florida, with many U.S. clients of Swiss banks, said Wegelin's plea should serve as a wake-up call to the world banking community servicing U.S. clients to takes steps to ensure compliance with U.S. law. Sharp called Wegelin's change of heart shocking. Banks under U.S. criminal investigation in the wider probe include Credit Suisse, which disclosed last July it had received a target letter saying it was under a grand jury investigation. Zurich-based Julius Baer and some cantonal, or regional, banks are also under scrutiny, sources familiar with the probes have previously told Reuters. So are UK-based HSBC Holdings and three Israeli banks, Hapoalim, Mizrahi-Tefahot Bank Ltd and Bank Leumi, sources have also said previously. Those banks have not commented on the inquiries. In a statement after the plea, Assistant U.S. Attorney General Kathryn Keneally said it was a top Justice Department priority to find those who continue to shirk their tax obligations, as well as those who help them and profit from it. The best deal now for these folks is to come in and 'get right' with the IRS, before either the IRS or the Justice Department finds them, she said. Under its plea, Wegelin agreed to pay the $20 million in restitution to the IRS as well a civil forfeiture of $15.8 million, the U.S. Justice Department said. Wegelin also agreed to pay an additional $22.05 million fine, the Justice Department said. U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff, who must approve the monetary penalties, set a hearing in the case for March 4 for sentencing. Last year, the U.S. government separately seized more than $16 million of Wegelin funds in a UBS AG account in Stamford, Connecticut, via a civil forfeiture complaint. Because Wegelin has no branches outside Switzerland, it used UBS for correspondent banking services, a standard industry practice, to handle money for U.S.-based clients. In court papers, Bruderer said that Wegelin believed it would not be prosecuted in the United States for this conduct because it had no branches or offices in the United States and because of its understanding that it acted in accordance with, and not in violation of, Swiss law and that such conduct was common in the Swiss banking industry. The case is U.S. v. Wegelin & Co et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 12-cr-00002.

KCB, Kenya's biggest bank by assets and with operations across East Africa, said last week it was interested in a possible acquisition but did not indicate a specific interest in Chase, a mid-sized lender put into receivership this month. Chase was the third small- or mid-sized bank in Kenya to  close in the past nine months, rattling investors. With more than 40 banks operating in East Africa's biggest economy and following the closures, experts have said the Kenyan market is ripe for consolidation. The Central Bank of Kenya said in a statement that an understanding had been reached with KCB on modalities to reopen Chase Bank Ltd in the next few days and the eventual acquisition of a majority stake in the bank. It said KCB would carry out due diligence, and a timeline for any acquisition would be announced at a later date, the central bank said. There was no immediate comment from KCB. Central Bank of Kenya Governor Patrick Njoroge told a news conference he had received nine indications of interest in Chase Bank, including from the private bank's own shareholders and other local banks or investors, as well as two foreign parties. The central bank statement said branches of Chase Bank would reopen on April 27 offering limited banking services, but giving customers immediate access to deposits worth up to 1 million shillings ($9,900) each. It said deposits in excess of 1 million shillings will be made available in a structured manner, details of which would be announced later. The statement said KCB and the central bank would ensure Chase Bank had adequate liquidity for operations. $1 = 101.0500 Kenyan shillings

In the email to clients seen by Reuters, the bank said it would no longer accept orders in Hong Kong due to the closure. An executive at the bank's Hong Kong office confirmed that it had ceased operating, and said that 11 staff are likely to lose their jobs.

At least 134 of the 183 Morgan Stanley brokerage offices that were closed had reopened by mid-morning, the company said. The offices that remained closed either lacked electricity or were inaccessible due to flooding or other damage. Most of the closed offices were in New Jersey and New York, with some in Connecticut. JPMorgan said it had reopened 587 Chase branches, about 55 percent of the total in the states of New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Nearly 60 percent of the New York City-based bank's 3,200 automated teller machines in the area were running. Wells Fargo said 106 of 156 branches in New York and Connecticut were open. Some offices in Manhattan, Long Island and coastal Connecticut remained closed. Bank of America said in statement that operations  from Virginia to Massachusetts that were hit by the storm were returning to business as usual. The bank did not say how many of its offices were still closed. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs Group Inc opened both its headquarters in Lower Manhattan and its office across the river at 30 Hudson Street in Jersey City, New Jersey on Wednesday. Goldman offices in Princeton, New Jersey, and Greenwich, Connecticut, were still open for some employees, while others worked remotely. Staff in the securities division - especially those who live in Manhattan - generally came into the office, though the lack of public transportation and traffic made commutes longer than usual. Goldman's two main buildings in the New York area, which bookend the Hudson River, sustained some flooding but no serious damage from the hurricane, a representative said. Citigroup's Lower Manhattan buildings used for trading and investment banking remained closed. The company said on Tuesday night that it would update information on access to those Greenwich Street buildings later this week."

Equities were back in the red, after seeing some bounce in the morning, as they tracked oil prices. Brent crude fell 9 cents to US$27.79 in early afternoon on oversupply fears. The Nikkei slumped 2.43% and the Hang Seng Index shed 1.5%. Everything is down on rumours that there were margin calls in the Hang Seng, said one high-grade bond trader. Everyone wants to get out of these levels, but, personally, the margin call rumour is one signal that the markets are almost bottom. Nevertheless, in the short term, there are little pointers to a less pessimistic view. Oil oversupplies, China's economic slowdown, worries over a US Fed rate hike in March and an upcoming FOMC meeting next week in the US are keeping fundamentals weak. Asian high-grade cash bonds were about 2-3bp wider while credit spreads gapped out nearly 4bp in the afternoon. The iTraxx Asia IG index was indicated at 157bp/159bp. Against this weak backdrop, KEB Hana's new bonds put in a respectable performance at 111bp/110bp over US Treasuries, inside yesterday's reoffer spread of 112.5bp. The fact that they priced at 112.5bp was already pretty amazing given yesterday's weak markets but they are getting good support from Asian investors, especially the Chinese banks and Korean buyers, said the trader. The newly priced 2019s from Bank of Communications, Hong Kong branch were indicated at 131bp/129bp over 2-year UST.   (Reporting by Kit Yin Boey; Editing by Vincent Baby)"

It has been a bit lethargic in secondary away from the new issues, said one trader in Singapore. With most of the recently printed bonds performing well, investors are also feeling more confident about putting money to work. Most of the trading today was focused on the new 5.5-year sukuk from the Republic of Indonesia, which rallied as high as 101.50 earlier in the day, having priced at par. It later retreated a bit as some accounts took profits to close quoted at 100.80/101.00. KDB's new USD750m 2019s, printed yesterday at 140bp over US Treasuries, told a similar story, trading as tight as 132bp in the beginning of the day, but settling at 140bp/137bp later in the day. The best performer so far, though, have been the new 5-year bond from China's ZhengTong Auto with a standby letter of credit from the Bank of China, Macau branch. That bond was printed at a reoffer spread of 285bp and closed the day quoted at 262bp/260bp. People like the pick-up the bond offered compared with other Chinese bonds that feature SBLCs, explained one trader. While cash was doing very well, the new issue flow took its toll on the CDS market. Investors buying protection for their added exposure to fixed income in the region prompted the Asia ex-Japan iTraxx IG to widen some 3bp and close at 138bp/140bp. On the high-yield front, a reopening of the 5-year bonds of Chinese developer CIFI Holdings prompted some profit-taking on the name with the reopened bond dropping from 106.50 to 105.00 and dragging other names with it. However, as rumours circulated that books on the deal were multiple times oversubscribed, the bonds recovered to close at 105.50/106.00. That also boosted other Chinese property credits, helping the sector end about 25ct higher in price terms on average. As has been the norm lately, though, most of the buying was being driven by retail accounts. Christopher.Langner@thomsonreuters.com"

Caesars closed Showboat in August, despite it being profitable, to try to consolidate Atlantic City's deteriorating  gaming market. It was the second of four casinos to close this year. The state college was long thought to be interested in purchasing one of the shuttered casinos, with the Atlantic Club, which closed in January, said to be a prime candidate.   One bidder for the shuttered Revel Casino, located next to the Showboat, had imagined a university for that building. Revel was ultimately bought by Brookfield Management, which has experience in casino operations.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/australia-china-banking-idUSL4N0PY05P20140723","Australia close to currency clearing deal with China -RBA's Lowe","","July 23, 2014 /  1:20 AM / in 3 years","","SYDNEY, July 23 (Reuters) - Australia is close to signing a deal with China that would allow the establishment of an official clearing bank for the renminbi, a step towards the more open flow of money and investment into and out of the Asian giant. Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) Deputy Governor Philip Lowe said the central bank was working with the People's Bank of China (PBOC) on a memorandum of understanding that would allow a clearing bank to be chosen over coming months. Their key function is to facilitate cross-border payments and receipts of RMB for trade-related purposes on behalf of other financial institutions in the local market, Lowe told a seminar on the internationalisation of the renminbi (RMB). Official clearing banks are afforded more direct access to China's onshore renminbi and foreign exchange markets than other offshore institutions, said Lowe. They have direct access to China's interbank payments system and receive a quota to transact in the onshore foreign exchange market. These changes also entail more direct access to renminbi liquidity from the PBOC. Setting up a clearing bank could lower transaction costs and reduce delays in payments for customers. China is Australia's single biggest export market with two-way trade flows of around A$150 billion ($141 billion) annually. So far, less than 1 percent of Australia's merchandise trade with China is invoiced in renminbi, allowing plenty of scope for expansion. Lowe said Australia also hoped to soon obtain a quota for Australian financial institutions to invest in mainland China under the Renminbi Qualified Foreign Institutional Investors scheme (RQFII). Approved institutions can then invest their own quota in selected mainland Chinese bonds and equities using renminbi  obtained in the offshore market. In this way, the RQFII scheme can be thought of as representing both a partial relaxation of controls on inward portfolio investment to mainland China and as a means of developing the offshore RMB market, said Lowe. In June, China Construction Bank's branch in London was appointed as the first clearing bank outside Asia for the Chinese currency. Earlier this month, Bank of Communications, China's fifth- largest commercial bank, got the nod for clearing in South Korea.     (Reporting by Wayne Cole; Editing by Eric Meijer)"

Sberbank, Europe's No.2 lender by market value, is seeking a  foothold in its long-eyed Turkish market and was competing for DenizBank with Qatar National Bank. Sberbank now appears to be the only bidder and is in exclusive talks, Dexia said in a statement on Thursday, adding that Sberbank had submitted a binding offer. The official bid is planned to be made by the end of May, one banker said earlier. Sources said previously that the Belgian government, a Dexia shareholder and responsible for most of its guarantees, had wanted 1.5 times DenizBank's book value, which according to Reuters calculations is around $3.6 billion. French Les Echos newspaper reported on Thursday that the price should be close to the 3 billion euros ($3.77 billion)expected by the Franco-Belgian bank. It said talks should take several weeks and be completed in the summer. Crippled by the euzo zone debt crisis, Dexia was bailed out last October by France, Belgium and Luxembourg, and its assets are being sold. It is set to be left as a portfolio of bonds and loans in run-off. If the deal proceeds, DenizBank will be the second step in Sberbank's international foray, after it paid 505 million euros ($635.5 million) in February to buy VBI from Austrian lender Volksbanken AG, aiming to boost its presence in emerging Europe. Sberbank is ramping its activities in central and eastern Europe and Turkey to diversify away from a home market where it controls a third of overall lending and half of household deposits. It aims to earn at least 5 percent of income from international operations by 2014. DenizBank, Turkey's sixth largest private sector bank, has 588 branches across Turkey, a further branch in Bahrain, a Vienna-based subsidiary Denizbank AG and a Moscow-based unit for clients doing business in Russia. It had total assets of 44.8 billion Turkish lira ($24.2 billion) at the end of 2011. Before its break-up, Dexia had planned that DenizBank would make up 25 percent of its income in 2014. Sberbank shares closed 3.55 percent up in Moscow, outperforming a broader MICEX index which was 0.21 percent down. Dexia has a 99.84 percent stake in DenizBank, with a small number of shares floated on the Turkish stock exchange.

The budget shortfall is mainly due to a downward revision of tax revenue because of a softer economy. The previous estimate for the fiscal year that began on July 1 was cut by $515 million to $21.496 billion. In addition, $25 million linked to tax settlements and which are one time in nature and already committed to specific costs bring the total gap to $540 million. The uncertainty of the fiscal cliff and the resulting slowdown in growth are the direct cause of our budget challenges, Governor Deval Patrick said in a statement. Patrick's plan to cover the gap, parts of which are subject to legislative approval, has Massachusetts cutting $225 million in executive branch agency spending and taking $200 million from the state's reserves, which will remain with a balance of $1.2 billion, one of the highest in the country. The rainy day fund exists to provide a cushion when revenue falls short, to cover the loss of federal funds and for other urgent financial needs for the state or its local governments. The state had been putting money into its stabilization fund even as federal stimulus funding fell away, getting the fund's balance up to over $1.7 billion, said Colin MacNaught, the state's assistant treasurer for debt management, at a New York Municipal Forum event on Tuesday. Non-executive departments will see cuts of $25 million and $98 million will come from federal revenues designated to support state low-income safety net programs. The withdrawals from the rainy day fund and the cuts from the non-executive departments are both subject to legislative approval, said Massachusetts Executive Office of Administration and Finance communications director Alex Zaroulis. In addition, 700 new jobs that were planned and funded will not be filled and will be eliminated. This will result in the total state workforce having more than 6,000 fewer positions at the end of FY13 than it did before the recession, the statement said."

In the wake of the Costa Concordia disaster, you had better bring your binoculars so you can see from afar. Italian environmentalists and some politicians are demanding that big cruise ships be banned from passing too close to islands or shorelines, or entering delicate areas such as the Venice lagoon. Prosecutors say Francesco Schettino, the captain of the Concordia, steered the ship to within 150 metres of the shore of the island of Giglio on the night of January 13, to make a salute to the islanders, who included a retired admiral, and give the passengers a close-up view. The giant ship, a floating pleasure palace of bars, spas, state rooms and tennis courts, capsized after striking a rock as dinner was being served. I hope there will be no more 'salutes', either on the island of Giglio or any other island by any captain, lawmaker Mario Valducci told the lower house of parliament during a special session on the tragedy, which has so far left 11 people dead and some 20 missing. Human lives and what tourism and shipbuilding bring to our economy are worth much more than any 'salute' by any captain in Italy, he said. Pictures published by Italian newspapers have shown that the massive ship and others just as large regularly come very close to shorelines or jetties elsewhere in the Mediterranean, including the island of Procida, off the Amalfi coast, and Sicily. Cosimo Nicastri, a Coast Guard official in Rome, told La Repubblica newspaper there was no specific ban on cruise ships approaching shorelines or islands to do the salutes, but general norms about keeping a safe distance exist, and Schettino violated them. The owners of the 114,500-tonne vessel - the biggest passenger ship ever wrecked and twice the tonnage of the Titanic - accused the captain of causing the disaster by sharply deviating from the charted course. Special Shipping Lanes The deputy transport minister, Mario Ciaccia, told parliament the government was considering a law to impose special shipping lanes on cruise ships. Environment Minister Corrado Clini said what happened at Giglio showed that salutes where ships approach islands or the mainland were a ritual that can no longer be tolerated. You don't have to be a Nobel prize winner to understand that a ship of that size should stay far from the coast, Clini said earlier this week. The disaster has put the spotlight on the Venice lagoon, perhaps Italy's most delicate maritime area, which big cruise ships enter to drop off passengers conveniently close to the historic centre and the Grand Canal. We have been saying for as long as I can remember that an environmental disaster here would mean the death of the lagoon, said Lidia Fersuoch, head of the Venice branch of Italia Nostra (Our Italy), the country's leading conservation group. We want big ships totally banned from the lagoon, she told Reuters, adding that the giant ships' wake damages buildings in the lagoon city, a UNESCO World Heritage site. Why did we need a tragedy like the Costa Concordia to get people to think about Venice again? she said. Fersuoch found comfort from centre-right parliamentarian Valducci, who told fellow legislators at the special hearing: Even though it may be nice for cruise passengers, we cannot let these mega-ships pass by St Mark's Square. So far we've been lucky, but we can no longer let them invade and destroy a pearl of international culture. Editing by Alessandra Rizzo"

U.S. officials in Washington confirmed the embassy would close because of the unpredictable security situation in a country where a rebel group has seized control of the capital, Sanaa.  State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki declined comment. But she noted that the embassy staff had been gradually reduced and said the safety of the personnel was a top priority. We take steps in order to make sure we do everything we can to protect that, she told a regular briefing.  Last month, Iran-backed Shi'ite Muslim Houthi fighters, who had captured the capital in September, seized the presidential palace, driving President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi and his government to resign.     After years of crisis, Yemen now risks descending into a full-blown civil war pitting regional, political, tribal and sectarian rivals against each other in a nation that shares a long border with top global oil exporter Saudi Arabia. Yemen is home to al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, one of the most active branches of the global Sunni Islamist group. Related CoverageYemen political unrest impacting U.S. military, Pentagon saysState Department has no comment on Yemen embassy after reports of closureHouthi leader says restoring stability to Yemen in everyone's interestThe United States has long used drones to attack the militants, a strategy critics say has failed to make a decisive difference and has stoked anti-U.S. sentiment. One U.S. official said a contingent of around 100 Marines was helping protect the U.S. embassy in Yemen. Another official said a Navy amphibious assault ship, the USS Iwo Jima, was in the Red Sea off Yemen’s coast and would be available to help with the evacuation of embassy staff, if requested by the State Department. Training Yemeni Forces  The Pentagon acknowledged Yemen's political unrest had affected its counter-terrorism capabilities but said it was still training some Yemeni forces and could still carry out operations inside the country against al Qaeda militants.  As I stand here today, we continue to conduct some training. We continue to have the capability – unilaterally if need be – of conducting counter-terrorism operations inside Yemen, said Rear Admiral John Kirby, a Pentagon spokesman. Kirby declined to discuss the status of the embassy. U.S. officials said the Americans, who had enjoyed the support of President Hadi, have no functional relationship with the Houthi forces. The Houthi leader, Abdel Malik al-Houti, took to the air waves to warn outside powers against interfering in the national crisis, saying in a televised speech on Tuesday it was in the interest of every power, domestic and foreign, to stabilise this country.      Any attempt to sow chaos or harm this country will have its repercussions on the interests of these powers, he said. Employees of the embassy said the U.S. mission had been getting rid of documents and weapons the past days and that the ambassador and other U.S. staff would leave by Wednesday. The ambassador told them Washington may ask the Turkish or Algerian embassies in Sanaa to look after U.S. interests.     Employees at the British, French and German embassies said their missions had also been getting rid of documents and have given local staff two months' paid leave. But there was no immediate word on the missions closing down. France's foreign ministry said it was monitoring the situation, but declined to say if the embassy would close. Political parties have been holding talks in Sanaa under U.N. auspices to try to agree on a transitional administration. Two parties walked out on Monday saying they had received threats from the Houthis.

The workers were trapped when the entrance of the mine in San Juan Arriba collapsed on Wednesday. Officials said the mine, 110 km (70 miles) south of the capital Tegucigalpa, had been ordered to close a few months ago because it was unsafe. Rescue workers said they had made contact with three of the workers and were close to freeing them, though eight are still missing and it was unclear whether they were alive. The situation is complex, it is difficult because the tunnels are narrow, they branch off in a number of directions, Moises Alvarado, a senior emergency services official in the region, said in a telephone interview. Another problem, authorities said, was a growing threat of rains that could result in the search being suspended. That area is all limestone, which is sensitive to rain and could cause landslides, threatening the safety of the people involved in the rescue, Oscar Triminio, a spokesman for the fire services, told Reuters. Gerardo Flores, the Honduras manager of Mayan Gold, a U.S. miner based nearby that was involved in rescue efforts, told local television that without food, water and with little air, the trapped miners could expect to live just three or four days. The problems are just starting for the (trapped) people, he said. The collapse occurred in a drought-stricken region of Honduras that had been a gold mining center for Spanish colonists. The rise in gold prices in recent years had spurred dozens of small mines to open in the area. Alvarado said many of the mines did not meet the most basic safety requirements and added that there were no maps of the underground structures, making the rescue operation harder. With the three miners we've located, we have auditory contact. They are banging their picks and shovels and yelling, said Lieutenant Manuel de Jesus Reyes, a firefighter in the nearby city of Choluteca. It seems like less noise today, but we keep working to get to them and save their lives. Hundreds of people including family members and neighbors had gathered near the entrance to the mine, but military troops cleared the area due to concerns of further landslides. Juan Bautista Mendez, 48, a farm worker, said his 25-year old nephew was among the trapped. His nephew started three weeks ago in the mine, where miners earn about $14 a day, or three times the average day rate in the region, he said. I wouldn't work there because it's very dangerous, but these guys want to earn more, Mendez said. We trust in God that my nephew is alive and can be rescued. Honduran deputy environment minister Carlos Pineda told local television the mine was illegal and that it had been ordered closed by mining authorities several months ago. An inspection proved that these are not tunnels with wood supports and lighting, it's just a hole in the ground, he said.   (Reporting by Gustavo Palencia; Editing by Alden Bentley)"

The move is a blow to the Vatican's drive to have its bank included in Europe's white list of states that comply with international standards against tax fraud and money-laundering. The bank, formally known as the Institute for Works of Religion (IOR), enacted major reforms last year in an attempt to get Europe's seal of approval and put behind it scandals that have included accusations of money laundering and fraud. Italy's leading financial daily Il Sole 24 Ore reported at the weekend that JP Morgan Chase in Milan had told the IOR of the closing of its account in a letter on Feb. 15. The letter said the IOR's account in Italy's business capital would gradually be phased out starting on March 16 and closed on March 30. In Milan, JP Morgan Chase declined to comment and the Vatican also had no comment. It was not possible to contact IOR officials because Monday was a holiday in the Vatican. Il Sole said JP Morgan Chase informed the IOR that the account was being closed because the bank's Milan branch felt the IOR had failed to provide sufficient information on money transfers. The financial newspaper, which gave the number of the IOR account, said some 1.5 billion euros passed through it in about 18 months. It said the account was a sweeping facility, meaning that it was emptied out at the end of each day with funds transferred to another IOR account in Germany. The closure move by JP Morgan Chase, which was also reported by two leading general newspapers on Monday - Corriere della Sera and La Stampa - was a further blow to the IOR, whose image has been tarnished by a string of scandals. In September, 2010, Italian investigators froze 23 million euros ($33 million) in funds in two Italian banks after opening an investigation into possible money-laundering. The bank said it did nothing wrong and was just transferring funds between its own accounts. The money was released in June 2011 but Rome magistrates are continuing their probe. Vatileaks Scandal The public image of the bank has also been harmed by the   so-called Vatileaks scandal, in which highly sensitive documents, including letters to Pope Benedict, were published in Italian media. Some of the leaked documents appear to show a conflict among top Vatican officials about just how transparent the bank should be about dealings that took place before it enacted its new laws. The IOR, founded in 1942 by Pope Pius XII, handles financial activities for the Vatican, for orders of priests and nuns, and for other Roman Catholic religious institutions. Last year, the Vatican adapted internal laws to comply with international standards on financial crime. The 108-acre sovereign state surrounded by Rome now complies with the rules of the Paris-based Financial Action Task Force (FATF). It also established an internal Financial Information Authority (FIA) along the lines of other countries and has committed to comply with international anti-money laundering standards and liaise with the group and law enforcement agencies. The IOR was entangled in the collapse 30 years ago of Banco Ambrosiano, with its lurid allegations about money-laundering, freemasons, mafiosi and the mysterious death of Ambrosiano chairman Roberto Calvi - God's banker. The IOR then held a small stake in the Ambrosiano, at the time Italy's largest private bank and investigators alleged that it was partly responsible for the Ambrosiano's fraudulent bankruptcy. Several investigations have failed to determine whether Calvi, who was found hanging under Blackfriars Bridge near London's financial district, killed himself or was murdered. The IOR denied any role in the Ambrosiano collapse but paid $250 million to creditors in what it called a goodwill gesture."

In the wake of the Costa Concordia disaster, you had better bring your binoculars so you can see from afar. Italian environmentalists and some politicians are demanding that big cruise ships be banned from passing too close to islands or shorelines, or entering delicate areas such as the Venice lagoon. Prosecutors say Francesco Schettino, the captain of the Concordia, steered the ship to within 150 metres of the shore of the island of Giglio on the night of Jan. 13, to make a salute to the islanders, who included a retired admiral, and give the passengers a close-up view. The giant ship, a floating pleasure palace of bars, spas, state rooms and tennis courts, capsized after striking a rock as dinner was being served. I hope there will be no more 'salutes', either on the island of Giglio or any other island by any captain, lawmaker Mario Valducci told the lower house of parliament during a special session on the tragedy, which has so far left 11 people dead and some 20 missing. Human lives and what tourism and shipbuilding bring to our economy are worth much more than any 'salute' by any captain in Italy, he said. Pictures published by Italian newspapers have shown that the  massive ship and others just as large regularly come very close to shorelines or jetties elsewhere in the Mediterranean, including the island of Procida, off the Amalfi coast, and Sicily. Cosimo Nicastri, a Coast Guard official in Rome, told La Repubblica newspaper there was no specific ban on cruise ships approaching shorelines or islands to do the salutes, but general norms about keeping a safe distance exist, and Schettino violated them. The owners of the 114,500-tonne vessel - the biggest passenger ship ever wrecked and twice the tonnage of the Titanic - accused the captain of causing the disaster by sharply deviating from the charted course. Special Shipping Lanes The deputy transport minister, Mario Ciaccia, told parliament the government was considering a law to impose special shipping lanes on cruise ships. Environment Minister Corrado Clini said what happened at Giglio showed that salutes where ships approach islands or the mainland were a ritual that can no longer be tolerated. You don't have to be a Nobel prize winner to understand that a ship of that size should stay far from the coast, Clini said earlier this week. The disaster has put the spotlight on the Venice lagoon, perhaps Italy's most delicate maritime area, which big cruise ships enter to drop off passengers conveniently close to the historic centre and the Grand Canal. We have been saying for as long as I can remember that an environmental disaster here would mean the death of the lagoon, said Lidia Fersuoch, head of the Venice branch of Italia Nostra (Our Italy), the country's leading conservation group. We want big ships totally banned from the lagoon, she told Reuters, adding that the giant ships' wake damages buildings in the lagoon city, a UNESCO World Heritage site. Why did we need a tragedy like the Costa Concordia to get people to think about Venice again? she said. Fersuoch found comfort from centre-right parliamentarian Valducci, who told fellow legislators at the special hearing: Even though it may be nice for cruise passengers, we cannot let these mega-ships pass by St Mark's Square. So far we've been lucky, but we can no longer let them invade and destroy a pearl of international culture."

The workers were trapped when the entrance of the mine in San Juan Arriba collapsed on Wednesday. Officials said the mine, 110 km (70 miles) south of the capital Tegucigalpa, had been ordered to close a few months ago because it was unsafe. Rescue workers said they had made contact with three of the workers and were close to freeing them, though eight are still missing and it was unclear whether they were alive. The situation is complex, it is difficult because the tunnels are narrow, they branch off in a number of directions, Moises Alvarado, a senior emergency services official in the region, said in a telephone interview. Another problem, authorities said, was a growing threat of rains that could result in the search being suspended. That area is all limestone, which is sensitive to rain and could cause landslides, threatening the safety of the people involved in the rescue, Oscar Triminio, a spokesman for the fire services, told Reuters. Gerardo Flores, the Honduras manager of Mayan Gold, a U.S. miner based nearby that was involved in rescue efforts, told local television that without food, water and with little air, the trapped miners could expect to live just three or four days. The problems are just starting for the (trapped) people, he said. The collapse occurred in a drought-stricken region of Honduras that had been a gold mining center for Spanish colonists. The rise in gold prices in recent years had spurred dozens of small mines to open in the area. Alvarado said many of the mines did not meet the most basic safety requirements and added that there were no maps of the underground structures, making the rescue operation harder. With the three miners we've located, we have auditory contact. They are banging their picks and shovels and yelling, said Lieutenant Manuel de Jesus Reyes, a firefighter in the nearby city of Choluteca. It seems like less noise today, but we keep working to get to them and save their lives. Hundreds of people including family members and neighbors had gathered near the entrance to the mine, but military troops cleared the area due to concerns of further landslides. Juan Bautista Mendez, 48, a farm worker, said his 25-year old nephew was among the trapped. His nephew started three weeks ago in the mine, where miners earn about $14 a day, or three times the average day rate in the region, he said. I wouldn't work there because it's very dangerous, but these guys want to earn more, Mendez said. We trust in God that my nephew is alive and can be rescued. Honduran deputy environment minister Carlos Pineda told local television the mine was illegal and that it had been ordered closed by mining authorities several months ago. An inspection proved that these are not tunnels with wood supports and lighting, it's just a hole in the ground, he said. Reporting by Gustavo Palencia; Editing by Alden Bentley"

U.S. officials in Washington confirmed the embassy would close because of the unpredictable security situation in a country where a rebel group has seized control of the capital, Sanaa.  State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki declined comment. But she noted that the embassy staff had been gradually reduced and said the safety of the personnel was a top priority. We take steps in order to make sure we do everything we can to protect that, she told a regular briefing.  Last month, Iran-backed Shi'ite Muslim Houthi fighters, who had captured the capital in September, seized the presidential palace, driving President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi and his government to resign.     After years of crisis, Yemen now risks descending into a full-blown civil war pitting regional, political, tribal and sectarian rivals against each other in a nation that shares a long border with top global oil exporter Saudi Arabia. Yemen is home to al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, one of the most active branches of the global Sunni Islamist group. Related CoverageYemen political unrest impacting U.S. military, Pentagon saysState Department has no comment on Yemen embassy after reports of closureHouthi leader says restoring stability to Yemen in everyone's interestThe United States has long used drones to attack the militants, a strategy critics say has failed to make a decisive difference and has stoked anti-U.S. sentiment. One U.S. official said a contingent of around 100 Marines was helping protect the U.S. embassy in Yemen. Another official said a Navy amphibious assault ship, the USS Iwo Jima, was in the Red Sea off Yemen’s coast and would be available to help with the evacuation of embassy staff, if requested by the State Department. Training Yemeni Forces  The Pentagon acknowledged Yemen's political unrest had affected its counter-terrorism capabilities but said it was still training some Yemeni forces and could still carry out operations inside the country against al Qaeda militants.  As I stand here today, we continue to conduct some training. We continue to have the capability – unilaterally if need be – of conducting counter-terrorism operations inside Yemen, said Rear Admiral John Kirby, a Pentagon spokesman. Kirby declined to discuss the status of the embassy. U.S. officials said the Americans, who had enjoyed the support of President Hadi, have no functional relationship with the Houthi forces. The Houthi leader, Abdel Malik al-Houti, took to the air waves to warn outside powers against interfering in the national crisis, saying in a televised speech on Tuesday it was in the interest of every power, domestic and foreign, to stabilise this country.      Any attempt to sow chaos or harm this country will have its repercussions on the interests of these powers, he said. Employees of the embassy said the U.S. mission had been getting rid of documents and weapons the past days and that the ambassador and other U.S. staff would leave by Wednesday. The ambassador told them Washington may ask the Turkish or Algerian embassies in Sanaa to look after U.S. interests.     Employees at the British, French and German embassies said their missions had also been getting rid of documents and have given local staff two months' paid leave. But there was no immediate word on the missions closing down. France's foreign ministry said it was monitoring the situation, but declined to say if the embassy would close. Political parties have been holding talks in Sanaa under U.N. auspices to try to agree on a transitional administration. Two parties walked out on Monday saying they had received threats from the Houthis.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eurozone-greece-banks-controls-idUSKCN0P92M720150629","Greece may find it is easier to close banks than re-open them","","June 29, 2015 /  7:49 PM / 2 years ago","","ATHENS/LONDON (Reuters) - Capital controls imposed in Greece are likely to stay in place for months and its banks may need billions of euros of new capital or even face nationalization under a lengthy financial rebuilding, industry sources said. The decision to close the banks and impose capital controls from Monday was difficult, yet re-opening them and finding a way to lift the measures could prove even tougher, experts warned.     Creditors said the door to negotiations remained open despite the government's decision to break off talks and put their latest cash-for-reforms offer to a referendum next Sunday, but that a no vote would signal an exit from the euro. In the best case scenario they manage the bank holiday, find a way to reopen the banks, stabilize the system like Cyprus, and deal with the fallout of higher NPLs (non-performing loans) and liquidity crunch. You find a path through, said a restructuring industry source who was not allowed to speak publicly. But the risk is you effectively have a state bankruptcy, and the banking system going bankrupt as well, he added. A Greek bank industry source concurred: Under a bad scenario we are in uncharted waters, (it) could end up with ruins, nationalized banks, he said. Greece said on Sunday it was closing banks all this week and capping withdrawals from ATMs at 60 euro a day to stem the outflow of cash from banks, from which about 40 billion euros  ($44.7 billion) of savings have flooded out this year, or a quarter of deposits. As the prospects for a deal receded, the European Central Bank (ECB) began refusing Greece's requests to raise the amount of emergency cash it is giving Greek banks, although the ECB is expected to let them keep using existing funds until the referendum, people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.  Greece is not the first European country to impose capital controls since the 2007/09 financial crisis, and Iceland and neighbor Cyprus showed such controls are rarely short-term. Cyprus closed its banks for two weeks in spring 2013 and limited withdrawals. Controls remained in place for two years, but the country was praised for stabilizing its financial system and preventing a long, deep recession. Iceland imposed controls in 2008 after the collapse of its banks, and only this month started to ease restrictions. Things Move Quickly... On Monday, most retail staff were not working in branches, but all other bank employees were at work, and so were staff responsible for replenishing ATMs.  Closing banks and restricting the flow of capital can build pressure for a solution as finances get squeezed. Once you start the closing of the banking system, things move quickly because every day you keep it closed you are aware of the consequences of doing so, the restructuring source said. It's easier to close the banks than it is to reopen them. You need a very clear plan for what's going to happen next when you reopen them, he said. The liquidity position of Greece's banks and the strength of their balance sheets are crucial to how severe and lengthy  capital controls will be. Greek banks are relying on 89 billion euros of emergency liquidity assistance (ELA) authorized by the ECB, but they are estimated to be near to using that capacity. While Greek authorities need to limit outflows, they also need to avoid crippling cash flow in the economy or squeezing the population too hard. Planning how far to go and how to re-open banks next week is also made near impossible by uncertainty about whether the ECB will extend liquidity, the threat Sunday's referendum may lead to Grexit, or the potential for another spell of political limbo following the referendum. A week of harsh controls might be enough to jolt the Greek people into reality over the dangers of not reworking a deal with public sector creditors, a second restructuring industry source said. While solving banks' liquidity position is most urgent, their solvency will need speedy attention, analysts said. Greek banks' core capital ratios (excluding tax credits) are all below 9 percent - the level investors typically want as a minimum - and range from just 4.9 percent at Eurobank (EURBr.AT) to 8.3 percent for Alpha Bank (ACBr.AT), Citigroup analyst Ronit Ghose estimated.  And as the economy struggles, losses from bad loans and sovereign bonds could build. Recapitalization risks are high, Ghose said. In the event ELA funding is stopped, banks could be nationalized and carved into new banks alongside a multi-year workout of Greece's finances and economy, analysts and restructuring sources said. Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras is likely to be well aware of the political risks of capital control moves. When Argentina froze access to bank deposits in December 2001, for example, the popular backlash was so severe its president and his successor had resigned within a month.

The White House and transportation leaders have warned for weeks that the $85 billion in federal cuts known as sequestration would force smaller airports across the country to curtail operations. The across-the-board cuts started kicking in on March 1 because Congress was not able to reach an alternative budget deal to replace them. The FAA must absorb $637 million in cuts by September 30. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said on Friday his department had tried to soften the blow. The FAA said another 40 towers previously slated for closure will remain open, either because them shutting them would not be in the national interest or because money was found in a federal cost-sharing program to keep them open. We heard from communities across the country about the importance of their towers and these were very tough decisions, LaHood said in a statement. Unfortunately we are faced with a series of difficult choices that we have to make to reach the required cuts under sequestration, LaHood said. The FAA does not expect any airports to have to shut down because of the tower closings, an agency spokeswoman said. Republican lawmakers expressed concern about the decision and asked LaHood in a letter for the analysis showing that closing each tower, as well as so many towers simultaneously, would not jeopardize safety. Republicans have repeatedly accused the White House of exaggerating the effects of sequestration in an attempt to shift the blame for a failed budget deal to Republicans. We are deeply disappointed by the Administration's choice today to push ahead with its proposed contract tower closings and are concerned about potential impacts on aviation safety, said House of Representatives Transportation Committee Chairman Bill Shuster and Senator John Thune, the top Republican on the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee. Airline passengers walk next to an Allegiant Air commercial flight near an air traffic control tower at the Ogden-Hinckley Airport in Ogden, Utah in this file photo taken March 11, 2013.Jim Urquhart/FilesCorporate Jets, Private Planes FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said the agency would work with affected airports and operators to ensure procedures are in place to maintain a high level of safety. Though the control tower is often the first thing passengers on commercial flights see on landing, most of the country's 5,000 publicly used airports don't have them. In addition to the 292 operated by the FAA, another 251 are staffed by three private companies: Midwest Air Traffic Control Service, Robinson Aviation (RVA) Inc and Serco Inc, in a public-private program called the FAA Contract Tower Program (FCT). The air traffic control tower is shown at the Ramona Airport in Ramona, California March 12, 2013.Mike BlakeThe FAA said it would phase in the closures over four weeks, and will work with communities that decide to participate in the agency's non-federal tower program and assume the cost of continued on-site air traffic control services at their airport. The targeted towers all have fewer than 150,000 takeoffs and landings or 10,000 commercial flights a year. They cater to corporate jets and individuals with private planes. Many also house flight schools, serve as hubs for smaller airlines, or provide relief capacity for larger airports nearby. The FAA said on Friday it had decided to keep 24 of the towers open because closing them would have a negative impact on the national interest. It made those decision based on a number of factors, including national security, the expected impact on the local community and whether the airport served by the tower is a critical diversionary airport for a large hub. Another 16 towers under a cost-share program were spared because the required 5 percent cut to that portion of the budget did not require them to be closed. The 149 towers to be closed are spread over three dozen states in cities including Tuscaloosa, Alabama; New Smyrna Beach, Florida; Battle Creek, Michigan; Branson, Missouri; Atlanta, Georgia; and Olive Branch, Mississippi. Florida, Texas, California, Oklahoma, Wisconsin and Washington were among the states with the most closings.

Ireland's almost fully state-owned banks, whose rescue cost the equivalent of 40 percent of annual economic output, have seen their losses widen because of the cost of the guarantee and capital threatened by worsening mortgage arrears. In a wide-ranging speech, Matthew Elderfield also criticised the banks dismaying handling of troubled business loans and said an impressive deleveraging drive may be slowing down. But he offered good news on one of the major drags on profitability. In my view we are getting close to the position where the changing circumstances arising from successful implementation of the IMF/EU programme and the introduction of the banking union should permit the full removal of the government guarantee, Elderfield said in prepared remarks. This will favourably impact on profitability as a result of reduced fees. Realistically, however, the prospects for significant improvement in net interest margins as a driver of profitability will be limited for the immediate future in light of the macro-economic environment. Ireland is working on a plan to wean banks off the guarantee and has already removed it from deposits taken in at branches in the UK. The scheme cost Dublin's largest lender, Bank of Ireland , 212 million euros in the first six months of the year, almost a quarter of its overall pre-tax loss. Call It as We See It Elderfield said that following tough stress tests last year, all banks' capital position remained healthy in the short term, helped by lower-than-expected losses on deleveraging and tentative early signs of stability in the Dublin housing market. However with more property price falls possible outside the capital, a difficult economic outlook and deteriorating mortgage arrears, the longer term position would not become clear until the next round of stress tests over the course of 2013. In the medium term the position becomes more uncertain, principally due to the anticipated strengthening of the minimum EU standards, uncertainty around profitability and around the exact size of future losses in problem portfolios, he said. How much uncertainty or risk? I'm afraid I'm going to disappoint you and say that we need to wait and see and do another thorough, rigorous and professional job of assessing that very question. We will, as before, call it as we see it. Elderfield said that if more capital is required, Dublin will face a policy choice of whether to again frontload or wait until support is fully needed, a decision he said that would be informed by how Europe decides to recapitalise its banks. There are limits to the public policy measures that can be taken without European assistance, said Elderfield, who is also the central bank's deputy governor. Noting that eurozone woes may keep banks from completing their deleveraging on time, he added that there may be an opportunity for a new phase of balance sheet restructuring to move poor performing or hard to value mortgage assets out of the system, but that technical issues first need to be solved."

Controls remained in place for two years, but the country was praised for stabilising its financial system and preventing a long, deep recession. Iceland imposed controls in 2008 after the collapse of its banks, and only this month started to ease restrictions. Things Move Quickly... On Monday, most retail staff were not working in branches, but all other bank employees were at work, and so were staff responsible for replenishing ATMs. Closing banks and restricting the flow of capital can build pressure for a solution as finances get squeezed. Once you start the closing of the banking system, things move quickly because every day you keep it closed you are aware of the consequences of doing so, the restructuring source said. It's easier to close the banks than it is to reopen them. You need a very clear plan for what's going to happen next when you reopen them, he said. The liquidity position of Greece's banks and the strength of their balance sheets are crucial to how severe and lengthy  capital controls will be. Greek banks are relying on 89 billion euros of emergency liquidity assistance (ELA) authorised by the ECB, but they are estimated to be near to using that capacity. While Greek authorities need to limit outflows, they also need to avoid crippling cash flow in the economy or squeezing the population too hard. Planning how far to go and how to re-open banks next week is also made near impossible by uncertainty about whether the ECB will extend liquidity, the threat Sunday's referendum may lead to Grexit, or the potential for another spell of political limbo following the referendum. A week of harsh controls might be enough to jolt the Greek people into reality over the dangers of not reworking a deal with public sector creditors, a second restructuring industry source said. While solving banks' liquidity position is most urgent, their solvency will need speedy attention, analysts said. Greek banks' core capital ratios (excluding tax credits) are all below 9 percent - the level investors typically want as a minimum - and range from just 4.9 percent at Eurobank  to 8.3 percent for Alpha Bank, Citigroup analyst Ronit Ghose estimated. And as the economy struggles, losses from bad loans and sovereign bonds could build. Recapitalization risks are high, Ghose said. In the event ELA funding is stopped, banks could be nationalised and carved into new banks alongside a multi-year workout of Greece's finances and economy, analysts and restructuring sources said. Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras is likely to be well aware of the political risks of capital control moves. When Argentina froze access to bank deposits in December 2001, for example, the popular backlash was so severe its president and his successor had resigned within a month.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/loans-sanctions-russia-idUSL6N0Q53TL20140730","RLPC-Sanctions close intl loan market to Russian companies","","July 30, 2014 /  12:11 PM / 3 years ago","","LONDON, July 29 (Reuters) - Fresh EU and US sanctions have frozen Russian companies out of the international syndicated loan market, senior loan bankers said on Wednesday. International banks had already stopped lending to sanctioned Russian companies after US sanctions were first announced on July 16, but new EU and additional US sanctions announced on Tuesday have removed the possibility of raising funds from Europe or Asia. Right now, all banks are acting the same, no group is any more or less cautious or sanctions aware. It's all too important - Asian banks are the same as European or US banks in this respect, a London-based banker at an Asian bank said. New EU sanctions released on Tuesday banned Russia's state- run banks from raising funds in European capital markets and the US released more sanctioned names including VTB Bank. Russia's second-largest bank, VTB, was seeking a $1.5-2 billion loan refinancing before US sanctions on July 16. The loan was due to sign but was put on hold at that time, even though the bank was not on the sanctions list. Signing was rescheduled for next week, but banks are now refusing to lend, a banker said. VTB declined to comment on the syndicated loan but released  a statement saying that it was ready to borrow on financial markets outside the European Union and United States. Sanctioned Outcasts Sanctioned Russian companies will not be able to raise syndicated loans in any region or in any currency, and their only funding option is the Russian state, loan bankers said. It is unlikely that Russian companies will rely on local banks for liquidity, it will come directly from the government, which can afford it, the London-based banker said. US sanctions forbid US banks from lending to sanctioned Russian companies, but also have wider implications as clearing systems for dollar and euro-denominated loans are based in Western countries which are sanctioning Russia. Russian companies have traditionally relied heavily on dollar-denominated syndicated loans. Several borrowers including Sberbank have raised euro-denominated loans, but euro lending remains small in comparison to dollar borrowing. It would depend how deals are structured or ringfenced, you'd have to be careful about dollars as US regulators are thinking about currency as well as geography, the London-based banker said. Sanctioned Russian companies will not be able to borrow in other currencies, such as euros or renminbi as European and Asian banks are unwilling to jeopardise relations with the US as they have US branches and subsidiaries. We definitely won't participate in any deals of sanctioned Russian companies, a Beijing-based senior syndicated loan banker at a major Chinese bank said. I would think all Chinese banks with businesses or branches or ADR in the United States would be very careful about doing business with Russia at the moment, another Beijing-based banker said. Contagion? Russian companies that have not been sanctioned are suffering from contagion as banks are now unwilling to lend to any Russian company as they assess the impact of the new sanctions. Lenders are focused on reducing Russian exposure as political risk increases. Chinese banks may be willing to lend to non-sanctioned companies but will consider each deal on its merits and remain wary given their US operations. We will still consider them (Russian companies) on a case by case if a Russian company is not on the sanction list, the first Beijing-based banker said. Chinese banks would be likely to focus on commodity deals and trade financings, bankers said. The only nationality of banks that is increasing activity is the Chinese banks. They would be likely to do commodity linked deals, such as oil prepayment facilities and only for names that are not on the sanctions list, the London-based banker said.

Investment-grade Asian credits were 2bp-3bp tighter across the region, while 10-year tenors were well bid as yields on the 10-year US Treasury settled below the 2.5% range at 2.18% overnight. CNOOC's 3.5% 2025s reversed a recent loss, rising a third of a point to 98.3/98.4, while bankers said investor feedback reflected appetite for 10-year bonds during Huawei's roadshow that started on Wednesday. China Merchants Bank New York branch's USD500m 3-year bonds tightened as much as 13bp on appetite for higher-yielding Chinese bank paper. Those bonds priced at 147.5bp over US Treasuries.

Export-Import Bank of Korea's 2025s stopped last week's rise in yields, tightening 1bp, while Woori's subordinated 2024s narrowed 2bp-3bp.

The iTraxx investment grade index series 17 breached the 150bp mark for the first time in four months as it traded at 147bp/150bp, the lowest since end-March.

The markets are very strong. Its summer time, liquidity is not great and there is a general move into risk after the developments in Europe, said a Singapore based trader. Sinopec's reopening of its 2022 bonds went off very smoothly even after the borrower sold it at a reoffer spread tighter than initially expected, indicating the market's hunger for paper. Asian issuers of dollar-, euro- and yen-denominated bonds have already raised USD86.4bn in the year to date, already in excess of the previous record of USD83.4bn. Still that has not satisfied all the investors as more funds have started to increase allocations to higher-yielding assets. EPFR Global data shows year to date inflows into high yield of over USD43bn 130% of the existing full-year record. There isn't much supply to satisfy the market and the more it squeezes, the more it forces others into the trade. We will probably remain like this next couple of weeks, he added referring to the supply drought. New bonds from Sinopec traded as tight as 143bp/141bp over US Treasuries after pricing at 145bp, 10bp tight to initial price guidance, even though some bankers felt the issuer had left 3bp on the table for investors relative to fair value. While the technicals remain supportive across the board in the investment grade sector, the support in high yield was very subjective and on a name by name basis. Sound Global debuted on a weak note after it raised USD150m in a deal priced at 12%, tighter than its similar rated peers like KWG, trading at 12.5%. The issuer pushed through its offering after it doubled the private banking rebate to 50 cents with that investor group accounting for 24% of the issue. The bonds traded down at 99.25/100 out of the box. Bonds from Standard Chartered fell across the board with the Hong Kong branch-issued 2020s wider by 30bp and the UK branch perpetuals down several points following accusations by a US regulator that the bank violated sanctions against Iran and the threat of loss of its New York licence.

The loss of its NY would licence would be embarrassing for SCB and would limit its scope of business; our best guess is that a more likely outcome is a hefty fine and some senior management at SCB stepping down to take responsibility, said CreditSights analysts in a report. The sovereign segment was quiet with Manila out due to a weather-related closure. Still investor enquiries were suggesting hunger for duration with Indonesia 2042 up by a quarter of a point at 113.875/114 and Philippines 2037 steady at 117.50. In high yield flows were light although levels were flat to a quarter point higher with some outperformance by second tier property names like Evergrande. Its 2015s are up at par from 99.625.

Iraqi forces cut the hardline group's last supply line into Ramadi in November, surrounding the city and making it almost impossible for the militants to send in reinforcements. But for thousands of residents who remain trapped inside the mainly Sunni city, life has become even harder as the militants grow increasingly paranoid, residents said. Reuters spoke to five residents inside the city and three who recently managed to get out. All said conditions inside had deteriorated to their worst since Islamic State overran it earlier this year. “Daesh fighters are becoming more hostile and suspicious. They prevent us from leaving houses. Everyone who goes out against orders is caught and investigated, said Abu Ahmed. We feel we’re living inside a sealed casket. Ramadi, a provincial capital in the fertile Euphrates valley just a short drive west of Baghdad, was Islamic State's biggest conquest since last year, and reversing it would be a major victory for the Iraqi government and its spectrum of allies that include both the United States and Iran. The description of harsh rule by Islamic State fighters could also indicate disquiet among Sunni Muslim residents, some of whom switched sides to help U.S. forces defeat a precursor of Islamic State in the city during the American occupation nearly a decade ago. Sheikh Khatab al-Amir who is still in contact with members of his tribe inside Ramadi said the insurgents were restricting movement there. “The insurgents have sectioned Ramadi into a group of smaller segments and do not permit the passage of civilians from one area to the other because they suspect anyone at the moment of being an informant for the security forces, he said. More people were cooperating with the security forces as the insurgents' treatment became harsher, the sheikh said. Residents say the militants have increased motorcycle patrols inside the city to catch those using mobile phones, which are banned in Islamic State territory. High, empty buildings are also under surveillance. “They (militants) are strangling us more and more. They treat us like prisoners,” said Abu Ahmed, speaking from the roof of his house to receive a weak phone signal with a cardboard box over his head so he would not be seen by Islamic State patrols.     “I have to go now. I’m hearing Daesh motorcycles. I could lose my head if…” said Abu Ahmed said, ending the call mid-sentence.    Food supplies used to enter the city from the west, but since Iraqi forces surrounded it, residents are subsisting on meager rations of vegetables and a small quantity of flour distributed by the militants. “We are eating old bread with rotten tomatoes, said another resident who preferred to be identified only by his first name, Omar, entreating God to rescue him and his family. I feel I’ll be forced to kill the cat we raised for years if there is nothing left to eat. An Iraqi Sunni displaced woman, who fled the violence in the city of Ramadi carries her child on the outskirts of Baghdad, Iraq May 19, 2015.StringerA shortage of cooking gas and kerosene has forced people to burn scraps of wood for fuel. Some said the militants had recently begun piling up branches and tree trunks in courtyards for families to use in cooking.   The militants used to provide fuel for neighborhood electricity generators, but they no longer do, leaving residents without power for many hours. “Daesh's ugly face has appeared at last. They are treating women like animals. I feel I was born again now. I feel I was a slave,” said Um Mohammed, a physics teacher who fled Ramadi on Sunday with her elderly mother and is now in a temporary shelter south of Ramadi.  Scapegoat Ramadi, the capital of Anbar province, fell to Islamic State in May, dealing the biggest blow in nearly a year to Iraqi government forces who had been fighting back after losing most of northern Iraq to the militants last year. Slideshow (3 Images)Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi vowed to retake the city within days, but the counter-offensive was delayed until Iraqi forces regrouped. That has also led to delays in government offensives in other areas further north. Local officials and tribal leaders estimate between 1,200-1,700 families remain trapped inside Ramadi. The government last week urged them to leave the city, but several residents told Reuters the militants were preventing them from doing so. Those caught trying to flee are detained by the fighters, and the head of the family risks being executed as a warning to others.     Some families managed to escape through a route controlled by the security forces on the city's southern outskirts before the militants deployed snipers to shoot anyone trying to reach the exit, residents and security sources said.      Ahmad al-Assafi who managed to flee in mid-November after paying $1,000 to a taxi driver who helped him to leave the city through connections with militants, said they appeared to be losing confidence as Iraqi forces close in.  “Daesh are mainly using motorcycles in their movements to avoid air strikes and have deployed suicide attackers in various parts of Ramadi. They look in real tension,” he said, using an Arabic acronym for the group also known as ISIL or ISIS.  Iraqi forces are making advances on the outskirts of the city, while denying that there are large numbers of innocent civilians still trapped in harm's way. “We are pushing the terrorists more to the corners and our troops are further closing on them, said Sabah al-Numani, spokesman for the Iraqi counter-terrorism forces, which are deployed on the western part of Ramadi. All families left inside Ramadi are those of the terrorists or those who support them. Several residents said that although they longed to be rid of Islamic State, they feared they would be accused of supporting the militants if the city is recaptured.  “I wish that could happen soon to get rid of the Daesh nightmare, but what could happen afterwards could be worse, said Omar, a father of two daughters. We will be the scapegoat. Additional reporting by Saif Hameed; Editing by Isabel Coles and Peter Graff"

    * Obama meets lawmakers to resolve budget impasse
    * Physical buying weak at current price levels

 (Updates prices)
    By A. Ananthalakshmi
    SINGAPORE, Oct 10 (Reuters) - Gold was barely holding above
$1,300 an ounce on Thursday on signs the Federal Reserve may
trim its stimulus measures this year and as the dollar rebounded
after President Barack Obama began meetings with lawmakers to
resolve the U.S. budget crisis.
    Safe-haven buying, seen in the last few sessions as a result
of the U.S. government shutdown, evaporated as the dollar
climbed off eight-month lows, also helped by the nomination of
Janet Yellen as the next Fed chief.  
 
    Physical buying failed to pick up despite the lower prices,
raising questions about what could support gold prices after the
U.S. budget impasse is resolved. 
    The fact that gold is not going up even with the shutdown
is a bad sign, said Yuichi Ikemizu, branch manager for Standard
Bank in Tokyo. The mood in the market is bearish.
    Even at this $1,300 level we don't see much physical
buying. It doesn't look too good for gold.
    Spot gold had fallen 0.05 percent to $1,306.00 an
ounce by 0625 GMT, after losing around 1 percent the session
before. Platinum gained nearly 1 percent as South African
mine strikes threatened to hurt supply.
    Gold has fallen about 22 percent this year on fears the Fed
would start cutting back its $85 billion bond purchases as the
U.S. labour and housing markets showed some growth. The central
bank stunned markets last month when it decided not to taper.
    However, minutes from the September policy meeting released
on Wednesday showed that the Fed's decision last month was a
relatively close call for policymakers and there was still
broad support to trim bond-buying this year. 
    The U.S. shutdown and concerns over the debt ceiling
deadline should have typically pushed up prices, but gold is
still trading below pre-shutdown levels of about $1,340.
    How the U.S. dollar moves in the near term may provide
direction for gold, HSBC analysts said in a note. It is
possible that investors move into Treasuries as a safe haven
despite the possibility of U.S. default. This could reduce
yields and bolster the dollar but detract from gold.

Emmy-winning mockumentary The Office, adapted from Ricky Gervais' British series of the same name, saw a documentary crew filming the daily lives of employees at the Dunder Mifflin paper company, led for several years by hapless boss Michael Scott, played by Carell. On Thursday's 75-minute finale, set six months after the fictional documentary was released, the colleagues all reunite for the marriage of Machiavellian office manager Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson), and accountant Angela Martin (Angela Kingsley). Carell entered the episode as a surprise guest at the wedding, uttering one of Michael Scott's best-known phrases - That's what she said. Later as he considered the romances that had formed at the workplace, Carell's character told the camera, It's like all my children grew up and they married each other. Over nine seasons, audiences have been treated to numerous office fights, friendships and romances on the NBC sitcom. One of the most compelling storylines was the growing romance of Jim and Pam, played by John Krasinski and Jenna Fischer, as audiences watched them transition from friendship to marriage and parenthood. For fans of the show, the season finale saw most of the long-standing cast members get their happy ending. Stanley finally retires, Erin finds her birth parents, Andy capitalizes on becoming an unwilling viral video star, Kelly and Ryan run off into the sunset (albeit abandoning a baby in the process) and Jim and Pam decide to move to Austin, Texas. The final scenes featured a montage of key moments, including Jim and Pam's romance and the numerous friendships that developed over the years. I wish there was a way to know you were in the good old days before you've actually left them, Andy Bernard, played by Ed Helms, said wistfully. The cast also reflected on the documentary that captured nine years of their lives at the company, which Jim described as this stupid, wonderful, boring, amazing job. Imagine going back and watching a tape of your life. You can see yourself change ... watch yourself fall in love, become a husband, a father. You guys gave that to me, Jim said to the cameras. Launching Stars, Falling Audiences The Office, which first aired in 2005, began with a relatively unknown cast, led by Carell, whose breakout film The 40-Year-Old Virgin came out the same year. The show made stars of many of its cast members, leading to high-profile movie roles, and its producers said last year that the outside success of The Office actors played a role in the decision to wind it down. Carell left the show in season seven to focus on his rising film career, which has included roles in Crazy, Stupid, Love and The Incredible Burt Wonderstone. Helms also made the move to the big screen with roles in The Hangover franchise, and Krasinski starred in the recent film The Promised Land with Matt Damon. Mindy Kaling, who plays office mean girl Kelly Kapoor, landed her own Fox sitcom The Mindy Project, while Craig Robinson, who plays warehouse manager Darryl, scored film roles in Pineapple Express and upcoming This Is the End. After Carell's exit in 2011, audiences began to turn away from The Office and viewership fell to about 4 million last year per episode from a high of about 8 million in 2008. The show's culmination comes on the heels of another NBC comedy, 30 Rock, bowing out after seven seasons in February. Prior to the finale, an hourlong retrospective of the show featured cast members and producers talking about the impact of The Office on their careers and why fans were drawn to it. This is a perfect time for the show to come to a close, Wilson said. There's a finality to it and a sadness to it. Wilson had sought to create a spin-off show led by his character Dwight, but it was not picked up for broadcast. The unlikely star of the show has been the city of Scranton, Pennsylvania, which prior to the show was known for coal mining but not anymore. As the series drew to a close, tens of thousands of people gathered in Scranton earlier this month to give a rousing send-off to the sitcom that changed the image of the city forever. Thank you, Scranton, Carell told the crowd. This all is because of you. NBC is a unit of Comcast Corp. Reporting By Piya Sinha-Roy; Editing by Bill Trott"
"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-guantanamo-sloan-idUSBRE95H01420130618","Lawyer Cliff Sloan faces tough assignment: Closing Guantanamo","","June 18, 2013 /  1:11 AM / 4 years ago","","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Cliff Sloan has represented Jon Bon Jovi's band in legal matters and argued cases before the U.S. Supreme Court. Now, he has perhaps his toughest assignment: Helping to close the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The Washington attorney was named on Monday as the State Department's Guantanamo Bay envoy, a central player in President Barack Obama's renewed push to make good on a 2008 campaign promise to shut the installation where the United States holds terrorism suspects. Obama wants to close the facility because it is a legacy of the Bush administration that he feels has damaged the U.S. reputation with allies around the world. The most pressing demand for Sloan, who has deep legal skills but little foreign policy experience, will be to serve as the lead negotiator for the transfer of Guantanamo Bay detainees abroad, a task fraught with difficulty. Obama last month lifted a ban on the transfer of prisoners to Yemen. Of 166 detainees at Guantanamo, 86 have been cleared for transfer or release and 56 of those are from Yemen, where al Qaeda has a dangerous foothold. Adding to the pressure to deal with the prison is the fact that more than 100 detainees are on a hunger strike. The fear among many lawmakers is that those sent to Yemen or elsewhere would return quickly to the battlefield and plot attacks against the United States. To forestall that possibility, current law requires the Defense Department to certify for each transferred prisoner that the destination country is not a state terrorism sponsor. The countries also must certify that they would ensure the individual would not threaten the United States. Unless this law is lifted as Obama wants, transferring the detainees is nearly impossible, which makes Sloan's job all the more difficult. This is going to be a very difficult job, but he brings to the table I think both the combination of intellect and personality to find some solution. I don't know what the solution is going to be, said Newton Minow, a former commissioner at the Federal Communications Commission who has worked with Sloan. Another former colleague, former White House counsel Fred Fielding, said Sloan faces a tough assignment but has the intellect and judgment that will be required if it is to have a chance to succeed. 'Inheriting a Mess' Sloan, who declined to be interviewed by Reuters, will work with a Defense Department envoy to be named soon. He also must deal with lawmakers who oppose moving any detainees to face prosecution in the United States. There is wide bipartisan opposition to the president's plan to transfer terrorists from the secure facility at Guantanamo into American cities and towns, said Don Stewart, spokesman for Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell. Sloan, a partner at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom, has worked for both Republican and Democratic administrations. He was an associate counsel in the Bill Clinton White House, and at one point worked for then-U.S. Solicitor General Ken Starr, who would eventually bring impeachment charges against Clinton. A former law clerk to Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens, Sloan has been involved in six U.S. Supreme Court arguments, including one in which he had the temerity to ask a question of Justice Antonin Scalia. In one of my first Supreme Court arguments, I responded to a question from Justice Scalia by asking him a question. I learned that you never answer the bench with a question! Sloan told the legal website Law360 in an interview in February. He served as lead counsel for Bon Jovi's band in a successful copyright infringement lawsuit. Sloan was picked for the job because he is considered an effective advocate who will work well with all U.S. government branches. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Sloan, besides negotiating detainee transfers, will periodically review the detainees not approved for transfer. Sloan fills the post left vacant by veteran diplomat Dan Fried when he moved on in January to work in the State Department office of international sanctions.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/television-theoffice-idUSL2N0DY03T20130517","Steve Carell helps 'The Office' close its doors in moving finale","","May 17, 2013 /  3:30 AM / 4 years ago","","LOS ANGELES, May 16 (Reuters) - The doors of Dunder Mifflin's Scranton branch closed for the last time on Thursday as NBC's The Office wrapped up after a nine-season run with a nostalgic finale featuring a long-awaited wedding and the return of the show's biggest star, Steve Carell. Emmy-winning mockumentary The Office, adapted from Ricky Gervais' British series of the same name, saw a documentary crew filming the daily lives of employees at the Dunder Mifflin paper company, led for several years by hapless boss Michael Scott, played by Carell. On Thursday's 75-minute finale, set six months after the fictional documentary was released, the colleagues all reunite for the marriage of Machiavellian office manager Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson), and accountant Angela Martin (Angela Kingsley). Carell entered the episode as a surprise guest at the wedding, uttering one of Michael Scott's best-known phrases - That's what she said. Later as he considered the romances that had formed at the workplace, Carell's character told the camera, It's like all my children grew up and they married each other. Over nine seasons, audiences have been treated to numerous office fights, friendships and romances on the NBC sitcom. One of the most compelling storylines was the growing romance of Jim and Pam, played by John Krasinski and Jenna Fischer, as audiences watched them transition from friendship to marriage and parenthood. For fans of the show, the season finale saw most of the long-standing cast members get their happy ending. Stanley finally retires, Erin finds her birth parents, Andy capitalizes on becoming an unwilling viral video star, Kelly and Ryan run off into the sunset (albeit abandoning a baby in the process) and Jim and Pam decide to move to Austin, Texas. The final scenes featured a montage of key moments, including Jim and Pam's romance and the numerous friendships that developed over the years. I wish there was a way to know you were in the good old days before you've actually left them, Andy Bernard, played by Ed Helms, said wistfully. The cast also reflected on the documentary that captured nine years of their lives at the company, which Jim described as this stupid, wonderful, boring, amazing job. Imagine going back and watching a tape of your life. You can see yourself change ... watch yourself fall in love, become a husband, a father. You guys gave that to me, Jim said to the cameras. Launching Stars, Falling Audiences The Office, which first aired in 2005, began with a relatively unknown cast, led by Carell, whose breakout film The 40-Year-Old Virgin came out the same year. The show made stars of many of its cast members, leading to high-profile movie roles, and its producers said last year that the outside success of The Office actors played a role in the decision to wind it down. Carell left the show in season seven to focus on his rising film career, which has included roles in Crazy, Stupid, Love and The Incredible Burt Wonderstone. Helms also made the move to the big screen with roles in The Hangover franchise, and Krasinski starred in the recent film The Promised Land with Matt Damon. Mindy Kaling, who plays office mean girl Kelly Kapoor, landed her own Fox sitcom The Mindy Project, while Craig Robinson, who plays warehouse manager Darryl, scored film roles in Pineapple Express and upcoming This Is the End. After Carell's exit in 2011, audiences began to turn away from The Office and viewership fell to about 4 million last year per episode from a high of about 8 million in 2008. The show's culmination comes on the heels of another NBC comedy, 30 Rock, bowing out after seven seasons in February. Prior to the finale, an hourlong retrospective of the show featured cast members and producers talking about the impact of The Office on their careers and why fans were drawn to it. This is a perfect time for the show to come to a close, Wilson said. There's a finality to it and a sadness to it. Wilson had sought to create a spin-off show led by his character Dwight, but it was not picked up for broadcast. The unlikely star of the show has been the city of Scranton, Pennsylvania, which prior to the show was known for coal mining but not anymore. As the series drew to a close, tens of thousands of people gathered in Scranton earlier this month to give a rousing send-off to the sitcom that changed the image of the city forever. Thank you, Scranton, Carell told the crowd. This all is because of you. NBC is a unit of Comcast Corp.   (Reporting By Piya Sinha-Roy; Editing by Bill Trott)"

The plea, in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, marks the death knell for one of Switzerland's most storied banks, whose original European clients pre-date the American Revolution. It is also potentially a major turning point in a battle by U.S. authorities against Swiss bank secrecy. A major question was left hanging by the plea: Has the bank turned over, or does it plan to disclose, names of American clients to U.S. authorities? That is a key demand in a broad U.S. investigation of tax evasion through Swiss banks. It is unclear whether the bank was required to turn over American client names who held secret Swiss bank accounts, said Jeffrey Neiman, a former federal prosecutor involved in other Swiss bank investigations who is now in private law practice in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. What is clear is that the Justice Department is aggressively pursuing foreign banks who have helped Americans commit overseas tax evasion, he said. Charles Miller, a Justice Department spokesman, declined to comment immediately. Wegelin admitted to charges of conspiracy in helping Americans evade taxes on at least $1.2 billion for nearly a decade. Wegelin agreed to pay $57.8 million to the United States in restitution and fines. Otto Bruderer, a managing partner at the bank, said in court that Wegelin was aware that this conduct was wrong. He said that from about 2002 through about 2010, Wegelin agreed with certain U.S. taxpayers to evade the U.S. tax obligations of these U.S. taxpayer clients, who filed false tax returns with the IRS. Initially Vowed to Resist When Wegelin last February became the first foreign bank in recent memory to be indicted by U.S. authorities, it vowed to resist the charges. The bank, founded in 1741, was declared a fugitive from justice when its Swiss-based executives failed to appear in U.S. court. The surprise plea effectively ended the U.S. case against Wegelin, one of the most aggressive bank crackdowns in U.S. history. Once the matter is finally concluded, Wegelin will cease to operate as a bank, Wegelin said in a statement on Thursday from its headquarters in the remote, small town of St. Gallen next to the Appenzell Alps near the German-Austrian border. But the fate of three Wegelin bankers, indicted in January 2012 on charges later modified to include the bank, remains up in the air. Under criminal procedural rules, the cases of the three bankers - Michael Berlinka, Urs Frei and Roger Keller - are still pending., Although Wegelin had about a dozen branches, all in Switzerland, at the time of its indictment, it moved quickly to wind down its business, partly through a sale of its non-U.S. assets to regional Swiss bank Raiffeisen Gruppe. A corporate indictment can be a death knell. In 2002, accounting firm Arthur Andersen went out of business after being found guilty over its role in failed energy company Enron Corp. A 2005 Supreme Court ruling later overturned the conviction, but it was too late to save the company. Wegelin, a partnership of Swiss private bankers, was already a shadow of its former self - it effectively broke itself up following the indictment last year by selling the non-U.S. portion of its business. Dozens of Swiss bankers and their clients have been indicted in recent years, following a 2009 agreement by UBS AG, the largest Swiss bank, to enter into a deferred-prosecution agreement, turn over 4,450 client names and pay a $780 million fine after admitting to criminal wrongdoing in selling tax-evasion services to wealthy Americans. 'Wake-Up Call' William Sharp, a tax lawyer in Tampa, Florida, with many U.S. clients of Swiss banks, said Wegelin's plea should serve as a wake-up call to the world banking community servicing U.S. clients to takes steps to ensure compliance with U.S. law. Sharp called Wegelin's change of heart shocking. Banks under U.S. criminal investigation in the wider probe include Credit Suisse, which disclosed last July it had received a target letter saying it was under a grand jury investigation. Zurich-based Julius Baer and some cantonal, or regional, banks are also under scrutiny, sources familiar with the probes  previously told Reuters. So are UK-based HSBC Holdings  and three Israeli banks, Hapoalim, Mizrahi-Tefahot Bank Ltd and Bank Leumi, sources also said previously. Those banks have not commented on the inquiries. In a statement after the plea, Assistant U.S. Attorney General Kathryn Keneally said it was a top Justice Department priority to find those who continue to shirk their tax obligations, as well as those who help them and profit from it. The best deal now for these folks is to come in and 'get right' with the IRS, before either the IRS or the Justice Department finds them, she said. Under its plea, Wegelin agreed to pay the $20 million in restitution to the IRS as well a civil forfeiture of $15.8 million, the Justice Department said. Wegelin also agreed to pay an additional $22.05 million fine, the Justice Department said. U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff, who must approve the monetary penalties, set a hearing in the case for March 4 for sentencing. Last year, the U.S. government separately seized more than $16 million of Wegelin funds in a UBS AG account in Stamford, Connecticut, via a civil forfeiture complaint. Since Wegelin has no branches outside Switzerland, it used UBS for correspondent banking services, a standard industry practice, to handle money for U.S.-based clients. In court papers, Bruderer said that Wegelin believed it would not be prosecuted in the United States for this conduct because it had no branches or offices in the United States and  because of its understanding that it acted in accordance with, and not in violation of, Swiss law and that such conduct was common in the Swiss banking industry. The case is U.S. v. Wegelin & Co et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 12-cr-00002.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/alliedirishbanks-idUSL5N0CJ0KV20130327","UPDATE 2-Allied Irish Banks says closing in on profitability","","March 27, 2013 /  7:29 AM / 4 years ago","","* Provisions drop 70 pct to 2.5 bln euros as losses fall * Net interest margin rises quarter on quarter * No significant deposit movement on Cyprus crisis - CFO By Padraic Halpin DUBLIN, March 27 (Reuters) - State-owned Allied Irish Banks (AIB) declared that it is moving back towards profitability after cutting its operating loss by a quarter last year and improving margins this year. AIB cost taxpayers more than 20 billion euros during the financial crisis - the most handed out to any lender still operating - and is cutting jobs, closing branches and reducing its funding costs. Now focused on its home market after a property crash forced it to ditch its international ambitions, the bank said that demand in Ireland would be constrained in 2013 but is showing signs of stability, echoing comments made by rival Bank of Ireland this month. It's a similar message, maybe a number of months behind Bank of Ireland, but certainly a similar one in terms of seeing a turn in performance, AIB acting finance chief Paul Stanley said. There is good momentum, he added, with the net interest margin improving and cost efficiencies coming through. The bank doesn't expect any fallout from developments in Cyprus, where bank deposit holders face a hefty levy as part of the government's EU bailout deal. There has been some noise in terms of a few customers with queries, but nothing in terms of movements in actual deposits that would indicate a concern, Stanley said. Loan Book Unlike its main rival, AIB failed to attract private capital two years ago, triggering its effective nationalisation. Its margins have been slower to recover partly because of a loan book still weighed down by mortgage arrears. Its proportion of owner-occupiers in arrears for more than 90 days rose at a slower pace to 9.1 percent last year, against an industry average of 11.9 percent, and the bank reiterated that it expects arrears to peak towards the middle of this year. While the comparative figure for buy-to-let mortgage holders in trouble - 17.7 percent - was also below the 18.9 percent reported by the central bank for the sector as a whole, those investors represented 44 percent of the entire buy-to-let book. That was significantly above the 24 percent at Bank of Ireland and 30 percent at permanent tsb. The bank's net interest margin - measuring the profitability of its lending - was broadly unchanged at 0.91 percent versus 0.9 percent at the end of June but grew quarter-on-quarter for the first time in 10 years in the final three months of 2012. That remains some way from the 1.5 percent that AIB believes would convince investors to take a stake in the bank. But after excluding the costly state guarantee on deposits, which is due to be lifted this week, AIB says the full-year figure is 1.22 percent. Acting CFO Stanley told a conference call that the 388 million euros ($499 million) in fees related to the guarantee should fall by about 200 million euros this year. Coco Bond Sale After the government cut its exposure to Bank of Ireland by selling 1 billion euros of contingent capital notes in January, Stanley said there is a reasonable amount of investor interest in these CoCo bonds. While nothing immediate is on the table, there may be a sale this year, he said. The bank, which also narrowed its provisions by 70 percent to 2.5 billion euros, added that it had largely completed a restructuring that will cut its workforce by almost 20 percent. Whilst arrears are slowing, impairments look higher than expected as the bank continues to cleanse its balance sheet ahead of 2013/14, Eamonn Hughes, an analyst at Goodbody Stockbrokers, wrote in a note. The margin stabilisation is a helpful sign, but the turnaround here is likely to trail Bank of Ireland. The bank's shares, which no longer trade on Ireland's main stock exchange, were down 1 percent at 0.07 euros by 0920 GMT. AIB had also met 89 percent of a 20.5 billion euro deleveraging target set under Ireland's bailout by the end of last year and said its deposit base remained stable in the second half, rising 5 percent year on year.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/brazil-election-evangelicals-insight-pix-idUSL2N0RP0WG20140928","INSIGHT-Brazil's evangelicals gain clout, close to electing first president","","September 28, 2014 /  11:01 AM / 3 years ago","","BRASILIA, Sept 28 (Reuters) - Brazil's increasingly powerful evangelical Christians are tantalizingly close to electing one of their own as president next month in what would be a historic shift for the world's largest Catholic nation. Marina Silva, an environmentalist running neck and neck in polls with incumbent President Dilma Rousseff, is a Pentecostal Christian who often invokes God on the campaign trail and has said she sometimes consults the Bible for inspiration when making important political decisions. Some 65 percent of Brazil's 200 million people are Roman Catholics but evangelicals are rapidly gaining followers and power. They grew from 5 percent of the population in 1970 to more than 22 percent in 2010 and the trend has continued. Evangelical groups have made particular inroads among urban working Brazilians who benefited from economic prosperity over the last two decades and are now demanding a greater say in politics. Recent polls show evangelical voters would support Silva over Rousseff by a margin of about 54 percent to 38 percent if the two face each other in a runoff on Oct. 26, as most expect. In a tight race, that could swing the result. The evangelicals' rise has drawn comparisons to the religious right that began to influence U.S. politics in the 1980s. There are important differences - most Brazilians are politically well to the left of Americans, perhaps inevitably in a country with one of the world's biggest gaps between rich and poor. Silva and Rousseff both call themselves socialists and push for robust welfare programs. Infighting within evangelical groups has also limited their ability to create a unified bloc. Yet similarities with the religious right abound. Brazil's evangelical faithful have turned their opposition to gay marriage and abortion, which are both illegal here, into key national political issues. Funded by the tithes their followers are asked to pay, the more successful evangelical churches are increasingly turning their newfound wealth into political influence. They have bought up radio and television stations across Brazil and financed campaigns to elect evangelical candidates, including many pastors, to seats in Congress. The evangelical caucus in Congress showed its muscle in May by forcing Rousseff to revoke authorization for public health service abortions in exceptional cases of pregnancies caused by rape and of fetuses with brain defects. For the first time in a Brazilian election, there are two evangelical candidates running for president. Silva has eclipsed the second hopeful, Pastor Everaldo, although he has made his mark in debates by accusing Rousseff's government of trampling on family values and seeking to legalize abortion. Under evangelical pressure, Silva has changed her party's position on gay rights. And Rousseff, a Catholic who has rarely used faith in her political career, is now presenting herself as a good Christian. Happy is the nation whose God is the Lord, she quoted from Psalms at one campaign stop. The evangelical vote will be decisive in this election, said Rodrigo Delmasso, a pastor of a Brasilia-based Pentecostal church, who is running for a seat in the city's legislature. As the community grows it's natural that our share of political representation grows too, the 34-year-old pastor said during a campaign stop where he handed out bumper stickers and posters to metro workers. Delmasso said he voted for Rousseff in 2010, but he now backs Silva, trusting she will sweep out corruption after 12 years of rule by the leftist Workers' Party. Morality Many evangelicals believe their churches are uniquely equipped to cleanse politics - and society at large. In a shabby shopping center in the center of Brazil's capital, two theaters that used to show porn films are now churches. In one that doubled as a strip club, pastors preach about salvation from a stage where strippers once performed. Pentecostalism, the fastest growing branch of evangelical Christianity, was introduced to Latin America by U.S. missionaries a century ago. These days, virtually every town and neighborhood in Brazil seems to have a Pentecostal chapel where vibrant song and prayer blare over loudspeakers onto the street outside. Many converts say the uplifting services and emphasis on material prosperity are more appealing than what they found in the Catholic Church. The exodus is happening across Latin America and is especially strong in Brazil. The Catholic Church retains political influence of its own - gathering all the major presidential candidates for a debate in Aparecida, the shrine of Brazil's patron saint, earlier this month, for example. But while it bans its priests from engaging in politics, evangelical preachers are free to launch their own political careers from the pulpit or televangelist studios. Recently, at the doors of a church in Brasilia, youths in shirts and ties handed out campaign flyers to people attending the service. A vote for the evangelical congressional candidate was the same as voting for the Church, one of the youths said. One major goal of evangelicals is to keep expanding their caucus in Congress, which has grown from 17 in 1985 to 76 today - about 15 percent of the Chamber of Deputies. They have in many ways followed the path taken by the U.S. Christian right, which didn't really get involved in national politics until the early 1980s when one of its own - Pat Robertson - ran for president, said Andrew Chesnut, an expert on Brazil's Pentecostal boom. Up until then, American evangelicals saw the political arena as the devil's arena where even forthright Christians could be contaminated, said Chesnut, a professor of religious studies at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond. The view was that if they had critical mass they could elect their own people and that would inoculate them from the contagion of the political arena. That was the same in Brazil. Conversion Silva's rise could further boost political engagement among Brazilian evangelicals. Many, like Silva, are Afro-Brazilian women who come from a poor background. Silva came to the faith somewhat late in life. She was born to illiterate rubber-tappers in the Amazon rainforest and wanted to become a Catholic nun as an adolescent, before turning to environmental activism and a career in politics. Her conversion to Pentecostalism came in 1997 after her doctor said only a miracle would heal her fragile health,  wrecked by malaria, hepatitis and lead poisoning when she was a child on the rubber plantation. Silva has tried to strike a careful balance between pride in her faith and not alienating more secular-minded Brazilians. She said in an interview this month that the Bible is without a shadow of a doubt a source of inspiration, but immediately added that all of her decisions are taken on a rational basis. One campaign jingle celebrates the faith of every believer and the reason of every atheist. Last month, her Brazilian Socialist Party issued an official platform supporting gay marriage and making homophobia a crime but Silva quickly reversed the stance after Brazil's best-known televangelist, Silas Malafaia, threatened to withdraw his support for her. It was a costly embarrassment for Silva, losing her support among young and urban middle-class voters and fueling broader concerns that she flip-flops on major issues. Rousseff tried to capitalize, announcing after Silva's gaffe that she would push through legislation granting evangelical churches the same tax benefits as the Catholic Church. Analysts say many evangelical voters are still up for grabs. Brazil's poor depend on social programs introduced by the ruling Workers' Party, and could vote for Rousseff regardless of what their pastor may say. Rousseff has the backing of Brazil's second-largest evangelical church, the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God. Silva belongs to Assemblies of God, which has more members but is less well-organized. Rousseff even attended the opening last month of a 10,000-seat, 11-story Solomon's Temple built in Sao Paulo by the Universal Church's leader, Bishop Edir Macedo. A media magnate, Macedo has a fortune estimated by Forbes magazine at $1.24 billion. Macedo's PRB party backs Rousseff and even has a seat in her cabinet. But he exerts more influence with his ownership of the second largest television network, Rede Record. Bishop Robson Rodovalho, a physicist who founded a Pentecostal church in 1992 that now has more than 1 million followers and a TV channel, said he expects that Silva still has room to grow her support in coming weeks. Much of the Church will converge on her candidacy, he told Reuters before going on stage to preach to the sound of rock music in a darkened church hall lit with discotheque lights. Brazil is a real democracy. It's only a matter of time before we have an evangelical president. That's a fact.       (Editing by Brian Winter and Kieran Murray)"
"https://www.reuters.com/article/swissbank-wegelin-idUSL1E9C34IW20130103","UPDATE 3-Swiss bank Wegelin to close after guilty plea","","January 3, 2013 /  5:35 PM / 5 years ago","","* Oldest Swiss private bank pleads guilty to U.S. charge * Bank admits to conspiracy charge in U.S. federal court * Wegelin agrees to pay nearly $58 million to U.S. govt By Nate Raymond and Lynnley Browning NEW YORK, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Wegelin & Co, the oldest Swiss private bank, said Thursday it would shut its doors permanently after more than two and a half centuries following its guilty plea to charges of helping wealthy Americans evade taxes through secret accounts. The plea, in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, marks the death knell for one of Switzerland's most storied banks, whose original European clients pre-date the American Revolution. It is also a potentially major turning point in a battle by U.S. authorities against Swiss bank secrecy. A major question was left hanging by the plea: has the bank turned over, or does it plan to disclose, names of American clients to U.S. authorities? This is a key demand in a broad U.S. investigation of tax evasion through Swiss banks. It is unclear whether the bank was required to turn over American client names who held secret Swiss bank accounts, said Jeffrey Neiman, a former federal prosecutor involved in other Swiss bank investigations who is now in private law practice in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. What is clear is that the Justice Department is aggressively pursuing foreign banks who have helped Americans commit overseas tax evasion, he said. Charles Miller, a Justice Department spokesman, declined to comment immediately. Wegelin admitted to charges of conspiracy in helping Americans evade taxes on at least $1.2 billion for nearly a decade. Wegelin agreed to pay $57.8 million to the United States in restitution and fines. Otto Bruderer, a managing partner at the bank, said in court that Wegelin was aware that this conduct was wrong. Speaking in a thick Swiss-German accent, he said that from about 2002 through about 2010, Wegelin agreed with certain U.S. taxpayers to evade the U.S. tax obligations of these U.S. taxpayer clients, who filed false tax returns with the IRS. Initially Vowed to Resist When last February Wegelin became first foreign bank in recent memory to be indicted by U.S. authorities, it vowed to resist the charges. The bank, founded in 1741, was declared a fugitive from justice when its Swiss-based executives failed to appear in U.S. court. The surprise plea effectively ended the U.S. case against Wegelin, one of the most aggressive bank crackdowns in U.S. history. Once the matter is finally concluded, Wegelin will cease to operate as a bank, Wegelin said in a statement Thursday from its headquarters in the remote, small town of St. Gallen next to the Appenzell Alps near the German-Austrian border. But the fate of three Wegelin bankers, indicted in January 2012 on charges later modified to include the bank, remains up in the air. Under criminal procedural rules, the cases of the three bankers - Michael Berlinka, Urs Frei and Roger Keller - are still pending. Wegelin, a partnership of Swiss private bankers, was already a shadow of its former self - it effectively broke itself up following the indictment last year by selling the non-U.S. portion of its business. Dozens of Swiss bankers and their clients have been indicted in recent years, following a 2009 agreement by UBS AG, the largest Swiss bank, to enter into a deferred-prosecution agreement, turn over 4,450 client names and pay a $780 million fine after admitting to criminal wrongdoing in selling tax-evasion services to wealthy Americans. 'Wake-Up Call' William Sharp, a tax lawyer in Tampa, Florida, with many U.S. clients of Swiss banks, said Wegelin's plea should serve as a wake-up call to the world banking community servicing U.S. clients to takes steps to ensure compliance with U.S. law. Sharp called Wegelin's change of heart shocking. Banks under U.S. criminal investigation in the wider probe include Credit Suisse, which disclosed last July it had received a target letter saying it was under a grand jury investigation. Zurich-based Julius Baer and some cantonal, or regional, banks are also under scrutiny, sources familiar with the probes have previously told Reuters. So are UK-based HSBC Holdings  and three Israeli banks, Hapoalim, Mizrahi-Tefahot Bank Ltd and Bank Leumi, sources have also said previously. Those banks have not commented on the inquiries. In a statement after the plea, Assistant U.S. Attorney General Kathryn Keneally said it was a top Justice Department priority to find those who continue to shirk their tax obligations, as well as those who help them and profit from it. The best deal now for these folks is to come in and 'get right' with the IRS, before either the IRS or the Justice Department finds them, she said. Under its plea, Wegelin agreed to pay the $20 million in restitution to the IRS as well a civil forfeiture of $15.8 million, the U.S. Justice Department said. Wegelin also agreed to pay an additional $22.05 million fine, the Justice Department said. U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff, who must approve the monetary penalties, set a hearing in the case for March 4 for sentencing. Last year, the U.S. government separately seized more than $16 million of Wegelin funds in a UBS AG account in Stamford, Connecticut, via a civil forfeiture complaint. Because Wegelin has no branches outside Switzerland, it used UBS for correspondent banking services, a standard industry practice, to handle money for U.S.-based clients. In court papers, Bruderer said that Wegelin believed it would not be prosecuted in the United States for this conduct because it had no branches or offices in the United States and  because of its understanding that it acted in accordance with, and not in violation of, Swiss law and that such conduct was common in the Swiss banking industry. The case is U.S. v. Wegelin & Co et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 12-cr-00002."

Marina Silva, an environmentalist running neck and neck in polls with incumbent President Dilma Rousseff, is a Pentecostal Christian who often invokes God on the campaign trail and has said she sometimes consults the Bible for inspiration when making important political decisions. Some 65 percent of Brazil's 200 million people are Roman Catholics but evangelicals are rapidly gaining followers and power. They grew from 5 percent of the population in 1970 to more than 22 percent in 2010 and the trend has continued. Evangelical groups have made particular inroads among urban working Brazilians who benefited from economic prosperity over the last two decades and are now demanding a greater say in politics. Recent polls show evangelical voters would support Silva over Rousseff by a margin of about 54 percent to 38 percent if the two face each other in a runoff on Oct. 26, as most expect.  In a tight race, that could swing the result. The evangelicals' rise has drawn comparisons to the religious right that began to influence U.S. politics in the 1980s.  There are important differences - most Brazilians are politically well to the left of Americans, perhaps inevitably in a country with one of the world's biggest gaps between rich and poor. Silva and Rousseff both call themselves socialists and push for robust welfare programs. Infighting within evangelical groups has also limited their ability to create a unified bloc. Yet similarities with the religious right abound. Brazil's evangelical faithful have turned their opposition to gay marriage and abortion, which are both illegal here, into key national political issues. Funded by the tithes their followers are asked to pay, the more successful evangelical churches are increasingly turning their newfound wealth into political influence.  They have bought up radio and television stations across Brazil and financed campaigns to elect evangelical candidates, including many pastors, to seats in Congress. The evangelical caucus in Congress showed its muscle in May by forcing Rousseff to revoke authorization for public health service abortions in exceptional cases of pregnancies caused by rape and of fetuses with brain defects. For the first time in a Brazilian election, there are two evangelical candidates running for president. Silva has eclipsed the second hopeful, Pastor Everaldo, although he has made his mark in debates by accusing Rousseff's government of trampling on family values and seeking to legalize abortion. Under evangelical pressure, Silva has changed her party's position on gay rights. And Rousseff, a Catholic who has rarely used faith in her political career, is now presenting herself as a good Christian. Happy is the nation whose God is the Lord, she quoted from Psalms at one campaign stop. The evangelical vote will be decisive in this election, said Rodrigo Delmasso, a pastor of a Brasilia-based Pentecostal church, who is running for a seat in the city's legislature.

Not even close - Nina Krushcheva","","June 28, 2013 /  4:50 PM / 4 years ago","","(Nina Khrushcheva is a Reuters columnist but her opinions are her own.) By Nina Khrushcheva NEW YORK, June 28 (Reuters) - When the Guardian and the Washington Post revealed details about the U.S. National Security Agency collecting phone data from telecommunications companies and government programs pulling in emails and photographs from internet businesses, suddenly George Orwell was leading the news. The British essayist predicted it all, commentators asserted, and the United States now seems straight out of 1984, Orwell's novel about a dystopian future. Big Brother had arrived. This is ridiculous. Former NSA contractor Edward Snowden might claim that America is under the Big Brother's glare, but he does not understand what this really means. I grew up in the Soviet Union. I knew Big Brother. This is not even close. In 1982, for example, when I was in high school in Moscow, I was on the phone with one of my closest friends, talking about how relieved we were that Leonid Brezhnev had finally died, after 18 years of stifling power. Suddenly, there was a metallic click on the line and we heard a dour man's voice. A KGB functionary, no doubt. Hang up the phone, he demanded, immediately. We did. I dare anyone to tell me that this has happened to you in the United States. Both supporters and critics of this sweeping NSA surveillance are passionate in their arguments. Advocates insist that the NSA's metadata gathering is a legitimate use of state power, because all three branches of government have signed off on the program, and it keeps the country safe. Critics assert this is what Big Brother is all about, manipulating the rule of law for the benefit of the few at the top. Their spying doesn't protect the nation but helps maintain their grip on power. But when Orwell wrote his novel in 1948, he was not warning against the NSA which was actually created four years later in order to break enemy codes in defense of American values of freedom. Orwell's Big Brother, in the nation of Oceania in 1984, was about Nazi Germany's Gestapo or Joseph Stalin's NKVD (precursor to the KGB), dictatorial outfits that surrender to the views of just one man. Under those despotic regimes, the public was manipulated and harsh punishments against thoughtcrime and free will were rationalized as necessary for public good. In the Soviet Union, writers were sent to the gulag for the critical thoughts of their fictional characters. At school, we had to start every paper praising the Communist Party. If you began with your own thoughts, you were guaranteed an F - no college, no job, no nothing. Beat that! Only those who read Orwell, but have never lived in the world he portrayed, could view President Barack Obama's justifications - that data gathering is necessary to identify potential leads of people who might engage in terrorism - as a standard government trick to deflate fears about violations of Americans' privacy rights. In fact, the recent Senate hearings about Internet surveillance and the White House's explanation that nobody is listening to your telephone calls demonstrate efforts for transparency that no dictatorial regime would ever make. Obama has said that he welcomes debates about the balance between spying and security. In my early life in the Soviet Union, any conversation critical of the state had to be held on a balcony or in a cramped bathroom with the water running. To most Americans, it would have looked as if we were enacting a scene from a John le Carré novel. Even thinking about my privacy rights was an Orwellian thoughtcrime. The American public is prudent to ask questions about the NSA program. Not in vain, President Ronald Reagan used to warn his Cold War rival about the need to trust but verify. Yet comparing the United States to dystopian Oceania only shows how lucky today's democracies are. They can debate about Big Brother who then has to explain himself to citizens. Obama is the first U.S. president to publicly admit his government is overseeing the electronic life of its citizens. Even this concession riled his constant bête noire, former Vice President Dick Cheney. In a recent interview on Fox News, Cheney, his newly transplanted heart as hardened as ever, insisted that leadership decisions should never be explained and that Obama is wrong to justify the NSA program because it would only harm the cause. The public is warned but so is the enemy. So, Cheney's reasoning would seem to suggest, who cares about the public? It was under President George W. Bush, and Cheney, that the United States began to copy - in form, if not in substance - aspects of Soviet behavior, such as deploying Orwellian newspeak to validate preventative wars. Cheney resolutely insisted in 2005 that waterboarding is not torture but a good program because it was used against the enemies of the people. In 2006, he firmly denied that the government was spying on Americans on U.S. soil, saying there was no domestic surveillance program. Not that the Obama administration has been fully open on this issue. When National Intelligence Director James Clapper testified about NSA data collection at a March 2011 Senate Intelligence Committee hearing, he said it was, Not wittingly. Still, few leaders in a democracy reject the public's right to question them. This was not the prevailing attitude I experienced growing up in propaganda-saturated Moscow. I know these dictatorial ways in my bones, more so than most Soviets, since Nikita S. Khrushchev, the Soviet premier who succeeded Stalin and preceded Brezhnev, was my great-grandfather. Generations of Soviet rulers, Khrushchev included, had systemized propaganda into a central element of the state. Their pompous posters and statues were a costume of a totalitarian society where all decisions were handed top-down and the silent public was excluded from any participation in the political process. The closest thing I ever experienced to that here in the United States was Cheney's post-September 11 talk of overwhelming facts in pressing for an implausible connection between al Qaeda and Saddam Hussein. It was a blast from the Brezhnev-era past. For it was eerily familiar to Orwell's 1984 slogan, War is Peace, Freedom Slavery, Ignorance Strength. In addition, when information was proven false, as it was with the pretense to invade Iraq in 2003, there was no regret or remorse on the part of the all-knowing leader. Cheney was a marvel of democracy, a black orchid, whose autocratic behavior was fit for a marble statue, even of a city or state dedication - Cheinograd, Cheinistan. In another country - Oceania, the Soviet Union or even the current Russia, where elections look like just a scheme to prolong Vladimir Putin's presidency - someone like Cheney would have stayed on beyond his constitutional term, stifling public debate and insisting on government's supremacy. A hypothetical scenario, but worthy of consideration, particularly for Snowden in his quest for the truth. He fled the United States, a country with functional, if imperfect, checks and balances, for places - China, Russia, Ecuador - that unabashedly observe a one-man rule, hamper freedom of speech and ignore government accountability. Take it from a former Soviet: secret defense programs don't necessarily violate privacy or rights, and the capabilities to spy are always there in any country and at any time. It's their application and the people's ability to separate democracy from dictatorship that makes all the difference.

Silva came to the faith somewhat late in life. She was born to illiterate rubber-tappers in the Amazon rainforest and wanted to become a Catholic nun as an adolescent, before turning to environmental activism and a career in politics. Her conversion to Pentecostalism came in 1997 after her doctor said only a miracle would heal her fragile health,  wrecked by malaria, hepatitis and lead poisoning when she was a child on the rubber plantation. Silva has tried to strike a careful balance between pride in her faith and not alienating more secular-minded Brazilians. She said in an interview this month that the Bible is without a shadow of a doubt a source of inspiration, but immediately added that all of her decisions are taken on a rational basis. One campaign jingle celebrates the faith of every believer and the reason of every atheist. Last month, her Brazilian Socialist Party issued an official platform supporting gay marriage and making homophobia a crime but Silva quickly reversed the stance after Brazil's best-known televangelist, Silas Malafaia, threatened to withdraw his support for her. It was a costly embarrassment for Silva, losing her support among young and urban middle-class voters and fueling broader concerns that she flip-flops on major issues. Rousseff tried to capitalize, announcing after Silva's gaffe that she would push through legislation granting evangelical churches the same tax benefits as the Catholic Church. Analysts say many evangelical voters are still up for grabs. Brazil's poor depend on social programs introduced by the ruling Workers' Party, and could vote for Rousseff regardless of what their pastor may say. Rousseff has the backing of Brazil's second-largest evangelical church, the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God. Silva belongs to Assemblies of God, which has more members but is less well-organized. Rousseff even attended the opening last month of a 10,000-seat, 11-story Solomon's Temple built in Sao Paulo by the Universal Church's leader, Bishop Edir Macedo. A media magnate, Macedo has a fortune estimated by Forbes magazine at $1.24 billion. Macedo's PRB party backs Rousseff and even has a seat in her cabinet. But he exerts more influence with his ownership of the second largest television network, Rede Record. Bishop Robson Rodovalho, a physicist who founded a Pentecostal church in 1992 that now has more than 1 million followers and a TV channel, said he expects that Silva still has room to grow her support in coming weeks. Much of the Church will converge on her candidacy, he told Reuters before going on stage to preach to the sound of rock music in a darkened church hall lit with discotheque lights. Brazil is a real democracy. It's only a matter of time before we have an evangelical president. That's a fact.       (Editing by Brian Winter and Kieran Murray)"

The third-largest U.S. bank overhauled compensation practices in its branches in January following a scandal tied to a pay scheme that rewarded employees who sold multiple products to the same customer and punished those who did not. As a result of that system, low level employees created as many as 2.1 million accounts without customer authorization. The new compensation system rewards teams rather than individuals in many cases, and is based on whether customers actually use the products they are sold. Wells Fargo's shares have rebounded from the sharp drop suffered in the wake of the sales scandal boosted by growth expectations after the election of U.S. President Donald Trump. However, they are still down 1.85 percent so far this year, underperforming a 4.26 percent increase in the S&P; financial index .SPSY over the same period. Mack also discussed the bank's work to reduce the number of branches in its network, something it was slower to do than rivals such as Bank of America Corp (BAC.N).

Poland's Alior Bank in December pulled out of exclusive talks to buy Raiffeisen Bank Polska IPO-RBP.WA, after which Raiffeisen said it would hold onto the bank while also floating 15 percent on the Warsaw bourse, as required by Poland. The Polish government has been pushing to reduce foreign ownership of the country's banks to gain more control over the economy. In December, for example, Italian bank UniCredit agreed to sell a stake in Polish bank Pekao to Polish insurer PZU and development fund PFR. Outlining its restructuring plans, Raiffeisen said in a statement it planned to close 60-70 branches in Poland by 2018 as well as launch cost-saving initiatives of around 50 million euros ($53 million) and cut 850-950 full-time equivalent (FTE) jobs by the end of 2019, it said in a statement. The Polish business, which is also known as Polbank, had 4,242 employees and 299 branches at the end of last year. Based on those figures, the layoffs represent roughly 20-22 percent of the workforce, and at least a fifth of branches will close. Up to 90 branches will be converted to cost-efficient formats by the end of 2019, the company said. A spokeswoman said that mainly meant being downsized. The project's restructuring costs were estimated at 10 million euros and would be booked in the first half of this year, the company added.

The decision to close the banks and impose capital controls from Monday was difficult, yet re-opening them and finding a way to lift the measures could prove even tougher, experts warned. Creditors said the door to negotiations remained open despite the government's decision to break off talks and put their latest cash-for-reforms offer to a referendum next Sunday, but that a no vote would signal an exit from the euro. In the best case scenario they manage the bank holiday, find a way to reopen the banks, stabilise the system like Cyprus, and deal with the fallout of higher NPLs (non-performing loans) and liquidity crunch. You find a path through, said a restructuring industry source who was not allowed to speak publicly. But the risk is you effectively have a state bankruptcy, and the banking system going bankrupt as well, he added. A Greek bank industry source concurred: Under a bad scenario we are in uncharted waters, (it) could end up with ruins, nationalised banks, he said. Greece said on Sunday it was closing banks all this week and capping withdrawals from ATMs at 60 euro a day to stem the outflow of cash from banks, from which about 40 billion euros  ($44.7 billion) of savings have flooded out this year, or a quarter of deposits. As the prospects for a deal receded, the European Central Bank (ECB) began refusing Greece's requests to raise the amount of emergency cash it is giving Greek banks, although the ECB is expected to let them keep using existing funds until the referendum, people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters. Greece is not the first European country to impose capital controls since the 2007/09 financial crisis, and Iceland and neighbor Cyprus showed such controls are rarely short-term. Cyprus closed its banks for two weeks in spring 2013 and limited withdrawals. Controls remained in place for two years, but the country was praised for stabilising its financial system and preventing a long, deep recession. Iceland imposed controls in 2008 after the collapse of its banks, and only this month started to ease restrictions. Things Move Quickly... On Monday, most retail staff were not working in branches, but all other bank employees were at work, and so were staff responsible for replenishing ATMs. Closing banks and restricting the flow of capital can build pressure for a solution as finances get squeezed. Once you start the closing of the banking system, things move quickly because every day you keep it closed you are aware of the consequences of doing so, the restructuring source said. It's easier to close the banks than it is to reopen them. You need a very clear plan for what's going to happen next when you reopen them, he said. The liquidity position of Greece's banks and the strength of their balance sheets are crucial to how severe and lengthy  capital controls will be. Greek banks are relying on 89 billion euros of emergency liquidity assistance (ELA) authorised by the ECB, but they are estimated to be near to using that capacity. While Greek authorities need to limit outflows, they also need to avoid crippling cash flow in the economy or squeezing the population too hard. Planning how far to go and how to re-open banks next week is also made near impossible by uncertainty about whether the ECB will extend liquidity, the threat Sunday's referendum may lead to Grexit, or the potential for another spell of political limbo following the referendum. A week of harsh controls might be enough to jolt the Greek people into reality over the dangers of not reworking a deal with public sector creditors, a second restructuring industry source said. While solving banks' liquidity position is most urgent, their solvency will need speedy attention, analysts said. Greek banks' core capital ratios (excluding tax credits) are all below 9 percent - the level investors typically want as a minimum - and range from just 4.9 percent at Eurobank  to 8.3 percent for Alpha Bank, Citigroup analyst Ronit Ghose estimated. And as the economy struggles, losses from bad loans and sovereign bonds could build. Recapitalization risks are high, Ghose said. In the event ELA funding is stopped, banks could be nationalised and carved into new banks alongside a multi-year workout of Greece's finances and economy, analysts and restructuring sources said. Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras is likely to be well aware of the political risks of capital control moves. When Argentina froze access to bank deposits in December 2001, for example, the popular backlash was so severe its president and his successor had resigned within a month.

The White House and transportation leaders have warned for weeks that the $85 billion in federal cuts known as sequestration would force smaller airports across the country to curtail operations. The across-the-board cuts started kicking in on March 1 because Congress was not able to reach an alternative budget deal to replace them. The FAA must absorb $637 million in cuts by Sept. 30. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said on Friday his department had tried to soften the blow. The FAA said another 40 towers previously slated for closure will remain open, either because them shutting them would not be in the national interest or because money was found in a federal cost-sharing program to keep them open. We heard from communities across the country about the importance of their towers and these were very tough decisions, LaHood said in a statement. Unfortunately we are faced with a series of difficult choices that we have to make to reach the required cuts under sequestration, LaHood said. The FAA does not expect any airports to have to shut down because of the tower closings, an agency spokeswoman said. Republican lawmakers expressed concern about the decision and asked LaHood in a letter for the analysis showing that closing each tower, as well as so many towers simultaneously, would not jeopardize safety. Republicans have repeatedly accused the White House of exaggerating the effects of sequestration in an attempt to shift the blame for a failed budget deal to Republicans. We are deeply disappointed by the Administration's choice today to push ahead with its proposed contract tower closings and are concerned about potential impacts on aviation safety, said House of Representatives Transportation Committee Chairman Bill Shuster and Senator John Thune, the top Republican on the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee. Corporate Jets, Private Planes FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said the agency would work with affected airports and operators to ensure procedures are in place to maintain a high level of safety. Though the control tower is often the first thing passengers on commercial flights see on landing, most of the country's 5,000 publicly used airports don't have them. In addition to the 292 operated by the FAA, another 251 are staffed by three private companies: Midwest Air Traffic Control Service, Robinson Aviation (RVA) Inc and Serco Inc, in a public-private program called the FAA Contract Tower Program (FCT). The FAA said it would phase in the closures over four weeks, and will work with communities that decide to participate in the agency's non-federal tower program and assume the cost of continued on-site air traffic control services at their airport. The targeted towers all have fewer than 150,000 takeoffs and landings or 10,000 commercial flights a year. They cater to corporate jets and individuals with private planes. Many also house flight schools, serve as hubs for smaller airlines, or provide relief capacity for larger airports nearby. The FAA said on Friday it had decided to keep 24 of the towers open because closing them would have a negative impact on the national interest. It made those decision based on a number of factors, including national security, the expected impact on the local community and whether the airport served by the tower is a critical diversionary airport for a large hub. Another 16 towers under a cost-share program were spared because the required 5 percent cut to that portion of the budget did not require them to be closed. The 149 towers to be closed are spread over three dozen states in cities including Tuscaloosa, Alabama; New Smyrna Beach, Florida; Battle Creek, Michigan; Branson, Missouri; Atlanta, Georgia; and Olive Branch, Mississippi. Florida, Texas, California, Oklahoma, Wisconsin and Washington were among the states with the most closings. Here is a link to the FAA's list of the towers to be closed:"

The valuations of U.S. regional banks have soared following  Trump's victory in the Nov. 8 election, supported by the prospect of higher interest rates, softer banking regulation and a lower corporate tax rate. Royal Bank of Canada (RY.TO) Chief Executive Dave McKay expects the bank to benefit from changes made by the incoming president, he said at the RBC 2017 Canadian Bank CEO conference. We do see a stronger growth agenda in the United States, we do anticipate pro-growth policy coming out of the new administration, he said. That would potentially lead to higher rates which is very good for our franchise in the United States. Canada's largest banks want to expand in the United States to offset sluggish growth in their domestic market. Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD.TO) CEO Bharat Masrani said the bank would look at acquisition opportunities in the U.S. Southeast or expanding its credit card business in the United States.  We are organically growing right through our franchise but I would like to see more in the southeast of the U.S. because I think there's more opportunity there, he said. TD, Canada's second-biggest bank, has grown to become one of the 10 biggest banks in the United States, where it has a major retail presence serving 9 million people through 1,300 branches. RBC has said it plans to expand further in the United States following its $5 billion acquisition of Los Angeles-based City National in 2015. Bank of Montreal CEO Bill Downe said he also expected to see an acceleration in growth in the United States. Clearly, the new administration is leaning toward more fiscal stimulus than was present. The reliance on monetary stimulus is ebbing away. Both of those things are good for our clients in the business that they do, Downe said. Canadian banks are also closing branches in response to customers visiting them less frequently and investing more in digital technology.  Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS.TO) CEO Brian Porter said the bank planned to close around 5 percent of its network of just over 1,000 branches over the next two years.  CIBC (CM.TO) will cut branch numbers to above 1,000 by 2019 from 1,100, CEO Victor Dodig said.    Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe and Meredith Mazzilli"

The iTraxx investment grade index series 17 is trading at 149bp/151bp, slightly wider than the morning levels after Europe opened on a weaker footing amid caution after markets rose to 4-month highs. But the China high yield sector was rattled by yet another report making allegations of fraud as investors were reminded about corporate governance issues in China, with West China Cement's tumble having a ripple effect on the rest. The market is trading by rotation, looking for value, laggards, that's whats driving trade, said a Singapore-based dealer. Indian banking paper continued to grind tighter even as markets awaited supplied from the sector following the successful taps by State Bank of India and Exim Bank. Both the bonds have rallied sharply - EXIM 2017s are trading at 320bp/310bp after being priced at 355bp, with the rally also boosted by its EMBI inclusion. State Bank of India 2017 is trading at 336bp/330bp, much tighter than reoffer 375bp. IDBI Bank's existing 2016s were trading at 365bp/355bp, unfazed by the prospects of additional supplies as the institution plans investor meetings next week via DBS, HSBC and Standard Chartered. Reuters reported that the bank is eyeing a Singapore dollar offering. ICICI's 2016s are trading at 395bp/375bp extending a rally in the belly of the curve after investors sold that maturity in anticipation of a supply glut. The bonds were trading around 415bp a week ago. South Korean bonds were also firm as local investors put money to work. That has squeezed the spread on the new Indsutrial bank of Korea to 167bp and on the 2017s of Korea Development Bank to 170bp/165bp. KDB sold its bond in February at 175bp over US Treasuries and IBK at 185bp over last month. Traders don't expect IBK to continue trading tighter than KDB for long as the government's lower 76% stake in IBK versus the full ownership status of KDB should be reflected in the spreads. Sinopec's bonds due 2022, tapped this week, were trading inside its reoffer at 142/139. The bonds were sold at 145bp above and there was little reaction to this afternoon's upgrade by Fitch to A+. The upgrade follows a review of Sinopec's strategic and operational ties with the Chinese government as well as of the tangible support it has received from the sovereign, the agency said in a statement. This has led Fitch to now equalise Sinopec's ratings with that of China it said while raising the rating to A+ from A. The rating is now at par with S&P.; Standard Chartered Bank bonds remained under pressure following allegations by a US regulator that the bank made improper transactions with Iran. The lower tier 2 bonds due 2020 issued by its HK branch is quoted at 300bp over US Treasuries, wide to yesterday's 280bp-300bp range and much wider than recent levels of 260bp-270bp. The jump came after New York's top banking regulator threatened to strip StanChart of its state banking license amid an investigation of financial transactions tied to Iran. For a graphic showing the spike in StanChart yields please click on r.reuters.com/wyk89s The high yield sector saw some repurcussion from allegations made by US-based Glaucus Research Group against West China Cement. WCC's bonds due 2016 traded as low as 81/82, its lowest in nearly a year, before rebounding to around 86, still down about 4-5 points on the day as markets awaited a response from the company. The report accuses WCC of, among other things, misrepresenting its margins and also triggered some selling in Shanshui Cement 2017s which is trading half a point lower at 103.5/104.5. The allegations comes at a point when investors are returning to buy into Chinese industrial credits, much of the sector having been smashed by corporate governance risks highlighted by various parties in recent years, and as the primary market for the sector tries to reopen. But Sound Global, which became the first debut high yield bond issuer from China this year, saw its bonds trading slightly above reoffer at 99.7/99.8. umesh.desai@thomsonreuters.com"

"https://www.reuters.com/article/safrica-rand-rigging-idUSL5N1H86GM","Banks raise objections in South Africa's FX rigging case- sources","","April 6, 2017 /  3:23 PM / 4 months ago","","* Banks say watchdog charges lack detail- sources * Watchdog's jurisdiction over case challenged - sources By Tiisetso Motsoeneng JOHANNESBURG, April 6 (Reuters) - Some of the banks South African regulators have alleged rigged the rand currency say the case against them lacks specific detail about anti-competitive conduct and its impact, three sources with direct knowledge of the matter said. The banks have also questioned whether the country's Competition Commission can penalise banks which do not have subsidiaries or branches in South Africa, the sources said. The Competition Commission is seeking to impose fines on more than a dozen local and foreign banks that it alleges colluded to coordinate trading in the rand and the U.S. dollar. The Commission launched the investigation in April 2015, joining a global clampdown that has led to big banks being fined around $10 billion in total for rigging interest rate and forex benchmarks. It referred the case to the Competition Tribunal, which holds hearings on anti-trust matters before making a ruling. The Commission has recommended that the Tribunal impose fines amounting to 10 percent of the banks' South African revenues, the maximum allowed. At a closed preliminary Tribunal hearing in March, some of the banks raised objections about the lack of specific detail in the case to allow their lawyers to present a defence, one of the sources said. The Tribunal will meet again in July to consider the banks' objections if the Commission has done enough to fine-tune its case, the sources said. The Competition Commission did not immediately respond to a Reuters' request to comment. Under South African regulations, the Commission is required to investigate anti-competitive cases within South Africa, or those that have an impact in the country. If there was an anti-competitive conduct, as the Commission alleges, the question then is: did it have an effect in South Africa? That's one jurisdictional issue the banks have raised, another source said. Another issue raised was how banks with no subsidiaries or branches in South Africa would be affected. Some of the banks want jurisdictional issues to be cleared up because some of the them named have no branches in South Africa, one source said. How do you calculate a fine for banks with no branches in South Africa? Australia's ANZ Banking Group has no branches in South Africa. Nomura only launched a branch in South Africa in April last year, almost a year into the Commission's investigation. Among the banks, Barclays Africa Group, a regional unit of Barclays Plc, has been granted conditional immunity from prosecution in return for its cooperation in the investigation. In February, the local arm of Citigroup was fined $5 million for its role in the affair. The Commission said it had set the fine for Citi Bank NA South Africa at less than 10 percent of its annual turnover after the bank undertook to cooperate with the Commission. Other banks named in the investigation were Standard Bank , Investec, JP Morgan, BNP Paribas , Credit Suisse Group, Commerzbank AG , Macquarie Bank, Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAML), HSBC Plc and Standard Chartered Plc. Standard Bank, South Africa's second biggest bank by market value, said its own internal investigation had found no evidence of any wrongdoing. Nonetheless, Standard Bank is treating these allegations very seriously and will engage fully with the Competition Commission and the Competition Tribunal to better understand the basis for the complaints, spokesman Erik Larsen said.

Ber, the Supervisor of Banks who a year ago ordered banks to become more efficient, said about 5,100 jobs will be cut from Israel's largest banks over the next five years, or a net 10 percent of the total workforce. At the same time, 200 bank branches -- 20 percent -- will be closed or merged, she told the Globes business conference. Banks in Israel compared to the rest of the world are not efficient, Ber said, noting that Israeli banks' expenses stand at 69.4 percent, versus 63.8 percent for the OECD group of wealthy nations. Banks need to adapt to a new world. That, she said, includes a move to digital branches and services where customers can bank by phone apps and the internet, which would lower fees and overall costs. Israelis have long complained about banks charging too many fees, including for making deposits and withdrawing money from their own accounts. To encourage banks to become more efficient and offer early retirement plans, Ber offered to allow higher dividend payouts, the spreading of the cost of the streamlining steps and an ability to implement them without negatively affecting banks' abilities to meet capital adequacy requirements. Israel's largest bank, Hapoalim, said in October that 1,500 workers will take early retirement from 2017-2020 at a cost of 1.2 billion shekels, in addition to 300 workers expected to leave the bank voluntarily in 2016. Leumi, Israel's second-largest bank, plans for about 700 workers to retire early this year as part of a multi-year efficiency.

Popular, the bank with the biggest exposure to Spain's troubled real estate sector that is publicly listed, announced a cost-cutting plan in July a month after raising 2.5 billion euros ($2.8 billion) in a share issue to clean up its balance sheet. Spain's sixth-biggest bank expects the plan to save it around 175 million euros ($194 million) annually from 2017. The bank said in a filing to the stock market regulator it would consult with unions over the 2,900 to 3,000 staff who would be affected. Other Spanish banks such as Santander and Caixabank  in recent months have also announced staff cuts and branch closures as record low interest rates bite into margins and increased domestic competition encourages efficiency gains. Even after cutting around a quarter of staff and shutting a third of outlets since the height of the crisis in 2009 to December 2015, many lenders still have larger than average networks as Spain is among the European countries with the most bank branches per head of population. Banking executives contacted by Reuters expect lenders to cut staff and branches by an additional 15 to 25 percent in the next two years. Like peers worldwide, Spanish lenders are also trying to cope with a shift to online and mobile-based business, as well as with the rising costs of meeting tougher regulatory demands. Popular's toxic property assets have hampered its attempts to recover from the crisis. It reported in July just 122,000 euros of second-quarter net profit and has announced provisions on bad loans of 4.7 billion euros, which it said could lead to overall losses of 2 billion euros in 2016. Caixabank has said it would lay off 500 workers in Spain this year and would close 600 branches by 2018. Santander plans to lay off more than 1,000 employees in Spain and close around 450 small branches. BBVA also wants to run the bank more efficiently betting on a digital banking model and has left the door to branch cuts.

Over the next year, the state-controlled lender is giving early retirement to employees, many of which have over 15 years of service, closing 402 branches, and reformulating the size of another 379. The bank estimates the branch reduction plan could save as much as 750 million reais annually. Shares soared the most in almost eight months on optimism about Caffarelli's steps to cut the size of a payroll which, in some areas, is three times the size of private-sector peers. The early retirement plan could trim the bank's payroll by 17 percent, fan profitability and enhance Banco do Brasil's ability to generate capital organically, he said. No other big Brazilian bank can improve their general and administrative expense structure to the same magnitude, said analyst Henrique Navarro of Santander Investment Securities. This may help Banco do Brasil close the return-on-equity gap with rivals. Goldman Sachs expects the plan to boost profit by up to 10 percent within two years.

The bank aims to increase the number of clients in northern Europe, including Germany, the United Kingdom and Scandinavia, and expects to add 350 new customer groups by 2020, it said at an investor day in Paris. It fleshed out to investors its longer-term strategy, announced in February, which will include continuing to close retail branches and reducing headcount through natural attrition. Yann Gerardin, head of corporate and institutional banking, said clients were worried about European banks' commitment to investment banking operations but BNP planned to continue competing in a wide range of activities. In terms of retrenching of some of our competitors, we have an opportunity to attract even more clients, he said. European investment banks have lost market share in recent years to their U.S. rivals, with Wall Street firms taking the top three spots for investment banking fees in Europe in 2016. However, BNP has performed better than some of its regional peers, and its investment banking arm, CIB, earned more fees than both Deutsche Bank and Barclays in Europe last year, according to Thomson Reuters data. The future of CIB ... is also going to be a war on costs, the more efficient we are, the more likely we are to compete with the best American competitors, Gerardin said. The bank in February announced plans to spend 3 billion euros ($3.2 billion) from 2017-2020 to boost profitability, including investing in digital technologies to boost cost savings. BNP Paribas trade union FO said on Monday that the bank planned to close 200 retail branches in France and reduce staff in its retail branch networks by 2 to 4 percent over two years. BNP declined to comment on the numbers, but the investor day presentation said a headcount reduction in France would come through natural turnover. The bank reiterated its targets to boost dividend payouts and increase its return on equity to 10 percent from 9.4 percent. It said its domestic markets, such as France and Italy, would eke out 0.5 percent revenue growth annually from 2017 till end-2020. However, it signalled that its revenue targets were based on prudent macro assumptions taken a few months ago and that the recent steepening of the yield curve could provide some upside in the future. Like other French banks, BNP Paribas faces a weak domestic retail market and is looking at a year of political uncertainty, with presidential elections looming and far-right leader Marine Le Pen - who has advocated a retreat from the euro currency - performing strongly in polls. Shares in BNP Paribas fell 0.3 percent to 60.1 euros by 1555 GMT, against a little changed broader market. They are on a defensive side in terms of ambitions, it is a business development plan that targets operational efficiency, first of all, as the previous one did, Gildas Surry, a senior analyst at Axiom Alternative Investments.

In recent years, with U.S.-Russia ties increasingly frosty, the fast food chain has pursued a different strategy: go native. We say it every time: we are a Russian company, Khamzat Khasbulatov, the head of McDonald's Russia, told Reuters. I don't think there's a single company that can call itself more Russian than us. Nearly all the restaurant's suppliers are Russian and its executives are all Russian, Khasbulatov said in an interview. The familiar McDonald's logo outside the restaurants is all in Russia's Cyrillic script.  As for the golden arches, he said: They are Russian arches. They shine wherever they are. The company has reason to play down its U.S. associations. After Washington imposed sanctions on Russia over its role in Ukraine in 2014, Russia's public health watchdog briefly closed down dozens of McDonald's outlets, including its original Moscow flagship in Pushkin Square, citing hygiene concerns. Some Russian politicians called for the chain to be shut down completely. Khamzat Khasbulatov, head of McDonald's Russia, reacts during a news conference in Moscow, Russia, January 31, 2017. Picture taken January 31, 2017.Sergei KarpukhinKhasbulatov acknowledged the link with the United States was sensitive. We don't want to be drawn in when something's going on, he said. A wholly-owned unit of the firm headquartered in Oak Brook, Illinois, McDonald's Russia has 609 restaurants around the country and plans to add at least 50 more in 2017 after expanding last year to the far-flung Urals and Siberia. McDonald's does not disclose its Russian unit's profit numbers but counted it among high growth markets in its 2015 annual report, with high expansion and franchising potential. Its Pushkin Square branch is one of the busiest in the world.   Khasbulatov said he hopes to increase the share of franchised branches, which currently account for only 15 percent of outlets in Russia compared to the global McDonald's norm of 80 percent. Khasbulatov declined to comment on what the future holds for McDonald's Russia now that Donald Trump is U.S. president. Russian President Vladimir Putin has spoken about Trump in warm terms and Trump has said he wants the relationship to improve. McDonald's has to be pragmatic, said Bob Goldin, a partner at Pentallect, a Chicago, Illinois-based food industry consulting firm.  My sense is they have to play a real balancing act, he said in an email. For customers, politics didn't seem to be that big a deal, however.  It's irrelevant, Vadim Ashiman, 22, told a Reuters reporter at one branch near the Kremlin in Moscow. It's food. Food isn't to blame for political differences.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/mcdonalds-russia-idUSL5N1FL4BE","In Russia, McDonald's 'golden arches' have a Russian shine","","February 2, 2017 /  2:49 PM / 6 months ago","","MOSCOW (Reuters) - When McDonald's opened its first Russian restaurant in 1990 in Moscow, it was not unusual to see wedding receptions held there, so strong was the appeal of the quintessential American brand at the end of the Cold War. In recent years, with U.S.-Russia ties increasingly frosty, the fast food chain has pursued a different strategy: go native. We say it every time: we are a Russian company, Khamzat Khasbulatov, the head of McDonald's Russia, told Reuters. I don't think there's a single company that can call itself more Russian than us. Nearly all the restaurant's suppliers are Russian and its executives are all Russian, Khasbulatov said in an interview. The familiar McDonald's logo outside the restaurants is all in Russia's Cyrillic script.  As for the golden arches, he said: They are Russian arches. They shine wherever they are. The company has reason to play down its U.S. associations. After Washington imposed sanctions on Russia over its role in Ukraine in 2014, Russia's public health watchdog briefly closed down dozens of McDonald's outlets, including its original Moscow flagship in Pushkin Square, citing hygiene concerns. Some Russian politicians called for the chain to be shut down completely. Khamzat Khasbulatov, head of McDonald's Russia, reacts during a news conference in Moscow, Russia, January 31, 2017. Picture taken January 31, 2017.Sergei KarpukhinKhasbulatov acknowledged the link with the United States was sensitive. We don't want to be drawn in when something's going on, he said. A wholly-owned unit of the firm headquartered in Oak Brook, Illinois, McDonald's Russia has 609 restaurants around the country and plans to add at least 50 more in 2017 after expanding last year to the far-flung Urals and Siberia. McDonald's does not disclose its Russian unit's profit numbers but counted it among high growth markets in its 2015 annual report, with high expansion and franchising potential. Its Pushkin Square branch is one of the busiest in the world.   Khasbulatov said he hopes to increase the share of franchised branches, which currently account for only 15 percent of outlets in Russia compared to the global McDonald's norm of 80 percent. Khasbulatov declined to comment on what the future holds for McDonald's Russia now that Donald Trump is U.S. president. Russian President Vladimir Putin has spoken about Trump in warm terms and Trump has said he wants the relationship to improve. McDonald's has to be pragmatic, said Bob Goldin, a partner at Pentallect, a Chicago, Illinois-based food industry consulting firm.  My sense is they have to play a real balancing act, he said in an email. For customers, politics didn't seem to be that big a deal, however.  It's irrelevant, Vadim Ashiman, 22, told a Reuters reporter at one branch near the Kremlin in Moscow. It's food. Food isn't to blame for political differences.

Riyadh is already planning to sell about 5 percent of state-owned Saudi Aramco through an initial public offer (IPO) of shares in 2018 that could value the oil giant at $2 trillion, with proceeds used to develop other industries. One of the plans is to have an investment licence company, QNB Group Chief Executive Officer Ali Ahmed al-Kuwari told reporters while inaugurating a branch in Riyadh offering retail and corporate banking services. QNB Capital is one of the biggest in the region in terms of equity and debt capital market advisory as well as structuring advisory, he said, adding that QNB would seek a licence from Saudi Arabia's Capital Market Authority. Other foreign banks are also chasing business in the kingdom. Citigroup secured a licence last month for capital markets work, marking the U.S. bank's return to Saudi Arabia after an absence of almost 13 years. Credit Suisse is also considering whether to obtain banking licences. QNB planned to build its investment banking business through its branch network in Saudi Arabia rather than via acquisitions, al-Kuwari said. The chief executive said QNB had no immediate plans to raise further capital. We don't need it now but when we are close to the requirement we have a commitment from the shareholders to inject capital if needed, he said. QNB's capital adequacy ratio stood at 15.7 percent at the end of March, compared to the minimum required by Qatar's central bank of 14.8 percent. Editing by Jason Neely and Edmund Blair"

French banks in general have been closing down retail branches and cutting staff, while investing more in the faster-growing online banking sector. The objective of this reorganisation is to reduce the number of decision-making chains and to concentrate decision-making powers closer to the needs of the customers, said a BNP Paribas spokesman on Thursday, following a report on the plan by French newspaper Le Monde. Revenues at BNP Paribas' French retail banking networks fell 3 percent in 2016, and fell 1.4 percent in the first quarter of this year. BNP Paribas said it was discussing the job cuts plan, that would come via natural attrition, with French trade unions. The French retail banking unit employed around 29,000 people in 2016, according to the bank's annual report. The bank declined to comment on how many people would be impacted directly by the management revamp. The presentation of the plan comes after the bank outlined its strategy during an investor day earlier this year. BNP said then that it wanted to reduce its cost to income ratio - a key measure of profitability - in the retail bank business to 70 from 73 percent by 2020 through a digital transformation, simplification of the organisation and streamlining of the branch networks.

But the move, detailed at Wells Fargo's investor day, failed to impress Wall Street, because management also indicated that revenue growth is suffering from the scandal, which involved employees creating as many as 2.1 million unauthorized accounts in customers' names to hit sales targets. The San Francisco-based bank's stock was down 1.7 percent at $53.81 in afternoon trading. Wells Fargo plans to reduce expenses by another $2 billion through the end of 2019, on top of a $2 billion cost-cutting target management previously announced. The cuts come after repeated questions from analysts and investors about why Wells Fargo was not doing more to reduce costs, which have been high by some measures when compared to U.S. banking rivals. But the scandal has only increased costs, as the bank has tried to fix practices internally and respond to regulatory inquiries and public backlash. During the investor day event, executives said they understood investor concerns and would take action. Chief Executive Tim Sloan used the word unacceptable at least twice, in reference to prior sales practices and expense levels. Management had been trying to keep expenses in a range of 55 percent to 59 percent of revenue, but in the first quarter that ratio soared to 62.7 percent. Operating at this level is completely unacceptable, Sloan said. As Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry began his presentation, he joked to the crowd: Raise your hand if you're interested in hearing about expenses at Wells Fargo. He said the bank plans to get back into its targeted ratio in the coming years. A Wells Fargo logo is seen in New York City, U.S. January 10, 2017.Stephanie KeithThe sales abuses in Wells Fargo's branch banking operation led to a $190 million regulatory settlement, launches of other government probes, the firing of several bankers, the departure of CEO John Stumpf and shareholders offering scant support for most directors at the bank's annual meeting last month. Nearly all of the executives speaking on Thursday, including Sloan, are in new positions entered after the scandal erupted in September. Wells Fargo's investor day is typically a biannual event, but management held it a year early to provide more information about how they are running the bank. Sloan and his deputies indicated that the scandal had impacted revenue, either because some customers may be less inclined to do business with the bank or because reforms to business practices have hurt sales.  For instance, Wells Fargo has changed pay structures so that instead of being incentivized to boost sales figures, employees are encouraged to deliver products and services customers actually need. While executives have described such reforms as necessary, they may also be hurting revenue. We had an incentive program and high-pressure sales culture in our community bank that drove behavior that was at times inappropriate and inconsistent with our values, Sloan said, noting that management took too long to appreciate seriousness of the problem. Wells Fargo bankers are getting fewer referrals from branches for personal loans and home-equity loans, said Franklin Codel, an executive in the consumer lending unit. That has led to a 3 percent decline in business, though trends appear to be stabilizing, he said. The credit card business has also been hurt by the scandal, said Avid Modjtabai, who heads Wells Fargo's payments, virtual solutions and innovation group. The rate of new credit card account openings has recently picked up, but Modjtabai did not say when she expects the business to fully recover. Overall, Wells Fargo expects net interest income to grow in the low-to-mid single percentage points this year, which some analysts characterized as disappointing, as were executives' assertions that Wells will not hit its cost efficiency ratio this year. The new cost-cutting guidance fell roughly in the middle of analyst expectations. A big chunk of the savings will come from Wells Fargo's plan to close 450 branches in 2017 and 2018, roughly 10 percent more than its previous target. Wells Fargo has been slower to cut branches than rivals like Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) or Citigroup Inc (C.N). It is a quick way to slash expenses, though some banks, including JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), have been cautious about trimming branch networks because doing so can hurt revenue. Through Wednesday's close, Wells Fargo's shares had risen 6 percent over the past six months, lagging gains of 14.1 percent for JPMorgan and 28.7 percent for Bank of America.

The new cost-cutting guidance fell roughly in the middle of analyst expectations. A big chunk of the savings will come from Wells Fargo's plan to close 450 branches in 2017 and 2018, roughly 10 percent more than its previous target. Wells Fargo has been slower to cut branches than rivals like Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) or Citigroup Inc (C.N). It is a quick way to slash expenses, though some banks, including JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), have been cautious about trimming branch networks because doing so can hurt revenue. Through Wednesday's close, Wells Fargo's shares had risen 6 percent over the past six months, lagging gains of 14.1 percent for JPMorgan and 28.7 percent for Bank of America.

The Gulf branch of the famous Paris museum and two other planned museums are part of the oil-rich emirate's wider push to diversify its economy away from oil, investing billions of dollars in tourism, industry and infrastructure. The local Louvre was originally scheduled to open in 2012 but that target was pushed back to the second half of 2016, the chairman of state-owned Tourism Development and Investment Company (TDIC) told Reuters last year. TDIC, the developer, was scheduled to hand over the $650 million museum to Abu Dhabi’s Tourism & Culture Authority (TCA) in mid-2016. “First, the museum buildings have to be completed and delivered and then the opening (must take place), which is now some time in 2017,” a source close to the project said. “There is some work to be done – interiors, testing which are critical as the commissioning takes place.” Two other sources confirmed the opening is postponed to an unspecified date next year. All three sources declined to be identified as details about the project are private. A spokeswoman of TDIC declined to comment.  A building boom in the United Arab Emirates has created bottlenecks as some construction firms scramble to find labor, supplies and financing to complete huge backlogs of work. TDIC is developing a cultural district in Abu Dhabi that will house branches of the Louvre and Guggenheim museums, as well as the Zayed National Museum. The Zayed Museum was scheduled to open this year and the Guggenheim in 2017, but contracts are yet to be awarded for them.  Construction of Louvre Abu Dhabi was awarded to an Arabtec-led joint venture with Construction San Jose SA and Oger Abu Dhabi LLC in 2013.

Deutsche has provided its findings to the market regulator and will cooperate closely with authorities, the spokesman said. Khilov did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment.

Researchers on Wednesday described fossils of a long-necked, four-legged, meat-eating reptile called Teleocrater rhadinus that reached up to 10 feet (3 meters) long and prowled a Tanzanian floodplain roughly 245 million years ago. It lived during the Triassic Period millions of years before the first dinosaurs. Scientists called it a close cousin rather than a direct dinosaur ancestor. Its appearance differed from what scientists had expected from the earliest representatives of the dinosaur evolutionary lineage. Teleocrater possessed an unexpected combination of crocodile-like and dinosaur-like characteristics.  I'm surprised by the mosaic of features that it possesses, said paleontologist Ken Angielczyk of the Field Museum in Chicago, one of the researchers in the study published in the journal Nature. An artist depiction of a life reconstruction of Teleocrater rhadinus feasting on a deep relative of mammals, Cynognathus, shown in this handout provided April 11, 2017.   Credit: Natural History Museum, London, artwork by Mark Witton/Handout via REUTERSIn terms of how it shakes up our understanding of dinosaur evolution, Teleocrater shows that the earliest members of the dinosaur lineage were very unlike dinosaurs, and that many 'typical' features of dinosaurs accumulated in a step-wise fashion instead of all evolving at close to the same time. Dinosaurs belong to a larger group called archosaurs that about 250 million years ago cleaved into two branches: crocodilians in one and another that includes dinosaurs, extinct flying reptiles called pterosaurs, and birds, which evolved from  feathered dinosaurs. Teleocrater is the oldest-known member of the dinosaur-pterosaur-bird archosaur branch. Scientists had expected such a dinosaur forerunner to be a smallish, two-legged predator resembling early dinosaurs such as Herrerasaurus, which lived about 231 million years ago in Argentina. While dinosaur predators were bipedal, Teleocrater instead was four-legged, looking superficially like a modern Komodo dragon. Virginia Tech paleontologist Sterling Nesbitt, the study's lead author, said fossils representing at least four individuals were found in southern Tanzania, representing about half the skeleton. Much like a croc and unlike a dinosaur, Teleocrater's ankle joints could rotate from side to side as well as flexing up and down, providing a crocodile-like gait. It also boasted telltale dinosaur features such as characteristic depressions for jaw muscle attachment on the roof of the skull, extra surfaces for the backbones to attach to one another, and distinctive hip muscle attachments on the thigh bone. Teleocrater's remains were found in the same Tanzanian region as fossils of the two-legged meat-eater Nyasasaurus, which lived perhaps a couple of million years later. Some scientists regard Nyasasaurus as the earliest-known dinosaur. Reporting by Will Dunham; Editing by Sandra Maler"

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-banks-strategy-analysis-idUSKBN1852PF","As China's banks swap corporates for retail borrowers, risks rise","","May 9, 2017 /  11:08 PM / 3 months ago","","SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's lenders are swapping struggling corporates for more promising retail borrowers - restructuring branches, teams and even overhauling bankers' commissions in an unprecedented push that is fuelling a record jump in home loans. Yet the speed of the switch, the pressure to pull in more borrowers and soaring house prices are also worrying loan officers, analysts and regulators, with the central bank governor among those sounding a note of caution. Corporate lending has long made up the bulk of many Chinese banks' loan books: the deals are larger and loans have more attractive rates. But with firms faltering, economic growth slowing for key sectors and banks under pressure to deleverage, lenders are eyeing other options. While retail lending also includes credit cards and consumer loans, mortgage lending has been a focus for China's big five banks since the push began in earnest last year.  Mortgage lending was up around 30 percent for the big five in 2016, the fastest growth in five years, while property lending in China accounted for 40.4 percent of new loans in the first quarter, data from the People's Bank of China (PBOC) showed. Mortgages in China are among the safest loans - they are secured, of course, and conservative borrowing also means loan-to-value ratios (LTV) as low as under 40 percent. However, bankers, investors and analysts say the latest retail push has seen unprecedented pressure, tough targets and hard-hitting sales tactics - with some drawing comparisons to the pre-financial crisis years in the United States. There was quite a lot of (skirting mortgage rules) last year, said Chen Shujin, a banking analyst from Huatai Securities. We do think this will have an impact on the quality of mortgages and bank assets.  Mortgage growth is also set to slow this year, credit analysts say. Many cities have introduced a raft of measures to cool property prices that have surged beyond the reach of many Chinese, posing growing financial risks.  China's central bank did not respond to requests for comment, though governor Zhou Xiaochuan has cautioned on the need for balance as mortgages jump, according to local media. The China Banking Regulatory Commission also did not respond to requests for comment.      More Loans, More Trouble? Among the concerns is the pressure on bankers to radically accelerate the number of loans they push through.  It doesn’t matter whether you were from the corporate team, or SME team, now 50 percent of your targets are retail borrowing targets, said one banker at Ping An Bank (000001.SZ).  FILE PHOTO: A customer takes her bankbook from a smart banking machine at a branch of ICBC bank in Beijing, China, April 13, 2016.Kim Kyung-Hoon/File PhotoPing An increased its retail assets under management by 13.6 percent in the first quarter alone as part of a major strategic shift in focus from corporate to retail.  At one branch, many bankers now have to open 60 retail accounts a year, two Ping An bankers said. Bankers with retail experience have been promoted to head many of the lender's sub-branches, they added. To incentivise bankers, Ping An is providing higher commissions for retail wins. Bankers who don't hit their targets for the sale of an unpopular product face penalties, according to the Ping An bankers.  There was no suggestion bankers at Ping An had skirted mortgage rules. Ping An said it disputed some elements of the bankers' account, without clarifying which parts. But similar accounts emerge across the sector.  Rival lender CITIC Bank has changed its sub-branches from handling both corporate and retail lending to just focusing on one or the other, with more in some areas focused on retail, according to the website and two bankers. We're slowly moving towards retail by hiring more bankers with retail experience, said one vice-president of a CITIC Bank sub-branch. CITIC Bank did not respond to requests for comment. Again, there was no evidence its bankers were side-stepping loan rules. While the high pressure practices have drawn some comparisons to the U.S. property bubble, analysts noted Beijing can exert far more control on its banking system, much of which is state owned. Mortgage-backed securities and other financial instruments that helped aggravate the U.S. problems are also less developed in China, although volumes are growing steadily. Residential mortgage-backed securities in 2016 tripled from a year earlier to 138.2 billion yuan ($20 billion), according to China Central Depository & Clearing Co Ltd.     With average property deposits last year of close to 50 percent, risks are manageable, said Huatai's Chen. Still, a report by Moody's Investors Services this month  noted that while Chinese mortgages have historically shown very low risk, the latest loan originations are likely to entail a high level of risk, because of the sharp rise in property prices in 2016.

Shares in the company fell 13 percent to a record low of 162.75 pence in morning trade in London. Countrywide's pretax profit fell 59 percent to 19.5 million pounds ($23.7 million) from a year earlier. The company had forecast income for the full year to be broadly flat at 737 million pounds, after issuing two warnings on results since July. Total income for 2016 rose 0.4 percent to 737 million pounds. Countrywide warned in January that the volume of house sales in London in the final quarter continued to be below 2015 levels, resulting in a 6 percent drop in the number of deals for the year. The sales market volatility is likely to continue in 2017, it said. Countrywide also expects headwinds from tenants' fees regulation and pressured landlord environment in 2017. Britain has said it would ban one-off tenant fees to try to bring down the cost of renting and cool the market already hit by a property tax increase in April on houses bought by buy-to-let landlords. London-focused estate agent Foxtons Group was also hit by a slump in demand due to the property tax hike and Britain's vote to leave the European Union last year and predicted on Wednesday that 2017 would be tough for sales. Annual British house price growth cooled in February to its weakest since July 2013, hurt by increasingly squeezed consumer finances, mortgage lender Halifax said on Tuesday.

There are 1.7 million adults in the country that do not have access to a bank account, the report said, raising the risk that they will turn to high-cost sources of credit such as payday loans, 'doorstep' loans sold at a customer's home, and a system known as rent-to-own. In the latter method, a company rents consumer goods to a customer at a high cost, with ownership not transferred until the final payment. Usage of rent-to-own has more than doubled in the last five years to over 400,000 households in Britain, according to Christine Allison, financial inclusion fellow at the Centre for the Study of Financial Innovation. StepChange Debt Charity estimates 2.6 million people in Britain are struggling with severe problem debt, and another 8.8 million show some signs of financial difficulty. Particularly at risk are those in the lowest income brackets, the report said, defined in British government data as having an average weekly household income of 130 pounds to 240 pounds ($162-$299). Regulation of short-term payday loan companies has been effective in curbing some of their practises such as exorbitant interest rates, but other forms of high-cost credit have flourished instead, according to Claire Tyler, a lawmaker in the House of Lords who chaired the committee on financial exclusion. There is a poverty premium where the poor pay more for credit, Tyler told Reuters in an interview. The report called on the Financial Conduct Authority to establish new rules requiring banks to have a duty of care towards their customers to address some of these problems, but left the definition of that duty up to the regulator. Britain's Treasury department and nine of the biggest banks in 2014 agreed new guidelines stipulating that so-called basic bank accounts should be fee-free, in an effort to widen access to banking. Tyler said data were not yet available to show the impact of those new rules. The report also said Britain's poorer and more vulnerable people were hardest hit by bank branch closures, echoing a report by Reuters last June that showed banks were  disproportionately closing branches in the lowest-income areas while expanding in wealthier ones.

Huishan, whose shares are suspended indefinitely on the Hong Kong exchange, said late on Monday that Bank of China Ltd's Macau branch had asked it to repay the outstanding principal on a $50 million loan, with interest of $937,363 by May 16. It gave no further details. The crisis at Huishan has highlighted the complexities of resolving corporate debt problems in the world's second-biggest economy. The firm's board has resigned, a key finance executive is missing and almost all of the shares owned by its controlling shareholder had been pledged as collateral. The demand for repayment from state-owned Bank of China could prompt other creditors to take similar action, bankers and analysts said. Two people with knowledge of the matter said other creditors, which include HSBC, China CITIC Bank International and Hang Seng Bank, are now keeping close watch on the situation. None have yet taken action. Huishan, which has been heavily dependent on short term loans, entered into the loan agreement with Bank of China's Macau branch on April 28, 2014, with a maturity period of three years, according to official filings. Bank of China did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Huishan declined to comment. Last month, Huishan said Shanghai courts had ruled to freeze some of Huishan's assets following an application by Gopher Asset Management Co Ltd, one of the company's creditors. Meng Shen, director of Chanson & Co, a boutique investment bank based in Beijing, said that if Huishan did not come up with a plan to restructure its debt, more lenders would seek legal action such as freezing Huishan assets. There is a distinct possibility that Huishan will not be able to restructure, he said. Huishan's stock has been suspended at the company's request since March 24, after it plunged 85 percent in a single day. On Monday, Hong Kong's securities regulator also ordered trade in its shares be halted. Hong Kong's banking watchdog is separately questioning banks over a $200 million syndicated loan raised by Huishan from lenders including China CITIC, Hang Seng, and HSBC, sources told Reuters last month. A spokesman for HSBC declined to comment. Hang Seng declined to comment, while China CITIC Bank did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.

The May 10-14 poll, which was conducted after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey, suggests the public is increasingly uneasy with allegations of meddling by the Russians in the U.S. election. Trump's dismissal of Comey, who was leading the Federal Bureau of Investigation's probe into ties between the White House and Russia, intensified calls by Democrats for an independent probe.  According to the poll, 59 percent of adults, including 41 percent of Republicans and 79 percent of Democrats, agreed that Congress should launch an independent investigation into communications between the Russian government and the Trump campaign during the 2016 election.  That compares with 54 percent of all adults, including 30 percent of Republicans and 81 percent of Democrats, who felt that way when the poll last asked the question in February.      I really don't know what to believe anymore, said John Kremer, 74, a Trump supporter from Birmingham, Alabama, who wants an independent investigation. Kremer does not think Trump had any illegal contact with the Russians, but he does not like the way the president is handling he issue.  If Comey hadn't been fired, I would have been comfortable with the results of their investigation, Kremer said. My concern now is whether he (Trump) is trying to minimize the investigation.  The Reuters/Ipsos poll also found that public confidence in the executive branch and in Congress has eroded since the Nov. 8 election. Thirty-six percent of Americans said they had hardly any confidence at all in the executive branch and 43 percent said they felt that way about Congress. That is up from 30 percent and 37 percent, respectively, who answered that way in a November poll.  When asked who should replace Comey, 48 percent wanted an FBI outsider with credible experience in law or law enforcement. Thirty-seven percent said they wanted someone from within the FBI while 5 percent wanted an FBI outsider who is close to the Trump administration.  The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online in English in all 50 states and Washington, D.C. It included responses from 1,541 adults, including 515 Republicans and 686 Democrats.

The hardline Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, once allied with al Qaeda and formerly known as the Nusra Front, attacked Free Syrian Army (FSA) groups west of Aleppo this week. It accused them of conspiring against it at peace talks in Kazakhstan.    Ahrar al-Sham, which presents itself as a mainstream Sunni Islamist group, sided with the FSA groups and said Fateh al-Sham had rejected mediation attempts. It said that any attack on its members of was tantamount to a declaration of war. Rebel factions Alwiyat Suqour al-Sham, Fastaqim, Jaish al-Islam's Idlib branch, Jaish al-Mujahideen and al-Jabha al-Shamiya's west Aleppo branch said in a statement they had joined Ahrar al-Sham.  The Ahrar al-Sham statement also mentioned a sixth group, the Sham Revolutionary Brigades, and said other brigades had joined.  Ahrar al-Sham is considered a terrorist group by Moscow and did not attend the Russian-backed Astana peace talks. But it said it would support FSA factions that took part if they secured a favorable outcome for the opposition.  The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based war monitor, said Fateh al-Sham clashed with fighters from Ahrar al-Sham and Suqour al-Sham on Thursday in the northern rebel stronghold of Idlib province.  The attack by Fateh al-Sham had threatened to wipe out the FSA groups which have received backing from countries opposed to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad such as the Gulf Arab states, Turkey and the United States. Internationally viewed as a terrorist group, Fateh al-Sham  has been excluded from all diplomatic efforts to end the Syrian conflict, including a recent truce brokered by Russia and Turkey. Since the new year, the group has been targeted by a U.S. air strikes. While Fateh al-Sham has often fought in close proximity to FSA rebels against Assad, it also has a record of crushing foreign-backed FSA groups during Syria's complex, almost six-year conflict.

Spain's fifth biggest bank estimated net profit of 800 million euros ($856 million) in 2017, a 13 percent rise compared with 2016, underpinned by stable lending income which would allow it to improve its profitability over the next few years. In a strategic update, Sabadell described 2017 as a transitional year in which it wanted to focus on containing costs, including the closure of 250 Spanish branches, and finalise the integration of its British unit TSB. Sabadell said it expected the British economy, where it makes around a quarter of its profits through TSB which it bought in 2015, to perform better than initially expected this year after Britain's vote to leave the European Union last June. Sabadell does not expect sterling to continue to depreciate  beyond its near three-decade low, although volatility in Britain would continue, CEO Jaime Guardiola told analysts on a conference call. Sterling's fall helped trim Sabadell's 2016 profit to a worse-than-expected 710 million euros, flat from the previous year after it booked a 490 million euro charge from a European court ruling in December on disputed mortgage clauses. For 2017, Sabadell said it expected net interest income - a measure of earnings on lending minus deposit costs and a key profit driver for retail banks - to grow 1 percent on the back of lower funding costs and higher interest rates in Britain. Due to these better business conditions, Sabadell said it expected to double its profitability in the next few years, with its return on equity ratio (ROE) hitting double digits by 2020 from 5.84 percent in 2016. Analysts welcomed the new guidance and said it was realistic since it was pricing in foreseeable higher interest rates, higher banking fees and lower provisions and costs. Sabadell's shares were up 0.4 percent at 1030 GMT. The bank said it expected to reduce its non-performing property assets by over 9 billion euros to less 10 billion euros by 2020 as Spanish banks continue to clean up their balance sheets after Spain's real estate market crash in 2008. $1 = 0.9347 euros

The phrase, which first surfaced as an anti-capitalist slogan a century ago, refers to the practice of drying up wetlands to stop mosquitoes from breeding. Since taking office less than a month ago it has become evident that Trump had a different definition in mind. Trump's idea of a swamp looks more like what the founding fathers of America's constitutional democracy intended as a system of checks and balances on the power of the executive branch of government. And over the past week, the denizens of that noble muskeg have risen up and exerted the separation of powers that Trump's victory always promised to test. The judiciary, the legislative branch and fourth estate – institutions ennobled by the framers of the Constitution and its Bill of Rights – have delineated important limits to the reality-TV star's governance. For proponents of unfettered executive power, not to mention investors who have pushed stock prices to new highs amid hopes for speedy tax cuts and other bottom-line bolstering measures, this all may come as a disappointment. That may be why the president and his proxies are attempting to rebrand the virtues of the American political system as quagmire. Sean Hannity, the Fox News propagandist, proclaimed that the DC swamp is rising up and colluding to take down the 45th president. On the contrary, Trump's failure to rule through the bully pulpit of Twitter and ill-considered and poorly constructed executive decision-making should be celebrated. Consider Trump's freshest ignominy, the defenestration of his nominee to run the Department of Labor, Andrew Puzder. The chief executive of the company running the Hardee's and Carl's Jr hamburger chains was forced to withdraw from consideration for the job because he lacked sufficient votes in the Senate to reach a simple majority. Though a successful fast-food entrepreneur, Puzder was a controversial pick to run a branch of the government designed to give the working man a voice. But to face nay votes from as many as a dozen GOP senators, as CNN reported might have been the case if Puzder's nomination went to the floor, suggests something close to a mini-revolt. In that sense, Puzder is the first instance in which the legislative branch – even one controlled by the president's own, albeit recently adopted, party – has said no to him. And not for any single reason, but a plurality of them, ranging from lefty complaints about working conditions at CKE Restaurants, his views on workers and the over-the-top ads he sanctioned to sell burgers, to worries on the right that he was too soft on immigration and failed to properly document an illegal immigrant in his employ. Puzder's failure to pass muster with a sufficient number of lawmakers who have six years to make their case to voters, should not be taken as evidence of swamp muck. It should serve as a lesson to the White House that it needs to select its candidates more carefully and be prepared to defend its choices more robustly. That logic also should extend to issues of policy, where in most cases it will need to bring along a few Democrats. Similar reasoning applies to the humiliating resignation of Trump's national security adviser Michael Flynn on Tuesday. Though there may be legitimate questions about leaks emanating from the White House and intelligence officials about Flynn's conversations with the Russian ambassador involving sanctions, it was only when the matter was made public by the media that Trump made the call to push him out, according to the New York Times. The Flynn affair, therefore, represents a victory for an institution the president and his advisers have consistently sought to discredit and even branded as the effective opposition: the press. The exercise of the First Amendment of the Constitution is not the swamp rising up, but rather as Thomas Jefferson wrote, our liberty depends on the freedom of the press, and that cannot be limited without being lost. Lastly is the decision by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals to stay an executive order restricting travel from seven majority-Muslim nations a week ago. The ruling put the order on hold until the courts can decide on the underlying merits, and address questions about the extent of executive power on matters of immigration and national security. An appeals court may ultimately find for the president. Like the Puzder case, however, the battle over the travel ban should force the White House to subject its actions, not to mention the language of its orders, to the extreme vetting they deserve. Again, this is in keeping with the separation of powers enshrined in America's founding documents. Contrary to ridding Washington of the metaphorical gnats sucking the money-blood of the federal government, Trump has empowered Wall Street bankers, corporate executives and vulture investors with roles throughout his administration and in numerous federal agencies. It is a handy but dangerous fiction for the president and his proxies to simply brand each of these setbacks as uprisings from the Washington swamp they promised to drain.BreakingviewsReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/eurozone-banks-italy-unicredit-idUSL5N1E810Z","UniCredit to raise 13 billion euros in Italy's biggest share issue","","December 13, 2016 /  8:28 AM / 7 months ago","","MILAN/LONDON (Reuters) - Italy's largest bank, UniCredit (CRDI.MI), plans to raise 13 billion euros ($13.8 billion) in the country's biggest-ever share issue to shore up its balance sheet and shield itself from a broader banking crisis. The plans announced on Tuesday also include 14,000 job cuts and more than 900 branch closures. They come at a turbulent time for Italian banks and the economy - with Monte dei Paschi di Siena (BMPS.MI) at risk of failure, a new government just installed in Rome and early elections expected next year. UniCredit, the only Italian bank deemed important to the stability of the global financial system, has lost about half its market value this year, hit by profitability concerns, bad loans and a weaker balance sheet than major European rivals. Chief Executive Jean Pierre Mustier said the bank planned to launch the share issue in the first quarter of 2017 and use the money to help mop up 17.7 billion euros worth of bad debts from its balance sheet, enabling it to boost its profits and also dividend payouts by 2019.     Drafted in five months ago, the former Societe Generale (SOGN.PA) executive has sought to streamline the bank, selling assets like fund manager Pioneer and Polish unit Bank Pekao. We've taken some bold actions because self-help is always the best thing to do, the 55-year-old told analysts in a call. Joseph Oughourlian, CEO at UniCredit shareholder Amber Capital, said he was a firm believer in Mustier. Related CoverageUniCredit deal to offload bad loans sets bar high for Italian banksSorting out UniCredit is huge service and a plus for the Italian banking sector. We now have the two largest banks in Italy well-capitalised, he said. Italy's other major bank is Intesa Sanpaolo (ISP.MI). The issue would take the bank's core capital ratio to above 12.5 percent in 2019, from about 10.8 percent now, though UniCredit envisages deep job cuts. It plans to shed 14,000 jobs, or about 11 percent of its staff as of end-2015.  Including announced asset sales, the bank will have a third less staff by 2019, compared with the end of last year, as a result of its turnaround plan. It also plans to close 944 branches in its core areas of Italy, Germany and Austria by 2019. Mustier pledged to cut his fixed salary by 40 percent to 1.2 million euros with no annual bonus this year or during the plan to 2019.  The headquarters of UniCredit bank is seen in Milan, Italy, in this February 8, 2016.Stefano Rellandini/File PhotoShares Leap While UniCredit expects net profit to increase to 4.7 billion euros in 2019 from 1.5 billion last year, it projects revenue will rise just 0.6 percent annually, with growth mainly coming from fees and commissions. The bank said it would maintain its focus on central and eastern Europe as a growth area where revenues should grow by 2.6 percent a year and streamline its investment banking business. Shares in the bank jumped 10 percent on news of its plans, with traders saying its targets seemed realistic. The turnaround, though, would involve 12.2 billion euros in one-off losses in the fourth quarter, including loan writedowns and restructuring costs. Slideshow (4 Images)If one was to believe management can deliver on the plan ... and, should the environment turn in their favor, there is an argument to be said the shares look about 50 percent too cheap, said wealth manager Northern Trust Capital Markets. Mustier said no more asset sales were on the cards and that UniCredit itself was not in talks for a possible merger. His appointment this year had revived rumors about a possible merger between UniCredit and Societe Generale. The success of UniCredit's plan rests on investors believing it will be a long-term solution. The bank has already raised 14.5 billion euros since the global financial crisis struck in 2008. Mustier told reporters that the problems of Monte dei Paschi would not upset UniCredit's plans. I am highly confident Monte Paschi will be resolved by year-end and so it will have no impact on our capital increase. Italy is ready to bail out Monte dei Paschi, the country's third-largest bank, if it fails to get the 5 billion euros it needs to stay in business from private investors, a Treasury source said. The European Central Bank has given it by the end of this month to raise the money. For UniCredit, investment banks have signed a pre-underwriting agreement to help it market the issue, including Morgan Stanley (MS.N), UBS (UBSG.S), BofA Merrill Lynch (BAC.N), JP Morgan (JPM.N) and Mediobanca (MDBI.MI). UniCredit's bad loans would be sold to two vehicles, one managed by Fortress Investment Group and the other by PIMCO. UniCredit would retain minority stakes in each.

British and Chinese government officials met in London on Thursday to unveil a strategic plan to deepen financial and economic ties between the two countries. It will support the integration of China's financial markets into the global market through London's financial centre, exchange of expertise and increase market access, Britain and China said in a joint statement. It takes forward plans for closer ties between the London and Shanghai stock exchanges. The two countries underscored a commitment by their regulators to cooperate more closely in banking, asset management, insurance, and financial technology or fintech. Both sides welcome the continuing interest by firms, including Agricultural Bank of China (UK), Shanghai Pudong Development Bank, and others, in submitting further applications to establish branches in the UK, once they are ready to make applications, Britain and China said in a joint statement. Regulators from both countries were committed to working together to ensure an effective review of all proposals from the banks, it added. The announcement may help soothe jitters in the City of London financial district that foreign banks will shun Britain because it is leaving the EU. British regulators have already authorised London branches for Bank of Communications Co, and China Merchants Bank. The China Banking Association will also open a London office when conditions permit. The Shanghai Clearing House also intends to set up a London office next year, the document said. Chinese authorities will support Aberdeen Asset Management  in its application to register private fund management entities in China, and then launch private fund products after authorisation. Chinese authorities will also positively consider the application of Heng An Standard Life, part-owned by Standard Life, for a pensions licence in China, the document said.

Among planned strikes this month are walkouts by airline cabin staff, baggage handlers, rail conductors and Post Office counter workers. If these strikes share one thing in common, it's a shared contempt for ordinary people who are just trying to go about their daily lives, May's spokesman said on Monday, adding that parties should negotiate to avoid action. He said the government would not rule anything out in terms of changing legislation to make striking more difficult. British Airways (BA) said on Monday it would not be cancelling flights on Dec. 25 and 26 as the airline, owned by International Airlines Group, holds talks at the conciliation service Acas with the Unite union in an attempt to avert walkouts by more than 2,500 cabin staff. We have been working on detailed contingency plans to ensure that we are able to operate our normal flight program from all our airports on both Christmas Day and Boxing Day, BA chief executive Alex Cruz said. The BA strike over a pay dispute is being staged by members of the airline's Mixed Fleet, Unite has said, referring to cabin crew staff who have joined the airline since 2010. They make up about 15 percent of BA's 16,000 cabin crew. Unite also said over 1,500 check-in staff, baggage handlers and cargo crew at airports across Britain will walk out for 48 hours from Friday in a long-running pay dispute. Conductors on the Southern railway line were also taking strike action on Monday and Tuesday, the latest of over a dozen walkouts during a long-running dispute over whose job it is to open and close train doors.  Meanwhile post office counter workers on Monday began a two-day strike over job security and pensions, during one of the busiest weeks of their year. The action will affect almost 300 Crown Post Offices, the larger branches usually found on high streets, but the rest of the Post Office's network of 11,600 local branches, and Royal Mail's delivery services, are not involved.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/nigeria-fcmb-group-bonds-idUSL5N1FO3LO","Nigerian bank FCMB raises 5.1 bln naira via bonds","","February 3, 2017 /  12:30 PM / 6 months ago","","LAGOS, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Nigerian mid-tier lender FCMB  has sold 5.1 billion naira ($16 million) of bonds, less than it originally planned to raise, at an interest rate coupon of 17.25 percent, its advisers said on Friday. The seven-year bond was issued by way of a book-building with Standard Chartered Bank, local investment bank Chapel Hill Denham and FCMB Capital Markets as book runners. The offer was fully subscribed, they said in a statement. Several Nigerian lenders will likely raise fresh capital this year or sell some assets to boost capital ratios, after low oil prices created dollar shortages and weakened the naira leading to a pile-up of non-performing loans. Last November FCMB said it wanted to raise funds to strengthen its capital base but it halved the amount it planned to raise to 7.5 billion naira in debt after announcing a bond sale of up to 15 billion naira three months earlier. Last year the lender closed some branches and slowed loan growth to conserve its capital, which was close to the regulatory limit of 15 percent of assets at mid-year. Chief Executive Ladi Balogun said then it was undertaking the capital raising to provide an additional cushion. Nigeria, Africa's biggest economy, has been issuing bonds at yields below inflation, making it difficult for corporates to raise debt, as the government increases borrowing to try to spend its way out of the country's first recession in 25 years. In January the government sold a five-year bond at 16.89 percent to raise 34.95 billion naira. Annual inflation in Nigeria hit 18.55 percent in December, its 11th straight monthly rise to a more than 11-year high. FCMB's shares were down 3.82 percent on Friday at 1.28 naira, having gained 19 percent this year. Shares fell 35 percent in 2016. $1 = 314.50 naira

Iran has provided military support to Assad's forces since at least 2012, but initially did not comment publicly on its role. But as the military support increased and Iranian casualties also rose, officials began to speak more openly. The advisory help isn't only in the field of planning but also on techniques and tactics, the Fars news agency quoted Mohammad Pakpour, head of the Revolutionary Guard ground forces, as saying. And because of this the forces have to be present on the battlefield. We will continue our advisory help as long as they (the Syrians) need it, he added. An Iranian official said late last year that more than 1,000 Iranians had been killed in the Syrian civil war. These include a handful of senior commanders of the Revolutionary Guards, according to Iranian media reports. Iran has helped to train and organize thousands of Shi'ite militia fighters from Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan in the Syrian conflict. Fighters from Lebanon's Hezbollah are also working closely with Iranian military commanders in Syria.   Pakpour said the Revolutionary Guards' ground forces were in Syria to help the Quds Force, the branch of the Guards responsible for operations outside of Iran's own borders. There is very close coordination between the Syrian army and the Revolutionary Guards advisers, Pakpour said.  Iran and Russia are Assad's main allies in the conflict, while the United States, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and other Gulf Arab states support opposition groups seeking to overthrow him. Russia's intervention in the conflict has tilted it decisively back into Assad's favor. Reporting By Babak Dehghanpisheh; Editing by Gareth Jones"

First Horizon's offer price of $40.83 per share represents a discount of about 3 percent to Capital Bank's Wednesday closing. Capital Bank's shares, which have gained 40 percent in the past year, were trading just shy of the offer at $40.00 before the bell on Thursday. The deal is the latest in a spree of mergers between regional U.S. banks that started last year, spurred by low interest rates, lagging returns on equity and tough regulations. However, U.S. President Donald Trump has ordered reviews of major banking regulations put in place following the 2008 financial crisis. Federal Reserve policymakers have also signaled that a 'liftoff' of interest rates may finally get underway this year. The combined company will have $40 billion in assets and $32 billion in deposits and will operate more than 300 branches across the Southeast, including Tennessee, South Carolina,  Florida and Virginia. First Horizon will offer 1.750 shares and $7.90 in cash for each Capital Bank share - a ratio of 80 percent stock and 20 percent cash. Capital Bank shareholders will own a 29 percent stake in First Horizon after the deal closes.

While Chancellor Angela Merkel's government, running a budget surplus, is lifting public investment in infrastructure, many economists say private investment also needs to pick up to boost anaemic growth rates.   The German economy grew more slowly than expected in the third quarter of this year as exports fell after Britain's vote to leave the European Union. The biggest increase in investment last year came from the rubber and plastics sector which saw a 16.4 percent rise to 3.4 billion euros.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/china-huishan-idUSL4N1IB2M9","UPDATE 1-Indebted Huishan Dairy under pressure as Bank of China calls in loan","","May 9, 2017 /  7:32 AM / 3 months ago","","(Adds that banks sent letter to Huishan in April) * Bank of China calls in $50 mln loan, asks for payment by May 16 * Other creditors monitoring situation closely -sources * Some banks sent letter in April about broken covenants By Sumeet Chatterjee HONG KONG, May 9 (Reuters) - China Huishan Dairy Holdings Co Ltd, wrestling with debt, battered shares and an empty boardroom, could come under more pressure from its banks after one creditor demanded it repay a $50 million loan, people familiar with the matter said. Huishan, whose shares are suspended indefinitely on the Hong Kong exchange, said late on Monday that Bank of China Ltd's Macau branch had asked it to repay the outstanding principal on a $50 million loan, with interest of $937,363 by May 16. It gave no further details. The crisis at Huishan has highlighted the complexities of resolving corporate debt problems in the world's second-biggest economy. Most of the firm's board has resigned, a key finance executive is missing and almost all of the shares owned by its controlling shareholder has been pledged as collateral. The demand for repayment from state-owned Bank of China could prompt other creditors to take similar action, bankers and analysts said. Two people with knowledge of the matter said other creditors, which include HSBC, China CITIC Bank International and Hang Seng Bank, are now keeping a close watch on the situation. So far, none have taken action to recall their loans, the people said. Huishan, which has been heavily dependent on short term loans, entered into the loan agreement with Bank of China's Macau branch on April 28, 2014, with a maturity period of three years, according to official filings. Bank of China did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Huishan declined to comment. Last month, Huishan said Shanghai courts had ruled to freeze some of Huishan's assets following an application by Gopher Asset Management Co Ltd, one of the company's creditors. Meng Shen, director of Chanson & Co, a boutique investment bank based in Beijing, said that if Huishan did not come up with a plan to restructure its debt, more lenders would seek legal action such as freezing Huishan assets. There is a distinct possibility that Huishan will not be able to restructure, he said. Huishan's stock has been suspended at the company's request since March 24, after it plunged 85 percent in a single day. On Monday, Hong Kong's securities regulator also ordered trade in its shares be halted. Hong Kong's banking watchdog is separately questioning banks over a $200 million syndicated loan raised by Huishan from lenders including China CITIC, Hang Seng, and HSBC, sources told Reuters last month. The banks sent a letter to Huishan in April stating that there had been non-compliance with certain of the covenants of the three-year loan agreed in 2015, although the letter did not necessarily mean that creditors were seeking accelerated repayment. Representatives for HSBC, Hang Seng and China CITIC Bank declined to comment.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/deutsche-mirrortrade-probe-idUSL1N1FK1JN","Deutsche to pay $425 mln to N.Y. regulator over Russian 'mirror trades'","","January 30, 2017 /  11:18 PM / 6 months ago","","NEW YORK/FRANKFURT, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank AG  has agreed to pay $425 million to New York's banking regulator over a mirror trading scheme that moved $10 billion out of Russia between 2011 and 2015, the regulator said on Monday. In addition, Britain's Financial Conduct Authority is about to penalize the bank roughly $200 million for the suspicious trades, a person familiar with the matter said. The scheme involved clients buying stocks in Moscow in rubles and related parties selling the same stocks shortly thereafter through the bank's London branch, the New York Department of Financial Services (DFS) said in a statement. The trade of a Russian blue chip stock, typically valued at between $2 million to $3 million an order, was cleared through the bank's New York operations, with the sellers typically paid in U.S. dollars, the regulator found. The regulator, which licenses and supervises the New York branch, found the bank conducted its business in an unsafe and unsound manner in violation of state banking law. Though the trades appeared to have no legitimate economic purpose, Deutsche's deficient anti-money laundering controls and know-your-customer policies did not detect and stop the scheme for years, DFS superintendent Maria Vullo said. Deutsche Bank said it has been unable to identify the actual purpose behind this scheme, according to a consent order between the New York regulator and the bank. It is obvious, though, that the scheme could have facilitated capital flight, tax evasion or other potentially illegal objectives. In addition to the penalty, Deutsche is required to retain an independent monitor to review the bank's compliance programs. A spokesperson for the Financial Conduct Authority declined to comment. The source on the FCA's expected penalty did not want to be identified because the terms were not public. The New York regulator said it worked closely on the investigation with the FCA. Reuters reported on Monday that Deutsche Bank was poised to settle with British and U.S. authorities over the trades. The U.S. Department of Justice, which also has been investigating the suspicious trades, is not party to the deal. A spokesman for the Justice Department declined to comment on the status of its probe. Deutsche Bank disclosed last September that it had taken disciplinary measures against certain employees as part of an investigation of the trades and would continue to do so. The bank also cut back on its investment banking activities in Russia last year. Monday's consent order found Deutsche Bank's Moscow traders facilitated the scheme. Deutsche Bank had set aside 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) in provisions for the Russian case, people close to the matter have told Reuters. A resolution on the mirror trades comes on the heels of a $7.2 billion agreement with the Justice Department for misleading investors in selling mortgage-backed securities in the run-up to the financial crisis. The two probes lift much of the uncertainty swirling around the bank over its exposure to fines and enforcement. The bank is due to report fourth-quarter financial results on Thursday.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-otc-trump-idUSKBN15L2FF","In Trump appeal of immigration ruling, a battle over court’s authority","","February 6, 2017 /  9:06 PM / in 6 months","","(Reuters) - The U.S. judiciary is the only branch of our government that frequently restricts its own power. The constitutional system of checks and balances requires the courts to decide when Congress or the president is overreaching. But no one tells the justices of the U.S. Supreme Court, who are appointed for life, that they’re exceeding their constitutional power (except other justices). The system depends on judges acting judiciously.  The Trump administration believes the system failed on Friday, when U.S. District Judge James Robart of Seattle granted a motion by the states of Washington and Minnesota to suspend enforcement of the president’s week-old travel, immigration and refugee policy. The Justice Department’s appeal at the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to stay Judge Robart’s order is, fundamentally, a call on federal courts to limit their own authority to review the president’s power to decide who comes into and goes out of this country.  The government’s brief, as I’ll explain, contends the Supreme Court has already conceded its restricted power in opinions that say courts must defer to the president as long as the government offers a legitimate rationale for its immigration decisions. Beyond that, the Trump Justice Department said, judges are intruding on terrain the U.S. Constitution and Congress have reserved for the president, meddling in policy they have no right to control.  Washington and Minnesota responded late Sunday night courts “have both the right and the duty” to examine the motives behind an unprecedented immigration and refugee policy that flouts the Constitution and a Congressional directive against nationality-based discrimination.  The 9th Circuit can decide the case on any number of technicalities – ranging from its jurisdiction to hear the appeal to the standing of Washington and Minnesota to bring claims on behalf of their residents - without reaching the essential question of the scope of court authority to review the president’s immigration policies. But the issue won’t go away with this case. The Trump administration intends to pursue aggressive immigration policies. Judges need to know how closely they can scrutinize the administration’s actions.  President Trump made clear his own view of the appropriate balance of power in a series of Twitter posts this weekend. Deriding Judge Robart – who was appointed by President George W. Bush and confirmed unanimously by the U.S. Senate - as a “so-called judge,” Trump tweeted, “What is our country coming to when a judge can halt a Homeland Security travel ban and anyone, even with bad intentions, can come into U.S.?”  On Sunday, the president once again questioned federal court interference with his national security policy. “Just cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril,” he tweeted. “If something happens blame him and court system. People pouring in. Bad!”  The president’s comments seem to me to be gratuitously disdainful of Judge Robart’s authority, but his tweets distill the arguments his Justice Department has been making all week in the Washington and Minnesota AG case. The government has warned against “judicial second-guessing” of the president’s discretion in matters of national security, which, it said, Congress codified in immigration law provisions guaranteeing the executive branch’s power to suspend admission to the U.S. when the safety of the nation is at stake.  In the brief filed Saturday, the Justice Department added the argument that judges don’t have access to all of the classified information the president sees, so “courts are particularly ill-equipped to second-guess the president’s prospective judgment about future risks.” According to the Justice Department, judges are committing irreparable harm to constitutional separation-of-powers doctrine when they intrude “on the political branches’ exclusive authority over the admission of aliens.”  To back those arguments, the government cites two Supreme Court opinions, Kleindienst v. Mandel from 1972 and Kerry v. Din from 2015. Both cases were brought by U.S. citizens suing over State Department decisions not to issue visas to particular foreign nationals. In Kleindienst, American professors claimed the government was violating their First Amendment rights by refusing entry to a radical Belgian journalist; in Kerry, a woman married to a former Taliban member asserted the government was obliged to explain its refusal to grant her husband a visa.  In both cases, the Supreme Court said that when the government has a “facially legitimate and bona fide” reason to deny a visa, courts should not probe the executive branch’s exercise of its discretion. “This reasoning has particular force in the area of national security, for which Congress has provided specific statutory directions pertaining to visa applications by noncitizens who seek entry to this country,” wrote Justice Anthony Kennedy in a concurrence in the Kerry case.  The Justice Department’s position is not unreasonable. Boston federal district judge Nathaniel Gorton, who declined on Friday to extend a temporary restraining order barring enforcement of the Trump policies, agreed with the government’s restricted view of court oversight of immigration policy. (And was hailed in a yet another tweet from President Trump over the weekend.) “The president has exercised his broad authority … to suspend entry of certain aliens purportedly in order to ensure that resources are available to review screening procedures and that adequate standards are in place to protect against terrorist attacks,” Gorton wrote, citing Kleindienst among other cases.  But as Washington and Minnesota explained Sunday night in their 9th Circuit response to the Justice Department, the Supreme Court doesn’t always give the executive branch a free pass when it comes to national security. Most notably, in a series of decisions in the early 2000s, the justices granted constitutional rights to detainees held at Guantanamo Bay, over ardent opposition from the George W. Bush administration. “Courts routinely review executive decisions with far greater security implications” than the Trump administration immigration policy, the states’ brief said.  Moreover, according to Washington and Minnesota, Justice Kennedy’s concurrence in the 2015 Kerry case specifically said that courts can consider the executive branch’s motives if there is sufficient evidence the government acted in bad faith. The states, as you know, contend the Trump administration policy, which bars entry from seven Muslim-majority countries, is a de facto ban on Muslims, in violation of the First Amendment’s Establishment Clause.  What is the proper standard for evaluating a sweeping immigration order that categorically bars all travelers from seven countries, albeit temporarily? Like so much else about the Trump administration, that’s hard to predict."

The power outage, which was triggered by a fire in a PG&E; Corp. utility substation, disrupted San Francisco's normally bustling financial district, home to banks and technology companies.  The blackout started just after 9 a.m. (noon ET/1600 GMT) and at one point affected nearly 90,000 customers, according to PG&E.; The cause of the fire was a circuit breaker failure at the substation, PG&E; spokesman Paul Doherty said. Office workers unable to access elevators or use their keycards spilled out onto the sidewalks, some wandering the streets in search of an open cafe or sunny spot to enjoy a rare warm San Francisco day.  Others simply went home, with long lines forming for ferries. For many, there was little to do but wait. When I got here we had to shut down all the servers, all the work stations were off-line, said Bard Wood, an information technology worker in the financial district. I'm sure we've lost millions of dollars already. There's no business down here right now. Some cable car operators snoozed after their cars stalled on the street rails. Traffic was snarled and emergency workers responded to 20 elevator rescues, according to the city's fire department, but there were no reported deaths or major injuries. But many businesses, from coffee shops to major banks, took a hit. Wells Fargo & Co closed 13 bank branches and four office buildings, while the New York Stock Exchange said its ARCA options trading floor in San Francisco was briefly unavailable. Employees in Goldman Sachs' financial district office were sent home. King Lip, chief investment officer at Baker Avenue Asset Management, said his firm was in the middle of a trade when all our systems went down. He said employees in another state had to complete the transaction. Two office buildings and a local branch of First Republic Bank were shut down, a sign on the branch's doorway apologizing for the unexpected closure.  Fourteen neighborhoods were affected, including the main shopping district near Union Square, where stores turned signs to closed and major retailers such as Macy's and Louis Vuitton shut their doors.

Fighting between Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, formerly the al Qaeda-affiliated Nusra Front, and more moderate, foreign-backed factions erupted this week in areas west of Aleppo and the adjacent rebel-held province of Idlib. The clashes, which are taking place separately to the main battle in Syria's conflict - that between rebels and the Syrian government - threaten to further weaken opposition to President Bashar al-Assad in the insurgents' biggest territorial stronghold. A rebel source said Fateh al-Sham launched fierce new attacks on Friday. A short while ago there was tank bombardment of the base of the headquarters of our brothers in the Jaish al-Islam (faction) in Babsiqa, a rebel source in one of the groups involved in the fighting told Reuters. Activists are reporting casualties in a camp for women nearby from the tank and mortar bombardment. The clashes appeared to take place in two areas of Idlib - one west of Aleppo and close to the Turkish border, and the other south of Idlib city, close to the main highway linking Aleppo to Damascus. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said each side was using heavy weaponry, and reported a number of civilian casualties. In towns close to the fighting, several hundred people protested against Fateh al-Sham for targeting rebel factions, or called for the clashes to stop so civilians would not get hurt, the British-based Observatory said. Fateh al-Sham, which routed at least one Free Syrian Army rebel faction this week, is now fighting against a number of groups that have joined forces under the powerful Islamist Ahrar al-Sham to fend off the assault. Ahrar al-Sham, which presents itself as a mainstream Sunni Islamist group, sided with the FSA groups and said Fateh al-Sham had rejected mediation attempts. Fateh al-Sham said on Tuesday it had been forced to act preemptively to thwart conspiracies being hatched against it. The groups it has attacked include factions that attended peace talks in Kazakhstan sponsored by Damascus allies Russia and Iran, and rebel backer Turkey.

The capital raising plan could include swapping debt for equity in the bank as well as raising around 300 million pounds in new shares, the bank said, as it seeks to meet long-term regulatory capital requirements. If neither plan works, Co-Op Bank said it faces intervention by regulators including the possibility of being closed down, in what would be a first test of new bank resolution powers granted to the Bank of England after the 2008 financial crisis. Chairman Dennis Holt said the bank has made progress on a plan announced a month ago to sell itself, and that there is no fixed timetable for that process. We are pleased with the interest to date and engaging with potential bidders as planned, Chief Executive Liam Coleman said. The debt-for-equity swap being considered would convert bonds held by creditors into shares in the bank, boosting the lender's regulatory capital position but potentially leading to heavy losses for those investors. The bank has not made a profit since 2011 and has struggled to rebuild its capital position after being rescued from the brink of collapse by a group of hedge funds in 2013. The bank has blamed low interest rates and higher-than-expected costs in implementing its turnaround plan for its failure to meet capital targets set by the Bank of England's Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA). The PRA last month said it welcomed the bank's decision to put itself up for sale as a possible solution to increasing its capital levels. CEO Coleman said the bank plans to close 10 branches in 2017, after closing 59 last year, as it seeks to further slash costs. Coleman declined to comment on how many jobs would be affected by the closures. The bank's current cost-income ratio is 103 percent, Chief Financial Officer John Worth told reporters on a conference call on Thursday, meaning the lender spends more than it earns. $1 = 0.8224 pounds

Cogebanque is Rwanda's third largest bank by assets, which totalled 167.5 billion Rwandan francs ($226 million) at the end of the third quarter of 2015, according to the company. We have signed an memorandum of understanding to buy 75 percent stake in Cogebanque, Attijariwafa's chief executive Mohammed Kettani said after signing the deal. A statement from Rwanda's president's office said the deal was worth around $41 million. Like other large Moroccan companies, Attijariwafa Bank has been expanding in Africa. It has subsidiaries in Tunisia, Ivory Coast, Senegal, and Mali, among other countries, as well as branches in Europe. The Cogebanque deal was signed during a visit to Rwanda by the Moroccan king, which began on Tuesday. Attijarawafa Bank said the closing of the deal was conditional on signing the sale contract and receiving regulatory approvals.

HUD said it expects its case against the bank will be heard in federal court, where a judge could potentially order the bank to pay damages, attorneys fees or other equitable relief. A Bank of America spokesperson did not have any immediate comment. This is not the first time that Bank of America has faced allegations of discrimination. The Supreme Court is currently weighing whether to let Miami pursue lawsuits accusing both Bank of America and Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) of engaging in predatory lending against black and Hispanic home buyers. The city accused the banks of steering those borrowers into higher-cost loans that they could not afford. The banks are seeking to quash the lawsuit, arguing that the kind of monetary recovery being sought by Miami is not covered by federal law. A ruling on that case is due by the end of June. The Fair Housing Act makes it illegal to deny or discriminate against people based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status or disability when it comes to issuing mortgages or mortgage modifications. HUD's case on Friday against Bank of America was prompted by a complaint filed by the National Fair Housing Alliance.  The alliance raised concerns about possible discrimination, after it conducted a series of tests in February 2013 through January 2014 to compare how bank employees treated female Hispanic versus non-Hispanic female prospective borrowers in a Charleston-based branch of the bank. The Hispanic borrowers were offered less favorable lending terms compared with the non-Hispanic borrowers and the bank was less prompt in helping connect the Hispanic borrowers with the loan officer, the testing found.  For instance, one non-Hispanic borrower received an estimate with lower closing costs and monthly payments, as well as an offer by the bank to pay $2,000 of her closing costs.  The Hispanic borrower, by contrast, would have faced higher monthly payments and did not receive a similar offer for the bank to cover her closing costs. Reporting by Sarah N.

The third-largest U.S. bank by assets said net income applicable to common shareholders fell to $5.06 billion, or $1.00 per share, in the first quarter ended March 31, from $5.09 billion, or 99 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average had estimated earnings of 96 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. It was not immediately clear if the reported figures were comparable. Wells Fargo has been dealing with multiple lawsuits and regulatory inquiries since government investigations found in September that some of its employees had opened as many as two million accounts without customers' knowledge. The scandal damaged the bank's folksy image and also led to the ouster of Chief Executive John Stumpf, but growing deposit balances and a stable level of account closings show that profitability in the long run should not be hampered. The company has been reporting customer activity in its branch banking unit on a monthly basis ever since the scandal, in an effort to be transparent with investors and to win back their trust.

The British firm has pushing into a number of overseas markets and last year introduced a corporate offering in Spain, launched a full branch in Romania and signed a commercial partnership with global news firm CNN. Moneycorp, which had revenues of about $140 million in 2016, did not disclose the terms of the deal.  Chief financial and operations officer Nick Haslehurst told Reuters that the firm would fund 20 percent of the deal using cash on hand, while 80 percent would be backed by external financing. Providence, Rhode Island headquartered Commonwealth had revenues of about $20 million last year and serves over 4,000 customers in the United States, enabling the movement of over 3 billion dollars across the world. Moneycorp said the Commonwealth acquisition would allow it to add small- and medium-sized U.S. customers by rolling out its specialist forex technology and platform through Commonwealth's network. I think, in the United States, the provision of cross-border banking, payments and FX services by the big mainstream banks doesn't service that SME and midcap market in the U.S. particularly well, Haslehurst said. Having acquired Commonwealth the ability to leverage their licensing structure and sales team to roll out Moneycorp's transparent, fast, efficient service provision, we believe will give us a big advantage for customer acquisition. Moneycorp, which offers telephone and online payments, traded 25 billion pounds worth of currencies and handled over 7 million transactions in 2016. The deal, which requires regulatory clearance in the United States, is expected to close around September or October. KPMG was financial adviser to Moneycorp, while Holland & Knight and Shearman & Sterling were legal advisers. Raymond James advised Commonwealth.

Since the army recaptured Aleppo in December, some of the many armed groups in the northwest have consolidated into factions that are now fighting each other for control of territory and resources.

The bank has cut overheads at its French retail arm where net interest income fell more than 5 percent in 2016. It is investing to bolster online and mobile banking while cutting back-office centers. It closed 92 bank branches last year. Given the good performance of other businesses, we have decided to accelerate, to have 250 million euros of additional capital expenditure ... without changing our dividend guidance, Severin Cabannes told a conference, according to a webcast on the bank's website. Last month SocGen said it planned to keep increasing the dividend and maintain the current 50 percent pay-out ratio. Deputy Chief Executive Severin Cabannes also reiterated that SocGen's French retail banking revenues would weaken in 2017 at the same pace as in 2016, indicating a decline of up to 3.5 percent. Rock-bottom interest rates have hurt European banks, but the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision on March 15 to raise interest rates has increased the likelihood of higher European lending rates in the not too distant future.

But investors are already assessing how much European banks could make in a higher rate environment.

The central bank shored up the Skye last year with a 100 billion naira ($328 million) capital injection, after sacking its top management for failing to meet minimum capital requirements. It then appointed a new management team. The bank said it had recovered 60 billion naira in bad loans, closed some branches and sold four subsidiaries to boost capital in the past year. Skye's problems started after it used short-term funds to buy local lender Mainstreet Bank in 2014 but failed to raise fresh cash. It was in talks with shareholders and investors last year to raise 30 billion naira but suspended the plans when weak oil prices hit capital markets and drove foreign investors away. The bank continues to require assistance from central bank and government as it repairs the damage inflicted on the institution in the past and charts a sustainable path forward for the bank, Skye bank said in a statement. It said it had reached restructuring agreements with many of the chronic bad debtors resulting in improved payments and prospects of future recoveries, it said in a statement.

The bank, which posted a pre-tax loss in 2015, said it had submitted its 2016 accounts for approval. The central bank designated Skye as one of Nigeria's systemically important banks due to the size of total deposits it holds after it acquired Mainstreet Bank.

The service, to be called Alticebank, would add another layer to the company's businesses, which have already grown beyond telecoms with the acquisition of broadcast distribution rights as well as online video advertising marketplace Teads.  The move also highlights the heightened competition in retail financial services, with mobile operators seeing the increase in smartphone ownership and the lower use of bank branches as an opportunity to challenge traditional lenders. Altice, a holding company based in the Netherlands, has expanded rapidly through a series of debt-financed buyouts in the United States and Europe. It owns France's second-biggest telecoms firm SFR Group and Portugal's biggest. It's the first one on a European level, but certainly not the last one, Julien Maldonato, a partner at Deloitte in Paris, said referring to online banks launched by telecoms companies. The logic is to make the heavy telecoms infrastructure profitable, he said. French rival Orange, which is testing an online bank, hopes to launch it nationwide to take on traditional banks with a low-cost services that will eventually expand to include loans and insurance. The service, Orange Bank, aims to break even in four to five years and was formed after the former telecoms monopoly bought 65 percent of Groupama Banque last year. The nationwide launch was postponed last month, however, to allow for additional testing. A union official pointed at the time to issues with the quality of the user interface and customer service. The Orange plan for France contrasts with Altice's current strategy, under which its new banking service would be built from scratch and need to go through a complex regulatory compliance process.  Altice has requested a banking license from the European Central Bank (ECB), the source said, confirming an earlier report by newspaper Le Parisien.  The ECB declined to comment.

Mick Mulvaney, director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), said in a letter that the administration was not seeking to impede efforts by the Office of Government Ethics to obtain that information, despite earlier protests from Walter Shaub, the director of the Office of Government Ethics (OGE). OMB shares the belief that the executive branch must uphold the highest ethical standards in accordance with the law, Mulvaney wrote. Our concern was, and is, protecting the process related to the data call. Shaub, an appointee under President Barack Obama in the final year of five-year term, had requested in April copies of waivers the administration of President Donald Trump granted to former lobbyists now appointed to positions in the government. Those requests were sent to agencies across the administration, seeking waivers that would allow former lobbyists to work on issues they had been involved with as paid advocates.  But OMB requested a stay of that request, prompting a fierce response from Shaub. He called the request highly unusual and said his agency has the authority to take corrective action proceedings against agencies that refuse its requests. In his Friday response, Mulvaney said the requested stay was not an attempt to stifle OGE efforts but rather to provide more time to ensure sufficient consideration was given to legal questions. OMB has never sought to impede OGE, he wrote. Mulvaney closed the letter by saying the OMB did not grant any lobbyist waivers itself.

The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) said Moody's German and UK branches negligently committed two infringements of the Credit Rating Agencies Regulation regarding their public announcement of certain ratings, ESMA said in a statement on Thursday. The failures relate to 19 ratings issued between June 2011 and December 2013 for nine international bodies, including the European Investment Bank, the European Investment Fund, the European Stability Mechanism, the European Financial Stability Facility, and the European Union itself. Moody's gave too little public information about how the ratings were arrived at, making it harder for investors to check and verify they were sound and reliable, ESMA said, adding that the only public information available was a press release. Moody's said it acknowledged ESMA's findings and was pleased that the matter was now closed. None of the findings related to the quality of our ratings or the supranational methodology itself, Moody's European spokesman Daniel Piels said. ESMA also recognized that Moody’s took steps in 2013 to ensure that similar infringements did not occur in the future. Moody's is one of the Big Three agencies that dominate the issuance of ratings globally, along with S&P; Global (SPGI.N) and Fitch Ratings LBCP.PA. ESMA authorizes and supervises credit rating agencies in the EU and it has taken action against ratings agencies three times previously, including a 1.38 million euro fine for Fitch.

The two men sacked, Aden provincial governor Aydaroos al-Zubaidi and cabinet member Hani bin Brek, are both seen as supporting separatism for southern Yemen, while Hadi is determined to tighten his grip over a unified country. Zubaidi was one of the leaders of the Southern Resistance that helped expel the Houthis from his city. Diplomats and some analysts say Hadi is uncomfortable with the fact that among the forces trained and supported by the United Arab Emirates are some pro-secessionist fighters. Zubaidi and Brek are also seen as close to the UAE, a powerful regional military player. Witnesses described convoys of buses and cars carrying hundreds of people that had been arriving since Wednesday from around southern Yemen in Aden, the capital of the former South Yemen, for a rally billed as a gathering of millions. Supporters of the separatist Southern Movement demonstrate against recent decisions by President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi that sacked senior officials supported by the United Arab Emirates, including Aden governor Aidaroos al-Zubaidi, in the southern port city of Aden, Yemen May 4, 2017.Fawaz SalmanHadi is going along partisan objectives and deepening divisions in the country, said protester Hamed Faraj.  He said many people believe that the dismissals show the president is caving in to pressure from the Islamist Islah party, Yemen's branch of the Muslim Brotherhood, which also opposes the secessionist movement. Slideshow (5 Images)Zubaidi told the protesters that he intended to work with all parties to push for independence for the south. May 4th represents a turning point in the Southern nationalist movement's struggle for independence, he told the protesters in Aden. Formerly Marxist South Yemen merged with the North in 1990. Secessionists failed in a civil war in 1994 to reverse the unification, but secessionist sentiment has picked up again in recent years. Separatists accuse Hadi's government of failing to provide public services to Aden nearly two years after local fighters, backed mainly by forces from the UAE, expelled Houthis in 2015.

The operator, Moritomo Gakuen, last year bought an 8,770-square-metre plot of government-owned land for 134 million yen ($1.2 million), or 14 percent of its appraisal price, to build a new elementary school, Kyodo news agency has reported.  Akie Abe is set to be honorary principal of the new school in Japan's western region of Toyonaka, Moritomo Gakuen says on its website.  Prime Minister Abe told parliament on Friday neither he or his wife had been involved in the transaction. Although the appraisal price of the land was 956 million yen, an estimated cost of 822 million yen for land cleanup activities was deducted from the sale price, Kyodo said. The focus is whether the cost estimate of 800 million was truly right, Democratic Party lawmaker Yuichiro Tamaki said on Wednesday, following a visit to the site and meetings with finance ministry officials the previous day.      During the field trip, no evidence has emerged to support construction work worth 800 million yen was actually carried out or such work was necessary in the first place, he told reporters. No officials of the finance ministry or Moritomo Gakuen were immediately available for comment on the land transaction.   Fellow Democratic Party lawmaker Kiyomi Tsujimoto told the same news conference the party was demanding that Yasunori Kagoike, the president of Moritomo Gakuen, appear before a parliamentary committee to give an explanation of the purchase.   Moritomo Gakuen has been in the media spotlight in recent weeks following online comments by its kindergarten that domestic media described as possible hate speech against Koreans and Chinese people, for which the school then apologized. Kagoike heads the Osaka branch of Nippon Kaigi, or Japan Conference, a nationalist lobby group with close ties to Abe and his cabinet. Reporting by Kiyoshi Takenaka; Editing by Clarence Fernandez"

The region where the incident happened is close to China. The FSB, the successor organization to the Soviet KGB, said the attacker had been killed and that another person had been injured in the incident. An unknown person entered the reception of the FSB's Khabarovsk regional branch and started shooting at people inside, the FSB said in a statement. The Site Intelligence Group, a U.S.-based monitoring service, said that Islamic State had claimed responsibility for the attack. It said that the claim of responsibility had been made through the militant group's Amaq news agency.  That contradicted earlier media reports, which said the FSB believed the gunman was a nationalist. The TASS news agency cited an unnamed FSB official as saying that the gunman was a local resident and born in 1999. The visitor who was killed and the one who was injured were from former Soviet states outside Russia, according to the security service. Russia was this month shaken by a suicide bombing of the St Petersburg metro, which killed 16 people. The suspected suicide bomber and his alleged accomplices were from Central Asia. The man Russian police believe was the suicide bomber had developed an interest in Islam and soon after traveled to Turkey, two people who knew him told Reuters.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-election-banks-idUSKBN1900XW","Little upside in prospect for British banks from election result","","June 9, 2017 /  8:12 AM / 2 months ago","","LONDON (Reuters) - British bank shares fell on Friday as investors priced in the likely negative impact on the sector of Prime Minister Theresa May's failure to win a majority in a snap election. The resulting hung parliament threatens to derail talks over Britain's exit from the European Union and dampen consumer confidence, which could puncture a banking sector that many analysts believe is already overextended. Britain's financial sector had pinned its hopes on a strengthened majority for May's Conservative government, expecting it to deliver a more certain economic outlook. But her failure to win outright control of parliament could delay and complicate talks over Britain's exit from the European Union, increasing the likelihood of slowing economic growth. This is the worst outcome apart from (Labour leader) Jeremy Corbyn being prime minister, a government relations official at one of Britain's biggest banks said. The more internationally-focused banks fared better in the election aftermath. HSBC (HSBA.L) and Standard Chartered (STAN.L) both rose by 2 percent by 0730 GMT thanks to their lower exposure to the British economy and higher proportion of dollar earnings which rose in value against the pound. Conservative-Led Coalition Analysts said the most favorable outcome now for banks is a Conservative-led coalition, likely with Northern Ireland's pro-British Democratic Unionist Party (DUP).  FILE PHOTO: The Canary Wharf financial district is seen at dusk in London, Britain November 7, 2014.Toby Melville/File PhotoThe best case for the markets, as it stands now, is a continuity of the current government with outside support from some of the parties, Chirantan Barua of Bernstein wrote in a research note. The DUP's manifesto makes little mention of banks and the financial sector, but lenders may be heartened by its emphasis on trade and customs relationships in the Brexit negotiations. Banks could still suffer under this scenario with a weakened government unlikely to push too hard for big business.  May had said she would tighten laws on company takeovers and would ensure any foreign group buying important infrastructure did not undermine security or essential services if she won the election, in a potential blow to dealmaking. Labour-Led Coalition The worst outcome for banks, especially Royal Bank of Scotland, (RBS.L) would be if Corbyn is able to form a coalition government with another party, or win a follow-up election. Labour in its manifesto said it would launch a consultation to break the state-owned lender into smaller regional banks. Other lenders would suffer under a Labour government too, with the party set to hike corporate taxes from 19 percent to 26 percent by 2020 and to restore a separate bank levy. In further measures hostile to banks, Labour could pass laws preventing banks from closing unprofitable branches in places where they are the last branch in town, and intervene to curb profits banks make on variable rate mortgages.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-immigration-idUSL1N1K51EL","Trump to ask Supreme Court to block travel ban ruling","","July 14, 2017 /  6:48 PM / in 14 days","","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said on Friday that the Justice Department will ask the Supreme Court to block a judge's ruling that prevented President Donald Trump's travel ban from being applied to grandparents of U.S. citizens and refugees already being processed by resettlement agencies. Sessions said in a statement that the administration would reluctantly return directly to the Supreme Court in a bid to overturn Thursday's decision by a U.S. district judge in Hawaii, which limited the scope of the administration's temporary ban on refugees and travelers from six Muslim-majority countries. The Justice Department could file papers with the high court as soon as Friday. By this decision, the district court has improperly substituted its policy preferences for the national security judgments of the executive branch in a time of grave threats, defying both the lawful prerogatives of the executive branch and the directive of the Supreme Court, Sessions Said. The Supreme Court last month said the ban could take effect, but that people with a bona fide relationship to a U.S. person or entity could not be barred. The administration had narrowly interpreted that language, saying the ban would apply to grandparents and other family members, prompting the state of Hawaii to ask Hawaii-based U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson to expand the definition of who could be admitted. The truth here is that the government’s interpretation of the Supreme Court’s stay order defies common sense, said Omar Jadwat, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union involved in challenging the ban. That’s what the district court correctly found, and the attorney general’s misleading attacks on its decision can’t change that fact. The conservative-leaning Supreme Court is not currently in session, but the justices can handle emergency requests. The administration's application could be directed either to Justice Anthony Kennedy, who has responsibility for emergency requests from western states, or to the nine justices as a whole. If the court as a whole is asked to weigh in, five votes are needed to grant such a request. Separately, the Justice Department filed papers in Hawaii federal court saying it would appeal Watson's ruling to the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. That would give the government a second route to the Supreme Court. Earlier on Friday, White House homeland security adviser Tom Bossert told reporters that the ruling appeared to be fairly broad and something that would trouble me if it was as broad as reported. Bossert, speaking aboard Air Force One as the president returned from a trip to Paris, focused his remarks on the part of the ruling that would allow more refugees to enter the country, saying the ruling could be interpreted as so expansive as to cover every refugee. In his decision, Watson harshly criticized the government's definition of close family relations as the antithesis of common sense. Watson also ruled that the assurance by a resettlement agency to provide basic services to a newly arrived refugee constitutes an adequate connection to the United States because it is a sufficiently formal and documented agreement that triggers responsibilities and compensation. The ruling, if left in place, means refugees can continue to be resettled in the United States, beyond a cap of 50,000 set by the executive order. That limit was reached this week. The Supreme Court's decision last month revived parts of Trump's March 6 executive order banning travelers from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days, as well as refugees for 120 days. The court also agreed to hear oral arguments in the fall over whether the ban violates the U.S. Constitution. (Additional reporting by Ayesha Rascoe, Yeganeh Torbati and Dan Levine)"

Trudeau, 45, came to power in November 2015 promising to run an open and accountable administration but has been dogged by repeated questions about his luxury Bahamas vacation over the New Year, which his officials first declined to talk about. Opposition legislators say the holiday was inappropriate since Ottawa helps fund the Aga Khan's foundation, and shows Trudeau is out of touch with ordinary Canadians at a time when the economy is struggling. The travel back and forth from (the Bahamian capital) Nassau to the island happens on the Aga Khan's private helicopter, which he offered us the use of ... we don't see an issue on that, he told a televised news conference in Kingston, Ontario, during a cross-country tour to meet voters. The Aga Khan, the wealthy leader of the Ismaili branch of Shi'ite Islam, is a close Trudeau family friend. Under ethics rules which Trudeau himself introduced in 2015, government ministers may not take private flights without first getting approval from Mary Dawson, the country's conflict of interest and ethics commissioner. Asked why he flew on the helicopter without consulting Dawson, Trudeau said he would happily answer any questions she might have. Dawson has already opened a preliminary inquiry into opposition complaints about the vacation. Trudeau, who faces a separate probe by Dawson into fundraising by his Liberal party, last week scrapped a trip to the World Economic Forum in Davos and announced the cross-country tour.

Wells Fargo has set aside that money to compensate customers who are part of a class-action lawsuit involving claims regarding consumer or small business bank accounts, credit cards or loans, as well as identity theft protection, between May 2002 and April of this year. It plans to begin reaching out to those affected customers soon. In the unlikely event that there are so many claims, and there is not $25 million left over to distribute across all customers involved in the lawsuit, Wells Fargo said it will pay more. The bank reached the settlement in April, according to a regulatory filing, but the judge's preliminary approval moves the deal to the next step. Wells Fargo has previously said thousands of branch employees created as many as 2.1 million bank and credit card accounts in individuals' names without their permission to artificially hit sales goals. Lawyers representing the claimants said 3.5 million accounts were created, according to a May 12 story by the Los Angeles Times. If U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria grants final approval to  the deal, it could help Wells Fargo chip away at a bevy of legal and regulatory issues stemming from the scandal, which erupted in September after it reached a $185 million settlement with a Los Angeles prosecutor and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Wells still faces probes from federal, state and local government agencies, including the U.S. Department of Justice, as well as a number of private lawsuits, according to its quarterly securities filing in May. In a statement, the bank's chief executive, Tim Sloan, said he was pleased that the court approved the preliminary settlement and considered it a major milestone in our efforts to make things right for our customers. If the agreement receives final approval the bank expects it will close out the vast majority of claims in 10 class action lawsuits related to the one it is trying to settle."

Estate agents have continued to smart from the slowdown in the secondary housing market that accounts for nearly 90 percent of transactions, though strong demand from first-time buyers has helped most builders recover from the initial dip after the UK's June 23 vote to leave the European Union. The first half of 2017 was tough for the group compared to the same period last year, given the high levels of housing transactions brought forward in time as a result of the stamp duty changes and the EU referendum, Chief Executive Alison Platt said. This has forced property dealers, including Countrywide, to invest in digital expansion, close branches and slash headcount to stave off the growing threat from online agencies that lure customers by charging lower fees. Countrywide, which set out plans to cut costs in March, said total savings rose to about 19 million pounds. The company said it was working on plans to mitigate the impact of the removal of tenant fees -- expected in 2018 -- and focus on further digital penetration, besides reducing IT running costs. Smaller rival Foxtons Group Plc also posted a 63.8 percent fall in first-half profit, hurt by slowing demand and increased political uncertainty. UBS analysts said Countrywide's results were further evidence of the structural challenges that Countrywide face, and said it expects further weakness. Pretax profit fell to 447,000 pounds ($587,402.70) in the six months to June 30, from 24.3 million pounds a year earlier. However, the company - Britain's largest estate agency by revenue - said it expect full-year results to be within the range of market expectations.

The militants have effectively lost most of the land they held in the barren, mountainous border region of Jroud Arsal, he added.     As soon as the fighting ends, the Shi'ite Iranian-backed Hezbollah would be ready to hand over territory it has captured if the Lebanese army requests it, he said. Hezbollah has made rapid advances since it launched an offensive with the Syrian army on Friday to drive Sunni militants from their last foothold along the frontier. In the outskirts of the Lebanese town of Arsal, the operation has focused on the ex-Nusra Front, al-Qaeda's Syria branch until last year when it severed ties and rebranded. The next phase is expected to target a nearby enclave in the hands of Islamic State militants. The Lebanese army, a big recipient of U.S. and British military support, has not taken part in the offensive and has set up defensive positions around Arsal, which Nasrallah described as essential.  Negotiations began on Tuesday between Lebanese officials and the Nusra Front over the withdrawal of remaining militants to insurgent-held territory in Syria, he also said.  There is seriousness, better than at any previous time, Nasrallah said. But he added that militant demands remained unreasonable and that the Lebanese state, the Syrian government, and Hezbollah must each agree to the terms. Hezbollah has played a major role in fighting militants in the border region during the six-year Syrian war, along with critical military support it has provided to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. On the Syrian side of the border, Hezbollah fought shoulder to shoulder with the Syrian army around the town of Fleita in recent days and cleared the area of insurgents, Nasrallah said. Hezbollah fighters pray at Juroud Arsal, Syria-Lebanon border, July 25, 2017.Mohamed AzakirSecurity sources say some two dozen Hezbollah fighters have been killed overall, and nearly 150 militants. Refugee Camps Early in the offensive, Saraya Ahl al-Sham - the FSA rebel faction that had a small presence in the area - pulled its fighters from the front lines, Nasrallah said. The rebels took charge of protecting nearby refugee camps.     We facilitated this, he said. We are ready to work with the Lebanese state and the Syrian government on the withdrawal of the rebel faction to Syria. Slideshow (4 Images)Since the onset of the Syrian conflict, nearly 1.5 million refugees have poured into Lebanon - around a quarter of its population - where most languish in severe poverty. Several thousand refugees live in makeshift camps east of Arsal. The Lebanese army has been helping with the passage of refugees fleeing the recent clashes at the border, with United Nations supervision, according to a security source. The International Rescue Committee said around 390 people, mostly Syrian women and children, escaped to Arsal so far, many of them visibly shaken. Nasrallah said fighters were proceeding cautiously because of the proximity of the refugee camps. The border offensive had been in the works for months and Hezbollah asked the Syrian army to help after deciding to launch the battle, he said. Hezbollah's role in the Syrian conflict has drawn criticism from its Lebanese political opponents, including Sunni leader and Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri. During a state visit by Hariri this week, U.S. President Donald Trump called Hezbollah a threat to Lebanon from within and a menace to the region.    Nasrallah said on Wednesday he would not respond to Trump's comments in order not to embarrass the official Lebanese delegation to Washington.

Monmouth University will establish the Bruce Springsteen Archives and Center for American Music at its campus in the borough of West Long Branch, just miles from Asbury Park where he forged his career. The archive will include all of the Born to Run singer's recorded works as well as posters, photos, articles and other artifacts. Slideshow (3 Images)The center will preserve and promote the legacy of Bruce Springsteen and his role in American music, the university said in a statement. It will also highlight the work of other American musicians, including Woody Guthrie, Frank Sinatra and Robert Johnson. It will include a collection housed at Monmouth University since 2011, and will continue to accept works and memorabilia from Springsteen, fans and other donors, school spokeswoman Tara Peters said. The archives will be available for viewing by the public by appointment only at Monmouth, which is one of nine university affiliates of the Grammy Museum in Los Angeles, Peters said.  Springsteen, 67, who rose from playing in the gritty clubs of the Jersey Shore to international superstardom, has long maintained a home in, and close ties to, the Garden State roots.  When the New Jersey coastline was battered by Hurricane Sandy in 2012, Springsteen, along with fellow New Jersey native Jon Bon Jovi, headlined a concert to benefit victims of the storm. Springsteen is also an outspoken supporter of Democratic politics, campaigning for President Barack Obama ahead of the 2012 U.S. presidential election and backing Democrat Hillary Clinton in November's election.

The Sikorsky Aircraft Corp, which manufactures the helicopters, issued a service notice on Tuesday, saying the tail rotor and bearing assemblies of the S-92 should be checked following an incident in Scotland last December. Sikorsky is a unit of Lockheed Martin Corp. We are starting to resume flights gradually this afternoon as helicopters are checked and put back in flight, Statoil's spokesman said. The decision to stop the flights meant Statoil's workers were left stranded on oil platforms as the S-92 is the only model used by the company to transport people offshore Norway. Statoil stopped using H225 Super Puma helicopters, a workhorse of the offshore oil industry, following a fatal crash last April. Sikorsky said the inspections could take about 11 hours, but the time depended on each operator. We have already been informed that many operators have already completed these inspections, and we anticipate the majority of the fleet will have the initial inspection accomplished within the next 24-48 hours, a spokesman said in an email. In Britain, where S-92 flights were also stopped, the oil and gas industry lobby group said the inspections would create some short-term disruption to operations in the North Sea. One of Britain's offshore operators, Shell, said it was working on alternative flight provision. Sikorsky said in a separate note it was working closely with customers to determine the root cause of a problem with the tail rotor during a landing on a rig off Scotland on Dec. 28. A spokesman for Britain's Air Accidents Investigation Branch said the authority was still investigating the incident near Aberdeen. Both Statoil and Shell said their offshore production wasn't affected by the suspension of flights.    (Reporting by Nerijus Adomaitis and Karolin Schaps; Editing by Stine Jacobsen and Mark Potter)"

HUD said it expects the case will be heard in federal court, where a judge could potentially order the bank to pay damages, attorneys fees or other relief. HUD filed the complaint in its Office of Administrative Law Judges. A Bank of America spokesman strongly rejected HUD's claims. We are committed to fair lending principles and are proud to be one of the country's largest mortgage lenders to Hispanic borrowers, the spokesman, Terry Francisco, said. The case against Bank of America was prompted by a complaint filed by the National Fair Housing Alliance. The alliance raised concerns about possible discrimination, after it conducted a series of tests in February 2013 through January 2014 to compare how bank employees treated female Hispanic versus female non-Hispanic prospective borrowers in a Charleston-based branch of the bank. This is not the first time that Bank of America has faced allegations of discrimination. The Supreme Court is currently weighing whether to let Miami pursue lawsuits accusing both Bank of America and Wells Fargo & Co of engaging in predatory lending against black and Hispanic home buyers. The city accused the banks of steering those borrowers into higher-cost loans that they could not afford. In the testing by the National Fair Housing Alliance in Charleston, South Carolina, the Hispanic borrowers were offered less favorable lending terms compared with the non-Hispanic borrowers and the bank was less prompt in helping connect the Hispanic borrowers with the loan officer, the testing found. For instance, one non-Hispanic borrower received an estimate with lower closing costs and monthly payments, as well as an offer by the bank to pay $2,000 of her closing costs. The Hispanic borrower, in contrast, would have faced higher monthly payments and did not receive a similar offer for the bank to cover her closing costs. The Fair Housing Act makes it illegal to deny or discriminate against people based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status or disability when it comes to issuing mortgages or mortgage modifications."

Five Russian state-owned banks are present in Ukraine, including three in the top 20, and they hold a combined market share of 8.6 percent. The central bank has sought to cut that following a breakdown in bilateral relations in 2014 due to Moscow's annexation of Crimea and support for pro-Russian separatists. We want them to leave our market painlessly, deputy chief Kateryna Rozhkova told journalists. There are two options: either find a new owner or gradually reduce your presence. Two of the Russian banks - VEB and VTB - are already in talks to sell their Ukrainian subsidiaries, and Rozhkova said the central bank expected progress by the end of the first quarter. The three others are Sberbank and subsidiaries of Kremlin-owned BM Bank and VS Bank. In 2014 the central bank introduced restrictions on the five banks, banning them from increasing their assets and deposits. This resulted in their market share falling by half. A recent deadly escalation in Ukraine's nearly three-year-old separatist conflict prompted a few dozen protesters to gather outside a branch of Sberbank in Kiev, demanding it stop operating in the country. But Rozhkova said it was not in Ukraine's interests for the banks to close abruptly as they together had 22 billion hryvnias ($815 million) in Ukrainian consumer deposits and 16 billion hryvnias in business deposits. The central bank is formulating a scheme to transfer loans owed to these banks by Ukrainian companies elsewhere, she said. She said central bank experts had found no evidence that the banks had financed separatists in eastern Ukraine, as claimed by some Ukrainian politicians.

The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) said Moody's German and UK branches negligently committed two infringements of the Credit Rating Agencies Regulation regarding their public announcement of certain ratings, ESMA said in a statement on Thursday. The failures relate to 19 ratings issued between June 2011 and December 2013 for nine international bodies, including the European Investment Bank, the European Investment Fund, the European Stability Mechanism, the European Financial Stability Facility, and the European Union itself. Moody's gave too little public information about how the ratings were arrived at, making it harder for investors to check and verify they were sound and reliable, ESMA said, adding that the only public information available was a press release. Moody's said it acknowledged ESMA's findings and was pleased that the matter was now closed. None of the findings related to the quality of our ratings or the supranational methodology itself, Moody's European spokesman Daniel Piels said. ESMA also recognized that Moody’s took steps in 2013 to ensure that similar infringements did not occur in the future. Moody's is one of the Big Three agencies that dominate the issuance of ratings globally, along with S&P; Global (SPGI.N) and Fitch Ratings LBCP.PA.

Slideshow (6 Images)The work, made of silicon, resin and fiberglass, with human hair and real clothes, was created by Spanish artist Eugenio Merino - best known for his hyper-realistic models of dictators including Spain's Francisco Franco. Picasso lies out in a small room in the city's branch of the Alliance Francaise cultural institute, the end point of a tour following the landmarks of his life.  On the surface, it looks like another scheme to draw in tourists. But, say the organizers, the tour and sculpture are actually a critique of the way the city has used Picasso for commercial ends. The project is meant to criticize mass tourism and the culture industry of the city as a brand, in which tourism goes against the needs of the residents and where reality is replaced by settings created for the visitors, said Los Interventores, a group of artists who commissioned the exhibit.

Wolseley, which makes about 80 percent of its profit in the United States, said the 80 branch closures would take two or three years, resulting in restructuring charges of about 100 million pounds ($130 million). They are expected to deliver annualized cost savings of 25-30 million pounds. Its shares traded some 4 percent lower at 4,127 pence by 1220 GMT after it posted slightly lower-than-expected profit for the year ended July and did not return excess cash to shareholders for the first time in four years after spending more on acquisitions. Failure to return excess cash ... [is] likely the real culprit for investor displeasure, Accendo Markets' head of research Mike van Dulken said. It only makes matters worse for shareholders struggling in an environment of low returns. Wolseley, which started life in 1887 manufacturing machine tools and early motor cars before moving into distribution in 1979, has faced tough competition and a weak market for its core repair, maintenance and property improvement services in the UK and Europe. Analysts said oversupply in plumbing and heating had been an industry-wide problem, forcing peers Travis Perkins (TPK.L) and Grafton GRF_u.L to restructure as well. The difficulty with all these companies is that boilers now last a lot longer, said Liberum analyst Charlie Campbell.  Wolseley said it was also considering closing a distribution center in Worcester and had started a strategy review in the Nordic region to restore profitable growth. Analysts said the closure of its smaller branches could see Wolseley lose some clients to rivals, including distribution brands owned by Saint Gobain (SGOB.PA). Chief Executive John Martin told Reuters that Wolseley had no plans to shift its UK listing to the United States, where it owns U.S. wholesale plumbing supplies distributor Ferguson, adding that it had traded ADRs on the U.S. market.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/china-banks-forex-idUSL4N1ET1N4","Few people seen selling yuan for dollars on first day of China's forex quota re-set","","January 3, 2017 /  11:31 AM / 7 months ago","","BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's authorities have sounded the alarm in recent weeks over the risk of capital outflows from the economy, but there was little evidence at Beijing and Shanghai banks on Tuesday that Chinese individuals were rushing to lock in 2017 quotas to buy foreign exchange. Only a trickle of people at banks were seen selling yuan for dollars on the first business day of the new year, when buyers in theory could have made use of their quotas. Under China's capital controls, individuals are permitted to buy up to $50,000 in foreign exchange a year, and data shows January is typically a standout month for onshore foreign currency deposits. The yuan shed nearly 7 percent against the dollar last year, its poorest showing since 1994, as policymakers struggled to contain capital outflows and preserve foreign exchange reserves in the face of a slowing economy and resurgent dollar. Authorities have tightened monitoring of foreign exchange transactions out of concern over capital outflows. China's currency regulator this week began requiring Chinese individuals who want to buy foreign currencies to specify the purpose of the purchase and provide additional information, and said it would monitor transactions more closely and frequently as well as punish rule-breakers. At major bank branches in two of China's biggest cities, there were no queues on Tuesday, and the few individuals who changed money reported doing so with relative ease. Smooth and Quick The whole process of changing money was pretty smooth and quick, said an office worker surnamed Xu, who withdrew $500 from an ICBC branch in Beijing on Tuesday for a coming vacation in the United States. Several other customers at banks in the two cities reported similar ease when changing amounts of money well below the quota. However, it is unclear how much foreign currency exchange was being conducted online on Tuesday. Central bank data shows onshore foreign exchange deposits rose by almost 32 percent in the first 11 months of 2016, propelled in part by the yuan's fall to eight-year lows. Aside from the rising forex deposits, there has been little indication of growing unease among ordinary Chinese - although the authorities were taking no chances, repeating a mantra that the economy is improving and there is no basis for depreciation of the yuan in the long term. Yang Zhao, chief China economist at Nomura in Hong Kong, said there wasn't any widespread panic about the falling yuan, so he had not expected a surge in demand. In recent months, analysts have noted that the yuan was not alone in falling against the dollar, with most other emerging market currencies also suffering, which has helped keep sentiment around the yuan from souring too much.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-bank-of-america-discrimination-idUSKBN14Q2BB","U.S. housing regulators accuse Bank of America of discriminatory lending","","January 6, 2017 /  8:07 PM / in 7 months","","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) filed charges on Friday against Bank of America (BAC.N) and two of its employees, saying they wrongfully discriminated against prospective Hispanic mortgage borrowers in South Carolina.  HUD said it expects its case against the bank will be heard in federal court, where a judge could potentially order the bank to pay damages, attorneys fees or other equitable relief. A Bank of America spokesperson did not have any immediate comment. This is not the first time that Bank of America has faced allegations of discrimination. The Supreme Court is currently weighing whether to let Miami pursue lawsuits accusing both Bank of America and Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) of engaging in predatory lending against black and Hispanic home buyers. The city accused the banks of steering those borrowers into higher-cost loans that they could not afford. The banks are seeking to quash the lawsuit, arguing that the kind of monetary recovery being sought by Miami is not covered by federal law. A ruling on that case is due by the end of June. The Fair Housing Act makes it illegal to deny or discriminate against people based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status or disability when it comes to issuing mortgages or mortgage modifications. HUD's case on Friday against Bank of America was prompted by a complaint filed by the National Fair Housing Alliance.  The alliance raised concerns about possible discrimination, after it conducted a series of tests in February 2013 through January 2014 to compare how bank employees treated female Hispanic versus non-Hispanic female prospective borrowers in a Charleston-based branch of the bank. The Hispanic borrowers were offered less favorable lending terms compared with the non-Hispanic borrowers and the bank was less prompt in helping connect the Hispanic borrowers with the loan officer, the testing found.  For instance, one non-Hispanic borrower received an estimate with lower closing costs and monthly payments, as well as an offer by the bank to pay $2,000 of her closing costs.  The Hispanic borrower, by contrast, would have faced higher monthly payments and did not receive a similar offer for the bank to cover her closing costs. Reporting by Sarah N.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-banks-regulator-test-idUSKBN19K121","UK regulator reviews business models at retail banks","","June 29, 2017 /  9:34 AM / in a month","","LONDON (Reuters) - The financial regulator has begun a study of how Britain's high street banks make money and said the initial findings due next year would help determine if their approach had to be changed. The study would apply lessons from the 2007-2009 financial crisis when Northern Rock collapsed because of an unsustainable business model, Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), told a conference on Thursday. It coincides with government efforts to increase competition in a sector dominated by HSBC, Lloyds, Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclays. Bailey said 16 new banks had been approved over the last five years and 38 were considering seeking authorisation. My hope is that we can lay out a body of evidence from which conclusions can start to be drawn, Bailey told the British Bankers' Association (BBA) conference, adding that evidence would be gathered into the first half of next year. The study will initially focus on different products and services and their profitability as fewer customers visit bank branches, preferring to use the phone or Internet instead. BBA Chief Executive Anthony Browne told the conference that apps were now the most popular way to access accounts. But he said there was a public interest in access to bank branches, after many have been closed as more customers bank online. Bailey said the study should enable us to assess better the impact of changes – for instance in technology – on retail banking business models. In a separate review to be published in coming months, the FCA has been examining so-called high-cost credit including overdrafts, after lawmakers criticised banks for charging hefty fees for people who overdraw on their accounts. We will then be able to decide if we need to intervene further, Bailey said. Britain has capped high interest rates on payday loans, where customers borrow money against their next monthly wage and usually face steep rates. Critics say the cap risks making it tougher for the most vulnerable to access credit and could drive them into the arms of unregulated loan sharks. Bailey said this had not been the outcome so far. Some lawmakers have called for a wider use of caps, but Bailey said capping everything was not the right approach. Findings from a third review by the regulator, examining how banks assess customers' understanding of their products and services, are also due to be published soon. Some lawmakers have called for the banks to end what they call free banking for those in credit because they say it simply means other services, such as overdrafts, are charged more heavily and that often hurts the less well off more. I do not advocate ending free-if-in-credit banking. Why? Because there is no such thing to start with, Bailey said, adding that it simply meant some customers paid more or less than others depending on what products they used.

Wells, the third-largest U.S. bank by assets, spent 61.1 cents for every dollar of revenue it generated in the second quarter. While that was an improvement from the first quarter, Wells' efficiency ratio remains above a targeted range of 55 to 59 cents in costs per dollar of revenue. Operating at this level is just not acceptable, Chief Executive Officer Tim Sloan said on a conference call with analysts to discuss results, echoing comments on costs he made earlier this year. Wells Fargo has been taking measures to cut $4 billion from its annual expenses by 2019, including branch closures, curtailing travel and entertainment costs and even reducing the amount of postage it uses. However, it takes about a year for savings to trickle down to the bottom line once branches close, said Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry. The bank is also facing elevated costs for technology as well as legal and regulatory matters. Some of that relates to a sales scandal that erupted last year involving the bank's creation of as many as 2.1 million accounts in customers' names without their permission.  Wells had to spend an additional $110 million on third-party services related to the scandal last quarter. It also added to legal reserves for various matters, including regulatory investigations into its residential mortgage-backed securities business. Four analysts brought up expenses during the call, including Deutsche Bank analyst Matthew O'Connor, who pushed executives to explain why they do not offer an absolute target for costs the way some other big banks do. I think it's something worth considering, he said. I think it would be helpful for your stock. Wells shares were down 1.9 percent at $54.54 on Friday afternoon, with analysts citing high expenses and weak revenue as disappointments, even though the bank managed to beat Wall Street's profit expectations. Its net income rose 4.5 percent to $5.40 billion, or $1.07 per share, in the quarter ended June. 30, topping the average analyst estimate of $1.01, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue remained flat at $22.17 billion and missed analysts' average estimate of $22.47 billion, with weakness in mortgages and wholesale banking.  Non-interest expenses rose 5 percent to $13.54 billion. It was not all gloom, however. Net interest income, a measure that reflects earnings relative to funding costs, rose 6.4 percent to $12.48 billion thanks to loan growth, higher interest rates and keeping a lid on deposit costs. Oppenheimer & Co analyst Chris Kotowski called the results lackluster, and questioned whether problems related to the sales scandal were hurting Wells' underlying businesses. The one bright spot, he said, was that customers' delinquency and default rates looked good.

N26, previously known as Number26, has expanded rapidly since it launched in early 2015 as a smartphone-only bank with no local branches, with the backing of major global investors including Silicon Valley's Peter Thiel.  Vincent Haupert, a research fellow and PhD student in the computer science department of the University of Erlangen-Nuernberg, told the Chaos Communications Congress in Hamburg how he and two colleagues found N26 security defenses riddled with holes that could have been used to defraud thousands of users.  They say you can open a bank account in just eight minutes, Haupert said. As it turns out, you can lose it even faster. In a statement, N26 thanked Haupert for alerting the company to a theoretical security vulnerability and advising it on fixes, which N26 said it completed this month. N26 offers a range of online banking and other financial services to 200,000 customers in 17 European countries through a banking license granted earlier this year by German financial regulator Bafin. N26 executives have been the most outspoken among new fintech players in arguing traditional banks are failing to serve customers more directly by relying on antiquated local branch relationships instead of modern, phone-based services. I don't see banks at all as my competitors. They just can't move fast enough, N26 Chief Executive Valentin Stalf told Reuters last year. Haupert told the Chaos conference, Europe's biggest annual gathering of hackers, how his team had found numerous ways to attack N26 banking apps to hijack individual customer accounts. With such a strategy, fintechs squander the trust that banks established over years, he said. For example, Haupert said he compared data from a leak of 68 million account credentials from online file sharing company Dropbox with information on N26 users he was able to request from the company's own software feed to identify 33,000 N26 user credentials - without being thwarted by N26 anti-fraud systems.  From there, he said it would have been simple to send a phishing email to these N26 customers that could potentially have allowed him to break into their accounts.  Don't worry, we didn't do this, Haupert said. My professor had legal concerns. Instead, Haupert disclosed his research findings to N26 on Sept. 25. In response, N26 said in a statement it had made customer accounts more secure by reducing and encrypting data transfers, by blocking brute-force attacks in which hackers can quickly guess user credentials, and fixing voice-recognition security weaknesses in its app for the newest Apple mobile devices.  At no time during these scenarios was personal data of our customers available to third parties, the statement said. No N26 customer was impacted by the demonstrated vulnerabilities. It added: We have fully addressed and closed all vulnerabilities promptly and completely and quoted Haupert as saying earlier this month that all vulnerabilities he had uncovered appeared to have been fixed.   Still, Haupert said regulators needed to take a closer look at the security of banks.

Monmouth University will establish the Bruce Springsteen Archives and Center for American Music at its campus in the borough of West Long Branch, just miles from Asbury Park where he forged his career. The archive will include all of the Born to Run singer's recorded works as well as posters, photos, articles and other artifacts. Slideshow (3 Images)The center will preserve and promote the legacy of Bruce Springsteen and his role in American music, the university said in a statement. It will also highlight the work of other American musicians, including Woody Guthrie, Frank Sinatra and Robert Johnson. It will include a collection housed at Monmouth University since 2011, and will continue to accept works and memorabilia from Springsteen, fans and other donors, school spokeswoman Tara Peters said. The archives will be available for viewing by the public by appointment only at Monmouth, which is one of nine university affiliates of the Grammy Museum in Los Angeles, Peters said.  Springsteen, 67, who rose from playing in the gritty clubs of the Jersey Shore to international superstardom, has long maintained a home in, and close ties to, the Garden State roots.  When the New Jersey coastline was battered by Hurricane Sandy in 2012, Springsteen, along with fellow New Jersey native Jon Bon Jovi, headlined a concert to benefit victims of the storm. Springsteen is also an outspoken supporter of Democratic politics, campaigning for President Barack Obama ahead of the 2012 U.S. presidential election and backing Democrat Hillary Clinton in November's election.

Shamelessly, the British have recently called ...

So I want to assure you that I am clear-eyed about the threat that Iran poses to the Gulf and the wider Middle East, she told the summit in Bahrain on Dec. 7. Khamenei accused the United States and Britain of provoking conflicts among the main Sunni and Shi'ite branches of Islam and said: The old British policy of 'divide and conquer' is seriously on the agenda of Islam's enemies.   Iranian media reported on Saturday that the foreign ministry had summoned a top British diplomat in Tehran to protest against British criticism of its actions in Syria.

U.S.-based Citi, which is marking its 50th anniversary in South Korea, said it plans to grow its target customer base in wealth management by 50 percent by 2020 with new offices in Seoul, Dogok and Bundang. The bank, which has close to 3 million consumer banking clients in South Korea, also aims to boost consumer banking deposits by 30 percent, up from $10 billion currently and will boost investments in technology. The number of clients visiting branches has fallen dramatically, Brendan Carney, consumer banking head of Citi in South Korea, said in a statement.  We are responding to the changing preferences of our clients by investing further in digitization that allows us to serve customers wherever they want to bank with us. Citi said it aimed to acquire 80 percent of new credit card customers via digital platforms by 2020. A focus on rich young Asians and new products has helped Citi accelerate net new money growth at its Asia-Pacific consumer wealth business in 2016 to about 10 percent, and similar annual growth is expected over the next few years. Anand Selvakesari, its Asia-Pacific consumer banking head, said in January that growth in net new money, a key measure of profitability of the wealth business, improved in 2016 from around mid-single digit levels in the last four to five years. In 2015, the number of high net worth individuals - those with $1 million or more in investable assets - grew by 2.2 percent in South Korea, while Singapore saw a decline of 3.5 percent and India rose by 1.1 percent, according to the latest available Capgemini Financial Services Analysis report.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-accounts-pensions-regulations-idUSKBN13X1DD","No big makeover of pensions rules, says global accounting body","","December 8, 2016 /  12:42 PM / in 8 months","","LONDON (Reuters) - A global accounting body has dismissed calls for root and branch reform of its rules for defined benefit pension schemes, saying they must reflect risks to investors. The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) has come under fire from critics who say its rules unfairly inflate pension deficits in defined benefit schemes because liabilities are measured according to bond yields, which have fallen to record lows for a prolonged period. The sheer size of deficits in some company-defined benefit schemes has become a stumbling block in mergers and company rescues.  With interest rates being so low for so long, some are reopening an old debate about the measurement of the pension liability, IASB Chairman Hans Hoogervorst said in a speech in the Netherlands on Thursday. IASB accounting standards are used in over 100 countries, including the European Union, but not the United States. Critics of the IASB rules say many pension funds invest in shares, which historically have given higher returns than bonds and therefore fewer assets should be needed to cover liabilities. Hoogervorst said that while its accounting rules for pension schemes were a bit out of date and are being looked at by the board, there are no grounds for radical changes. Accounting rules provide information for investors in companies and must therefore include risks, he said. Booking a profit from investments in shares before they are earned would not be prudent. For these reasons the IASB rejects calls to fundamentally change pension accounting to eliminate or reduce pension deficits, Hoogervorst said. It is looking at how its rules could cater better for the increased use of hybrid schemes which define pension liabilities more flexibly. Many defined benefit schemes have been closed to employees joining a company and replaced with schemes which pay out according to how investments perform in financial markets, rather than based on a commitment to pay a certain amount.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-obama-defense-idUSKBN14C29E","Obama signs defense spending bill, criticizes Guantanamo policy","","December 23, 2016 /  10:06 PM / 7 months ago","","HONOLULU (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama on Friday signed into law an annual defense policy bill, but in a lengthy statement he raised objections to parts of it, including policies blocking him from closing the detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Obama pledged in his 2008 presidential campaign to close the military prison, but his efforts have been blocked by mostly Republican opposition in Congress. The Democratic president has instead reduced the population there by transferring prisoners to other countries.  The administration recently told Congress it would move up to 18 more prisoners of the 59 remaining at Guantanamo before Obama leaves office next month. During my administration, we have responsibly transferred over 175 detainees from Guantanamo, Obama said in the statement on Friday. Our efforts to transfer additional detainees will continue until the last day I am in office. President-elect Donald Trump, who will be sworn in on Jan. 20, said during the campaign that he would keep the Guantanamo Bay facility open and vowed to load it up with some bad dudes. The $618.7 billion defense spending bill passed by the Republican-controlled Congress this month was a compromise version that dropped controversial language requiring women to register for the draft. But it kept some Republican-backed initiatives Obama had opposed. The legislation boosts military spending when there has been no similar increase in non-defense funding, and it bars closures of military bases even though top Pentagon officials say they have too much capacity.     House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, a Republican, said on Friday the legislation would give U.S. troops a pay raise and praised the Guantanamo language. This ensures that, right up until his last hour in office, President Obama will not be able to transfer Guantanamo Bay detainees to the United States, Ryan said in a statement. Obama's predecessor George W. Bush opened the facility to hold terrorism suspects rounded up overseas following the Sept. 11 attacks. Under Bush, the prison came to symbolize aggressive detention practices that opened the United States to accusations of torture. Obama has maintained for years that he considers onerous restrictions on his ability to transfer prisoners a violation of the U.S. Constitution's separation of powers between Congress and the executive branch. But he gave no indication he would try to override those restrictions. Reflecting the growing migration of espionage and warfare into cyberspace, Obama also said on Friday that he favors splitting the U.S. Cyber Command, which conducts offensive operations, from the National Security Agency and making it independent, similar to the military's European and Pacific Commands.

It said the deal to buy the stake from Oger Middle East Holdings, part of the Lebanon's Hariri family business empire, involved a consortium including 40 investors, a majority of them Jordanian. Masri, one of Jordan's major businessmen with stakes in other banks and the hotel industry, led the negotiations after the family of Saudi Arabia's Fawaz Alhokair dropped a planned $1.1 billion offer. A source close to the deal said Masri was the single largest investor in the consortium, acquiring a quarter of the Hariri family's 20 percent stake in the bank. QInvest, a Qatari investment bank, said in a statement it was the sole financial advisor to the consortium. Masri told Reuters the purchase price was 6.25 dinars ($8.82) per share. Arab Bank's shares closed at 6.32 dinars on Wednesday. Arab Bank is one of the Arab world's largest privately owned banks and operates in 30 countries. It owns 40 percent of Saudi Arabia's Arab National Bank ANB. Arab Bank's growth has long been tied to its regional and global expansion. The bank has assets of more than $46 billion, 600 branches on five continents and a reputation for withstanding political upheaval. This sale will enhance the stability of the banking sector and is a vote of confidence in Jordan's economy at this time, Masri said. Jordan's authorities, who consider Arab Bank a pillar of the country's economy, had resisted any non-Jordanian investor becoming the single largest shareholder in the bank. Jordan had sought to prevent Hariri family business entities from taking greater control at the bank nearly a decade ago. Arab Bank's 2016 net profit rose 20 percent to $533 million which it attributed to diversified operations and growth in revenue from core banking activities. Construction giant Saudi Oger began seeking buyers for its stake in the bank over a year ago to help ease cashflow problems brought on by difficulties in the Saudi building sector. It owes around 15 billion riyals ($4 billion) to banks, plus billions more to contractors, suppliers and employees, sources told Reuters in September. The Arab Bank stake sale was expected to help it repay a $1.03 billion loan from regional and international banks due to mature this month.

Grohmann Engineering, a maker of automated manufacturing systems which Tesla agreed to buy in November, is key to the Silicon Valley carmaker's bid to succeed in the mass market by massively ramping up its output. Since then, Tesla has given job guarantees and pay rises to the firm's 700 employees in the small town of Pruem close to the Belgian border, under threat of strike action organised by powerful trade union IG Metall. The head of Grohmann's works council, Uwe Herzig, said Tesla had offered another 1,000 euro ($1,089) one-off payment after Easter, on top of job guarantees, pay rises and stock options. He added that Klaus Grohmann, under whose leadership Tesla had been planning to run the business, suddenly retired at the end of last month. In November we were told that everything would remain the same, and then on March 31 we were surprised to hear that he will retire, Herzig told a news conference, adding Klaus Grohmann had not been seen at the company since then. A Klaus Grohmann listed in the German telephone directory as living close to Pruem was not immediately reachable by phone. Tesla in Germany did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Tesla has pledged to create an additional 1,000 jobs at Grohmann, which it has renamed Tesla Grohmann Automation, as it seeks to increase output to half a million vehicles next year from around 80,000 in 2016. Grohmann has helped Tesla rivals Daimler and BMW build production facilities for electric car batteries. Herzig said Grohmann had given Tesla priority over existing customers. The takeover and expansion plans by Tesla have prompted IG Metall to demand that Tesla Grohmann Automation adopts collective wage agreements and job guarantees above and beyond an existing pledge to guarantee Grohmann jobs for five years. Christian Schmitz, head of IG Metall's Trier branch, said concessions made by Tesla to guarantee jobs were encouraging but they were not the collective guarantees customary among German unionised workforces. Furthermore, key parts of the workforce at Grohmann were being paid around 25 to 30 percent below an industry-wide collective agreement for the metalworker electric industry sector, IG Metall said.. $1 = 0.9185 euros

 (Updates prices)
    By Nithin ThomasPrasad
    BENGALURU, June 21 (Reuters) - Gold inched up on Wednesday
after hitting its lowest in five weeks in the previous session,
buoyed as equities fell and the dollar eased from one-month
highs following a tumble in crude oil prices. 
    A renewed slump in oil markets to seven-month lows put Asian
investors on edge, and pushed down U.S. Treasury yields and the
dollar index against a basket of currencies.                  
    It's mostly the dollar (supporting gold). It is a little
bit weaker than yesterday's closing, said Yuichi Ikemizu, Tokyo
branch manager at ICBC Standard Bank.  
    Spot gold        was up 0.2 percent at $1,245.82 per ounce,
as of 0801 GMT.
    U.S. gold futures         for August delivery climbed 0.3
percent to $1,246.7 per ounce
    Gold is also being supported by a bout of short-covering
following its recent weakness, said OCBC analyst Barnabas Gan.
    However, the possibility of another interest rate hike by
the U.S. Federal Reserve this year is underpinning the bearish
outlook for the yellow metal, he added.  
    Meanwhile, the outlook for inflation and the future of
financial stability are emerging as dueling concerns at the
heart of a debate at the U.S. central bank over how fast to
proceed on future interest-rate hikes.             
    Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan on Tuesday expressed
doubt that short-term interest rates are very accommodative and
said he wants to wait for more data to understand whether recent
weak inflation readings are transitory as he suspects.
            
    Higher interest rates tend to boost the dollar and push bond
yields up, pressuring gold prices by increasing the opportunity
cost of holding non-yielding bullion.    
    Spot gold may break resistance at $1,248 per ounce and rise
towards the next resistance level at $1,251, as it has managed
to stabilize around support at $1,243, according to Reuters
technical analyst Wang Tao.
    A lack of solid data this week globally won't be helping
gold's direction in either way, said OANDA analyst Jeffrey
Halley.
    Russia's central bank posted an increase in gold reserves in
May, the fifth consecutive month of gains.             
    Among other precious metals, silver        gained 0.1
percent to $16.47 per ounce, hovering near a six-week low hit in
the previous session.
    Platinum        slid 0.1 percent to $917.25 per ounce, while
palladium        was flat at $867.99 per ounce.

China Exim Bank is already financing the first phase of the railway, from the Kenyan port of Mombasa to the capital Nairobi. Solomon Ouna, the railway's project advisor, said that section is 98 percent complete and will start commercial operations in January 2018.  Kenya's rail link with landlocked Uganda is expected to lower transport costs and boost trade. The first phase, covering 472 km, will cost $3.8 billion and cut the journey between Nairobi and Mombasa to four and a half hours from 13 hours or more currently.  Kenya signed an agreement in March with China Communications Construction Company (CCCC) to extend the railway to the town of Malaba on the Ugandan border. However, financing was not part of the deal.  China Exim Bank has expressed an intention to finance this, Atanas Maina, Kenya Railways managing director, told a news conference.  From the Kenya Railways side, we have finalised the commercial agreement and we believe that in the course of next year, we may be able to close the financing of that particular section.  The 370 kilometer (230 mile) third section, which will include a branch to the Kenyan town of Kisumu next to Lake Victoria, will cost $4.9 billion to construct and supply with locomotives and rolling stock, Kenya Railways said.

He would be the world's oldest prime minister if that happened. Mahathir, along with Najib's former deputy, Muhyiddin Yassin - fired last year for questioning his boss about the scandal - have formed a new party called Bersatu (Unite). It has opened branches in 165 of parliament's 222 constituencies, Muhyiddin told Reuters, a feat few opposition parties have managed. During his 1981-2003 rule, Mahathir championed modernization by switching Malaysia's focus from plantations and mining to a diversified high-tech manufacturing base on the back of foreign investment. He built the world's tallest buildings at the time, the Petronas Twin Towers. A considerable fan base is excited about his comeback. I was still young when Mahathir was prime minister. And I thought anything was possible ... maybe cars could fly, said Nazariah Harun, a former government party supporter in the southern state of Johor, bordering Singapore. Mahathir also dealt ruthlessly with opponents, jailing his former deputy - and now alliance partner - Anwar Ibrahim on corruption and sodomy charges in the late 1990s.  The opposition alliance hopes to capitalize on a couple of scandals that are resonating in rural Malaysia. One is around the state's 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) strategic development fund that Najib, 63, founded after taking power in 2009. Its murky transactions through overseas front companies and Middle Eastern partners, many of them exposed by foreign media reports, have bewildered the public over the past two years. Najib insisted he did nothing wrong when it leaked to the media that $700 million wound up in his bank account before the 2013 election. The other scandal, involving state plantation company FELDA, is more problematic because it directly affects tens of thousands of small landholders in the heartlands. They are a key vote bank for Najib's party, the United Malay National Organisation (UMNO). Umno Patronage The 1,600 residents of Kuala Sin, a village of farmers and rubber tappers in Mahathir's home state of Kedah, are switching from UMNO to Bersatu, says UMNO's former chief there. I’ve held the ballot box here (for UMNO) from 1962 until 2014... but this year, God willing, UMNO will lose, said 77-year-old Ramli Mat Akib at his weathered two-storey wooden home in Kuala Sin. The UMNO branch office opposite his home has closed. Mahthir's son Mukhriz, who leads Bersatu's campaign in Kedah, believes it is making huge headway in rural Malaysia. It goes all the way down to the branches, and in Kedah very many UMNO branches have dissolved, Mukhriz told Reuters. UMNO says that isn't true nationwide. We have a lot of young people queuing up to sign up at our headquarters as new party members. I don't see a problem at all, said UMNO's secretary general Tengku Adnan Mansor. Despite the scandals, Najib commands the loyalty of UMNO chieftains. Patronage has much to do with that.  An UMNO leader needs to distribute largesse to guarantee chiefs' support and they, in turn, operate an affirmative action plan for ethnic Malays first introduced in 1971. The policy gives majority Malays government contracts, cheap housing, guaranteed university admissions and preferential stock shares. Government-appointed village committees also provide cradle-to-grave assistance. This makes the villagers closely dependent on the committee, and that makes the committee supreme and also makes UMNO supreme, said Radzi Ayob, 54, a veteran UMNO leader in Kedah, who joined Bersatu last year. But most Malays have moved to cities and even those in the countryside are less reliant on the rural welfare model.     As it is now, UMNO still needs Malaysians but Malaysians may not need UMNO, Radzi said. An Ipo That Flopped  No leadership surveys have been published in Malaysia recently, but sources in UMNO say an internal poll in April showed Najib winning 128 of the 222 parliamentary seats, down  from the current 131. A government source told Reuters Najib's cabinet had been preparing to call polls in September, but the timing has since become less clear in the wake of the scandals. Now nothing is firm, he said. Malaysia's opposition won only 40 percent of the seats in the 2013 election despite winning 51 percent of the popular vote, thanks to a first-past-the-post system that awards seats based on a plurality of votes. Just before the 2013 election, Najib spun off a listed company of FELDA and gave its Malay landowners and suppliers, known as settlers, the opportunity to buy preferential shares. They are less than thrilled about it today. The shares have plunged 70 percent since the $3 billion listing. The anti-corruption agency is investigating officials  at the listed company, Felda Global Ventures Holdings, with the FELDA chairman himself raising questions about what happened to the IPO proceeds. They basically told us we will be rich, said Md Isa Md Yassan, 59, a palm oil grower in Muhyiddin's home constituency of Pagoh. The settlers are just dissatisfied and it's not just me feeling it... everyone feels the same way. Curtailing Dissent Najib has kept a lid on the scandals by curbing dissent.  The main media outlets are allied to his government. Anwar, the charismatic opposition figure, is in jail on what critics say was another trumped-up sodomy conviction in 2014. Najib has revived a colonial-era subversion law allowing him to jail opponents without trial. The only conviction in the 1MDB scandal was of a legislator -- who publicized alleged wrongdoing at the fund. But Najib is riding a good economy into the election. The ringgit has been one of Asia's strongest currencies, stocks have hit a two-year high, and economic growth was 5.6 percent in the first quarter. And an opposition victory, however unlikely, would put Malaysia into uncharted waters and likely trigger fears of a short-term plunge in financial markets. Analysts, however, say Mahathir's entry into the electoral fray supporting an Anwar-led opposition alliance does represents a real threat to UMNO.     If the two leaders can revive a reversed role of their previous partnership displayed so effectively when they were in national leadership in the 1990s, the opposition could have a winning formula, said Yang Razali Kassim, senior fellow at S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS) in Singapore. Mahathir supporting Anwar, in a spirit of genuine reconciliation, will be a powerful combination.  Salbiah Kassim, a member of the UMNO women's wing in Kedah, saw parallels to Brexit and U.S. President Donald Trump's election win. Just like overseas, things can change, she said. We don't know where the silent voters will go.                 ($1 = 4.2855 ringgit)     For a graphic on past election results 1999-2013, click tmsnrt.rs/2tfzLeQ Editing by Bill Tarrant"

Its acquisition of Swiss rival BSI from Brazil's Grupo BTG Pactual SA has made EFG one of Switzerland's biggest private banks, behind the likes of UBS, Credit Suisse, Julius Baer and Pictet. The acquisition was announced in February and completed in November for a preliminary 1.06 billion Swiss francs ($1.05 billion). EFG said it now expects 100 to 150 job cuts per year between 2017 and 2019.  Having conducted a more detailed analysis, additional synergies have been identified which will support us in building an efficient business of substantial scale to deliver sustainable growth, EFG Chief Executive Joachim Straehle said in a statement. The cuts are across EFG and BSI, with around two thirds expected to take place in Switzerland. The merged bank has around 3,800 employees.  Zurich-based EFG, whose largest shareholder is Greece's Latsis family, also raised its targeted cost savings from the takeover by 55 million francs to around 240 million by 2019.  EFG will close BSI's Panama branch late next year and has agreed a partial sale of BSI Bahamas client portfolios. It also plans to sell its Independent Financial Advisers business in Britain.  Overall, EFG now expects the BSI integration to cost around 250 million francs between 2016 and 2018, up from 200 million previously forecast.   The bank manages 148 billion francs in assets, although EFG forecasts outflows of around 10 billion francs over the next three years resulting from the BSI deal.  The acquisition was complicated by BSI's legal troubles which included its dealings with scandal-hit Malaysian government fund 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB).

The legislation to amend the Statistics Act, introduced to parliament by Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains, would also give the chief statistician a renewable five-year term and create an advisory council to ensure the agency is transparent. Our government believes that for a national statistical agency to be credible, there must be a high degree of professional independence, Bains told reporters. StatCan releases the country's official economic data on everything from jobs to trade in reports that are closely watched by markets and investors. The agency has been dogged by controversy over its independence from the government, in part because of technological problems the Liberal government inherited from the previous Conservative government. The agency was criticized earlier this year for technological issues that delayed the release of some economic reports on its website. StatCan was also forced to withdraw a jobs report in 2014, citing a flaw in the way the figures had been processed. The monthly report can be volatile, often prompting economists to question its validity. The proposed changes to the law, certain to be passed by the Liberal majority government, were part of the Liberals' 2015 campaign promise to reinforce the agency's independence, which previous had been independent by convention only. The agency's top statistician, Wayne Smith, resigned in September after complaining for months that the centralization of data services under Shared Services Canada gave the technical branch an effective veto over many decision of StatCan. The proposed changes would also remove from the Statistics Act the threat of imprisonment for those who refuse to respond to mandatory surveys, replacing the penalty with a fine.

kwacha and Ghana's cedi are seen strengthening against the
dollar in the next week to Thursday, while the Nigerian naira is
seen weakening, traders said.
    
    KENYA
    The Kenyan shilling        could strengthen in the week
ahead due to foreign exchange inflows from charities and
horticulture exporters outweighing subsiding dollar demand from
oil importers , traders said. 
    Commercial banks quoted the shilling at 103.20/40 per
dollar, compared with 102.95/103.05 at last Thursday's close.
    Once the oil importer demand is out of the way, we should
see the shilling regain some ground, said a trader from a
commercial bank. 
    
    UGANDA
   The Uganda shilling        is seen weakening moderately in
the coming days, as anticipated government spending triggers an
uptick in demand for hard currency.
    Commercial banks quoted the shilling at 3,605/3,615, little
changed from last Thursday's close of 3,610/3,620. 
    If those (government) funds come through, we might see some
dollar purchases, David Bagambe, a trader at Diamond Trust Bank
Uganda, said.
     
    TANZANIA
    The Tanzanian shilling        is expected to remain
range-bound in the coming days due to relatively slow trading
conditions.
    Commercial banks quoted the shilling at 2,233/2,238 to the
dollar on Thursday, unchanged from a week ago.
    The outlook for next week is that of stability ... we do
not expect any big movement of the local currency due to the
prevailing subdued market conditions, said a trader at a
commercial bank in Dar es Salaam.
    
    GHANA
    Ghana’s cedi        is seen extending its rally against
sustained dollar inflows from offshore investors buying
long-dated local securities, analysts said.
    After touching record lows of 4.7420 to the dollar early
this month, the cedi has steadily recouped, rallying to 4.2100
by mid-morning on Thursday compared to 4.3700 a week ago. It is
down 0.37 percent since January, according to Reuters data.
   The resultant inflows and growing confidence in the economy
is likely to extend the cedi's gains recorded in the last four
weeks. Joseph Biggles Amponsah, analyst at the Accra-based
Dortis Research said.
    
    NIGERIA
    Nigerian naira          is seen weakening further on the
black market even as the central bank moves to improve hard
currency liquidity in both the parallel and official interbank
windows yield little results.
    The local currency was quoted at 398 to the dollar on the
black market on Thursday, compared with 380 per dollar last
week, while commercial lenders are yet to put up any quote as
11.11 GMT. The local currency however closed at the official
window at 306.20 to the dollar.
    Traders said in spite of the improvement in dollar supply to
the bureaux, demand pressure has increased due to speculators
betting that the naira would still depreciate further in the
coming weeks.
  
    ZAMBIA
    The Kwacha        is expected to maintain its bullish run
against the US dollar next week supported by hard currency flows
from companies looking to meet their mid-month tax obligations.
    Commercial banks quoted the currency of Africa's No.2 copper
producer at 9.4500 per dollar from a close of 9.5700  per dollar
a week ago.
    The local unit is expected to stand tall in the interim,
the Zambian branch of Atlas Mara, BancABC said in a market note.

China Exim Bank is already financing the first phase of the railway, from the Kenyan port of Mombasa to the capital Nairobi. Solomon Ouna, the railway's project advisor, said that section is 98 percent complete and will start commercial operations in January 2018.  Kenya's rail link with landlocked Uganda is expected to lower transport costs and boost trade. The first phase, covering 472 km, will cost $3.8 billion and cut the journey between Nairobi and Mombasa to four and a half hours from 13 hours or more currently.  Kenya signed an agreement in March with China Communications Construction Company (CCCC) to extend the railway to the town of Malaba on the Ugandan border. However, financing was not part of the deal.  China Exim Bank has expressed an intention to finance this, Atanas Maina, Kenya Railways managing director, told a news conference.  From the Kenya Railways side, we have finalised the commercial agreement and we believe that in the course of next year, we may be able to close the financing of that particular section.  The 370 kilometer (230 mile) third section, which will include a branch to the Kenyan town of Kisumu next to Lake Victoria, will cost $4.9 billion to construct and supply with locomotives and rolling stock, Kenya Railways said. In October, Kenya Railways launched construction of the second phase of the railway, a $1.5 billion 120 km section linking Nairobi to the Rift Valley town of Naivasha.

Moritomo Gakuen, an educational institution in the western  city of Osaka that also operates a kindergarten promoting patriotism based on Japanese traditions and culture, will open an elementary school in April that had been set to have Akie Abe as honorary principal. Yasunori Kagoike, who is president of Moritomo Gakuen, heads the Osaka branch of Nippon Kaigi, or Japan Conference, a nationalist lobby group with close ties to the prime minister and his cabinet. Abe, grilled about the issue in a parliamentary committee on Friday, said his wife had tried to refuse the position of honorary principal but accepted after it was announced in front of parents. Despite this, she decided that it would be detrimental for both the students and the parents if she continued and so she told them she would resign, he said. On the web site of the elementary school, Akie had said: I was impressed by Mr. Kagoike's passion for education and have assumed the post of honorary principal. But the comments were removed from the website on Thursday. It is true that she was on the web site as honorary principal but at her request, this was removed, Abe said. Abe reiterated that he had declined to allow his name to be used when Moritomo Gakuen solicited donations for what it called the Abe Shinzo Memorial Elementary School. He has also denied that either he or his wife had been involved in the school's getting approval or in its acquisition of the state-owned land for school grounds. Moritomo Gakuen last year bought an 8,770-square-metre plot of government-owned land for 134 million yen ($1.2 million), or 14 percent of its appraisal price, to build a new elementary school, according to official data. Officials have said the difference reflected the cost for cleanup of waste at the site. Finance Minister Taro Aso said in parliament earlier this week that there were no problems with the purchase.

Reuters first reported the incident earlier Tuesday, which a source familiar with the matter said also affected a USCIS facility in Philadelphia. Employees began experiencing problems logging into networks Tuesday morning due to a problem related to domain controllers, or servers that process authentication requests, which could not validate personal identity verification (PIV) cards used by federal workers and contractors to access certain information systems, according to the source. Some employees were able to access systems through a virtual private network. It was not clear if other branches of DHS were affected. The source characterized the issue as one stemming from relatively benign information technology missteps and a failure to ensure network redundancy. There was no evidence of foul play, the source said, adding that it appeared the domain controller credentials had expired on Monday when offices were closed for the federal Presidents Day holiday. We are working to track all device certificate issuance and expirations to ensure future lapses of service do not occur, the DHS official said in the statement.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-jpmorgan-mortgages-idUSKBN15V207","JPMorgan moving mortgages online to please paper-weary customers","","February 16, 2017 /  3:11 PM / 5 months ago","","NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) is gradually introducing a digital mortgage platform where customers can apply online and track applications by mobile phone. The tools will allow customers to submit and sign documents online and exchange messages with bank staff and real-estate agents so loans can close more quickly and easily, consumer mortgage chief Mike Weinbach said in an interview. This platform will allow us to be where more of our customers are, which is online and on their phones, Weinbach said. It is more efficient for customers and for us. Applying for a mortgage can make or break a bank's relationship with a customer because home purchases are often the most expensive, complex and emotional transactions people make in their lifetimes. JPMorgan started pilot-testing its digital tools in recent weeks and will make them available to more people before completing the rollout in 2018. Offering the process online has become an imperative as customers have lost patience with the tedious and paperwork-heavy ordeal. Some 150,000 home loans JPMorgan made last year came through its branches and telephone lines, which will continue to be available for applications. Five years in the future, every lender is going to have a digital offering for their customers, or they're probably not going to be in business, Weinbach said. Detroit-based Quicken Loans Inc first brought digital home loans into the mainstream about a year ago with a major advertising campaign for its Rocket Mortgage product. Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) introduced a Home Loan Navigator tool in June to handle applications online. It is more important for us to get it right for our customers, said Weinbach. It is less important for us to be first. The bank is using technology from Roostify, which sells software to the mortgage industry. Founders of the San Francisco-based company have said they started it after their own frustrations with buying homes. JPMorgan is the No. 2 U.S. mortgage lender, behind Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), according to Inside Mortgage Finance data for the first nine months of 2016. In the past few years, Quicken climbed to No. 3, in part because of the ease with which its customers can process applications. Bank of America ranked fourth.

An offshoot of the Jund al-Aqsa group killed roughly 150-200 members of rebel factions and of another Islamist alliance in the village of Khan Sheikhoun in southern Idlib province, they said. They had been arrested and held captive for six days during clashes that broke out in the area, in the increasingly bloody infighting between different militant groups.  Dozens of those executed were members of a Free Syrian Army (FSA) faction, Jaish al-Nasr. Abdul Hakim al-Rahmon, head of Jaish al-Nasr's political wing, confirmed that 70 fighters from the group were executed eight days ago, vowing to attack in response. He said more than 160 FSA fighters were killed in total, plus another 43 from Tahrir al-Sham - which includes the former al Qaeda branch in Syria, Jabhat Fateh al-Sham - who had been killed immediately after the militants stormed a court run by Tahrir al Sham in the same area. They were all liquidated at the same time, he said. The U.S.-based security monitoring service SITE reported on Wednesday, citing a pro-al Qaeda social media outlet, that a total of 150 members of rebel factions had been killed. They included more than 70 from Jaish al-Nasr, and fighters from the Tahrir al-Sham alliance.  Jund al-Aqsa is seen as ideologically close to Islamic State, al Qaeda's main jihadist rival. Fighting between Jund al-Aqsa and Tahrir al-Sham has flared in the past week, in clashes that war monitors say have killed dozens. Those clashes have added to the complexity of insurgent infighting in the west of the country. Both Tahrir al-Sham and Jund al-Aqsa are also fighting against FSA rebel factions who have been foreign-backed. Jihadist groups attacked the FSA for sending delegates to peace talks in Kazakhstan last month.  Many of those FSA groups are now fighting under the banner of the more moderate but powerful Islamist Ahrar al-Sham.

Alexandre Moraes, a 49-year-old lawyer, law professor and former public security secretary of Sao Paulo state, vowed to remain absolutely impartial when judging any corruption cases involving his former cabinet colleagues or Temer himself. Moraes was approved on a 55-to-13 vote. Leftist senators slammed his appointment as a move to protect Temer's government from the sprawling Car Wash kickback investigation that threatens to implicate a large swath of Brazil's political establishment. Six members of Temer's cabinet as well as the president himself have been named in plea bargain testimony by defendants in Brazil's biggest corruption scandal, and many of the ministers could end up on trial before the Supreme Court. Moraes declined to say if he would recuse himself if the Supreme Court eventually judges a case involving allegedly illegal campaign funding of the successful 2014 presidential campaign ticket, when Temer was the vice president to the now-impeached President Dilma Rousseff. Critics say he should recuse himself in any cases that come before the Supreme Court, given his extremely close ties to the people who may be put on trial before the court.

The court is so slow in dealing with its case overload, critics say, that the so-called privileged forum is tantamount to impunity.  At Tuesday's 10-hour hearing on his nomination, Moraes denied reports in local media that he plagiarized a Spanish jurist in one of his law books, including passages that were nearly identical. He also refuted claims from some senators during his confirmation process that his law firm in Sao Paulo defended a transportation firm linked to Brazil's largest drug gang, the First Command of the Capital, known as the PCC. The claims have also been reported in local media. Moraes would take the seat left by Justice Teori Zavascki, who died in a small plane crash last month. Zavascki handled the cases of politicians involved in the Car Wash probe and was widely respected for his work on the highly politicized investigations.

The company has provided notice to Wells Fargo that it may seek indemnification under the MyTerm distribution agreement, Prudential said in a Feb. 17 regulatory filing. It was unclear how much in costs Prudential may seek. A push by the Newark, New Jersey-based insurer for Wells to cover its costs could become another headache for the San Francisco-based bank, whose sales practices have been under a spotlight. Last year, federal regulators ordered Wells Fargo to pay $190 million in fines and restitution because they said its high pressure sales environment pushed employees to open as many as 2 million deposit and credit card accounts without customers' permission. A Wells spokesman declined to comment on the filing. In December, Prudential suspended the distribution of MyTerm, a low-cost life insurance policy it sold through Wells, pending a review of how the product was sold by the bank. Prudential's move followed a wrongful termination lawsuit filed in New Jersey by three former managers in its corporate investigation division who said Wells employees signed up bank customers for the Prudential policies without the customers' knowledge or permission. Since bankers are not licensed to sell insurance, Wells Fargo employees were meant to direct customers to either self-service kiosks in branches or online to buy the insurance, without getting into specifics about the products. In some cases, policies were opened and closed after a month or two and then reopened, and sometimes monthly fees were withdrawn from the accounts, according to evidence in the lawsuit. Insurance regulators in California and New Jersey are investigating the allegations. Prudential was also hit with a class action lawsuit on behalf of Wells Fargo customers who said they were unknowingly signed up for Prudential policies. The lead plaintiff withdrew the lawsuit on February 17. Prudential has received inquiries, requests for information a subpoena and a civil investigative demand related to this matter from state and federal regulators, the insurer said in the Feb 21 filing.

    SAO PAULO, March 21 (Reuters) - Brazilian stocks fell
sharply on Tuesday as traders feared widening corruption
investigations could hamper government efforts to balance its
budget.
    Federal police raided the offices of people close to several
prominent senators in the latest phase of a three-year graft
probe.
    The 14 search and seizure warrants were based on information
provided by executives of engineering conglomerate Odebrecht SA
          .
    A top Brazilian prosecutor told Reuters more than 350 new
investigations will spring from the testimonies, ensnaring top
congressmen, senior members of the executive branch and other
powerful figures.
    Traders worry that the investigations could make it harder
for President Michel Temer's administration to approve painful
structural reforms aimed at recovering investor trust. Brazil's
benchmark Bovespa stock index fell 2.8 percent, the
biggest decliner in the region.
    Miner Vale SA and key shareholder Bradespar SA
 fell the most, tracking a sharp drop in iron ore
prices.
    Shares of JBS SA and Marfrig Global Foods SA
 were among the only gainers, after a federal
investigation of alleged bribery of food safety officials by
Brazilian meatpackers triggered a sell-off in the sector this
week.
    Analysts said the slump drove prices to attractive
territory, with both JBS and Marfrig able to focus on foreign
subsidiaries to sidestep potential bans on imports of Brazilian
meat.
    Most Latin American currencies weakened on profit-taking
following recent gains. The Brazilian real and the
Mexican peso weakened around 0.5 percent after firming
on Monday to the highest levels in months. 
    Indications that the U.S. Federal Reserve will increase
interest rates slowly in coming months have stoked demand for
high-yielding assets in recent weeks.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-philippines-casinos-idUSKBN16Y1OW","Philippines aims to include casinos in dirty money law this year: senator","","March 27, 2017 /  2:19 PM / 4 months ago","","MANILA (Reuters) - The Philippines could tighten its money laundering law this year to cover casinos, its top lawmaker said on Monday, in a move aimed at plugging loopholes that allowed $81 million stolen from Bangladesh to pass through Manila gaming venues. The Senate aims to approve its version of the bill in May and it is likely the lower house of Congress would hold separate discussions on its version around the same time, said Senate President Aquilino Pimentel.  Apart from strict enforcement of a know-your-customer rule, casinos would, under the proposed amendment, be required to report to the country's anti-money laundering body accumulated bets within a 24-hour period totaling 3 million pesos ($60,000), he said. The review of the existing law comes after a breach last year of Bangladesh Bank's systems and use of SWIFT messaging network to request nearly $1 billion from its account at the New York Federal Reserve in early February. The branch of the U.S. central bank rejected most of the requests, but $81 million disappeared into casinos and other entities in the Philippines. The pending bill is one of the products of the (senate) investigation, Pimentel told reporters, referring to the inquiry it conducted last year into the stolen Bangladesh central bank money. The exclusion of casinos from the current scope of the anti-money laundering laws and a strict bank secrecy law have made it difficult for authorities to track the Bangladesh money trail and identify the perpetrators. Bangladesh's central bank has retrieved just under a fifth of the stolen funds. The plan is for President Rodrigo Duterte to sign the measure into law this year, Pimentel said. Duterte has expressed frustration at the country's anti-money laundering body for lack of progress in tracking the proceeds of illegal drugs trafficking, a task made more difficult by its tough bank secrecy laws. Amending the law had been an uphill battle because of fierce lobbying by the gaming industry, according to lawmakers.  Casinos last year raked in 149 billion Philippine pesos  in gross gaming revenue, data from the gaming regulator showed.  Pimentel also said the Senate would not close its doors to reopening the investigation into the heist, given that only a small amount had been recovered. Asked whether the revelation by U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation that North Korea was responsible could compel lawmakers to revive the probe, Pimentel said: Allow us to process the information first.

Asia has emerged as a key battleground for global wealth managers, with higher economic growth, rapidly rising wages and a thriving entrepreneurial ecosystem producing rich clients at a pace faster than in the west. U.S.-based Citi, which is marking its 50th anniversary in South Korea, said it plans to grow its target customer base in wealth management by 50 percent by 2020 with new offices in Seoul, Dogok and Bundang. The bank, which has close to 3 million consumer banking clients in South Korea, also aims to boost consumer banking deposits by 30 percent, up from $10 billion currently and will boost investments in technology. The number of clients visiting branches has fallen dramatically, Brendan Carney, consumer banking head of Citi in South Korea, said in a statement.  We are responding to the changing preferences of our clients by investing further in digitization that allows us to serve customers wherever they want to bank with us. Citi said it aimed to acquire 80 percent of new credit card customers via digital platforms by 2020. A focus on rich young Asians and new products has helped Citi accelerate net new money growth at its Asia-Pacific consumer wealth business in 2016 to about 10 percent, and similar annual growth is expected over the next few years. Anand Selvakesari, its Asia-Pacific consumer banking head, said in January that growth in net new money, a key measure of profitability of the wealth business, improved in 2016 from around mid-single digit levels in the last four to five years. In 2015, the number of high net worth individuals - those with $1 million or more in investable assets - grew by 2.2 percent in South Korea, while Singapore saw a decline of 3.5 percent and India rose by 1.1 percent, according to the latest available Capgemini Financial Services Analysis report.

Citing sources at the Italian Treasury and EU institutions, La Stampa daily said Rome's plan of using a precautionary recapitalisation to save the two lenders by using more than 5 billion euros ($5.6 billion) of public funds was no longer viable. Instead the branches and assets of the two banks would be hived off into a good bank while the non-performing loans would be placed in a bad bank, it said. A spokesman for the Commission said he could not confirm the report. The Commission and the Italian authorities are working closely together to ensure a viable solution. Rome has been trying for months to reach an agreement over a bailout of Veneto Banca and rival Banca Popolare di Vicenza to avoid their liquidation. Talks with the European Commission have dragged on because Brussels wants private investors to pump 1.25 billion euros into the banks before any taxpayer money can be used to avert them being wound down. But La Stampa said Rome had failed to find lenders willing to provide the private capital requested by the Commission. It said talks with Italy's main banks in recent days had spoken of a resolution of the two Veneto lenders and their sale at a symbolic price. Earlier this month European authorities stepped in to avert a collapse of Spain's Banco Popular following a run on the bank, orchestrating a last-minute rescue by Santander. La Stampa said it was still not clear who might buy the performing assets of the two Veneto lenders but said talks were most advanced with Italy's Intesa Sanpaolo. However it cautioned that Italy's biggest retail bank was concerned about stretching its balance sheet and jeopordising dividends, adding that any acquisition might prompt the European Central Bank to ask for a capital increase. The Italian Treasury and Intesa Sanpaolo were not immediately available for comment. Italian Economy Minister Pier Carlo Padoan said on Friday he was confident a solution for the two banks could soon be reached.

There is a deal, NBG's unit will be sold to OTP, a source in Athens said. OTP executives have said publicly they were in the running for Romaneasca as well as other banks in the region as they look to bolster the bank's presence in central Europe. NBG (NBGr.AT) plans to sell more assets in the Balkans, including its Romanian operations, to complete a restructuring plan agreed with European authorities, its chief executive Leonidas Fragiadakis told Reuters this month. This M&A; event was well-anticipated, Ipopema analyst Norbert Harcsa said. OTP could have a 3.6 percent market share (in Romania) versus a management target of 5 percent. The price-to-book could be the same as it was in Croatia (in May). OTP bought Croatian Splitska Banka from Societe Generale for a price close to book value. OTP, which will add Romaneasca's network of about 110 branches, is also expected to pay back a loan of 550 million euros ($625 million) that Banca Romaneasca borrowed from NBG. Apart from Romaneasca, Fragiadakis has said NBG would sell smaller operations in Serbia, Albania and Cyprus as part of agreements with regulators. One asset the bank still has is Serbia's Vojvodanska Banka, which is also a possible target for OTP, which has said it is looking at potential acquisitions there. The Hungarian bank did not reply to questions seeking comment on the Romaneasca deal or any further possible ones. OTP is one of the region's largest independent banks, and weathered the financial crisis better than many rivals. After Hungary imposed special taxes on the financial sector, it took a cautious line, doubling liquidity reserves from 4 billion euros in 2011 to 8.3 billion euros at the end of the first quarter.  As those special taxes have been gradually lifted, OTP has begun to expand in the region - just as Greek banks are looking to sell assets. OTP's core equity tier 1 capital ratio - a key measure of financial strength - was 16.6 percent at the end of the first quarter after hovering around 15 percent for the last five years.

London copper surged to its highest in two years on Wednesday in reaction to the news and Chinese futures climbed to their highest in more than five months.   The review of copper scrap imports is part of a broader crackdown by China authorities on imports of foreign waste as it looks to cut pollution from heavy industries to clear its skies. The recycling branch of the China NonFerrous Metals Industry Association said on Tuesday that it had received a notice that at the end of 2018 imports of scrap metal including wire, motors and bulk scrap metal will be prohibited, according to a copy of an informal Association message sent to members of its WeChat group reviewed by Reuters. The market is reacting to the news about China banning scrap cables, scrap motor and other scrap metals from the end of next year, which could block a lot of copper supply into China, said analyst Li Chunlan at consultancy CRU in Beijing.  China is the world's biggest user and producer of refined copper, accounting for about 45 percent of global demand, but must import any additional needs from mines or scrap merchants. A ban on scrap could mean that it must import more refined copper. Antaike, a metals research institute under the Association, said that the ban would likely affect less than 1 million tonnes of imports that market participants are speculating could be impacted. That is because the type of scrap affected by the ban only accounted for about 300,000 tonnes of China’s total 3.35 million tonnes of scrap copper imports in 2016, it said in a report. China's overall copper scrap imports were 1.85 million tonnes in the first half of 2017 versus refined copper imports of 1.54 million tonnes, customs data showed.  LME copper prices on Wednesday rose as much 2.8 percent to $6,400 a ton, the highest since May 2015. Prices have risen 4.5 percent in the past two days and are up 14 percent this year.

Board meetings to discuss the deal are being held this evening though the final agreement may not be reached tonight, one of the sources with knowledge of the meetings said without providing any details. Bankia and BMN, both controlled by the Spanish state, declined to comment. Last week, Spanish Economy Minister Luis de Guindos said that he expected both banks to agree on a share swap for a merger deal within days or weeks, while the chairman of Bankia said he expected the transaction to be completed in the fourth quarter. The state owns about 66 percent of listed Bankia, the fourth largest Spanish bank, and 65 percent of smaller lender BMN and plans to privatize them both before December 2019. Bankia and BMN were given a 24-billion-euro ($25.5 billion) bailout in 2012 after losses on property loans. Bankia's market value was around 11.5 billion euros ($12.85 billion) based on its closing share price on Monday. BMN was valued at around 1 billion euros by an independent adviser selected earlier this year by Spain's FROB bailout fund. Spanish banks have already undergone huge consolidation since the country's financial crisis, with just 13 left from 55 in 2008. In the latest stage of this process, Banco Popular, the country's sixth-biggest bank, was taken over Spain's largest bank Santander (SAN.MC) in early June for the symbolic price of one euro after European authorities stepped in to prevent its collapse. A privatization of Bankia and BMN is seen as one of the final steps in cleaning up Spain's banking sector, which was hit when a property bubble burst forcing the government to combine several failing banks to form Bankia and BMN. Analysts believe that the merger makes sense because each bank has a different geographic footprint, although the combined group would need to cut staff and branches as banks in Spain are struggling with ultra low interest rates and competition for lending. Bankia, which lost more than 19 billion euros in 2012 due to its real estate holdings, has bounced back strongly since its bailout and now has one of the highest profitability ratios and strongest capital positions among Spanish banks. BMN's profitability ratio is one of the lowest. Reporting By Jesús Aguado; editing by Sonya Dowsett, Tomas Cobos and Jane Merriman"

Wells Fargo has set aside that money to compensate customers who are part of a class-action lawsuit involving claims regarding consumer or small business bank accounts, credit cards or loans, as well as identity theft protection, between May 2002 and April of this year. It plans to begin reaching out to those affected customers soon. In the unlikely event that there are so many claims, and there is not $25 million left over to distribute across all customers involved in the lawsuit, Wells Fargo said it will pay more. The bank reached the settlement in April, according to a regulatory filing, but the judge's preliminary approval moves the deal to the next step. Wells Fargo has previously said thousands of branch employees created as many as 2.1 million bank and credit card accounts in individuals' names without their permission to artificially hit sales goals. Lawyers representing the claimants said 3.5 million accounts were created, according to a May 12 story by the Los Angeles Times. If U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria grants final approval to  the deal, it could help Wells Fargo chip away at a bevy of legal and regulatory issues stemming from the scandal, which erupted in September after it reached a $185 million settlement with a Los Angeles prosecutor and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Wells still faces probes from federal, state and local government agencies, including the U.S. Department of Justice, as well as a number of private lawsuits, according to its quarterly securities filing in May. In a statement, the bank's chief executive, Tim Sloan, said he was pleased that the court approved the preliminary settlement and considered it a major milestone in our efforts to make things right for our customers. If the agreement receives final approval the bank expects it will close out the vast majority of claims in 10 class action lawsuits related to the one it is trying to settle.

Lieutenant General Thomas Cirillo Swaka, the deputy head of logistics, is the highest-ranking officer to resign since former Vice President Riek Machar fled after his supporters clashed in Juba in July with soldiers loyal to President Salva Kiir. Swaka, widely known as Cirillo, is respected by the international community and Western governments would see his resignation and the charges he has leveled as an indictment of the government, one security expert in Nairobi said.  South Sudan has been riven by conflict since 2013, two years after seceding from North Sudan. Fighting broke out a few months after Kiir, from the Dinka tribe, sacked Machar, a Nuer. His reinstatement in 2016 lasted just weeks before violence erupted again. The conflict has increasingly followed ethnic lines, forcing three million people to flee their homes, bringing the nation of 11 million close to famine and leading the United Nations to say South Sudan was on the brink of genocide.  Swaka's letter reinforced those warnings.  President Kiir and his Dinka leadership clique have tactically and systematically transformed the SPLA into a partisan and tribal army, it read, using the acronym for the government Sudan People's Liberation Army.   Terrorizing their opponents, real or perceived, has become a preoccupation of the government.  Swaka said the military, police and other security branches systematically recruited Dinka from the president and chief of army staff's home region. Non-Dinkas and Dinkas who disagreed with the president's agenda were given remote postings or sidelined, he said. He also said soldiers from the Dinka ethnic group have been strategically deployed and posted in non-Dinka areas to support the policy of land occupation. Swaka said the military raped and killed civilians and allowed tribal militias to commit the same abuses as well as running a network of secret prisons where torture was endemic.  The government routinely dismisses charges of ethnic bias and blames rebels for stoking trouble. Officials say any soldier committing abuses will be held to account and the president said on Monday any soldier committing rape should be shot.  Military spokesman Brigadier General Lul Ruai Koang did not return calls seeking comment about Swaka's letter. The presidential spokesman also could not immediately be reached. U.N. officials and Western governments have accused both sides in the conflict of abuses. Editing by Edmund Blair and Louise Ireland"

Investcorp, which expects its assets under management to rise to around $21 billion in the first half of 2017, on Thursday reported a fall in profit to $35.6 million in the six months to Dec. 31 from $50.9 million in the prior-year period. This was largely due to the writedown of a real estate investment in the U.S. which it bought before the global financial crisis, Kapoor told Reuters on a call. Among potential investments in the U.S., Europe and the Gulf, Investcorp was looking for opportunities created by Britain's vote to leave the European Union and uncertainty over whether Trump's U.S. administration would deploy fiscal stimulus and the pace of interest rate hikes by the U.S. Federal Reserve. As a consequence (of the uncertainty) in the U.S., the kind of businesses we are focusing on are those resilient to cyclical downturns, Kapoor said, adding that business services was one area in particular where it was looking for opportunities. Kapoor said U.S.-based AlixPartners, the global advisory firm it agreed to acquire ownership stakes in along with other investors in November, was an example of this thinking. In Britain, Investcorp was looking at real estate assets with a long-term horizon in order to overcome any market volatility in the next two or three years, he said. The pound's slump since June's Brexit vote has encouraged investors from some Middle Eastern markets linked to the U.S. dollar to look for openings in the property market. Investcorp, which was founded in 1982, is one of the oldest Middle Eastern private equity houses and is best known outside the region for listing luxury goods brands such as Gucci and Tiffany & Co. It has increasingly branched out into other sectors and set out a goal in 2015 to more than double its assets under management in the next five to seven years to $25 billion. In a big step towards achieving that goal it agreed to buy 3i Group's debt-management business in October. When that deal closes in the first half of 2017, Investcorp said its assets under management will reach around $21 billion.

It always feels get that first one out of the way so you can relax little bit, said Rizzo, whose average has risen to .243 through nine games. CF Albert Almora Jr. made a great catch on Corey Seager's first inning drive to the center field wall Thursday. Almora, making his third appearance of the season in center, kept a close watch on the progression and trajectory of the shot as he sprinted toward the warning track, then put his right arm out to brace himself as he hit the ivy branches and brick wall to haul in his catch.  He made another running grab in the third on another Seager drive to end the inning. SS Addison Russell was 1-for-4 with his first home run of the season in the fourth inning Thursday. It was a career first homer batting fourth in the batting order. RHP Kyle Hendricks (1-0, 6.00 ERA) had a Cy Young Award worthy 2016 season (16-8, 2.13 ERA) and makes his second start of the new season Friday against a Pirates team he has a 3-1 record and 3.55 ERA in seven career starts.  Hendricks has not allowed a run in his last 15 innings against Pittsburgh, and he went six scoreless innings in his last start against the Pirates on Sept. 26, 2016. The Cubs have won his last five starts, and he is 3-0 with a 3.25 ERA in that span. Hendricks owns a career 2.92 ERA, third among all active pitchers behind Clayton Kershaw (2.37) and Jacob deGrom (2.74). LHP Brett Anderson (1-0) tossed five scoreless innings against the Dodgers and earned his first Cubs victory Thursday. It was his second all-time start at Wrigley Field, including one against Chicago on July 30, 2014, while with the Colorado Rockies. With the lack of stuff that I had, I was (still) able make some quality pitches when I had to, said Anderson, who faced his former team for the first time.

Yang Jiacai, assistant chairman of CBRC, has been under investigation since April 9 in connection with the scandal in  Hubei province, Caixin said late on Saturday, following days of rumors circulating online that Yang had gone missing. China's graft watchdog on April 9 also announced an investigation into the chairman of the country's insurance regulator, Xiang Junbo, the most senior financial regulator to be investigated as part of a government fight against graft. Yang could not be reached for comment.     No official announcement of an investigation into him has been made. His name and profile were still accessible on the CBRC website on Sunday. Caixin reported last Friday that Yang had been relieved of his duties, citing people with knowledge of the matter. CBRC did not respond to a faxed request for comment on Friday or to a second fax on Sunday about the investigation. Yang's last public appearance was on April 7 speaking at a news conference about new risk control guidelines for lenders as part of efforts to contain risks from a rapid build-up in debt. China's top leaders have pledged this year to address financial risks and asset bubbles. President Xi Jinping has pledged to wage war on deep seated graft in the ruling Communist party until officials at all levels dare not be corrupt, warning that a failure to check the rot could threaten the party's existence. Yang and his wife and son were all placed under investigation due to their suspected involvement in a loan scandal in Hubei, Yang's home province, Caixin said. Yang spent most of his career in Hubei and was deputy head of the central bank's Wuhan city branch in Hubei from 1997 to 2003, according to his official profile.

The decision by the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals likely means Blankenship will remain in prison at least until he is eligible for release on May 10. Blankenship led Massey from 2000 to 2010 and is the most prominent U.S. coal executive convicted of a crime related to miners' deaths. Blankenship, 66, argued that his December 2015 conviction on a misdemeanor conspiracy charge should be voided because the federal indictment did not specify which U.S. mine safety regulations he conspired to violate, and because of several errors by the trial judge. But the Richmond, Virginia-based appeals court said the indictment was sufficiently detailed, and that the trial judge did not commit reversible error when instructing jurors about the meaning of willfully violating mine safety regulations. Contrary to Blankenship's position, a mine operator is not immune from criminal liability by characterizing his mine's repeated failure to comply with safety laws as a consequence of tough decisions he had to make weighing production, safety, and regulatory compliance, Circuit Judge James Wynn wrote. A lawyer for Blankenship did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The office of U.S. Attorney Carol Casto in Charleston, West Virginia, had no immediate comment. The fire caused by a methane or natural gas leak likely set off the fatal April 2010 blast at Massey's now-closed Upper Big Branch mine, located about 40 miles (65 km) south of Charleston, according to federal investigators. The death toll was the highest in a U.S. mine accident since 91 workers died in a 1972 Idaho silver mine fire. Blankenship was also fined $250,000 in connection with his conviction. He was acquitted on related felony charges. Once known as West Virginia's king of coal for his working-class background and tough approach to business, Blankenship helped build Massey into Appalachia's largest coal producer, with more than 7,000 employees and more than 40 mines. Massey was acquired in 2011 by Alpha Natural Resources Inc for about $7 billion. Alpha Natural filed for bankruptcy in August 2015 amid a coal industry slowdown, and emerged last July.

It follows a year in which the bank cemented its position as the largest lender in the Middle East and Africa by assets after completing the 2.7 billion euro purchase of Finansbank , Turkey's fifth-largest private lender. The takeover helped lift its fourth-quarter net profit to 2.75 billion riyals ($755 million), compared with 2.54 billion riyals in the corresponding period of 2015, according to Reuters calculations based on the bank's annual results. The figures on Sunday came below analysts' expectations. EFG Hermes had forecast net profit at 2.99 billion riyals for the three months to Dec. 31 while SICO Bahrain had expected 3.44 billion riyals for the period. Competition among leading Gulf banks to expand outside the region is becoming intense at a time when opportunities for growth are limited at home amid weak oil prices and lower state spending. A merger between National Bank of Abu Dhabi and First Gulf Bank will create one of the biggest lenders in the Middle East and Africa when the deal closes in 2017. QNB said it was now targeting becoming a leading bank in the Middle East, Africa and Southeast Asia by 2020 after achieving its goal of becoming a Middle East and Africa icon by 2017. In addition to its foothold in Turkey, QNB, which has a presence in more than 30 countries, also owns a business in Egypt and a 23.5 percent stake in pan-African lender Ecobank International. QNB has a more limited presence in South East Asia, although the bank said in August 2016 it had been given approval to open a branch in India offering banking services. For 2016 as a whole, QNB reported a net profit of 12.4 billion riyals, up 10 percent from 2015, according to a statement. QNB's board proposed a cash dividend for 2016 of 3.5 riyals per share and a bonus share dividend which would award one free share for every 10 shares currently owned. In 2015, it awarded a cash dividend of 3.5 riyals per share and a bonus share dividend of two free shares for every 10 shares held.

The school, however, denounced unjust, slanderous and defamatory Internet-based articles about this kindergarten and it said it would keep fighting against malicious criticism. Criticism of Korean residents and Chinese people is a common feature of right-wing rhetoric in Japan, where ethnic homogeneity has been a source of pride for many conservatives. Separately, the Osaka prefectural government is considering whether to take action over derogatory expressions about Koreans living in Japan and Chinese used by the kindergarten in a document sent to students' parents last year, an Osaka official said.

Abe was grilled in parliament last week about possible ties to Moritomo Gakuen, including whether he knew his name had been used to solicit donations for the elementary school.  Abe said then he had rejected a request to have the school bear his name because it was not appropriate for an incumbent lawmaker and was unaware his name had been used in seeking donations. An official at the prime minister's office declined comment on any specific remarks by the school because they had not seen them.  But the official, who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the subject, added: When it comes to the issue of discrimination based on nationality, ethnicity or race, it cannot be tolerated and it is extremely important to have consideration for others and to have mutual understanding.

The tools will allow customers to submit and sign documents online and exchange messages with bank staff and real-estate agents so loans can close more quickly and easily, consumer mortgage chief Mike Weinbach said in an interview. This platform will allow us to be where more of our customers are, which is online and on their phones, Weinbach said. It is more efficient for customers and for us. Applying for a mortgage can make or break a bank's relationship with a customer because home purchases are often the most expensive, complex and emotional transactions people make in their lifetimes. JPMorgan started pilot-testing its digital tools in recent weeks and will make them available to more people before completing the rollout in 2018. Offering the process online has become an imperative as customers have lost patience with the tedious and paperwork-heavy ordeal. Some 150,000 home loans JPMorgan made last year came through its branches and telephone lines, which will continue to be available for applications. Five years in the future, every lender is going to have a digital offering for their customers, or they're probably not going to be in business, Weinbach said. Detroit-based Quicken Loans Inc first brought digital home loans into the mainstream about a year ago with a major advertising campaign for its Rocket Mortgage product. Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) introduced a Home Loan Navigator tool in June to handle applications online. It is more important for us to get it right for our customers, said Weinbach. It is less important for us to be first. The bank is using technology from Roostify, which sells software to the mortgage industry. Founders of the San Francisco-based company have said they started it after their own frustrations with buying homes. JPMorgan is the No. 2 U.S. mortgage lender, behind Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), according to Inside Mortgage Finance data for the first nine months of 2016. In the past few years, Quicken climbed to No. 3, in part because of the ease with which its customers can process applications. Bank of America ranked fourth.

Lam was chosen to be Hong Kong's next leader on Sunday amid accusations that Beijing had meddled in the election to ensure her victory and deny the financial hub a more populist leader. Many of the city's opposition pro-democracy politicians and activists were opposed to Lam's selection by a 1,200-person election committee stacked with Beijing and pro-establishment loyalists, who spurned another more popular candidate, former finance chief John Tsang I have every confidence that we will have a very smooth transition, said Lam, after shaking hands with Leung. She said unifying society would be her most urgent task, as well as improving the relationship between the executive branch of government and the legislature including opposition democrats. Lam, the city's first female leader, will formally take office on July 1. The next few months will be critical for Leung and Lam, with Chinese president Xi Jinping expected to pay a visit on July 1 to celebrate Hong Kong's 20th anniversary of the handover from British to Chinese rule, with large protests expected. Part of the public mistrust towards Lam stems from her close working relationship with the staunchly pro-Beijing Leung, who ordered the firing of tear gas on pro-democracy protesters in 2014 during the 'Occupy' civil disobedience movement.  People take selfies with Carrie Lam, chief executive-elect, a day after she was elected in Hong Kong, China March 27, 2017.Tyrone SiuLam was Leung's deputy as chief secretary over the past five years, and is known as a tough, though competent administrator. Some opposition politicians, however, remained skeptical, and said Lam needed to change tack to truly narrow differences. Slideshow (6 Images)If Carrie Lam continues to maintain her attitude during the election period, the ignorance towards the reality and voices from the public, then I don't think she will have an easy time at the Legislative Council, said Alvin Yeung, head of the pro-democracy Civic Party and an elected lawmaker. All of Hong Kong's three other post-handover leaders have struggled to balance the demands of China's stability-obsessed Communist Party leaders, with the wish of many residents to preserve the global financial hub's liberal values and rule of law that have long underpinned its economic success. Political and social divisions have led to some legislative and policy-making paralysis and the stalling of major projects. She has been elected pretty much solely on the support of Beijing, said political scientist Ma Ngok.  If that's the case, she might have a lot of debts that she has to repay to her supporters in Beijing.  Reporting by Katy Wong and James Pomfret; Editing by Michael Perry"

The British firm has pushing into a number of overseas markets and last year introduced a corporate offering in Spain, launched a full branch in Romania and signed a commercial partnership with global news firm CNN. Moneycorp, which had revenues of about $140 million in 2016, did not disclose the terms of the deal.  Chief financial and operations officer Nick Haslehurst told Reuters that the firm would fund 20 percent of the deal using cash on hand, while 80 percent would be backed by external financing. Providence, Rhode Island headquartered Commonwealth had revenues of about $20 million last year and serves over 4,000 customers in the United States, enabling the movement of over 3 billion dollars across the world. Moneycorp said the Commonwealth acquisition would allow it to add small- and medium-sized U.S. customers by rolling out its specialist forex technology and platform through Commonwealth's network. I think, in the United States, the provision of cross-border banking, payments and FX services by the big mainstream banks doesn't service that SME and midcap market in the U.S. particularly well, Haslehurst said. Having acquired Commonwealth the ability to leverage their licensing structure and sales team to roll out Moneycorp's transparent, fast, efficient service provision, we believe will give us a big advantage for customer acquisition. Moneycorp, which offers telephone and online payments, traded 25 billion pounds worth of currencies and handled over 7 million transactions in 2016. The deal, which requires regulatory clearance in the United States, is expected to close around September or October. KPMG was financial adviser to Moneycorp, while Holland & Knight and Shearman & Sterling were legal advisers. Raymond James advised Commonwealth. Haslehurst said that Moneycorp was keen to strike one more deal in 2017, with a preference to buy in the Americas, but did not intend to overpay.

Wells Fargo has set aside that money to compensate customers who are part of a class-action lawsuit involving claims regarding consumer or small business bank accounts, credit cards or loans, as well as identity theft protection, between May 2002 and April of this year. It plans to begin reaching out to those affected customers soon. In the unlikely event that there are so many claims, and there is not $25 million left over to distribute across all customers involved in the lawsuit, Wells Fargo said it will pay more. The bank reached the settlement in April, according to a regulatory filing, but the judge's preliminary approval moves the deal to the next step. Wells Fargo has previously said thousands of branch employees created as many as 2.1 million bank and credit card accounts in individuals' names without their permission to artificially hit sales goals. Lawyers representing the claimants said 3.5 million accounts were created, according to a May 12 story by the Los Angeles Times. If U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria grants final approval to  the deal, it could help Wells Fargo chip away at a bevy of legal and regulatory issues stemming from the scandal, which erupted in September after it reached a $185 million settlement with a Los Angeles prosecutor and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Wells still faces probes from federal, state and local government agencies, including the U.S. Department of Justice, as well as a number of private lawsuits, according to its quarterly securities filing in May. In a statement, the bank's chief executive, Tim Sloan, said he was pleased that the court approved the preliminary settlement and considered it a major milestone in our efforts to make things right for our customers. If the agreement receives final approval the bank expects it will close out the vast majority of claims in 10 class action lawsuits related to the one it is trying to settle.

Societe Generale (SocGen), like peers such as BNP Paribas, have boosted their online business to counter low-cost internet competitors, and a drop in the numbers of clients coming into their branches, both of which are hurting profits and forcing them to close outlets. I believe, in the long run, scale will be important. We will not have a multitude of profitable online banks, Oudea said at a fintech conference in Paris. The biggest operators in the online banking market in France are ING direct, SocGen's Boursorama and Credit Mutuel's Fortuneo. Boursorama is the cheapest bank in France...at least for the services it provides, Oudea said. SocGen's Boursorama, which offers online broking, banking and other financial services, aims to double the number of new clients, coming from outside its existing networks, to 2 million by 2020. Over the longer term, Oudea said he saw the number growing to 8 million. Rival ING Direct had 1 million clients as of July last year. Boursorama last reported 918,000 clients at the end of September. New Entrant A new entrant is knocking at the door of the online banking market. French telecoms operator Orange and Groupama Bank are launching Orange bank in a few weeks, promising a break from what rivals offer. We will try to do this under such conditions that both in terms of price and transparency would make it really a game-changer to what exists now in the French banking sector, Orange CEO Stephane Richard said at the Paris fintech forum. Some French banking executives have expressed concern about the entry of Orange Bank into the market and the impact on profit margins. They point to the telecoms market and the arrival of low-cost operator Free Mobile which fixed much lower tariffs than its rivals. Boursorama's Oudea said he was not worried and said he expected banking services to become cheaper over time on the back of improvements in efficiency. Orange bank is betting on the vast telecoms network of its parent that gives it access to 29 million clients. It is aiming to win 2 million of those clients.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nickel-market-supply-idUSKBN18Y0K2","Low prices to pile more pressure on beleaguered nickel miners","","June 7, 2017 /  7:09 AM / 2 months ago","","MELBOURNE/SYDNEY (Reuters) - Global nickel miners are coming under renewed pressure to cut costs or close capacity as a flood of cheap ore pushes prices to one-year lows, with analysts seeing little prospect of recovery. Indonesia and the Philippines are ramping up shipments of nickel ore after Indonesia relaxed an ore export ban earlier this year and a hardline Filipino environmentalist was ousted from the country's mining ministry. Nickel ore is popular as a cheaper alternative to refined metal for China's vast steel mills, which use the metal to add strength to stainless steel. The renewed supply comes as the market is already struggling with softening demand and high stocks, leading a slew of banks to slash their forecasts despite prices having already fallen 60 percent since mid-2014 80 percent from their 2007 peak. Citi recently told clients that for the first time in 10 years it saw little chance of a rally in the short, medium or long term.     Miners have been holding on as long as they can. They will be close to running out of wiggle room in terms of cutting costs, said Mark Pervan at consultancy AME Group in Sydney.  We need to see some reasonably sized refined capacity cutbacks to restore prices and confidence back to the market. Consultant Wood Mackenzie estimates that more than half of the world's nickel industry is running at a loss. High cost mines include those in the Dominican Republic, Greece, Cuba, Western Australia and New Caledonia, analysts said. Brazil's Vale has already said that it plans to suspend two of its older high-cost Canadian mines this year. Prices have persisted for some time now and our focus throughout this period has been on reducing costs and improving performance throughout our operations globally, Vale spokesman Cory McPhee said. New Caledonia, home to three of the world's top-10 projects, is one of the highest cost producers.  Christel Bories, CEO of France's Eramet said recently that losses at its Societe Le Nickel (SLN) operations were not sustainable, while Vale NC, a branch of Brazil's Vale, said its Q1 cost of production stood at $11,232, well above the LME nickel price around $8,890. The French government, however, has supported both mines with state loans, aimed at protecting jobs. Some mines, such as the Falcondo ferronickel plant in the Dominican Republic, exited the market when prices last dipped.  That mine since returned under new ownership. Mines built during periods of high prices could be the first on the chopping block, while some operations could be wound down ahead of their expected closure dates, said analysts. However, an impediment to closure was that many mines are run by diversified mining companies that derive most of their revenue from other minerals. In Australia we see the likes of Leinster and Long coming to end of mine life, in 2017 and 2018 respectively, so operations like these could close earlier, Wood Mackenzie analyst Angela Durrant said. Both BHP's Leinster mine, part of its Nickel West operations, and Independence Group's Long mine are situated in Western Australia. Independence Group, which also mines gold and copper, was not available for comment but has said previously it wants to expand its Long project.        BHP has said Nickel West is not part of its core portfolio, but chief commercial officer, Arnoud Balhuizen, said this month the miner was still running the Nickel West business for value.

Nigeria The naira is expected to remain firm at both the official interbank rate and on parallel markets ahead of the festive season as businesses wind down activities and demand for hard currency slows. The naira has traded steady this week at 485 to the dollar on the parallel market as demand for the greenback waned. There should be little pressure in the currency market in the coming days because many businesses are already winding down their operations, a currency changer told Reuters. Nigerians living abroad who will be visiting home for the holidays are also expected to bring in hard currency inflows and offer extra support to the naira. Ghana Ghana's cedi is seen being underpinned by foreign exchange supplies from cocoa sales. The currency stabilised this week after a streak of losses ahead of a presidential election on Dec.7, won by opposition leader Nana Akufo-Addo. At 1030 GMT the cedi was quoted at 4.14 to the dollar, compared with 4.22 a week ago. Analyst Joseph Biggles Amponsah of the Accra-based Dortis Research said the cedi would extend its gains in the coming week to trade below 4.1000 and towards the 4.0000 levels. Tanzania Tanzania's shilling is seen appreciating slightly due to a slowdown in demand for hard currency from importers while players are expecting some inflows from the agricultural sector and big firms converting some of their hard currency holdings. Commercial banks quoted the shilling at 2,178/2,183 to the dollar on Thursday, barely moved from 2,174/2,184 a week ago. There is a big demand for shillings at the moment as corporates are selling dollars to meet payment obligations in local currency, said a dealer at a commercial bank. Kenya The Kenyan shilling could lose ground due to importer  demand and spillover negative sentiment after the U.S. Federal Reserve raised rates, traders said. At 1145 GMT, commercial banks quoted the shilling at 102.00/102.10 to the dollar, little changed from last Thursday's close of 101.95/102.15. We are likely to see emerging market currencies, Kenya being one of them trading lower (weaker) against the dollar, said a trader from a commercial bank. UGANDA The Uganda shilling is forecast to trade with a firming bias, helped by a large mop-up of excess local currency liquidity by the central bank. At 1214 GMT commercial banks quoted the shilling at 3,600/3,610, stable from last Thursday's close. Bank of Uganda, the central bank, removed a total of 831 billion shillings ($230.51 million) from the interbank market via a 7-day repo. I see the local unit playing in a stable range but probably inclined toward the strengthening side, said a trader from a leading commercial bank who added the mop-up would trim appetite for the greenback among banks. Zambia The kwacha will likely trade in a stable position on the back of ebbing demand for hard currency as most firms start to close or cutback business ahead of the Christmas and year-end festivities. At 0948 GMT, commercial banks quoted the kwacha at 9.8900 per dollar from a close of 9.8400 a week ago, according to Thomson Reuters data. Activity in the market has slowed. The kwacha has traded in the 9.850/9.900 range over the past few weeks and should remain in the current range as we go into 2017, the Zambian branch of South Africa's First National Bank (FNB) said in a note.

The deal brings close to an end months of negotiations over the fate of the world's oldest bank and Italy's fourth biggest lender, the worst performer in European stress tests last year. The Commission said it had agreed in principle on a restructuring plan for the bank so that it can be bailed out by the state under new European rules for dealing with bank crises. It would allow Italy to inject capital into MPS as a precaution, in line with EU rules, whilst limiting the burden on Italian taxpayers, Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in a statement. The bank would undergo deep restructuring to ensure its viability, including by cleaning its balance sheet of non-performing loans, she said. Burdened by a bad loan pile and a mismanagement scandal, Monte dei Paschi has been for years at the forefront of Italy's slow-brewing banking crisis. It was forced to request state aid in December to help cover a capital shortfall of 8.8 billion euros ($9.9 billion) after it failed to raise money on the market.  The accord with the European Commission exploits an exception in current EU rules allowing member states to bolster the capital buffers of a bank provided it is solvent and that shareholders and junior bondholders shoulder some of the losses. The government could end up injecting some 6.6 billion euros into the bank, taking a stake of around 70 percent. A logo of Monte dei Paschi di Siena bank is seen on the ground in Siena, Italy, November 5, 2014.Giampiero Sposito/File PhotoThe agreement with Brussels is conditional on the European Central Bank confirming the lender meets capital requirements and on the sale of some 26 billion euros in soured debts to private investors.  Monte dei Paschi said on Monday it was in exclusive talks until June 28 with a domestic fund and a group of investors to shift the debts off its balance sheet and sell them repackaged as securities. Sources close to the matter said the price at which Monte dei Paschi sells those bad debts would be key for the bailout, as a low price would require the bank to book further loan losses which could not be covered by the state. Details of Monte dei Paschi's restructuring plan have not been made public, but it is expected to include thousands of job cuts and the closure of hundreds of branches as the bank must ensure it is profitable in the long term. MPS will take a number of measures to substantially increase its efficiency, the Commission's statement said. The EU deal also imposes a cap on senior management pay equivalent to 10 times the average salary of Monte dei Paschi's staff. As a result, the annual salary of Chief Executive Marco Morelli should be cut to around 500,000 euros from more than 1.8 million euros, according to a source. The Commission said retail investors who were mis-sold the bank's junior bonds would be eligible for compensation. Italy faces a much bigger hurdle in winning European approval for a state bailout of two other banks, Banca Popolare di Vicenza and Veneto Banca. Sources have said the EU Commission has demanded an additional injection of 1.2 billion euros by private investors before taxpayer money can be used, but Rome is struggling to find any investor willing to stump up the money.

The world's two richest people were speaking to students at Columbia University after U.S. President Donald Trump started to unwind the work of his predecessor Barack Obama in a series of executive orders, prompting concern from critics over what the actions mean for Americans and their place in the world. I am confident that America will move ahead, Buffett said. Gates, meanwhile, said the desire for innovation and support for research are strong and largely bipartisan, despite differences on how to accomplish and fund both. This administration is new enough; we don't know how its budget priorities are going to come out, but there is much intensity to ensure that the executive branch and Congress encourage amazing things, Gates said. Gates co-founded and was the first chief executive of Microsoft Corp, while Buffett runs the conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Forbes magazine said on Friday that Gates is worth $85.2 billion and Buffett is worth $73.9 billion. Warren Buffett, chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, is seen on a video screen as Bill Gates and moderator Charlie Rose (R) listen at Columbia University in New York, U.S., January 27, 2017.Shannon StapletonAn estimated 1,300 people attended Friday's event to watch the close friends, who have known each other for a quarter century. Gates is also a Berkshire director, while Buffett is donating much of his wealth to the charitable foundation set up by Gates and his wife, Melinda.  Both told students it is important to invest and focus on doing good works over the long term, despite the impulse or perceived need for shorter-term thinking. Slideshow (7 Images)Gates said this was particularly true in areas such as climate change and vaccinations, calling it just as important to be sure people can get vaccines as it is to develop them. Buffett said: It's very hard to have politicians think of something that's wonderful for the country 20 years from now if the short-term impact might cost them reelection, with their decisions often tainted by too much money, which he called bad news. He also stressed the importance of immigration, a central issue for Trump, whom neither Buffett nor Gates discussed. Buffett said the country has been blessed by immigrants, and might have come out quite different had the physicists Albert Einstein and Leo Szilard not in 1939 urged U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt to develop a nuclear program to counter threats from Nazi Germany. If it weren't for those two immigrants, who knows if we would be sitting in this room, Buffett said. Reporting by Jennifer Ablan and Jonathan Stempel in New York; editing by Bill Rigby"
"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-nordstrom-idUSKBN15T2M7","Ethics office urges White House to weigh disciplining Conway","","February 14, 2017 /  7:37 PM / 5 months ago","","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House should consider disciplinary action against presidential adviser Kellyanne Conway for appearing to violate government ethics rules by publicly endorsing Ivanka Trump products, the Office of Government Ethics wrote in a letter made public on Tuesday. The letter, dated Monday and addressed to a White House ethics official, asked President Donald Trump's administration to investigate the incident and gave it two weeks to provide its findings and detail any disciplinary steps taken. Conway, Trump's presidential campaign manager and now a senior counselor, said on Fox News last week that Americans should go buy Ivanka's stuff. She spoke after retailer Nordstrom announced it was dropping the branded line of Ivanka Trump, the president's older daughter. Federal ethics rules prohibit executive branch employees from using their positions to endorse products.     There is strong reason to believe that Ms. Conway has violated the Standards of Conduct and that disciplinary action is warranted, Office of Government Ethics Director Walter Shaub wrote in the letter.  Stefan Passantino, the White House ethics official named in the letter, declined to comment. A White House spokesman did not reply to a request for comment.  The ethics office has little enforcement power. It can formally recommend disciplinary action if the White House does not act, Shaub said in a separate letter to two U.S. lawmakers who sought a review of Conway's remarks. That recommendation would not be binding, and the process would take until late April or early May, Shaub said. If the ethics office does formally recommend discipline, it would be up to the White House to decide any steps against Conway.  Norman Eisen, who was ethics chief under President Barack Obama, said Congress also could call hearings or subpoena documents if the White House did not act. Trump himself earlier attacked Nordstrom for dropping his daughter's brand. The ethics rules that bar endorsements do not apply to the president, though critics said his comments were inappropriate. Nordstrom said it made the decision because sales had steadily declined, especially in the last half of 2016, to where carrying the line didn't make good business sense. In his letter to the White House, Shaub wrote that his office's regulatory guidelines include an example violation in which a hypothetical presidential appointee promotes a product in a television commercial. He said Conway's remarks closely mirrored that example of what not to do. White House spokesman Sean Spicer said on Thursday that Conway had been counseled, but Shaub wrote that the Office of Government Ethics had not been informed of any corrective steps.

It was not clear how widespread the issue was or how significantly it affected daily functions at DHS, a large government agency whose responsibilities include immigration services, border security and cyber defense.  In a statement, a DHS official confirmed a network outage that temporarily affected four U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) facilities in the Washington area due to an expired DHS certificate.  Reuters first reported the incident earlier Tuesday, which a source familiar with the matter said also affected a USCIS facility in Philadelphia. Employees began experiencing problems logging into networks Tuesday morning due to a problem related to domain controllers, or servers that process authentication requests, which could not validate personal identity verification (PIV) cards used by federal workers and contractors to access certain information systems, according to the source. Some employees were able to access systems through a virtual private network. It was not clear if other branches of DHS were affected. The source characterized the issue as one stemming from relatively benign information technology missteps and a failure to ensure network redundancy. There was no evidence of foul play, the source said, adding that it appeared the domain controller credentials had expired on Monday when offices were closed for the federal Presidents Day holiday. We are working to track all device certificate issuance and expirations to ensure future lapses of service do not occur, the DHS official said in the statement. President Donald Trump vowed to make cyber security a priority during his administration, following an election marred by hacks of Democratic Party emails that U.S. intelligence agencies concluded were carried out by Russia in order to help Trump, a Republican, win. At a White House event last month he said he would hold my Cabinet secretaries and agency heads accountable, totally accountable, for the cyber security of their organizations. Trump had planned to sign a cyber security executive order last month but it was put on hold to allow more time for review. Reporting by Dustin Volz; Editing by Jonathan Oatis"

The unlisted insurance firm's owners - five Hong Kong-based  financial institutions including Chong Hing Insurance Co Ltd, a unit of Chong Hing Bank Ltd - have agreed to sell their respective equity stakes to First Origin. First Origin mainly focuses on investments in financial and technology sectors in Asia, one of the owners, Chong Hing Bank, said in a statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange late on Monday. Hong Kong Life Insurance is one of the last remaining independent life businesses in the financial centre, and ranked 10th in terms of new business annual premium among life insurers in the city in the third quarter of 2016. Last year, China's Thaihot Group, a relatively new entrant to Hong Kong financial circles, agreed to buy Dah Sing Financial's life insurance unit for $1.4 billion in Hong Kong's most expensive insurance M&A.; In another deal that closed last year, China's JD Capital bought Ageas' Hong Kong insurance unit for $1.4 billion. Hong Kong is a developed life insurance market, with a life and health insurance premium-to-GDP ratio of 13.4 percent in 2015, the second-highest in Asia, according to Swiss Re. Still, the market offers strong growth, with Swiss Re forecasting premiums to grow 9.2 percent in 2016, making it attractive to new entrants. Hong Kong Life Insurance was founded in 2001 by OCBC Wing Hang Bank, Asia Insurance Co, Shanghai Commercial Bank, Chong Hing Bank and Wing Lung Bank. OCBC Wing Hang Bank owns a 33 percent stake while the others own about 16.7 percent each. Hong Kong Life sells insurance through 180 outlets using branch networks of Chong Hing Bank, OCBC Wing Hang, Shanghai Commercial and Wing Lung Bank.

The rebels attacked government positions in the town of Soran and the village of Maardas, gaining control over parts of them, a monitor of Syria's civil war said.  Tahrir al-Sham, an alliance of Syrian jihadist rebel groups, said on a social media feed that it had carried out two suicide car bomb attacks close to Soran in the countryside north of Hama at the start of the assault. The battle of Hama has begun, God be thanked, the group said in a posting on a Telegram channel it uses.  A military media unit run by Hezbollah, an ally of the Syrian government, said that the army was fighting rebels who attacked its positions north of Hama after detonating a bomb.  The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based war monitor, said there had been big explosions heard in that area and that there were intense clashes between the army on one side and Tahrir al-Sham and some other jihadist groups on the other.  The rebels gained control over several positions in the area around Soran and in Maardas just south of it, the Observatory said. The Hezbollah military media unit said the rebels had not gained control over either Soran or Maardas.  Rebels including hardline Islamist groups that joined to form Tahrir al-Sham staged an offensive in northern Hama last year that led to territorial advances in the area near Soran.  Tahrir al-Sham includes the former Nusra Front group, which officially designated itself as the Syrian branch of al Qaeda until last year, when it ended its formal allegiance to the global jihadist organization.  The Syrian army regained Soran last October, according to a military source and war monitor, as part of a counter-attack against insurgents that had lasted for weeks. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and his Russian, Iranian and Shi'ite Muslim militia allies have put mainly Sunni Muslim rebels fighting to oust him on the back foot over the past 18 months with a string of military victories.  Rebel groups including Tahrir al-Sham launched a new assault on Monday near central districts of Damascus, where fierce fighting continues amid heavy bombardment.

The agreement is the second phase of an earlier deal to evacuate people from two towns besieged by rebels, and two towns besieged by pro-government forces, the first phase of which was implemented last month, al-Manar reported.  The wounded fighters and some others accompanying them would form a group of about 50, reported the television channel, which is based in Lebanon. Hezbollah, also from Lebanon, is a close military ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.  Nusra Front was the official branch of al-Qaeda in Syria until a year ago, when it broke formal allegiance to the global jihadist movement and renamed itself. It has since joined a number of other militant groups under the new name Tahrir al-Sham.  Both Nusra Front and later Tahrir al-Sham have at times fought alongside other rebel groups, including those that operate under the banner of the Free Syrian Army, against the government and at times have clashed with them.  Yarmouk, in the southern suburbs of Damascus, is the location of a large Palestinian refugee camp. Parts of the area are held by the government, parts by rebels including Tahrir al-Sham, and parts by Islamic State.  An earlier deal involved evacuating civilians from the rebel-besieged Shi'ite Muslim towns of Kefraya and al-Foua in Idlib province in return for the departure of civilians and insurgent fighters from Zabadani and Madaya, near Damascus. Completed late last month, that agreement was the largest and most complex so far in a series of evacuation deals for besieged areas that have grown more common over the past year in Syria's civil war.  While Assad's government in Damascus has praised such deals as a way to reduce bloodshed, the rebels have condemned them as a means to impose demographic change by forcing large numbers of civilians to leave pro-opposition areas.  The United Nations, which has not been party to the agreements, has also voiced concern that they amount to forced displacement.  Reporting by Angus McDowall; Editing by Andrew Bolton"
"https://www.reuters.com/article/philippines-casinos-idUSL3N1H44BO","Philippines aims to include casinos in dirty money law this year: senator","","March 27, 2017 /  2:19 PM / 4 months ago","","MANILA (Reuters) - The Philippines could tighten its money laundering law this year to cover casinos, its top lawmaker said on Monday, in a move aimed at plugging loopholes that allowed $81 million stolen from Bangladesh to pass through Manila gaming venues. The Senate aims to approve its version of the bill in May and it is likely the lower house of Congress would hold separate discussions on its version around the same time, said Senate President Aquilino Pimentel.  Apart from strict enforcement of a know-your-customer rule, casinos would, under the proposed amendment, be required to report to the country's anti-money laundering body accumulated bets within a 24-hour period totaling 3 million pesos ($60,000), he said. The review of the existing law comes after a breach last year of Bangladesh Bank's systems and use of SWIFT messaging network to request nearly $1 billion from its account at the New York Federal Reserve in early February. The branch of the U.S. central bank rejected most of the requests, but $81 million disappeared into casinos and other entities in the Philippines. The pending bill is one of the products of the (senate) investigation, Pimentel told reporters, referring to the inquiry it conducted last year into the stolen Bangladesh central bank money. The exclusion of casinos from the current scope of the anti-money laundering laws and a strict bank secrecy law have made it difficult for authorities to track the Bangladesh money trail and identify the perpetrators. Bangladesh's central bank has retrieved just under a fifth of the stolen funds. The plan is for President Rodrigo Duterte to sign the measure into law this year, Pimentel said. Duterte has expressed frustration at the country's anti-money laundering body for lack of progress in tracking the proceeds of illegal drugs trafficking, a task made more difficult by its tough bank secrecy laws. Amending the law had been an uphill battle because of fierce lobbying by the gaming industry, according to lawmakers.  Casinos last year raked in 149 billion Philippine pesos  in gross gaming revenue, data from the gaming regulator showed.  Pimentel also said the Senate would not close its doors to reopening the investigation into the heist, given that only a small amount had been recovered. Asked whether the revelation by U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation that North Korea was responsible could compel lawmakers to revive the probe, Pimentel said: Allow us to process the information first.

The British high-street clothing chain has subjected itself to a stress test, previously the preserve of the financial world. In the worst scenario, where the average branch’s sales dip 6 percent a year for a decade, the net profit margin of its store portfolio will halve. Openness about the problems facing retailers is welcome. But this voluntary exam glosses over big risks. The company deserves credit for addressing a question on all of its competitors’ minds. Will a big store network be an asset or a liability as shoppers increasingly buy with the click of a mouse? Next, whose market capitalisation was 6.1 billion pounds ($7.6 billion) by mid-Thursday, paints an upbeat picture. The net profit margin almost holds its own from the current 20 percent if like-for-like sales dip 2 percent annually, the average slowdown of the past five years. In its most stressed scenario, store net profit margins still hit 10 percent. But in the same way that the European bank stress tests have underplayed hot-button risks like deflation and sovereign bond defaults, Next glosses over potential pitfalls. The group led by Chief Executive Simon Wolfson reckons it can cull the size of its store portfolio by shuttering unprofitable shops as their leases expire, leaving only its most lucrative locations. What Next doesn’t say is how many stores it reckons will still be open by the end of its 10-year timeline. Nor does it show its working on rising costs from staff wages, or sourcing clothing in Asia amid a depreciating sterling. The company already reckons general wage inflation will cost it an additional 8 million pounds this year. Those things could change the outcome a lot. Imagine Next’s store sales halve over a decade – only slightly more dramatic than its own worst-case scenario. All else being equal, if its net profit margin halves too, earnings would fall by three-quarters. Close stores and that falls even further. Meanwhile, stress tests don’t easily predict how fickle customers will react to rising prices or next season’s designs. In kicking off an important conversation, Next has shown just how much retailers are operating in the dark.BreakingviewsReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

Yang Jiacai, assistant chairman of CBRC, has been under investigation since April 9 in connection with the scandal in  Hubei province, Caixin said late on Saturday, following days of rumors circulating online that Yang had gone missing. China's graft watchdog on April 9 also announced an investigation into the chairman of the country's insurance regulator, Xiang Junbo, the most senior financial regulator to be investigated as part of a government fight against graft. Yang could not be reached for comment.     No official announcement of an investigation into him has been made. His name and profile were still accessible on the CBRC website on Sunday. Caixin reported last Friday that Yang had been relieved of his duties, citing people with knowledge of the matter. CBRC did not respond to a faxed request for comment on Friday or to a second fax on Sunday about the investigation. Yang's last public appearance was on April 7 speaking at a news conference about new risk control guidelines for lenders as part of efforts to contain risks from a rapid build-up in debt. China's top leaders have pledged this year to address financial risks and asset bubbles. President Xi Jinping has pledged to wage war on deep seated graft in the ruling Communist party until officials at all levels dare not be corrupt, warning that a failure to check the rot could threaten the party's existence.

Yang spent most of his career in Hubei and was deputy head of the central bank's Wuhan city branch in Hubei from 1997 to 2003, according to his official profile.  According to the article, investigations into the scandal have already led to a number of official probes, including into chief risk officer of China's Bank of Communications, Yang Dongping, who was expelled from the party on Feb. 24.

The Treasury excludes any suggestion of a banking resolution, a Treasury source said. According to La Stampa daily the European Commission will tell Italy in coming days it cannot inject public money to rescue Veneto Banca [VBANC.UL] and rival Banca Popolare di Vicenza [BPVS.UL]. Citing sources at the Italian Treasury and EU institutions, the newspaper said Rome's plan of using a precautionary recapitalization to save the two lenders by using more than 5 billion euros ($5.6 bln) of public funds was no longer viable. Instead the branches and assets of the two banks would be hived off into a good bank while the non-performing loans would be placed in a bad bank, it said. Related CoverageItaly rules out resolution for Veneto banks: Treasury sourceA spokesman for the Commission said he could not confirm the report. The Commission and the Italian authorities are working closely together to ensure a viable solution.     Rome has been trying for months to reach an agreement over a bailout to avoid their liquidation.     Talks with the European Commission have dragged on because Brussels wants private investors to pump 1.25 billion euros into the banks before any taxpayer money can be used to avert them being wound down.     But La Stampa said Rome had failed to find lenders willing to provide the private capital requested by the Commission.     It said talks with Italy's main banks in recent days had spoken of a resolution - the EU procedure to wind down a failing lender - of the two Veneto lenders and their sale at a symbolic price.     Earlier this month European authorities stepped in to avert a collapse of Spain's Banco Popular following a run on the bank, orchestrating a last-minute rescue by Santander.     La Stampa said it was still not clear who might buy the performing assets of the two Veneto lenders but said talks were most advanced with Italy's Intesa Sanpaolo.     However it cautioned that Italy's biggest retail bank was concerned about stretching its balance sheet and jeopardizing dividends, adding that any acquisition might prompt the European Central Bank to ask for a capital increase.     The Italian Treasury and Intesa Sanpaolo were not immediately available for comment.     Italian Economy Minister Pier Carlo Padoan said on Friday he was confident a solution for the two banks could be reached soon.

Alamo died on Tuesday at a U.S. Bureau of Prisons facility in North Carolina, according to television station KARK in Arkansas, where Alamo's religious organization was once based.  Representatives for the Federal Bureau of Prisons and for Tony Alamo Christian Ministries in California could not be reached for comment late on Wednesday.  Alamo was listed in the federal court system under his given name, Bernie Lazar Hoffman.  In 2009, Alamo was convicted in federal court in Arkansas on charges of transporting five girls across state lines to sexually abuse them, according to court records. He was sentenced to 175 years in prison. One of the child victims told investigators she was 8 years old when Alamo first molested her at his home in Fouke, Arkansas, and that when she was 9 he began calling her his wife, according to court records.  Alamo, an evangelical Christian who often promoted conspiracy theories about the Roman Catholic Church, founded his religious organization in the late 1960s in the Hollywood section of Los Angeles and in the mid-1970s moved the group's headquarters from California to Alma, Arkansas.  At the height of his influence, Alamo had thousands of followers, including some who worked at one of the ministry's several businesses such as a printing press he used to spread anti-Catholic messages. His religious group, which critics described as a cult, had branches in other states including New Jersey and Tennessee. Alamo once controlled the finances of members of his ministry and told them to distrust the government, according to a 2012 decision by the U.S. 8th Circuit Court of Appeals, in a case that awarded millions in damages to ex-followers who were beaten as children. In the 1990s, Alamo served four years in prison after he was convicted of income tax evasion. Aside from appearing on television in the 1970s along with his then wife Susan, who died in 1982, Alamo was also known for making designer jackets that were popular with celebrities in the 1980s, according to a 2009 report on the website of the Southern Poverty Law Center.

Board meetings to discuss the deal are being held this evening though the final agreement may not be reached tonight, one of the sources with knowledge of the meetings said without providing any details. Bankia and BMN, both controlled by the Spanish state, declined to comment. Last week, Spanish Economy Minister Luis de Guindos said that he expected both banks to agree on a share swap for a merger deal within days or weeks, while the chairman of Bankia said he expected the transaction to be completed in the fourth quarter. The state owns about 66 percent of listed Bankia, the fourth largest Spanish bank, and 65 percent of smaller lender BMN and plans to privatize them both before December 2019. Bankia and BMN were given a 24-billion-euro ($25.5 billion) bailout in 2012 after losses on property loans. Bankia's market value was around 11.5 billion euros ($12.85 billion) based on its closing share price on Monday. BMN was valued at around 1 billion euros by an independent adviser selected earlier this year by Spain's FROB bailout fund. Spanish banks have already undergone huge consolidation since the country's financial crisis, with just 13 left from 55 in 2008. In the latest stage of this process, Banco Popular, the country's sixth-biggest bank, was taken over Spain's largest bank Santander (SAN.MC) in early June for the symbolic price of one euro after European authorities stepped in to prevent its collapse. A privatization of Bankia and BMN is seen as one of the final steps in cleaning up Spain's banking sector, which was hit when a property bubble burst forcing the government to combine several failing banks to form Bankia and BMN. Analysts believe that the merger makes sense because each bank has a different geographic footprint, although the combined group would need to cut staff and branches as banks in Spain are struggling with ultra low interest rates and competition for lending. Bankia, which lost more than 19 billion euros in 2012 due to its real estate holdings, has bounced back strongly since its bailout and now has one of the highest profitability ratios and strongest capital positions among Spanish banks. BMN's profitability ratio is one of the lowest. Reporting By Jesús Aguado; editing by Sonya Dowsett, Tomas Cobos and Jane Merriman"

"https://www.reuters.com/article/altice-bank-idUSL8N1K4211","Telecoms group Altice to launch online bank in Europe: source","","July 13, 2017 /  9:24 AM / 15 days ago","","PARIS (Reuters) - French billionaire Patrick Drahi plans to launch an online bank by early 2019 in the European countries where his telecoms and cable firm Altice operates, a source close to the matter said on Thursday. The service, to be called Alticebank, would add another layer to the company's businesses, which have already grown beyond telecoms with the acquisition of broadcast distribution rights as well as online video advertising marketplace Teads.  The move also highlights the heightened competition in retail financial services, with mobile operators seeing the increase in smartphone ownership and the lower use of bank branches as an opportunity to challenge traditional lenders. Altice, a holding company based in the Netherlands, has expanded rapidly through a series of debt-financed buyouts in the United States and Europe. It owns France's second-biggest telecoms firm SFR Group and Portugal's biggest. It's the first one on a European level, but certainly not the last one, Julien Maldonato, a partner at Deloitte in Paris, said referring to online banks launched by telecoms companies. The logic is to make the heavy telecoms infrastructure profitable, he said. French rival Orange, which is testing an online bank, hopes to launch it nationwide to take on traditional banks with a low-cost services that will eventually expand to include loans and insurance. The service, Orange Bank, aims to break even in four to five years and was formed after the former telecoms monopoly bought 65 percent of Groupama Banque last year. The nationwide launch was postponed last month, however, to allow for additional testing. A union official pointed at the time to issues with the quality of the user interface and customer service. The Orange plan for France contrasts with Altice's current strategy, under which its new banking service would be built from scratch and need to go through a complex regulatory compliance process.  Altice has requested a banking license from the European Central Bank (ECB), the source said, confirming an earlier report by newspaper Le Parisien.  The ECB declined to comment.

There is a deal, NBG's unit will be sold to OTP, a source in Athens said. OTP executives have said publicly they were in the running for Romaneasca as well as other banks in the region as they look to bolster the bank's presence in central Europe. NBG (NBGr.AT) plans to sell more assets in the Balkans, including its Romanian operations, to complete a restructuring plan agreed with European authorities, its chief executive Leonidas Fragiadakis told Reuters this month. This M&A; event was well-anticipated, Ipopema analyst Norbert Harcsa said. OTP could have a 3.6 percent market share (in Romania) versus a management target of 5 percent. The price-to-book could be the same as it was in Croatia (in May). OTP bought Croatian Splitska Banka from Societe Generale for a price close to book value. OTP, which will add Romaneasca's network of about 110 branches, is also expected to pay back a loan of 550 million euros ($625 million) that Banca Romaneasca borrowed from NBG. Apart from Romaneasca, Fragiadakis has said NBG would sell smaller operations in Serbia, Albania and Cyprus as part of agreements with regulators. One asset the bank still has is Serbia's Vojvodanska Banka, which is also a possible target for OTP, which has said it is looking at potential acquisitions there. The Hungarian bank did not reply to questions seeking comment on the Romaneasca deal or any further possible ones. OTP is one of the region's largest independent banks, and weathered the financial crisis better than many rivals. After Hungary imposed special taxes on the financial sector, it took a cautious line, doubling liquidity reserves from 4 billion euros in 2011 to 8.3 billion euros at the end of the first quarter.  As those special taxes have been gradually lifted, OTP has begun to expand in the region - just as Greek banks are looking to sell assets. OTP's core equity tier 1 capital ratio - a key measure of financial strength - was 16.6 percent at the end of the first quarter after hovering around 15 percent for the last five years.

According to the lawsuit, Minnesota-based TCF National Bank wrongly pushed customers into a costly overdraft protection that generated hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue. A spokesman for the bank, a subsidiary of TCF Financial Corp TCB.N, denied the charges and said the lender would fight the case in court. TCF intends to vigorously defend against the CFPB's allegations, and we believe we have strong, principled defenses, said Mark Goldman in a statement. According to the suit, bank employees pushed customers to opt into a program. The suit cited as an example a customer who could be charged $35 in fees for a $2 overdraft. Many customers wrongly thought the service was mandatory rather than optional, according to the complaint. A 2010 law was meant to ensure bank customers willingly sought overdraft insurance but ‎TCF bulldozed its way through protections, CFPB Director Richard Cordray said in a statement. Overdraft Revenue TCF had challenged the 2010 rule in court but dropped its lawsuit in 2011.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/masseyenergy-ceo-idUSL1N1F915U","Court upholds conviction of Massey ex-CEO in fatal mine blast","","January 19, 2017 /  4:02 PM / 6 months ago","","Jan 19 (Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Thursday rejected former Massey Energy Co Chief Executive Officer Donald Blankenship's bid to overturn his conviction and one-year prison sentence related to his role in a 2010 West Virginia mine explosion that killed 29 workers. The decision by the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals likely means Blankenship will remain in prison at least until he is eligible for release on May 10. Blankenship led Massey from 2000 to 2010 and is the most prominent U.S. coal executive convicted of a crime related to miners' deaths. Blankenship, 66, argued that his December 2015 conviction on a misdemeanor conspiracy charge should be voided because the federal indictment did not specify which U.S. mine safety regulations he conspired to violate, and because of several errors by the trial judge. But the Richmond, Virginia-based appeals court said the indictment was sufficiently detailed, and that the trial judge did not commit reversible error when instructing jurors about the meaning of willfully violating mine safety regulations. Contrary to Blankenship's position, a mine operator is not immune from criminal liability by characterizing his mine's repeated failure to comply with safety laws as a consequence of tough decisions he had to make weighing production, safety, and regulatory compliance, Circuit Judge James Wynn wrote. A lawyer for Blankenship did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The office of U.S. Attorney Carol Casto in Charleston, West Virginia, had no immediate comment. The fire caused by a methane or natural gas leak likely set off the fatal April 2010 blast at Massey's now-closed Upper Big Branch mine, located about 40 miles (65 km) south of Charleston, according to federal investigators. The death toll was the highest in a U.S. mine accident since 91 workers died in a 1972 Idaho silver mine fire. Blankenship was also fined $250,000 in connection with his conviction. He was acquitted on related felony charges. Once known as West Virginia's king of coal for his working-class background and tough approach to business, Blankenship helped build Massey into Appalachia's largest coal producer, with more than 7,000 employees and more than 40 mines. Massey was acquired in 2011 by Alpha Natural Resources Inc for about $7 billion. Alpha Natural filed for bankruptcy in August 2015 amid a coal industry slowdown, and emerged last July."

The central bank said stories posted on social media had falsely suggested Heritage was unable to discharge its obligation to depositors. We wish to state that Heritage Bank is not in distress and as such its depositors should go about their transactions without fear, central bank spokesman Isaac Okorafor said in a statement. We wish to further state that no Nigerian bank is in distress. Nigeria's 21 banks have been laying off staff, closing branches and slashing forecasts as a recession, caused by a slump in oil prices bites harder in Africa's largest economy. In July, the central bank sacked the management of Skye bank, Nigeria's eighth biggest, for failing to meet minimum capital ratios. Skye's non-performing loan ratio (NPLs) had been above the regulatory limit for a while. NPLs in the banking sector hit 11.7 percent in the first half of 2016, well above the central bank's 5 percent limit, and are forecast to rise further this year. NPL's stood at 5.3 percent at the end of last year. The fall in oil prices since mid-2014 has forced Nigerian lenders, which have long focused on loans to the energy sector, to adapt their business models. Loans to the oil and gas sectors accounted for almost a third of total bank lending.

The bonus boost, which Chief Executive Bill Winters said was needed to motivate and retain staff, came as the lender swung back to a pretax profit of $409 million for 2016, a year after reporting its first loss in more than a quarter of a century. The move comes after rival lenders reported shrinking bonus pools due to underwhelming results. We continue to ensure that our pay remains competitive, and rewarding good performance. We had a meaningful improvement in performance ... so we concluded that this small increase was appropriate, Winters told reporters on a conference call. Winters said that despite the rise, compensation was still about 27 percent lower than what the bank paid out in dollar terms in 2012. StanChart will not pay a dividend for 2016 to shareholders as its restructuring is not complete and the bank faces regulatory uncertainty, Chief Financial Officer Andy Halford told reporters on a conference call. The profit result beat the $366 million expected by analysts, Thomson Reuters data showed. The bank's shares fell 4 percent in London by 1000 GMT. Winters' Discontent Since taking the helm in June 2015, Winters has announced plans to axe more than 15,000 jobs, closed the bank's stock trading business and overhauled its management team as he seeks to restore a slimmed-down StanChart to growing profitability. The former JPMorgan executive has expressed dissatisfaction with the bank's performance, last November branding its income and profit levels unacceptable as it missed out on bumper trading profits reaped by rivals more focused on the United States and Europe. Our financial returns are not yet where they need to be and do not reflect the group's earnings potential, Winters said in Friday's statement. Previous StanChart chairman John Peace said last year Standard Chartered would risk a staff exodus if it cut bonuses, responding to investor anger over high pay when the bank is not paying a dividend. It said in November 2015 that it was scrapping its final dividend. Winters himself received total pay for 2016 of 3.4 million pounds, excluding an additional long term incentive plan if performance targets are met. A total of 139 employees earned over 1 million euros  ($1.06 million), with the highest earning between 6-7 million euros, according to the bank's statement.  StanChart reported a $215 million loss from its stake in Indonesian lender PT Bank Permata Tbk (BNLI.JK), on rising bad loans and restructuring costs.  StanChart is seeking to reduce its interests in the Southeast Asian country to a single entity to comply with regulations, either by merging its branch with Permata or selling its stake in the local lender.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usas-trump-immigration-idUSKBN15R0O3","White House official attacks court after legal setbacks on immigration","","February 12, 2017 /  2:36 PM / 6 months ago","","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A White House official on Sunday attacked a U.S. court ruling that blocked President Donald Trump's executive order on immigration as a judicial usurpation of power and said the administration was considering a range of options, including a new order. Sustained criticism of the judiciary from the White House comes amid concern among Democrats and legal scholars over Trump's view of the constitutional principle of judicial independence as the administration seeks to overcome legal setbacks to its travel ban issued on Jan. 27. It has also become the backdrop against which U.S. senators consider Trump's Supreme Court nominee, Judge Neil Gorsuch, for a lifetime appointment to the nation's highest court.  The Republican president said on Friday that he may issue a new executive order rather than go through lengthy court challenges to the original one, which temporarily barred entry to the United States of people from seven Muslim-majority countries. We have multiple options and we are considering all of them, White House senior policy adviser Stephen Miller said on ABC's This Week.  Miller sharply criticized the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling on Thursday that upheld a Seattle federal judge's suspension of Trump's executive order. He accused the San Francisco-based court of having a history of overreaching and of being overturned. This is a judicial usurpation of power, he said on Fox News Sunday. The president's powers here are beyond question. The Trump administration has defended the travel ban on grounds it will prevent potential terrorists from entering the country, although no acts of terrorism have been perpetrated on U.S. soil by citizens of the targeted countries. The ban's announcement, late on a Friday, sparked a weekend of confusion at airports around the globe and within the federal agencies charged with enforcing it. It also triggered widespread protests and legal challenges. Aware that a new executive order would allow critics to declare victory against the travel ban, the White House has deflected blame and intensified its criticism of the judiciary. I think it's been an important reminder to all Americans that we have a judiciary that has taken far too much power and become in many cases a supreme branch of government, Miller said on CBS' Face the Nation. One unelected judge in Seattle cannot make laws for the entire country. I mean this is just crazy, he said. Senior White House Advisor Stephen Miller waits to go on the air in the White House Briefing Room in Washington, U.S., February 12, 2017.Joshua RobertsMiller's performance on several Sunday news shows won a plaudit on Twitter from Trump, who has himself attacked individual judges and called the courts so political. Great job! Trump tweeted. Attacks Condemned Gorsuch condemned the attacks on the judiciary as disheartening in private meetings last week with a number of U.S. senators, who pressed the judge to go public. Ron Bonjean, a Republican strategist, confirmed the conversations. Slideshow (7 Images)Legal experts said the Trump administration statements could undermine respect for the constitutional division of powers. Cornell University law professor Jens David Ohlin said that accusing the judiciary of usurping the president's powers demonstrated an absurd lack of appreciation for the separation of powers. Miller is coming dangerously close to reviving a discredited and dangerous theory that each branch of government, including the president, has independent authority to decide what the law and Constitution mean, Ohlin said in an interview on Sunday.  In our system of government, the commander in chief executes the laws, but it is the judiciary which interprets both the laws and statutes passed by Congress and the Constitution. That's their solemn duty, he added. Ilya Shapiro, a senior fellow in constitutional studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, said Trump’s remarks could diminish popular respect for institutions of law and order by making Americans think the government’s a joke, that you don’t have to follow what judges say. Immigration laws give the U.S. president broad powers to restrict who enters the country on national security grounds. But the same laws forbid discrimination based on race, sex, nationality or place of birth or residence. The case also could involve First Amendment protections involving religion. Trump's executive order banned entry into the United States to refugees and citizens of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days and all refugees for 120 days, except refugees from Syria, who were banned indefinitely.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-trump-immigration-idUSL1N1FY0HE","White House official attacks court after legal setbacks on immigration","","February 13, 2017 /  12:57 PM / 5 months ago","","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A White House official on Sunday attacked a U.S. court ruling that blocked President Donald Trump's executive order on immigration as a judicial usurpation of power and said the administration was considering a range of options, including a new order. Sustained criticism of the judiciary from the White House comes amid concern among Democrats and legal scholars over Trump's view of the constitutional principle of judicial independence as the administration seeks to overcome legal setbacks to its travel ban issued on Jan. 27. It has also become the backdrop against which U.S. senators consider Trump's Supreme Court nominee, Judge Neil Gorsuch, for a lifetime appointment to the nation's highest court. The Republican president said on Friday that he may issue a new executive order rather than go through lengthy court challenges to the original one, which temporarily barred entry to the United States of people from seven Muslim-majority countries. We have multiple options and we are considering all of them, White House senior policy adviser Stephen Miller said on ABC's This Week. Miller sharply criticized the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling on Thursday that upheld a Seattle federal judge's suspension of Trump's executive order. He accused the San Francisco-based court of having a history of overreaching and of being overturned. This is a judicial usurpation of power, he said on Fox News Sunday. The president's powers here are beyond question. The Trump administration has defended the travel ban on grounds it will prevent potential terrorists from entering the country, although no acts of terrorism have been perpetrated on U.S. soil by citizens of the targeted countries. The ban's announcement, late on a Friday, sparked a weekend of confusion at airports around the globe and within the federal agencies charged with enforcing it. It also triggered widespread protests and legal challenges. Aware that a new executive order would allow critics to declare victory against the travel ban, the White House has deflected blame and intensified its criticism of the judiciary. I think it's been an important reminder to all Americans that we have a judiciary that has taken far too much power and become in many cases a supreme branch of government, Miller said on CBS' Face the Nation. One unelected judge in Seattle cannot make laws for the entire country. I mean this is just crazy, he said. Miller's performance on several Sunday news shows won a plaudit on Twitter from Trump, who has himself attacked individual judges and called the courts so political. Great job! Trump tweeted. Attacks Condemned Gorsuch condemned the attacks on the judiciary as disheartening in private meetings last week with a number of U.S. senators, who pressed the judge to go public. Ron Bonjean, a Republican strategist, confirmed the conversations. Legal experts said the Trump administration statements could undermine respect for the constitutional division of powers. Cornell University law professor Jens David Ohlin said that accusing the judiciary of usurping the president's powers demonstrated an absurd lack of appreciation for the separation of powers. Miller is coming dangerously close to reviving a discredited and dangerous theory that each branch of government, including the president, has independent authority to decide what the law and Constitution mean, Ohlin said in an interview on Sunday. In our system of government, the commander in chief executes the laws, but it is the judiciary which interprets both the laws and statutes passed by Congress and the Constitution. That's their solemn duty, he added. Ilya Shapiro, a senior fellow in constitutional studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, said Trump’s remarks could diminish popular respect for institutions of law and order by making Americans think the government’s a joke, that you don’t have to follow what judges say. Immigration laws give the U.S. president broad powers to restrict who enters the country on national security grounds. But the same laws forbid discrimination based on race, sex, nationality or place of birth or residence. The case also could involve First Amendment protections involving religion. Trump's executive order banned entry into the United States to refugees and citizens of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days and all refugees for 120 days, except refugees from Syria, who were banned indefinitely. Options for the administration include formulating a new executive action, appealing the 9th Circuit panel's decision to the full appeals court and appealing the emergency stay to the U.S. Supreme Court, Miller said."
"https://www.reuters.com/article/azerbaijan-iba-idUSL8N1IE5J5","UPDATE 3-Azeri bank IBA says debt to be restructured totals $3.3 billion","","May 12, 2017 /  2:50 PM / 3 months ago","","* Azerbaijan's economy hit by low oil prices * Bank laden with bad debts * It is to suspend repayment on debt * Creditors likely to face haircut - analyst (Adds fund manager comment) By Nailia Bagirova and Margarita Antidze BAKU/TBILISI, May 12 (Reuters) - International Bank of Azerbaijan, the energy exporting country's biggest lender, said on Friday it needed to restructure more than $3 billion of its debt, most owed to foreign creditors, to tackle bad loans left over from the slump in oil prices. The state-controlled bank announced on Thursday it was suspending payments on some liabilities and seeking creditors' support for restructuring. The news sent IBA's dollar-denominated bond tumbling to its lowest level in over a year. The bank's problems show how Azerbaijan is still wrestling with the fallout of a prolonged slump on the global oil market, even though prices recovered some lost ground in early to mid-2016. An economic slowdown caused by the oil prices - which remain around half 2014 levels - left many of the bank's creditors unable to repay their loans. That built up non-performing debts that a previous government rescue package failed to fix. The bank published on Friday what it said was its proposed restructuring plan. According to this, the total level of debt subject to restructuring stood at $3.34 billion as of April 18. This included debt owed to entities including commodities trader Cargill, Italian lender Intesa Sanpaolo, Germany's Commerzbank and Bayerische Landesbank, and France's Societe Generale. The debt the bank wants to restructure include the $500 million Eurobond due on June 11, 2019. FACTBOX - IBA's debts under restructuring plan The plan did not set out the size of the haircut that creditors will be asked to take under the restructuring. Typically, creditors are asked to agree to accept a sum less than they are owed by the debtor. In the preliminary restructuring plan, the bank said it plans to exchange at least some of the bank's liabilities for Azeri sovereign debt. Azerbaijan's Finance Minister, Samir Sharifov, has said he will meet the bank's creditors in London on May 23 to seek their approval for the plan. Commerzbank, Bayerische Landesbank and SocGen declined to comment about how they viewed the bank's proposal. Lazard Frères and White & Case, hired by IBA to handle the restructuring, also declined comment. People familiar with the views of several creditor institutions, who did not want to be identified, said the institutions will participate in the restructuring talks and try to minimise any losses. Pavel Mamai, a portfolio manager at UK hedge fund Promeritum Investment Management, said IBA's creditors would be hard-pressed to resist whatever terms Azerbaijan offers because $1  billion of the debt earmarked for restructuring is held by state sovereign wealth fund SOFAZ. With SOFAZ already on board, IBA will be able to get the approval of the required two-thirds of creditors, especially with the help of trade finance firms, Mamai predicted. Creditors will be told either accept the deal or we declare bankruptcy, he added. I don't think creditors will have a lot of choice. However the blow will be softened if creditors receive sovereign bonds in the exchange, leaving them with a better-quality asset, said Richard Segal, emerging debt strategist at Manulife Asset Management. But they will have to take a haircut, that's just burden sharing, he said. Financial Cushion The bank's $500 million bond fell by more than 17 cents to 82.6 cents as trade opened on Friday. But prices later recovered to 89 cents while Azerbaijan's manat currency was largely unmoved. Investors said Azerbaijan had enough of a financial cushion to prevent contagion into the wider economy. The government still has plenty of money available in its sovereign wealth fund, it still has a lot of assets it can access in order to underpin its banks, and I imagine that is what they will do, said Alan Shipman, economist and consultant for Oxford Economics. The bank said it expected 2016 financial results to show a net loss of around 1.9 billion manats ($1.115 billion). It attributed this to extra provisions against its loan portfolio, and the fall in the manat's value. Its Tier 1 capital ratio - a safety cushion against shocks and bad loans - is expected to be approximately -4.7 percent as of the end of last year. For euro zone banks, by contrast, the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio is set at plus 6 percent. Inside Azerbaijan, a mainly Muslim country that borders Russia and Iran, news of the restructuring broke on mainstream media on Thursday night. Television stations did not report in detail what was happening. A Reuters reporter who visited several IBA branches in the capital, Baku, on Friday said there was no rush by depositors to withdraw money. An employee at one branch said the bank was paying out money as normal, with no special restrictions on withdrawals. Several bank customers said they had not heard about the restructuring. None who spoke to Reuters said they planned to close their accounts. I think it's a state bank and nothing is going to happen with our accounts, said Valida Husseinova, a teacher. There were, however, rumblings of anger on social media. One Facebook user, Samir Aliyev, asked what had happened to the money that the state had already spent on rescuing the bank.

Asked what it means for Israel should President-elect Trump embark on a dramatic fiscal expansion, Flug said: If the policies that will be followed will imply a stronger recovery of the U.S. economy that's good for Israel. As a small, open economy we are very dependent on our major trading partner and the United States is a major trading partner, she added. The United States is Israel's third-largest trading partner after Europe and Asia. While the U.S. economy is improving and the Federal Reserve has started to raise interest rates, Europe is still struggling and dealing with very accommodative monetary policies. We are in the middle, Flug said at the Globes business conference. We can't react differently to different parts of the world...When we set our policies, we look not at what other central banks are doing but how it affects the main forces in our economy. Israel's economy is expected to grow close to 3 percent in 2016 after a 2.5 percent pace in 2015. Economists forecast growth of 3-3.5 percent next year. Flug said Israel is in a good economic situation, especially taking into account global events, while the labour market is strong. We see shortages in certain branches of the economy, wages are moving up so all the indications are that the labour market is approaching full employment, she said. As a result, Israel's benchmark interest rate  will likely not go below a current 0.1 percent, where it has stood for 21 straight months, although Flug declined to say when the central bank might start raising rates. Flug said she did not want to go to zero or negative interest rates since there are risks in such policies. If you can get to right point without going that route, it's better not too. For the Israeli economy, we didn't have to go as far as going to that unconventional path. The central bank next decides on rates and will update its economic estimates on Dec. 26.

The analysis published last week found more than 90 percent of the branch closures were in areas where the median household income is below the British average of 27,600 pounds ($36,600). The research is very worrying and I hope the Treasury are aware of it, James Heappey, a Conservative member of parliament (MP), told the House of Commons in a debate on Thursday. It is important to make sure that (banks) are not focusing their branch network on the areas where they can make the most cash, when the nation collectively bailed them out not too long ago, he said. Britain's biggest banks, HSBC (HSBA.L), Barclays (BARC.L), Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L) and Lloyds Banking Group (LLOY.L), have been steadily shrinking their branch networks to cut costs while investing in online and mobile banking services. MPs in the debate said Britain should consider emulating the United States in requiring banks to maintain branches and lending in poorer areas.  The U.S. Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 is designed to reduce discriminatory lending by requiring banks to lend in communities where they are chartered. The U.S. law can block the opening of new branches elsewhere if a bank does not comply. The major banks have all said they close branches based on declining footfall, as consumers move to online banking, and that they study the impact of such closures carefully. RBS, Lloyds and Barclays declined to comment for this story. A spokesman for HSBC said the bank has launched a digital service that allows small businesses to apply for loans without visiting a branch. The HSBC building in Canary Wharf London January 12, 2016.Kevin CoombsChristian Matheson, a Labour member of parliament, said the  Reuters study, which covered the year to April, showed a crisis.  There can be no more cavalier closures of bank branches, which in turn damage the local economy, Matheson said.  In 2008 we apparently learnt that some big banks are too big to fail. Perhaps the message today is that some local banks are too important to local communities to close. A Barclays bank office is seen at Canary Wharf  in London, Britain May 19, 2015.Suzanne Plunkett/File PhotoMPs called in the debate for banks to share branches in smaller communities, and to be more transparent about closures. Closures have more than halved lending growth to small businesses in the areas affected, separate research released on Thursday showed. Campaign group Move Your Money estimated lending growth to small local businesses was down by 63 percent in towns and villages that had lost a bank branch. A spokesman for the British Bankers' Association (BBA) said banks have signed up to protocols aimed at minimizing the impact of branch closures, including partnering with post offices to offer services and carrying out impact studies before closures.Banks are determined to leave no one behind, he said. But MP for Tottenham David Lammy said banks were using their Access to Banking Protocol as a 'Trojan horse' to distract from closures. This is a quiet scandal and tragedy taking place across our country, Lammy said in Thursday's debate. Britain's vote last week to leave the European Union has potentially triggered the biggest upheaval for banking since the 2007-2009 financial crisis, raising risks of recession and earnings downgrades that hit bank shares.

The Gulf branch of the famous Paris museum and two other planned museums are part of the oil-rich emirate's wider push to diversify its economy away from oil, investing billions of dollars in tourism, industry and infrastructure. The local Louvre was originally scheduled to open in 2012 but that target was pushed back to the second half of 2016, the chairman of state-owned Tourism Development and Investment Company (TDIC) told Reuters last year. TDIC, the developer, was scheduled to hand over the $650 million museum to Abu Dhabi’s Tourism & Culture Authority (TCA) in mid-2016. “First, the museum buildings have to be completed and delivered and then the opening (must take place), which is now some time in 2017,” a source close to the project said. “There is some work to be done – interiors, testing which are critical as the commissioning takes place.” Two other sources confirmed the opening is postponed to an unspecified date next year. All three sources declined to be identified as details about the project are private. A spokeswoman of TDIC declined to comment.  A building boom in the United Arab Emirates has created bottlenecks as some construction firms scramble to find labor, supplies and financing to complete huge backlogs of work. TDIC is developing a cultural district in Abu Dhabi that will house branches of the Louvre and Guggenheim museums, as well as the Zayed National Museum. The Zayed Museum was scheduled to open this year and the Guggenheim in 2017, but contracts are yet to be awarded for them.  Construction of Louvre Abu Dhabi was awarded to an Arabtec-led joint venture with Construction San Jose SA and Oger Abu Dhabi LLC in 2013.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-trump-immigration-idUSL1N1FT0PX","Trump calls courts 'so political' as travel ban faces scrutiny","","February 8, 2017 /  2:24 PM / 6 months ago","","(Reuters) - President Donald Trump stepped up his criticism of the U.S. judiciary on Wednesday, saying courts seem to be so political, a day after his U.S. travel ban on people from seven Muslim-majority countries faced close scrutiny from an appeals court. A three-judge panel of the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Tuesday heard arguments on the Trump administration's challenge to a lower court order putting his temporary travel ban on hold. Trump on Saturday accused the judge who issued the order of opening the United States to potential terrorists. The appeals court is expected to issue a ruling as soon as Wednesday. I don't ever want to call a court biased, Trump told hundreds of police chiefs and sheriffs from major cities at a meeting in a Washington hotel. So I won't call it biased. And we haven't had a decision yet. But courts seem to be so political. And it would be so great for our justice system if they would be able to read the statement and do what's right. I think it's a sad day. I think our security's at risk today. The appeals court must decide whether Trump acted within his authority or violated the U.S. Constitution's prohibition on laws favoring one religion over another, as well as anti-discrimination laws, and was tantamount to a discriminatory ban targeting Muslims. The 9th Circuit is expected to decide the narrow question of whether a lower court judge acted properly in temporarily halting enforcement of the president’s order. While the court could take into account the strength of the arguments on both sides, this is just a first step in a fast-moving case. The appeals court judges questioned whether the directive improperly targeted people because of their religion. Trump's Jan. 27 order barred travelers from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen from entering for 90 days and all refugees for 120 days, except those from civil war-torn Syria, whom he would ban indefinitely. Do What They Should Trump, a Republican who took office on Jan. 20 and has made extensive use of unilateral presidential directives that bypass Congress, has defended the directive as necessary to prevent attacks by Islamist militants. If these judges wanted to, in my opinion, help the court in terms of respect for the court, they'd do what they should be doing, he told the law enforcement officials. Trump praised a federal judge in Boston who earlier ruled in his favor on the travel ban as a highly respected jurist whose findings were perfect. Trump on Saturday labeled U.S. District Judge James Robart of Seattle, who put his directive on hold last Friday, as a so-called judge who made a ridiculous ruling. Robart was appointed to the bench by Republican President George W. Bush. Last year, Trump accused Indiana-born U.S. District Court Judge Gonzalo Curiel of bias in overseeing a lawsuit against one of Trump's businesses, Trump University, because of his Mexican heritage. Democrats and other critics have called Trump's comments toward the judiciary an attack on a core principle of American democracy that the courts are independent and uphold the rule of law. Under the Constitution, the judiciary is a co-equal branch of the U.S. government, along with Congress and the president's executive branch. At the meeting with law enforcement officials, Trump read from the law he cited to justify the travel ban, quoting it in fragments and sprinkling bits of interpretation. He said the law clearly allowed a president to suspend entry of any class of people if he determines them to be a detriment to national security. A bad high school student would understand this, Trump said. Anybody would understand this. Security and Safety In a Twitter post earlier on Wednesday, Trump wrote, If the U.S. does not win this case as it so obviously should, we can never have the security and safety to which we are entitled. Politics! U.S. State Department figures showed that 480 refugees have been admitted to the United States since Robart's order went into effect, including 168 on Wednesday. Of those admitted, 198 were from war-torn Syria. During an oral argument lasting more than an hour on Tuesday, the appeals court panel in San Francisco pressed an administration lawyer over whether the Trump administration's national security argument was backed by evidence that people from the seven countries posed a danger. Judge Richard Clifton, also appointed to the bench by Bush, posed equally tough questions for a lawyer representing Minnesota and Washington states, which are challenging the ban. The order, the most divisive act of Trump's young presidency, sparked protests and chaos at U.S. and overseas airports. Ultimately the matter is likely to go to the U.S. Supreme Court, which is ideologically split with four liberal justices and four conservatives pending Senate action on Trump's nomination of conservative appellate judge Neil Gorsuch to fill a lingering vacancy on the high court.

The latest financial woes have surfaced days after its founder and CEO Jia Yueting said the conglomerate's cash problems were far worse than expected and that billions of dollars in funds raised in recent months were not enough to help it ride out the crunch. China Merchants Bank Co Ltd said in a statement on Tuesday it had applied to have some of LeEco's assets frozen because a subsidiary, Leview Mobile HK Limited, had been late on making interest payments on a loan. CMB's Shanghai branch repeatedly urged repayment without success and so sought to use legal means, the bank said, adding it now had risks related to the loan under control and did not rule out using friendly talks to resolve the issue. LeEco, which controls smartphone maker Coolpad and its core listed smart TV unit Leshi Internet Information and Technology Corp, has been battling huge financial pressure since Jia admitted last year the company had expanded too fast and was facing big company disease. Several local media outlets this week reported CMB's Shanghai branch had successfully applied for an asset freeze against some of LeEco's subsidiaries, Jia and his wife, totalling 1.237 billion yuan ($182 million). Reuters could not immediately confirm if the Shanghai court had approved the asset freeze. CMB did not comment further on the details. A LeEco spokesman said CMB's asset-freeze application concerned financing loans related to LeEco's smartphone business, but added LeEco had enough collateral to cover the loan. Our senior executives are currently in close communication with various financing units of CMB, and we hope to resolve the related debt issue very soon, he added. LeEco also hopes to raise further cash to help the firm get back to normal, the spokesman said. In 2015, CMB agreed on a 10 billion yuan loan to LeEco, part of which was used to acquire a stake in Coolpad and was the biggest bank loan to LeEco at the time, financial magazine Caixin said on Monday, citing public information. Some other partners and suppliers are re-examining their exposure to the troubled group. This week, local media reported an affiliated company of electronics manufacturing giant Foxconn divested its 20 percent stake in LeEco's TV and video unit Leshi Zhixin, a blow to the company's core business and one of its most profitable units. Foxconn did not reply to Reuters' request for comment. LeEco is also facing pressure from China Mobile over late payments of around 14 million yuan, a person with knowledge of the matter said. The carrier declined to comment. In June, Taiwan's Compal Electronics Inc reduced shipments to LeEco, and temporarily suspended its plans to buy shares of Leshi Zhixin, according to local media. At Compal's first quarter investor conference, it said it was monitoring Leshi's repayment abilities and would develop a new strategy to collect its debt, which could involve legal action. Compal did not provide immediate comment when contacted by Reuters. LeEco did not reply to Reuters' requests for comments on its business partners' actions. Faced with the worsening cash crunch, LeEco has put some of its global properties for sale, cut staff numbers, and is planning a restructuring to fold some business units into Leshi Internet.

The world's oldest bank said on Wednesday it expected a net profit of more than 1.2 billion euros ($1.4 billion) in 2021, from a loss of 3.2 billion euros last year, as part of a restructuring plan approved by European authorities.  It's a conservative plan. We're not shooting at unrealistic targets, Chief Executive Marco Morelli told analysts on a conference call to present the new plan.  Morelli said no mergers were planned at the moment. There is no Plan B on the table, he said. Burdened by bad loans and a mismanagement scandal, Monte dei Paschi has for years been at the forefront of Italy's slow-brewing banking crisis. Italy's fourth-largest lender was forced to request state aid in December after its attempt to raise capital from private investors failed.  On Tuesday the European Union approved a 5.4 billion euro state bailout after it agreed to a drastic overhaul in a move that will leave Rome holding around 70 percent of the bank. EU officials speaking on condition of anonymity said Italy would have to exit the bank at the latest by the end of the 5-year plan. What we experienced in the last nine months is pretty much unheard of: It's like an ER department with an emergency every five minutes, Morelli said. Italy has pledged more than 20 billion euros of taxpayer money in the space of a week to rescue three of its banks, but the country's wider financial sector is still weighed down by around 300 billion euros of non-performing loans (NPLs). At the end of last month, Rome committed up to 17 billion euros to rescue regional banks Popolare di Vicenza and Veneto Banca though it said the final bill would be much lower, adding the state might even turn a profit from the bailouts.  FILE PHOTO: The entrance of Monte dei Paschi di Siena bank's headquarters is seen in Siena, Italy, July 1, 2016.Stefano Rellandini/File PhotoThe Monte Paschi plan looks good but we need to see execution. Still, coming after the Veneto rescues it settles nerves about Italy's banking system, said Zenit fund manager Stefano Fabiani. Path to Profit In its 2017-2021 plan, Monte dei Paschi sees a headcount reduction of around 5,500 to just over 20,000 and a fall in the number of branches to around 1,400 from some 2,000 in 2016 as it seeks to ensure the lender is profitable in the long term. It expects to reach a return on equity of more than 10 percent in 2021 while its CET1 ratio, a measure of financial strength, is seen at 14.7 percent from 8.2 percent in 2016.  Crucially, the bank will sell 28.6 billion euros of gross bad loans, of which 26.1 billion will be securitized through a transfer to a privately funded vehicle on market terms, with the operation partially funded by bank rescue fund Atlante II. The bank said it would sell securitized notes to Atlante II at 21 cents on the euro. We are in line if not slightly above recent market transactions, Morelli said. The CEO, who expects the bank's shares to relist in the second half of September, said 5.5 billion euros in deposits were recovered in the first quarter, adding liquidity was no longer an issue. The bank managed to stay alive, he said, referring to the close shadowing of the lender by European authorities. We negotiated the plan with the EU Commission line by line.  Rome is under the spotlight for taking advantage of exceptions in EU rules designed to stop the use of taxpayer money to deal with bank crises. Policymakers now want Italy to come up with a solution for tackling NPLs without requiring any more government money to prop up its beleaguered banking sector. European Central Bank vice president Vitor Constancio said on Wednesday there needed to be swift action to establish a stronger secondary market in Europe for non-performing loans and policy changes to incentivise banks, investors and the authorities to tackle the issue more effectively. Partial solutions and further delays are not options if we want to tackle the problem of NPLs he wrote in Italy's main business newspaper Il Sole 24 Ore.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-wolseley-restructuring-idUSKCN11X1H7","Wolseley to cut up to 800 jobs in tough British market","","September 27, 2016 /  1:15 PM / 10 months ago","","(Reuters) - Heating and plumbing products supplier Wolseley (WOS.L) plans to close just over 10 percent of its UK branches in response to  tough competition and weak trading, it said on Tuesday, a move that could lead to up to 800 job losses and create a more U.S.-focused firm. Wolseley, which makes about 80 percent of its profit in the United States, said the 80 branch closures would take two or three years, resulting in restructuring charges of about 100 million pounds ($130 million). They are expected to deliver annualized cost savings of 25-30 million pounds. Its shares traded some 4 percent lower at 4,127 pence by 1220 GMT after it posted slightly lower-than-expected profit for the year ended July and did not return excess cash to shareholders for the first time in four years after spending more on acquisitions. Failure to return excess cash ... [is] likely the real culprit for investor displeasure, Accendo Markets' head of research Mike van Dulken said. It only makes matters worse for shareholders struggling in an environment of low returns. Wolseley, which started life in 1887 manufacturing machine tools and early motor cars before moving into distribution in 1979, has faced tough competition and a weak market for its core repair, maintenance and property improvement services in the UK and Europe. Analysts said oversupply in plumbing and heating had been an industry-wide problem, forcing peers Travis Perkins (TPK.L) and Grafton GRF_u.L to restructure as well. The difficulty with all these companies is that boilers now last a lot longer, said Liberum analyst Charlie Campbell.  Wolseley said it was also considering closing a distribution center in Worcester and had started a strategy review in the Nordic region to restore profitable growth. Analysts said the closure of its smaller branches could see Wolseley lose some clients to rivals, including distribution brands owned by Saint Gobain (SGOB.PA). Chief Executive John Martin told Reuters that Wolseley had no plans to shift its UK listing to the United States, where it owns U.S. wholesale plumbing supplies distributor Ferguson, adding that it had traded ADRs on the U.S. market. Half its shareholders are UK investors. Like-for-like revenue has risen 4.5 percent in its U.S. business since the beginning of its new financial year in August, outpacing growth of 1.5 percent across the group as end markets remained mixed given an uncertain economic outlook. It added it did not think the UK's weak summer performance was a result of the vote to leave the European Union. Whilst our sales have been weak in the UK over the last quarter, we haven't been able to directly attribute that to Brexit, Martin told journalists. Wolseley posted a 7 percent rise in full-year trading profit to 917 million pounds, a touch below analysts' estimate of 921 million pounds.

A potential deal for Tribune, first reported by Reuters, could come as soon as Monday, just weeks after the U.S. Federal Communications Commission voted to reverse a 2016 decision that limits the number of television stations some broadcasters can buy.      FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, named by President Donald Trump in January, is planning to take a new look at the current overall limit on companies owning stations serving no more than 39 percent of U.S. television households. Still, a combined Tribune and Sinclair could surpass this cap and face some regulatory challenges which could result in divestitures, analysts said.  The combination of Sinclair and Tribune would be a competitive blow to Fox because the added scale would give Sinclair more leverage in negotiations to carry Twenty-First Century Fox Inc's (FOXA.O)  local networks. Together the companies would own a large chunk of Fox broadcast affiliates around the country. Fox Networks Group Chairman Peter Rice said at the Milken Institute Global Conference last week that Fox was looking to buy Tribune Media because having more scale and more control of distribution is important. Twenty-First Century Fox was in talks with Blackstone Group LP (BX.N) last week about submitting an offer to buy Tribune Media, sources said at the time. Nexstar Media Group Inc also considered an acquisition of Tribune Media, sources have previously said. Fox never submitted a bid, according to a source familiar with the matter. Representatives for Fox and Blackstone both declined to comment.  Sinclair's offer values Tribune Media at around $44 per share, the sources said on Sunday. That would represent a premium of close to 30 percent of the price of Tribune Media shares on Feb. 28, the day before Reuters broke the news that Sinclair had approached Tribune Media to discuss an acquisition. Tribune Media shares ended trading on Friday at $40.29, giving it a market capitalization of $3.5 billion.   Negotiations between Sinclair and Tribune Media have not yet been finalized, and there is still a possibility the deal will not be reached, the sources cautioned. The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Tribune Media declined to comment. Sinclair did not respond for comment. Tribune Media has 42 owned or operated broadcast stations, as well as cable network WGN America, Tribune Studios and WGN-Radio. Sinclair, which has a market capitalization of $3.36 billion, owns, operates or provides services to 173 television stations in 81 markets. Sinclair branched out into cable networks last year when it bought the Tennis Channel for $350 million. Tribune Media said last year it was working with financial advisers Moelis & Co and Guggenheim Securities on a strategic review. It subsequently sold its media data unit Gracenote to Nielsen Holdings Plc for $560 million.     Activist investor Starboard Value LP, led by Jeffrey Smith,  cut its stake in March to 4.4 percent from 6.6 percent.  Tribune CEO Peter Liguori, who joined Tribune in 2013, stepped down in March and a permanent replacement has not yet been named.  Reporting by Liana B.

Sales practices at Wells Fargo have been under a spotlight since September when federal regulators ordered the San Francisco-based bank to pay $190 million in fines and restitution because they said its high pressure sales environment pushed employees to open as many as 2 million deposit and credit card accounts without customers' permission. Prudential has a partnership with Wells Fargo to sell a low-cost life insurance policy, known as MyTerm, to the bank's retail customers. Since bankers are not licensed to sell insurance, Wells Fargo employees were meant to direct customers to either self-service kiosks in branches or online to buy the insurance, without getting into specifics about the products. According to a wrongful termination suit filed in New Jersey state court this week by three former managers in Prudential's corporate investigation division, Wells Fargo employees appear to have signed up bank customers for the Prudential policies without the customers' knowledge or permission. In some cases, policies were opened and closed after a month or two and then reopened, and sometimes monthly fees were withdrawn from the accounts, according to evidence in the lawsuit. Scot Hoffman, a spokesman for Prudential Financial, said the insurer had been monitoring its business with Wells Fargo since last year. A customer survey had shown high lapse rates. The insurer expanded the review of how the product was sold after Wells Fargo was fined in September. We anticipate reviewing this matter with our regulators in due course, Hoffman said in a statement. The three managers say they were fired in November for trying to escalate their discoveries internally within Prudential. Hoffman said they were fired for, appropriate and legitimate reasons that were entirely unrelated to Prudential's business with Wells Fargo and Prudential's decision to examine sales of the MyTerm product. No one from Wells Fargo was immediately available to comment. The lawsuit and the Prudential investigation were first reported by The New York Times.

The group's customers include local authorities, big building firms, traders such as plumbers and kitchen fitters and regular consumers, with its fortunes closely tied to housing transactions and consumer confidence. The sharp decline in the value of sterling since June 2016 has created cost pressures on imported goods and materials, and the expectations for secondary housing market transactions and growth in the repair, maintenance and improvement market have weakened, Chief Executive John Carter said on Thursday. The group, which has over 20 businesses including Travis Perkins, Wickes, BSS, Toolstation and Tile Giant, mostly blamed its poorly performing plumbing and heating business for a raft of exceptional charges that pulled down profits. Its shares fell 121 pence to 1,444 pence by 1042 GMT, valuing the firm at 3.64 billion pounds ($4.5 billion) and taking losses for the year to 20 percent. Carter said pressure on discretionary spending from rising inflation could dent secondary housing transactions in the second half of 2017. Any significant reduction in consumer confidence may have a more pronounced impact on big-ticket purchases such as kitchens and bathrooms which make up around 10 percent of the group's sales, he said. Travis Perkins booked an exceptional non-cash impairment charge of 235 million pounds ($289 million) against goodwill and intangible and tangible assets. An exceptional charge of 57 million pounds was also taken to cover the cost of closing underperforming branches and a restructuring of its supply chain and central operations. Those changes were announced in October when Travis Perkins also warned of the hit to profits and kicked off a review of the plumbing and heating business. The charges meant the group's pretax profit fell to 73 million pounds in the year to Dec. 31 2016. Further work is required and over the next six months we will be exploring all routes to enhance returns, Carter said of the plumbing and heating division which contributes about 10 percent of group profit. Adjusted operating profit was 409 million pounds, broadly in line with analysts' expectations but down from 413 million pounds in 2015. Revenue increased 4.6 percent to 6.22 billion pounds. While current consensus expectations are not too stretched for 2017 with flattish profits expected, we would not be surprised to see 2017 consensus move lower, probably down by 4-6 percent, said analysts at Canaccord Genuity, which has a buy rating on the stock. $1 = 0.8145 pounds

Our country needs a good 'shutdown' in September to fix mess! he wrote. Trump also backed the so-called nuclear option for legislation but added that the party could strengthen its hand by winning more Senate seats in the 2018 congressional election. Democrats - and some Republicans - quickly denounced his call to close the federal government in a spending fight just as both parties were closing in on a final measure to fund agencies through September. Here we saw Democrats and Republicans working together in the best traditions of the Senate, and the president disparages it in a way that’s destructive, Democratic Senate Leader Chuck Schumer said. Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, told reporters: I just don’t agree. Trump said his fellow Republicans had to acquiesce to Democratic demands in a government spending bill negotiated this week because the party's majority was too slim to win the 60 Senate votes that would have been needed if Democrats had chosen to block the legislation with a filibuster. Republicans hold 52 seats in the 100-seat U.S. Senate. The reason for the plan negotiated between the Republicans and Democrats is that we need 60 votes in the Senate which are not there! We either elect more Republican Senators in 2018 or change the rules now to 51%, Trump wrote on Twitter Both parties signed off on the spending bill to fund the federal government through September to avert a government shutdown, with Republicans and Democrats both claiming some political victories. Despite Trump's tweets suggesting he would be willing to let U.S. government funding lapse later this year in an effort to pressure Democrats to agree to more of his budget priorities, top Republicans have touted this week's budget deal. After years of partisan bickering and gridlock, this bill is a clear win for the American people, Trump himself said later on Tuesday at a White House event. Republicans last forced a government closure in 2013 for 17 days. Democrats said Trump would shoulder the blame for any shutdown now. Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy called Trump's threat a sour and shameful note to kick off negotiations for next year's spending plan, pointing to billions of dollars of losses triggered by the shutdown four years ago. In the House, also led by Republicans, Speaker Paul Ryan took a more muted response. We've got a long ways to go between now and September, he told reporters. Some conservatives applauded Trump's call for ending the supermajority needed in the Senate to pass major legislation. Representative Trent Franks, pointing to the compromise spending bill moving to the House and Senate floors this week, said Democrats have a choke hold on bills despite being in the minority. Senate leaders have already allowed the nuclear option to ease through judicial and executive-branch nominees with a simple majority of 51 votes. In 2013, Democrat Harry Reid deployed it for lower-level nominees but left it in place for Supreme Court nominees. Last month, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell expanded that move to secure approval of Trump's Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch. But Cornyn, speaking to reporters, said using it to muscle through legislation without a consensus could lead to really bad policy on a number of issues: It’s a real mistake.

Wolseley has looked to grow in the U.S., which accounts for about two-thirds of its revenue, as it faces tough competition and a weak market for its core repair, maintenance and property improvement services in the UK and Europe. The company earlier this year set out plans to close just over 10 percent of its UK branches, as it seeks to respond to an oversupply in the plumbing and heating market that has also forced rivals Travis Perkins (TPK.L) and Grafton GRF_u.L to restructure. Wolseley would see strong growth for the year, its chief executive said on Tuesday, citing expectations of further growth in the U.S. residential and commercial markets as well as improvements in the industrial and commodities pricing markets. I think overall in the U.S. we're positive, John Martin told Reuters. However, as Wolseley focuses on growing its business and acquisitions, Martin said surplus cash payouts should not be expected imminently. Its last fiscal was the first time in four years that Wolseley failed to return excess cash to shareholders. Wolseley reported a 21.2 percent rise in trading profit to 303 million pounds ($386 million) and a 22.9 percent increase in revenue to 4.369 billion pounds for the quarter ended Oct. 31. Like-for-like revenue grew 1.8 percent year-on-year, underpinned by a 4.2 percent growth in the U.S from a 3.1 percent increase seen in the preceding quarter. U.S. growth was slightly below the 4.5 percent level noted for the opening weeks of the year, raising some concerns among analysts as the UK and Nordics posted revenue declines of 2.9 percent each, versus falls of 2.1 percent and 2.3 percent respectively for the preceding quarter. Martin said the UK business would remain tough for the year, citing a need to replace heating volumes lost due to an ongoing pullback in the social housing market. He said the weakness could not be linked to uncertainty caused by Britain's vote to leave the European Union, a condition that forced Travis Perkins to warn on profit in October. We leave our forecasts virtually unchanged with the key question for the rest of the year being whether the U.S. volume growth can be sustained, Barclays analysts wrote in a note.

It is the latest in a wave of consolidation in an industry which has been grappling with intense competition and weak trading volumes as a result of small investors being drawn towards cheaper investment products that track major indexes. E*Trade Financial Corp, another discount broker, said in July that it would buy online brokerage OptionsHouse for $725 million, while Ally Financial Inc purchased TradeKing Group for about $275 million a month earlier. In a connected deal, Toronto-Dominion Bank, TD Ameritrade's biggest shareholder, said on Monday it had agreed to buy Scottrade's banking business for $1.3 billion as it continues to ramp up its expansion in the United States. TD Ameritrade's acquisition of Scottrade combines two of the United States' big five brokerages, the others being Charles Schwab, Fidelity Investments and E-Trade, and would leave only four major brokers operating in the marketplace. I think that the authorities in the United States are unlikely to let this pass without a pretty close look, said John Briggs, an antitrust attorney with the law firm Axinn, Veltrop & Harkrider. I think the transaction deserves scrutiny and will get scrutiny. TD Ameritrade's CEO Tim Hockey said he believed regulators would look at the deal fairly. I still think this is a considerably competitive marketplace, that's for sure. There are lots of opportunities for additional competitors to get into our space and continue to drive price competition, he said. The deal will produce a combined business with around 10 million client accounts and $1 trillion in assets, which will execute around 600,000 trades per day. The purchase prices comprises $1.7 billion in cash and $1 billion in new shares. It will net a windfall for Scottrade's co-founder and Chief Executive Rodger Riney, who set the company up in 1980. Riney, who said last year he was being treated for cancer, will join the TD Ameritrade board and also become TD Ameritrade's fourth biggest shareholder. The environment has become more challenging than ever and we've faced some of our own internal pressures. As the years have gone by, it has become apparent that scale is more important than ever, Riney said on Monday. In addition to investors switching from buying individual stocks to holding cheaper index-tracking funds, discount brokerages have also been facing price competition from full-service brokerages and automated investment advisers, known as robo advisers. However, new regulations on giving retirement advice in the United States are expected to benefit discount brokerages because investors may switch to them from the full-service brokerages to avoid fees. Hockey said TD Ameritrade will look at further deals which make strategic and financial sense in addition to Scottrade. TD Ameritrade, 42-percent owned by Toronto Dominion Bank, said it expected annual cost savings of $450 million as a result of the deal, with another $300 million of potential savings identified in the longer term. As part of those plans, Hockey said around 25 percent of the combined business's 600 branches will be closed. TD Ameritrade currently has 100 branches while Scottrade has 500. Hockey said in the interview the combined workforce of 10,000 will be reduced by about 20 percent.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-malaysia-scandal-falcon-idUSKCN12B03Y","Singapore shuts Falcon bank unit, fines DBS and UBS over 1MDB","","October 11, 2016 /  1:17 AM / 10 months ago","","SINGAPORE/ZURICH (Reuters) - Singapore's central bank on Tuesday shut down a second Swiss bank in the city-state and fined banks DBS and UBS in its biggest crackdown on alleged money-laundering activities connected with Malaysia's scandal-tainted 1MDB fund.  The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said in a statement it had ordered Zurich-based Falcon Private Bank's Singapore branch to cease operating because of a persistent and severe lack of understanding of Singapore's money-laundering controls. It also accused Falcon's senior management in Switzerland and Singapore of improper conduct. Falcon was fined S$4.3 million ($3.12 million) for 14 breaches of the money laundering prevention law, including not filing suspicious transaction reports and failure to inform authorities of irregular activities in their customers' accounts. Falcon is the second bank to lose its license in connection with Singapore's probe into 1MDB, in which authorities have frozen millions of dollars in bank accounts, fined banks and charged several private bankers. In May, Swiss-based BSI Bank's Singapore branch was ordered to be closed for failing to control money-laundering activities connected with 1MDB. That was the first time in 32 years Singapore had shut down a bank.  DBS was fined S$1 million ($728,067) and UBS S$1.3 million on Tuesday for breaches in Singapore's anti-money laundering law. The two banks said in separate statements they would take action against staff responsible for the lapses. Standard Chartered Assessed In Zurich, the Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA), ordered Falcon to turn over 2.5 million Swiss francs ($2.56 million) in what the watchdog said were illegal profits.  A FINMA spokesman said the watchdog still has an ongoing investigation into UBS, Switzerland's biggest bank, in connection with 1MDB. FINMA also said it has opened enforcement proceedings against two former Falcon executives, without citing them by name. Singapore authorities arrested the Singapore branch manager of Falcon Private Bank, Jens Sturzenegger, on Oct 6, MAS said.  The MAS said it is also finalizing its assessment of the Singapore branch of Standard Chartered Bank and would make an announcement in due course.  Related CoverageAabar Investments says fully behind Falcon Private Bank after 1MDB sanctionsFalcon Private Bank not being sold at moment: CEOStandard Chartered said it would be inappropriate to comment while the assessment is taking place. Falcon described the MAS decision as regrettable and disappointing, but said it would now focus on growing in core locations in Switzerland, Middle East and London.      The bank expects to close the branch, which as around 35 employees, in the next few months, a Falcon spokesman said.       Six Countries Probing 1mdb Malaysia's 1MDB, once a pet project of Prime Minister Najib Razak who chaired its advisory board, is the subject of money-laundering investigations in at least six countries, including Switzerland, Singapore and the United States.  The logo of Switzerland's Falcon Private Bank, owned by Abu Dhabi's International Petroleum Investment Co (IPIC), is seen at its headquarters in Zurich, Switzerland October 5, 2016.Arnd Wiegmann/File PhotoThe U.S. Department of Justice filed lawsuits in July  seeking to seize dozens of properties tied to 1MDB, saying that over $3.5 billion was misappropriated from the fund. The lawsuits do not name Najib but say around $700 million of misappropriated funds flowed into the accounts of Malaysian Official 1, who U.S. and Malaysian officials have identified as Najib. The Wall Street Journal reported last year that investigators had traced nearly $700 million that was sent in from an account at Falcon in Singapore in 2013 to accounts in Malaysia they believed belonged to the Malaysian prime minister. Both Najib and 1MDB have denied any wrongdoing.  In January, Malaysia's Attorney General Mohamed Apandi Ali said Saudi Arabia's royal family gave Najib a $681 million gift, of which Apandi said about $600 million was later returned. Global Financial Centers The logo of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) is pictured at its building in Singapore in this February 21, 2013 file photo.Edgar Su/FilesFINMA said its review of Falcon had identified around $3.8 billion associated with the 1MDB Group that was transferred to accounts at Falcon between 2012 and mid-2015. The business relationships and transactions booked in Switzerland and at Falcon's Singapore and Hong Kong branches were unusual and involved a high level of risk for the bank both through their nature and the amounts transacted, it said.  It said Falcon had a number of business relationships with 1MDB group companies and executed transactions amounting to around $2.5 billion via accounts of two offshore companies.  Falcon also had a client relationship with a young Malaysian businessman with links to individuals in Malaysian government circles, it said without naming him. The bank did not verify how this individual had been able to acquire assets of $135 million in an extremely short period of time or why a total of $1.2 billion was transferred to his accounts at a later date - a transaction which was clearly at variance with the information he had provided when opening the account, it said. Internal warnings from bank staff were ignored, it found. FINMA banned Falcon from entering new business relationships with foreign politically exposed persons for three years and said Falcon would lose its license if there is any repetition of the offence. Falcon had $900 million in assets in Singapore, the bank's Chief Executive Walter Berchtold told a media briefing. The 1MDB case has not prevented the bank from attracting news assets, he added.  Falcon's owner, a subsidiary of Abu Dhabi's sovereign fund International Petroleum Investment Company, said it views Falcon as a strategic investment and has no current intention to sell it.  'Clean and Trusted' Ravi Menon, managing director of Singapore's central bank said in the MAS statement the board and senior management of financial institutions play a pivotal role in keeping Singapore  a clean and trusted financial center. They must put in place robust mechanisms to detect suspicious activities, promote strong risk awareness among their staff, and empower their compliance and risk management people, said Menon. Most of all, they must set the tone from the top – that profits do not come before right conduct. The crackdown also sends a message that banks have to adopt a compliance culture and the need for compliance staff to be able to take decisions independent of management, said Nizam Ismail, partner at RHTLaw Taylor Wessing LLP, where he advises clients on financial services regulation.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-taiwan-financialregulator-idUSKCN1230HZ","Mega Financial scandal claims first Taiwan administration victim as top regulator quits","","October 3, 2016 /  7:02 AM / 10 months ago","","TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan's top financial regulator resigned on Monday as a scandal over state-run institution Mega Financial's (2886.TW) New York bank branch breaching anti-money laundering regulations claimed its first victim among officials on the island. Ding Kung-Wha, the chairman of the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC), stepped down amid mounting criticism over the watchdog's effectiveness. The Mega Financial branch was fined $180 million by U.S. authorities for violations of rules including lax attention to risk exposure in Panama. In a statement released by the FSC, Ding, 62, said he hoped his resignation would reduce damage to the FSC over the Mega Financial scandal. President Tsai Ing-wen has said the case had damaged Taiwan's reputation and created public mistrust about supervision of the financial sector. But Tsai's opponents on the island said the official's departure was a symbolic political gesture that put disproportionate blame on Ding, who only assumed his position with the FSC in May of this year. A veteran of Taiwan's administration not widely known in international finance circles, Ding previously served as chief of the Taipei Exchange and as a finance ministry official.     Ding submitted his written resignation this morning, cabinet spokesman Hsu Kuo-yung said at a news conference. Hsu said Ding's view was that he had done as much as he could in his role as chairman to assist the investigation and efforts to improve the FSC. Ding's successor has yet to be selected, Hsu said. One potential candidate to replace him, according to political sources in Taipei, is Shih Jun-ji, current chairman of the Taiwan Stock Exchange. Shih has previously served a brief stint as the FSC's chief. An emergency task force set up by President Tsai is now supervising a probe into the violations of U.S. regulations. But opposition politicians said Ding was carrying responsibility just a few months after taking office for transactions that did not originate in Taiwan itself.  Ding and some legislators held a closed-door meeting last week on details of 174 suspicious transactions belonging to 76 accounts processed in Mega's New York branch. None of the transactions were from Taiwan, according to Lai Shyh-bao, a prominent member of opposition party Kuomintang (KMT), and other people with direct knowledge of the matter. He (Ding) did not have to take responsibility, said Lai. Some supporters of President Tsai thought he is too bureaucratic. He has financial expertise, but is not skilled in politics. In addition to the Mega Financial scandal, the FSC has faced criticism over its handling of a case involving XPEC Entertainment, a Taiwanese gaming software developer.    Investors in XPEC have suffered heavy losses after a tender offer for of a stake in the company by a Japanese suitor went sour, domestic media have reported, with some complaining the FSC should have taken regulatory action over the way the offer was managed.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/tribune-media-ma-sinclair-idUSL1N1I90BU","Sinclair Broadcast nears deal for Tribune Media","","May 7, 2017 /  5:02 PM / 3 months ago","","(Reuters) - Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc (SBGI.O) is nearing a deal to acquire Tribune Media Co (TRCO.N) for close to $4 billion after prevailing in an auction for one of the largest U.S. television station operators, according to people familiar with the matter. A potential deal for Tribune, first reported by Reuters, could come as soon as Monday, just weeks after the U.S. Federal Communications Commission voted to reverse a 2016 decision that limits the number of television stations some broadcasters can buy.      FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, named by President Donald Trump in January, is planning to take a new look at the current overall limit on companies owning stations serving no more than 39 percent of U.S. television households. Still, a combined Tribune and Sinclair could surpass this cap and face some regulatory challenges which could result in divestitures, analysts said.  The combination of Sinclair and Tribune would be a competitive blow to Fox because the added scale would give Sinclair more leverage in negotiations to carry Twenty-First Century Fox Inc's (FOXA.O)  local networks. Together the companies would own a large chunk of Fox broadcast affiliates around the country. Fox Networks Group Chairman Peter Rice said at the Milken Institute Global Conference last week that Fox was looking to buy Tribune Media because having more scale and more control of distribution is important. Twenty-First Century Fox was in talks with Blackstone Group LP (BX.N) last week about submitting an offer to buy Tribune Media, sources said at the time. Nexstar Media Group Inc also considered an acquisition of Tribune Media, sources have previously said. Fox never submitted a bid, according to a source familiar with the matter. Representatives for Fox and Blackstone both declined to comment.  Sinclair's offer values Tribune Media at around $44 per share, the sources said on Sunday. That would represent a premium of close to 30 percent of the price of Tribune Media shares on Feb. 28, the day before Reuters broke the news that Sinclair had approached Tribune Media to discuss an acquisition. Tribune Media shares ended trading on Friday at $40.29, giving it a market capitalization of $3.5 billion.   Negotiations between Sinclair and Tribune Media have not yet been finalized, and there is still a possibility the deal will not be reached, the sources cautioned. The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Tribune Media declined to comment. Sinclair did not respond for comment. Tribune Media has 42 owned or operated broadcast stations, as well as cable network WGN America, Tribune Studios and WGN-Radio. Sinclair, which has a market capitalization of $3.36 billion, owns, operates or provides services to 173 television stations in 81 markets. Sinclair branched out into cable networks last year when it bought the Tennis Channel for $350 million. Tribune Media said last year it was working with financial advisers Moelis & Co and Guggenheim Securities on a strategic review. It subsequently sold its media data unit Gracenote to Nielsen Holdings Plc for $560 million.     Activist investor Starboard Value LP, led by Jeffrey Smith,  cut its stake in March to 4.4 percent from 6.6 percent.  Tribune CEO Peter Liguori, who joined Tribune in 2013, stepped down in March and a permanent replacement has not yet been named.  Reporting by Liana B.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eurozone-banks-monte-dei-paschi-eu-idUSKBN18S4D0","EU, Rome seal preliminary rescue deal for Monte dei Paschi","","June 1, 2017 /  9:09 AM / 2 months ago","","BRUSSELS/MILAN (Reuters) - The European Commission and Italy have reached a preliminary agreement on a state bailout for Monte dei Paschi di Siena (BMPS.MI) that includes heavy cost cuts, losses for some investors and a cap on pay for the bank's top executives.  The deal brings close to an end months of negotiations over the fate of the world's oldest bank and Italy's fourth biggest lender, the worst performer in European stress tests last year. The Commission said it had agreed in principle on a restructuring plan for the bank so that it can be bailed out by the state under new European rules for dealing with bank crises. It would allow Italy to inject capital into MPS as a precaution, in line with EU rules, whilst limiting the burden on Italian taxpayers, Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in a statement. The bank would undergo deep restructuring to ensure its viability, including by cleaning its balance sheet of non-performing loans, she said. Burdened by a bad loan pile and a mismanagement scandal, Monte dei Paschi has been for years at the forefront of Italy's slow-brewing banking crisis. It was forced to request state aid in December to help cover a capital shortfall of 8.8 billion euros ($9.9 billion) after it failed to raise money on the market.  The accord with the European Commission exploits an exception in current EU rules allowing member states to bolster the capital buffers of a bank provided it is solvent and that shareholders and junior bondholders shoulder some of the losses. The government could end up injecting some 6.6 billion euros into the bank, taking a stake of around 70 percent. A logo of Monte dei Paschi di Siena bank is seen on the ground in Siena, Italy, November 5, 2014.Giampiero Sposito/File PhotoThe agreement with Brussels is conditional on the European Central Bank confirming the lender meets capital requirements and on the sale of some 26 billion euros in soured debts to private investors.  Monte dei Paschi said on Monday it was in exclusive talks until June 28 with a domestic fund and a group of investors to shift the debts off its balance sheet and sell them repackaged as securities. Sources close to the matter said the price at which Monte dei Paschi sells those bad debts would be key for the bailout, as a low price would require the bank to book further loan losses which could not be covered by the state. Details of Monte dei Paschi's restructuring plan have not been made public, but it is expected to include thousands of job cuts and the closure of hundreds of branches as the bank must ensure it is profitable in the long term. MPS will take a number of measures to substantially increase its efficiency, the Commission's statement said. The EU deal also imposes a cap on senior management pay equivalent to 10 times the average salary of Monte dei Paschi's staff. As a result, the annual salary of Chief Executive Marco Morelli should be cut to around 500,000 euros from more than 1.8 million euros, according to a source. The Commission said retail investors who were mis-sold the bank's junior bonds would be eligible for compensation. Italy faces a much bigger hurdle in winning European approval for a state bailout of two other banks, Banca Popolare di Vicenza and Veneto Banca. Sources have said the EU Commission has demanded an additional injection of 1.2 billion euros by private investors before taxpayer money can be used, but Rome is struggling to find any investor willing to stump up the money.

If it goes through, the cash takeover will increase South Africa's grip over global platinum and palladium supply and underline chief executive Neal Froneman's determination to branch out of gold mining and South Africa.  However, the price Sibanye is offering to increase its own share of supplies of the precious metals is larger than its market value and the move triggered a sharp fall in its stock. Sibanye said it would buy Stillwater, which operates in Montana and is the largest primary producer of platinum group metals (PMGs) outside South Africa and Russia, with a loan that it will re-finance with debt plus a rights issue of at least $750 million. Froneman wants to cut the bullion miner's dependence on gold and platinum in South Africa, where a volatile currency, labor strikes and strict government rules have weighed on Sibanye's share price. The deal, the second-biggest South African outbound M&A; transaction so far this year, will make Sibanye the world's third largest palladium producer and fourth largest platinum group metals miner, Froneman said. Some analysts highlighted the risks as the platinum market sinks into oversupply. But while demand from the diesel car sector for platinum, which is used in catalytic converters, is under pressure because of air pollution concerns, palladium used in hybrid petrol cars could see higher consumption and the market is in deficit. Palladium reached its most expensive versus platinum since early 2002 last month as the U.S. election result sparked a surge in cyclical assets. It's a tier one asset in palladium in the United States, a source close to the deal said. Normally in the U.S., there would be a 30-40 percent premium. This is around 20 percent.    Sibanye said it would pay $18.00 per share in cash for Stillwater, a 23 percent premium over Thursday's closing price, which it was initially financing through a $2.675 billion loan arranged by HSBC and Citigroup. These are some of the lowest cost ounces in the world, said Froneman, referring to Stillwater's operations.  Shares Under Pressure             Sibanye's shares dropped 18 percent to an 11-month low, but recovered slightly to close 15.3 percent weaker at 24.01 rand, their biggest daily percentage drop on record.   By 1512 GMT, shares in Stillwater had surged 18.5 percent to $17.41, a touch below the offer price.  Froneman said Sibanye's share price was too low, even though it paid industry-leading dividends and this was partly because it was not as geographically diverse as some competitors. Sibanye did not detail any regulatory hurdles, saying only the deal - which is backed by Stillwater's board - was conditional on the required authorizations. It said it needed deal approval from its own and Stillwater's shareholders, although it already has the support of 29 percent of its own investors. Sibanye was spun off from Gold Fields in 2013. It bought Aquarius Platinum and Anglo American Platinum's Rustenburg mines last year.

Lawmakers from both major political parties have raised concerns about Tillerson, president and chief executive of Exxon Mobil Corp who has close ties with Russia and has met Russian President Vladimir Putin several times, and about Bolton, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations who has voiced hawkish views on Iraq and Iran. Tillerson emerged over the weekend as Trump's expected pick for secretary of state. Bolton has been mentioned as a possible No. 2 State Department official. Trump is due to succeed President Barack Obama on Jan. 20. Washington and Moscow are at odds over a range of issues that include Syria, Ukraine and NATO's presence in eastern Europe. In television interviews on Monday, Trump's senior adviser Kellyanne Conway said Tillerson is a leading candidate for the top diplomat job and a decision may come this week. During a Monday news conference, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, said he was optimistic Trump's nominees would be confirmed by the Senate, but he declined to comment on any future nominees such as Tillerson. McConnell called all of Trump's choices so far pretty impressive. 'Thorough Hearing' Senator Charles Schumer, the incoming Democratic leader, told CBS This Morning that The bottom line is, every one of these nominees, particularly a guy like Tillerson, needs a thorough, thorough hearing. He'll be questioned thoroughly, should he be the nominee, and all of these allegations and talks about his closeness with Putin will come forward, Schumer said. During Trump's campaign for the Nov. 8 election, Democrats and longtime government officials voiced alarm when Trump repeatedly praised Putin, suggesting they would get along very well. On Sunday, Senator John McCain, a Republican who lost the 2008 presidential race to Obama, said of Tillerson: It's a matter of concern to me that he has such a close personal relationship with Vladimir Putin and obviously they've done enormous deals together. That would color his approach to Vladimir Putin and the Russian threat. McCain, now chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, added that Tillerson would get a fair confirmation hearing. Concerns About Bolton Bolton also has raised bipartisan concern. On Sunday, Republican Senator Rand Paul said he would work to stop Bolton from being confirmed to any Trump administration post. His world view is naive, Paul said on ABC's This Week. He still believes in regime change. He's still a big cheerleader for the Iraq war. He's promoted a nuclear attack by Israel on Iran. He wants to do regime change in Iran. In 2005, then-President George W. Bush installed Bolton as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations in a temporary, recess appointment that sidestepped U.S. Senate confirmation. He took that step after Democrats used procedural rules in place at the time to block the nomination. Bolton left the job at the end of 2006 when the temporary appointment was ending. Since then, Senate rules have changed, making it harder for a minority of senators to stop judicial and executive branch nominations. Republicans will hold a 52-48 majority in the Senate session that begins on Jan. 3. Reporting by Doina Chiacu; Writing by Richard Cowan; Editing

The cuts are across EFG and BSI, with around two thirds expected to take place in Switzerland. The merged bank has around 3,800 employees.  Zurich-based EFG, whose largest shareholder is Greece's Latsis family, also raised its targeted cost savings from the takeover by 55 million francs to around 240 million by 2019.  EFG will close BSI's Panama branch late next year and has agreed a partial sale of BSI Bahamas client portfolios. It also plans to sell its Independent Financial Advisers business in Britain.  Overall, EFG now expects the BSI integration to cost around 250 million francs between 2016 and 2018, up from 200 million previously forecast.   The bank manages 148 billion francs in assets, although EFG forecasts outflows of around 10 billion francs over the next three years resulting from the BSI deal.  The acquisition was complicated by BSI's legal troubles which included its dealings with scandal-hit Malaysian government fund 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB).

Sumitomo agreed to pay 2.23 euros per Fyffes share, 49 percent above Thursday's closing price, which analysts said reflected the relatively weak valuation of the Irish company in recent months and Sumitomo's desire to avoid being beaten in a bidding war. The transaction comes two years after Dublin-based Fyffes tried and failed to buy U.S. rival Chiquita in order to create the world's largest banana company. Brazil's Cutrale and Safra groups scuppered the deal by offering 20 percent more. Sumitomo said it had secured acceptances from 27 percent of shareholders, including Farringdon Capital Management and the Balkan Investment Company owned by Ireland's McCann Family, which established Fruit Importers of Ireland which merged with Fyffes in the 1980s. Fyffe's shares were trading at 2.229 euros at 1540 GMT. The offer is more than double its share price when it attempted to buy Chiquita in 2014. The Japanese firm said it hoped to close the deal before the end of March subject to regulatory approval. Unlike U.S. rivals such as Chiquita, Fresh Del Monte Produce Inc and Dole Food, Sumitomo has very little geographical overlap with Fyffes. Investec said the deal at 11.1 times Fyffes' forecast 2017 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation compared favourably to the 10.4 times paid by Cutrale for Chiquita. It has been trading at a discount to its true value for quite some time, said Investec analyst Ian Huggard, citing its low liquidity and small size. But this is a good price Sumitomo has paid. Maybe that is to forestall any thoughts of anyone else coming in with a counterbid, he added. The deal also represents the latest example of Japanese companies moving away from their home market, which is struggling with an ageing population and slow economic growth. Japanese Businesses Branch Out Sumitomo, which controls 30 percent of the Japanese import market and has banana plantations in the Philippines and a retail distribution network across Asia, said the deal would give it greater scale and diversity and help it to expand its produce division. Sumitomo is paying an attractive price for a business in which they see good long term growth potential and significant revenue synergies within the enlarged group, said Goodbody analyst Patrick Higgins. While Asia is the fastest-growing region for sales of bananas, the world's most popular fruit, demand in Europe is growing for organic and fair trade bananas. Other Japanese companies are looking for growth beyond their home market. Brewer Asahi is currently bidding for its second European acquisition this year, while Ajinomoto  recently agreed to take a stake in African drinks form Promasidor. A source close to the situation predicted that this trend would continue, as Japanese entities take advantage of a strong currency to put capital to work overseas. Fyffes was founded in London by food wholesaler Thomas Fyffe in the 1880s. It moved to Ireland a century later after merging with Fruit Importers of Ireland. Aside from being Europe's largest banana importer, it is a leading seller of pineapples, melons and mushrooms. J.P. Morgan advised Sumitomo in the deal, while Lazard and Irish stockbroker Davy advised Fyffes. Additional reporting by Martinne Geller and Dasha Afanasieva

Sales practices at Wells Fargo have been under a spotlight since September when federal regulators ordered the San Francisco-based bank to pay $190 million in fines and restitution because they said its high pressure sales environment pushed employees to open as many as 2 million deposit and credit card accounts without customers' permission. Prudential has a partnership with Wells Fargo to sell a low-cost life insurance policy, known as MyTerm, to the bank's retail customers. Since bankers are not licensed to sell insurance, Wells Fargo employees were meant to direct customers to either self-service kiosks in branches or online to buy the insurance, without getting into specifics about the products.  According to a wrongful termination suit filed in New Jersey state court this week by three former managers in Prudential's corporate investigation division, Wells Fargo employees appear to have signed up bank customers for the Prudential policies without the customers' knowledge or permission. In some cases, policies were opened and closed after a month or two and then reopened, and sometimes monthly fees were withdrawn from the accounts, according to evidence in the lawsuit. Scot Hoffman, a spokesman for Prudential Financial, said the insurer had been monitoring its business with Wells Fargo since last year. A customer survey had shown high lapse rates. The insurer expanded the review of how the product was sold after Wells Fargo was fined in September. We anticipate reviewing this matter with our regulators in due course,” Hoffman said in a statement. The three managers say they were fired in November for trying to escalate their discoveries internally within Prudential. Hoffman said they were fired for, appropriate and legitimate reasons that were entirely unrelated to Prudential’s business with Wells Fargo and Prudential’s decision to examine sales of the MyTerm product. A spokeswoman for Wells said the bank was investigating any alleged misconduct.  As we have consistently reinforced, if we identify any instances where a customer received a product they didn’t ask for, we will make it right, Mary Eshet, a spokeswoman for the bank said in a statement.

The analysis published last week found more than 90 percent of the branch closures were in areas where the median household income is below the British average of 27,600 pounds ($36,600). The research is very worrying and I hope the Treasury are aware of it, James Heappey, a Conservative member of parliament (MP), told the House of Commons in a debate on Thursday. It is important to make sure that (banks) are not focusing their branch network on the areas where they can make the most cash, when the nation collectively bailed them out not too long ago, he said. Britain's biggest banks, HSBC (HSBA.L), Barclays (BARC.L), Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L) and Lloyds Banking Group (LLOY.L), have been steadily shrinking their branch networks to cut costs while investing in online and mobile banking services. MPs in the debate said Britain should consider emulating the United States in requiring banks to maintain branches and lending in poorer areas.  The U.S. Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 is designed to reduce discriminatory lending by requiring banks to lend in communities where they are chartered. The U.S. law can block the opening of new branches elsewhere if a bank does not comply. The major banks have all said they close branches based on declining footfall, as consumers move to online banking, and that they study the impact of such closures carefully. RBS, Lloyds and Barclays declined to comment for this story. A spokesman for HSBC said the bank has launched a digital service that allows small businesses to apply for loans without visiting a branch. The HSBC building in Canary Wharf London January 12, 2016.Kevin CoombsChristian Matheson, a Labour member of parliament, said the  Reuters study, which covered the year to April, showed a crisis.  There can be no more cavalier closures of bank branches, which in turn damage the local economy, Matheson said.  In 2008 we apparently learnt that some big banks are too big to fail. Perhaps the message today is that some local banks are too important to local communities to close. A Barclays bank office is seen at Canary Wharf  in London, Britain May 19, 2015.Suzanne Plunkett/File PhotoMPs called in the debate for banks to share branches in smaller communities, and to be more transparent about closures. Closures have more than halved lending growth to small businesses in the areas affected, separate research released on Thursday showed. Campaign group Move Your Money estimated lending growth to small local businesses was down by 63 percent in towns and villages that had lost a bank branch. A spokesman for the British Bankers' Association (BBA) said banks have signed up to protocols aimed at minimizing the impact of branch closures, including partnering with post offices to offer services and carrying out impact studies before closures.Banks are determined to leave no one behind, he said. But MP for Tottenham David Lammy said banks were using their Access to Banking Protocol as a 'Trojan horse' to distract from closures. This is a quiet scandal and tragedy taking place across our country, Lammy said in Thursday's debate. Britain's vote last week to leave the European Union has potentially triggered the biggest upheaval for banking since the 2007-2009 financial crisis, raising risks of recession and earnings downgrades that hit bank shares.

Researchers on Wednesday announced the results of an intensive analysis of the 3.18 million-year-old fossils of Lucy, a member of a species early in the human evolutionary lineage known as Australopithecus afarensis. The scans of Lucy's arm bones showed they were heavily built, like chimpanzees, indicating that members of this species spent significant time climbing in trees and used their arms to pull themselves up in the branches. Australopithecus afarensis possessed a combination of ape-like and human-like traits. Scientists already knew its feet were adapted for walking upright on two legs, rather than grasping trees, but had wondered about whether it still spent time in trees like its ancestors. Chimpanzees, the closest living relative of humans, spend a lot of time in trees. The researchers performed high-resolution X-ray CT scans on Lucy's fossils at the University of Texas and compared the findings to data on the bones of modern humans and chimpanzees.

The 1974 discovery of Lucy created a scientific sensation and shed light on early stages of human evolution. Our species, Homo sapiens, appeared in Africa 200,000 years ago.

The findings fit nicely with a study published in August by Kappelman and other researchers that concluded that Lucy herself may have died after a fall from a tree, based on bone fractures detected in the fossils. Kappelman has hypothesized that Lucy, about 3-1/2 feet tall (1.07 meters), foraged on the ground and sought nightly refuge in trees. Her injuries indicated she fell from a height of more than 40 feet (12 meters), that earlier study found. It may seem unique from our perspective that early hominins (members of the human evolutionary lineage) like Lucy combined walking on the ground on two legs with a significant amount of tree climbing, but Lucy didn't know she was unique, he said.

Ding Kung-Wha, the chairman of the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC), stepped down amid mounting criticism over the watchdog's effectiveness. The Mega Financial branch was fined $180 million by U.S. authorities for violations of rules including lax attention to risk exposure in Panama. In a statement released by the FSC, Ding, 62, said he hoped his resignation would reduce damage to the FSC over the Mega Financial scandal. President Tsai Ing-wen has said the case had damaged Taiwan's reputation and created public mistrust about supervision of the financial sector. But Tsai's opponents on the island said the official's departure was a symbolic political gesture that put disproportionate blame on Ding, who only assumed his position with the FSC in May of this year. A veteran of Taiwan's administration not widely known in international finance circles, Ding previously served as chief of the Taipei Exchange and as a finance ministry official.     Ding submitted his written resignation this morning, cabinet spokesman Hsu Kuo-yung said at a news conference. Hsu said Ding's view was that he had done as much as he could in his role as chairman to assist the investigation and efforts to improve the FSC. Ding's successor has yet to be selected, Hsu said. One potential candidate to replace him, according to political sources in Taipei, is Shih Jun-ji, current chairman of the Taiwan Stock Exchange. Shih has previously served a brief stint as the FSC's chief. An emergency task force set up by President Tsai is now supervising a probe into the violations of U.S. regulations. But opposition politicians said Ding was carrying responsibility just a few months after taking office for transactions that did not originate in Taiwan itself.  Ding and some legislators held a closed-door meeting last week on details of 174 suspicious transactions belonging to 76 accounts processed in Mega's New York branch. None of the transactions were from Taiwan, according to Lai Shyh-bao, a prominent member of opposition party Kuomintang (KMT), and other people with direct knowledge of the matter. He (Ding) did not have to take responsibility, said Lai. Some supporters of President Tsai thought he is too bureaucratic. He has financial expertise, but is not skilled in politics. In addition to the Mega Financial scandal, the FSC has faced criticism over its handling of a case involving XPEC Entertainment, a Taiwanese gaming software developer.    Investors in XPEC have suffered heavy losses after a tender offer for of a stake in the company by a Japanese suitor went sour, domestic media have reported, with some complaining the FSC should have taken regulatory action over the way the offer was managed.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/bc-finreg-alibaba-moneygram-idUSKBN15M2D8","Alibaba acquisition of MoneyGram would spotlight a lackluster Chinese AML regime - experts","","February 7, 2017 /  8:26 PM / 6 months ago","","NEW YORK (Thomson Reuters Regulatory Intelligence) - A deal for the payment affiliate of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd to buy U.S. money-transfer company MoneyGram International Inc has the potential not only to rattle the international funds transfer landscape, but also to pressure China to bolster a lackluster anti-money laundering regime, anti-money laundering professionals said. The combination of Alibaba's Ant Financial Services Group, which runs Alipay, an online payment platform widely used in China, and MoneyGram's global network of agents and established brand, could create a massive payments company capable of muscling market share away from competitors, experts said. The deal was announced last month. But foreign branches of Chinese banks have been hit hard with regulatory enforcement actions around the world over alleged failures to properly police transactions for criminal activity, and banks in China are considered better regulated than other payment platforms operating in the country, raising questions about how U.S. regulators will view Chinese control of America's number-two money transfer firm, the experts said.  Some anti-money laundering (AML) compliance professionals are therefore watching to see if compliance hurdles will complicate any potential merging of Alipay and MoneyGram. And some U.S. law enforcement authorities have concerns. Will Alipay adopt U.S. AML rules and apply MoneyGram's more strict oversight of suspicious activities? There's this gray area between BitCoin, mobile banking, and remittance companies expanding, and government laws, rules and oversight cannot keep up, said a senior federal law enforcement official with responsibility for combating money laundering. Beyond the Chinese Firewall If Alipay's closed network, begins to use MoneyGram as a channel to send and receive funds through more effectively regulated portions of the global financial system, the money laundering risks would be significant unless new controls were put into place, said Juan Llanos, a consultant who helps money transfer outfits and high-tech payment firms comply with AML laws and regulations. Regulators around the world will be watching, he said. Alipay was launched in China in 2004 by Alibaba Group and its founder Jack Ma, who recently met with and won praise from U.S. President Donald Trump. It is a major player in the Chinese payment services sector. It can be used to make payments in-store as well as online, and competes with Tencent's Wechat Payment. Alipay has not been accused of AML deficiencies. The Alibaba-MoneyGram deal would require approval by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CIFIUS), a U.S. inter-agency panel that reviews foreign acquisitions of domestic assets for national security concerns. CIFIUS has been a stumbling block for several Chinese deals in the United States. MoneyGram, alongside competitor Western Union Co, has long dominated the money transfer industry with its large network of retail locations. It has about 350,000 outlets in retail shops, post offices and banks in nearly 200 countries and territories. Such payments mainstays have faced growing competition from more tech-savvy companies able to offer cheaper services online, however. Ownership change would spark regulatory scrutiny But perhaps more importantly for Ma's global ambitions, the U.S. states in which MoneyGram operates would each have to approve a change in ownership if the money transfer outfit is to remain licensed, Llanos said. The change of control process is famously invasive and is bound to subject the Chinese owners to an unprecedented level of scrutiny by a foreign set of regulators, Llanos said. An AML officer with a Manhattan branch of a Chinese bank said it is likely Alipay's controls will have to be beefed-up and noted that a number of Chinese banks have been targeted by regulators in the United States and elsewhere over AML lapses.  U.S. regulators are probably salivating at the prospect of examining a combined Alipay-MoneyGram payments company for AML and sanctions compliance, said a New York consultant with expertise in the regulatory consequences of China's growing role in the global financial services sector.  Ant Financial could find itself in regulators' crosshairs if it makes the mistake of replacing MoneyGram's senior managers – who have an appreciation for the importance of AML rules – with Chinese executives from the home office who may not consider compliance a priority, the consultant said. Foreign bank branches in Manhattan have had a similar challenge with incoming senior management from the home office unfamiliar with AML regulations and not understanding the seriousness of their compliance, he said. Alex Holmes will remain MoneyGram's chief executive and the company will continue to be based in Dallas, Reuters has reported. Chinese Banks' Aml Woes Last year, both the U.S. Federal Reserve and the New York Department of Financial Services took action against Agricultural Bank of China over AML failures, with the state regulator issuing a $215 million fine. In 2015, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, a large bank regulator, ordered Bank of China to improve its compliance systems and the Federal Reserve required China Construction Bank to tighten its controls.  Additionally, Bank of China and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China have been subject to AML enforcement actions in Italy and Spain, respectively.  Although China continues to make improvements to its anti-money laundering legal and regulatory framework and is gradually making progress toward meeting international standards, implementation and transparency remain lacking, a 2016 U.S. State Department report noted. The findings of the global AML standard-setting Financial Action Task Force support the U.S. State Department assessment. It has found China non-compliant or partially compliant with dozens of the body's recommendations, although the task force says China has been making progress to correct shortcomings. Any purchase of MoneyGram could force Ant Financial to get ahead of the curve and exceed its government's AML requirements, a development that could spark Beijing to move more quickly with its upgrades, sources said.  Ant Financial will need to adapt their systems to meet international Know Your Customer, monitoring, sanctions enforcement and information sharing protocols, Llanos said. And the global AML standards will affect the Chinese culture. This article was produced by Thomson Reuters Regulatory Intelligence and initially posted on Feb. 6.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/russia-sberbank-idUSL5N1H0291","Russia's Sberbank set to extend economic reach after record year","","March 28, 2017 /  5:30 AM / 4 months ago","","* Sberbank became largest Russian company this month * Bank posted record profits despite economic crisis * Sberbank part owned by central bank, close ties to Kremlin * Other banks complain it is stifling competition By Alexander Winning MOSCOW, March 28 (Reuters) - Russian banking giant Sberbank  has become so powerful that when it cuts interest rates on loans, other banks feel forced to follow. Now it wants to extend its reach into other areas of the economy. This month the former Soviet savings bank, which is still half-owned by the central bank and is headed by an ally of President Vladimir Putin, overtook oil company Rosneft to become the biggest company in Russia by market value. With over a third of Russia's banking deposits, Sberbank has a market grip unseen in most Western economies. It has thrived despite an economic crisis and Western sanctions on Russia, winning market share from domestic rivals and making a record $9.5 billion profit in 2016. Sberbank now wants to use its huge reach to sell customers across Russia's 11 time zones everyday services such as education and healthcare, earning fees even if it will not be the one providing those services. It also wants to expand its investment products and will be one of only two banks authorised to sell government bonds to the general public from next month. This will deepen its influence over major sectors of the economy, and the bank hopes it will help reduce its reliance on interest income. We have to invent a way to increase our fees and commissions, the bank's Chief Financial Officer Alexander Morozov told Reuters. We have to think about the future low interest rate environment. Sberbank has not given detailed information on which non-banking services it will offer as the plans for its financial ecosystem are in their infancy. Domestic projects have become more of a priority for Sberbank since its ambitions for international expansion were thwarted by Western sanctions, which made some clients wary of dealing with the bank for compliance reasons. Sberbank also aims to strengthen its financial position by closing more branches – it shut around 1,300 last year – and move more customers online. Chief Executive German Gref has said by 2025 it could have only half its current 330,000 staff. The bank wants to achieve return on equity (ROE) – a measure of profitability closely watched by investors – of between 16 and 19 percent this year, having hit almost 21 percent in 2016. Not one of the 50 largest banks in Europe's STOXX index achieved ROE of over 20 percent last year. Banking Oligopoly Sberbank has hoovered up clients as hundreds of smaller banks have been shut down as part of a crackdown on financial crime by the central bank. Bankers at some of Russia's other 560 banks say it has accumulated such a large market share it is hard to compete. Russia's banking sector is an oligopoly, a senior executive at a large private Russian bank said, asking for anonymity to speak freely. Sberbank cuts interest rates and we all have to follow. On Dec. 1 last year, for example, Sberbank reduced its rates on some mortgages by 0.5 percentage points. Rival VTB also lowered interest rates on some mortgages by 0.5 percentage points five days later and on Dec. 7 Raiffeisenbank, the Russian unit of Austria's RBI, also cut mortgage rates. Sberbank's Morozov acknowledged the competition. In mortgages the most aggressive competitors always match any of our moves, some of them continuously keep their offering lower, he said. Sberbank's dominant position does not appear to be causing any concern among Russian policymakers, some of whom see it as an important sign of economic and banking system strength. The bank's management has close ties to Putin. Gref was Russia's economy minister from 2000 to 2007, during Putin's first two terms as president, before taking over at Sberbank. He oversaw a plan to reform the economy after a period of crisis in the 1990s. While he is not in Putin's inner circle he has a reputation as an effective manager and is close to the governor of the central bank, Elvira Nabiullina. Analysts say having Gref and Nabiullina in charge of Sberbank and the central bank helps Putin guarantee economic stability. In order to have the foundations for economic growth and a stable currency you have to have a well-functioning savings bank and an effective central bank, said Tom Adshead, head of research at Moscow-based Macro Advisory. Putin understands this. He trusts Gref and Nabiullina and has them at the centre of his economic plans. Nabiullina said last year that the confidence in Sberbank among Russia's depositors was due to it being a state-controlled institution.

Wolseley has looked to grow in the U.S., which accounts for about two-thirds of its revenue, as it faces tough competition and a weak market for its core repair, maintenance and property improvement services in the UK and Europe. The company earlier this year set out plans to close just over 10 percent of its UK branches, as it seeks to respond to an oversupply in the plumbing and heating market that has also forced rivals Travis Perkins (TPK.L) and Grafton GRF_u.L to restructure. Wolseley would see strong growth for the year, its chief executive said on Tuesday, citing expectations of further growth in the U.S. residential and commercial markets as well as improvements in the industrial and commodities pricing markets. I think overall in the U.S. we're positive, John Martin told Reuters. However, as Wolseley focuses on growing its business and acquisitions, Martin said surplus cash payouts should not be expected imminently. Its last fiscal was the first time in four years that Wolseley failed to return excess cash to shareholders. Wolseley reported a 21.2 percent rise in trading profit to 303 million pounds ($386 million) and a 22.9 percent increase in revenue to 4.369 billion pounds for the quarter ended Oct. 31. Like-for-like revenue grew 1.8 percent year-on-year, underpinned by a 4.2 percent growth in the U.S from a 3.1 percent increase seen in the preceding quarter. U.S. growth was slightly below the 4.5 percent level noted for the opening weeks of the year, raising some concerns among analysts as the UK and Nordics posted revenue declines of 2.9 percent each, versus falls of 2.1 percent and 2.3 percent respectively for the preceding quarter. Martin said the UK business would remain tough for the year, citing a need to replace heating volumes lost due to an ongoing pullback in the social housing market. He said the weakness could not be linked to uncertainty caused by Britain's vote to leave the European Union, a condition that forced Travis Perkins to warn on profit in October. We leave our forecasts virtually unchanged with the key question for the rest of the year being whether the U.S. volume growth can be sustained, Barclays analysts wrote in a note.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eurozone-banks-italy-unicredit-idUSKBN1420P5","UniCredit to raise 13 billion euros in Italy's biggest share issue","","December 13, 2016 /  8:28 AM / 7 months ago","","MILAN/LONDON (Reuters) - Italy's largest bank, UniCredit (CRDI.MI), plans to raise 13 billion euros ($13.8 billion) in the country's biggest-ever share issue to shore up its balance sheet and shield itself from a broader banking crisis. The plans announced on Tuesday also include 14,000 job cuts and more than 900 branch closures. They come at a turbulent time for Italian banks and the economy - with Monte dei Paschi di Siena (BMPS.MI) at risk of failure, a new government just installed in Rome and early elections expected next year. UniCredit, the only Italian bank deemed important to the stability of the global financial system, has lost about half its market value this year, hit by profitability concerns, bad loans and a weaker balance sheet than major European rivals. Chief Executive Jean Pierre Mustier said the bank planned to launch the share issue in the first quarter of 2017 and use the money to help mop up 17.7 billion euros worth of bad debts from its balance sheet, enabling it to boost its profits and also dividend payouts by 2019.     Drafted in five months ago, the former Societe Generale (SOGN.PA) executive has sought to streamline the bank, selling assets like fund manager Pioneer and Polish unit Bank Pekao. We've taken some bold actions because self-help is always the best thing to do, the 55-year-old told analysts in a call. Joseph Oughourlian, CEO at UniCredit shareholder Amber Capital, said he was a firm believer in Mustier. Related CoverageUniCredit deal to offload bad loans sets bar high for Italian banksSorting out UniCredit is huge service and a plus for the Italian banking sector. We now have the two largest banks in Italy well-capitalised, he said. Italy's other major bank is Intesa Sanpaolo (ISP.MI). The issue would take the bank's core capital ratio to above 12.5 percent in 2019, from about 10.8 percent now, though UniCredit envisages deep job cuts. It plans to shed 14,000 jobs, or about 11 percent of its staff as of end-2015.  Including announced asset sales, the bank will have a third less staff by 2019, compared with the end of last year, as a result of its turnaround plan. It also plans to close 944 branches in its core areas of Italy, Germany and Austria by 2019. Mustier pledged to cut his fixed salary by 40 percent to 1.2 million euros with no annual bonus this year or during the plan to 2019.  The headquarters of UniCredit bank is seen in Milan, Italy, in this February 8, 2016.Stefano Rellandini/File PhotoShares Leap While UniCredit expects net profit to increase to 4.7 billion euros in 2019 from 1.5 billion last year, it projects revenue will rise just 0.6 percent annually, with growth mainly coming from fees and commissions. The bank said it would maintain its focus on central and eastern Europe as a growth area where revenues should grow by 2.6 percent a year and streamline its investment banking business. Shares in the bank jumped 10 percent on news of its plans, with traders saying its targets seemed realistic. The turnaround, though, would involve 12.2 billion euros in one-off losses in the fourth quarter, including loan writedowns and restructuring costs. Slideshow (4 Images)If one was to believe management can deliver on the plan ... and, should the environment turn in their favor, there is an argument to be said the shares look about 50 percent too cheap, said wealth manager Northern Trust Capital Markets. Mustier said no more asset sales were on the cards and that UniCredit itself was not in talks for a possible merger. His appointment this year had revived rumors about a possible merger between UniCredit and Societe Generale. The success of UniCredit's plan rests on investors believing it will be a long-term solution. The bank has already raised 14.5 billion euros since the global financial crisis struck in 2008. Mustier told reporters that the problems of Monte dei Paschi would not upset UniCredit's plans. I am highly confident Monte Paschi will be resolved by year-end and so it will have no impact on our capital increase. Italy is ready to bail out Monte dei Paschi, the country's third-largest bank, if it fails to get the 5 billion euros it needs to stay in business from private investors, a Treasury source said. The European Central Bank has given it by the end of this month to raise the money. For UniCredit, investment banks have signed a pre-underwriting agreement to help it market the issue, including Morgan Stanley (MS.N), UBS (UBSG.S), BofA Merrill Lynch (BAC.N), JP Morgan (JPM.N) and Mediobanca (MDBI.MI). UniCredit's bad loans would be sold to two vehicles, one managed by Fortress Investment Group and the other by PIMCO. UniCredit would retain minority stakes in each.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/stillwater-minng-ma-sibanye-gold-update-idUSL5N1E40JH","South Africa's Sibanye pays $2.2 billion for Stillwater in U.S. move","","December 9, 2016 /  1:37 PM / 8 months ago","","JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa's Sibanye Gold took a major step outside its home market on Friday with a $2.2 billion deal to buy Stillwater Mining, the only U.S. miner of platinum and palladium. If it goes through, the cash takeover will increase South Africa's grip over global platinum and palladium supply and underline chief executive Neal Froneman's determination to branch out of gold mining and South Africa.  However, the price Sibanye is offering to increase its own share of supplies of the precious metals is larger than its market value and the move triggered a sharp fall in its stock. Sibanye said it would buy Stillwater, which operates in Montana and is the largest primary producer of platinum group metals (PMGs) outside South Africa and Russia, with a loan that it will re-finance with debt plus a rights issue of at least $750 million. Froneman wants to cut the bullion miner's dependence on gold and platinum in South Africa, where a volatile currency, labor strikes and strict government rules have weighed on Sibanye's share price. The deal, the second-biggest South African outbound M&A; transaction so far this year, will make Sibanye the world's third largest palladium producer and fourth largest platinum group metals miner, Froneman said. Some analysts highlighted the risks as the platinum market sinks into oversupply. But while demand from the diesel car sector for platinum, which is used in catalytic converters, is under pressure because of air pollution concerns, palladium used in hybrid petrol cars could see higher consumption and the market is in deficit. Palladium reached its most expensive versus platinum since early 2002 last month as the U.S. election result sparked a surge in cyclical assets. It's a tier one asset in palladium in the United States, a source close to the deal said. Normally in the U.S., there would be a 30-40 percent premium. This is around 20 percent.    Sibanye said it would pay $18.00 per share in cash for Stillwater, a 23 percent premium over Thursday's closing price, which it was initially financing through a $2.675 billion loan arranged by HSBC and Citigroup. These are some of the lowest cost ounces in the world, said Froneman, referring to Stillwater's operations.  Shares Under Pressure             Sibanye's shares dropped 18 percent to an 11-month low, but recovered slightly to close 15.3 percent weaker at 24.01 rand, their biggest daily percentage drop on record.   By 1512 GMT, shares in Stillwater had surged 18.5 percent to $17.41, a touch below the offer price.  Froneman said Sibanye's share price was too low, even though it paid industry-leading dividends and this was partly because it was not as geographically diverse as some competitors. Sibanye did not detail any regulatory hurdles, saying only the deal - which is backed by Stillwater's board - was conditional on the required authorizations. It said it needed deal approval from its own and Stillwater's shareholders, although it already has the support of 29 percent of its own investors. Sibanye was spun off from Gold Fields in 2013. It bought Aquarius Platinum and Anglo American Platinum's Rustenburg mines last year.

The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said in a statement it had ordered Zurich-based Falcon Private Bank's Singapore branch to cease operating because of a persistent and severe lack of understanding of Singapore's money-laundering controls. It also accused Falcon's senior management in Switzerland and Singapore of improper conduct. Falcon was fined S$4.3 million ($3.12 million) for 14 breaches of the money laundering prevention law, including not filing suspicious transaction reports and failure to inform authorities of irregular activities in their customers' accounts. Falcon is the second bank to lose its license in connection with Singapore's probe into 1MDB, in which authorities have frozen millions of dollars in bank accounts, fined banks and charged several private bankers. In May, Swiss-based BSI Bank's Singapore branch was ordered to be closed for failing to control money-laundering activities connected with 1MDB. That was the first time in 32 years Singapore had shut down a bank.  DBS was fined S$1 million ($728,067) and UBS S$1.3 million on Tuesday for breaches in Singapore's anti-money laundering law. The two banks said in separate statements they would take action against staff responsible for the lapses. Standard Chartered Assessed In Zurich, the Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA), ordered Falcon to turn over 2.5 million Swiss francs ($2.56 million) in what the watchdog said were illegal profits.  A FINMA spokesman said the watchdog still has an ongoing investigation into UBS, Switzerland's biggest bank, in connection with 1MDB. FINMA also said it has opened enforcement proceedings against two former Falcon executives, without citing them by name. Singapore authorities arrested the Singapore branch manager of Falcon Private Bank, Jens Sturzenegger, on Oct 6, MAS said.  The MAS said it is also finalizing its assessment of the Singapore branch of Standard Chartered Bank and would make an announcement in due course.  Related CoverageAabar Investments says fully behind Falcon Private Bank after 1MDB sanctionsFalcon Private Bank not being sold at moment: CEOStandard Chartered said it would be inappropriate to comment while the assessment is taking place. Falcon described the MAS decision as regrettable and disappointing, but said it would now focus on growing in core locations in Switzerland, Middle East and London.      The bank expects to close the branch, which as around 35 employees, in the next few months, a Falcon spokesman said.       Six Countries Probing 1mdb Malaysia's 1MDB, once a pet project of Prime Minister Najib Razak who chaired its advisory board, is the subject of money-laundering investigations in at least six countries, including Switzerland, Singapore and the United States.  The logo of Switzerland's Falcon Private Bank, owned by Abu Dhabi's International Petroleum Investment Co (IPIC), is seen at its headquarters in Zurich, Switzerland October 5, 2016.Arnd Wiegmann/File PhotoThe U.S. Department of Justice filed lawsuits in July  seeking to seize dozens of properties tied to 1MDB, saying that over $3.5 billion was misappropriated from the fund. The lawsuits do not name Najib but say around $700 million of misappropriated funds flowed into the accounts of Malaysian Official 1, who U.S. and Malaysian officials have identified as Najib. The Wall Street Journal reported last year that investigators had traced nearly $700 million that was sent in from an account at Falcon in Singapore in 2013 to accounts in Malaysia they believed belonged to the Malaysian prime minister. Both Najib and 1MDB have denied any wrongdoing.  In January, Malaysia's Attorney General Mohamed Apandi Ali said Saudi Arabia's royal family gave Najib a $681 million gift, of which Apandi said about $600 million was later returned. Global Financial Centers The logo of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) is pictured at its building in Singapore in this February 21, 2013 file photo.Edgar Su/FilesFINMA said its review of Falcon had identified around $3.8 billion associated with the 1MDB Group that was transferred to accounts at Falcon between 2012 and mid-2015. The business relationships and transactions booked in Switzerland and at Falcon's Singapore and Hong Kong branches were unusual and involved a high level of risk for the bank both through their nature and the amounts transacted, it said.  It said Falcon had a number of business relationships with 1MDB group companies and executed transactions amounting to around $2.5 billion via accounts of two offshore companies.  Falcon also had a client relationship with a young Malaysian businessman with links to individuals in Malaysian government circles, it said without naming him. The bank did not verify how this individual had been able to acquire assets of $135 million in an extremely short period of time or why a total of $1.2 billion was transferred to his accounts at a later date - a transaction which was clearly at variance with the information he had provided when opening the account, it said. Internal warnings from bank staff were ignored, it found. FINMA banned Falcon from entering new business relationships with foreign politically exposed persons for three years and said Falcon would lose its license if there is any repetition of the offence. Falcon had $900 million in assets in Singapore, the bank's Chief Executive Walter Berchtold told a media briefing. The 1MDB case has not prevented the bank from attracting news assets, he added.  Falcon's owner, a subsidiary of Abu Dhabi's sovereign fund International Petroleum Investment Company, said it views Falcon as a strategic investment and has no current intention to sell it.  'Clean and Trusted' Ravi Menon, managing director of Singapore's central bank said in the MAS statement the board and senior management of financial institutions play a pivotal role in keeping Singapore  a clean and trusted financial center. They must put in place robust mechanisms to detect suspicious activities, promote strong risk awareness among their staff, and empower their compliance and risk management people, said Menon. Most of all, they must set the tone from the top – that profits do not come before right conduct. The crackdown also sends a message that banks have to adopt a compliance culture and the need for compliance staff to be able to take decisions independent of management, said Nizam Ismail, partner at RHTLaw Taylor Wessing LLP, where he advises clients on financial services regulation.

Witherspoon’s involvement in Hello Sunshine will come via her production company Pacific Standard, which counts films “Wild,” “Gone Girl,” and the upcoming HBO series “Big Little Lies” among its credits. As a subsidiary of Hello Sunshine, Pacific Standard will continue to make TV shows and films, but now will also branch out to include shorter-run digital content tailored for social media.

A study by USC-Annenberg found that female characters made up only 28.7 percent of all speaking roles in film, while women accounted for just 15 percent of directors.  Witherspoon launched Pacific Standard with her producing partner Bruna Papandrea in 2012 as a means to get more women both behind and in front of the camera in more prominent roles. Papandrea recently left to start her own venture.

    SAO PAULO, Nov 21 (Reuters) - The Brazilian real
strengthened on Monday as an emerging market selloff triggered
by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's unexpected victory lost
more steam.
    The real firmed 0.9 percent, extending gains to 2.5 percent
in four sessions after touching a five-month low on Nov. 14.
Other Latin American currencies, such as the Mexican peso
, also rose.
    The rebound allowed Brazil's central bank to reduce its
currency intervention following two weeks of heavy action.
    Seeking to curb volatility, the bank had offered new
traditional currency swaps, which function like selling dollars
to investors for future delivery, nearly every day since Nov.
11.
    The bank has not announced any such auction for Monday, but
it will offer swaps to roll over contracts maturing next month.
    The National Treasury also refrained from announcing a bond
repurchase auction for this session after doing so for the last
three trading days. Nevertheless, global risk appetite drove
down local bond and rate future <0#2DIJ:> yields.
    In a statement, the Treasury said it would keep monitoring

function properly.
    Brazil's benchmark Bovespa stock index rose 1

lender Banco do Brasil SA.
    The bank said late on Sunday that it would close 402
branches, downsize another 379 and give early retirement to
employees to save up to 3.05 billion reais ($908 million).
  
    Shares of miners and steelmakers, such as Gerdau SA
 and Cia Siderúrgica Nacional SA also
extended their recent rally on hopes that Trump's plans of heavy
infrastructure spending could support prices of industrial
metals.

Regling said financial integration, on the rise since the euro was created in 1999, took a big step back during the two consecutive financial crises that hit the 19 countries sharing the euro from 2008 onwards and that cut economic growth. He estimated that the drop in capital mobility between euro zone countries cost 4 percentage points of gross domestic product and 0.5 percentage points in terms of potential growth. The lack of risk sharing ... is a key challenge in this respect. It is the one economic priority on top of my list, when I think about the gaps that should be filled to make EMU more robust, and the euro area economy more resilient, he said. The Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) -- the single euro currency -- is the biggest political and economic project of the European Union, but while the monetary part of it has been set up and works well, the economic union is yet to be completed.

The euro zone also had to complete its banking union project by providing a financial backstop its Single Resolution Fund for banks and setting up a European Deposit Insurance Scheme -- an idea Berlin is adamantly against.

Finally, the euro zone should pursue the Capital Markets Union idea put forward by the European Commission which entailed a harmonization of corporate, insolvency ad tax laws across Europe to make cross-border investment easier. A higher degree of financial integration would be good for the private sector, for the real economy and for the good functioning of EMU, Regling said.

Regling said financial integration, on the rise since the euro was created in 1999, took a big step back during the two consecutive financial crises that hit the 19 countries sharing the euro from 2008 onwards and that cut economic growth. He estimated that the drop in capital mobility between euro zone countries cost 4 percentage points of gross domestic product and 0.5 percentage points in terms of potential growth. The lack of risk sharing ... is a key challenge in this respect. It is the one economic priority on top of my list, when I think about the gaps that should be filled to make EMU more robust, and the euro area economy more resilient, he said.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-libya-security-islamicstate-idUSKBN13Y1VM","Islamic State looks to regroup in Libya after losing Sirte","","December 9, 2016 /  3:25 PM / 8 months ago","","TUNIS (Reuters) - Islamic State has lost senior figures in an unsuccessful seven-month battle to defend its coastal stronghold in Libya, but  there are already signs it will try to fight back through sleeper cells and desert brigades. Libyan officials say hundreds of Islamic State militants may have escaped before the start of the battle for Sirte in May or during its early stages.   That has prompted fears of a counter-attack or insurgent campaign that could enable the militants to show they are still in business despite the rout, a heavy blow for a group that is also under intense military pressure in its core territory of Iraq and Syria.  Some cells have already been active. Islamic State is thought to be behind at least two dozen attacks or attempted attacks to the south and west of Sirte since August, said Heni Nsaibia of Menastream, a risk consultancy that monitors jihadist activity in the region.      Before May, IS was thought to have several thousand fighters stationed in Sirte - estimates of the exact number varied widely. Both leadership and rank and file had a heavy foreign presence, drawing on recruits from north and sub-Saharan Africa, according to Sirte residents and security officials in Misrata, the city that led the campaign to retake the jihadist stronghold. Much of that force has likely been wiped out over the past seven months, with dozens killed on both sides during the heaviest days of fighting. Islamic State was targeted by nearly 500 U.S. air strikes since Aug. 1.  Local officials say a number of high-level Libyan figures perished, including preacher and commander Hassan al-Karami, and senior official Abu Walid al-Ferjani.  Foreign commanders have also died, according to messages of mourning posted on social media accounts close to the militant group, though it is unclear how far up the hierarchy they were or how important to the group's future operations, said Marco Arnaboldi, a researcher of political Islam specializing on Libya. Few Prisoners Misratan officials refused to comment on reports of Islamic State militants being killed after capture, but fighters and commanders say they took few, if any, prisoners.  Ibrahim Baitulmal, head of Misrata's military council, estimated that 1,700 jihadists' bodies had been recovered during the campaign, adding that the number killed would have been higher since the militants retrieved some of their own dead. He said among those killed in the final days of the battle in Sirte was Abu Habib Jazrawi, a Saudi who is thought to have taken the name Abdul Qadr al-Najdi before being named as Islamic State's leader in Libya in March. Islamic State has not announced his death. Regional media reported that Najdi was replaced in September by a Tunisian, Jalaludin Al-Tunsi, possibly appointed to carry on the fight outside Sirte. He's one of the leaders who is going to prepare the next wave of Islamic State from south of the city, said Arnaboldi. The jihadist group has made no secret of its plans to continue the fight, in a country still roiled by the turmoil it exploited in the past. In August, the new leader of its east Libyan branch, Abu Musab al-Farouq, said high-level figures who had escaped from Sirte were helping it regroup not far away. In late October the head of the west Libyan branch, Abu Hudhayfah al-Muhajir, acknowledged that the group had been suffering, but said it would continue its campaign for conquest and empowerment and was still attracting a steady flow of foreign fighters.   Most of our people in Sirte have moved to neighbouring areas six months ago - and are still moving - during which they experienced the worst, he said in an interview with Al Naba, an Islamic State newsletter. The mujahideen in the Libyan provinces are still well ... Their security detachments are still spread in all the cities and the areas, and their brigades move in the east and west of the desert.

Reaching 1 million customers this year is thoroughly realistic, board member Michael Mandel told a media briefing, referring to the net new client target set for the 2012-2016 period. The retail bank added 81,000 customers between January and April this year, bringing the total to 900,000 since December 2012. The bank currently has 11.9 million retail customers. Assets under control rose by 55 billion euros ($61 billion)over the same period to 317 billion euros, compared with the multi-year target of more than 300 billion. Mandel, who took charge of Commerzbank's retail operations after his predecessor Martin Zielke was promoted to chief executive in May, is revamping the lender's network of 1,050 branches as it moves toward a common IT platform that can reach clients through multiple channels. Germany's second biggest lender expects to invest 200 million euros in the platform, while keeping overall costs flat. Commmerzbank warned investors in May to expect little from 2016 as it reported a steep drop in first-quarter earnings. Net income dropped by half to 163 million euros as volatile markets and low interest rates hit its business with German medium-sized companies particularly hard. Commerzbank is wrestling with a brutally competitive and low margin retail market, but Mandel declined to say how many branches would remain in its network by 2020. Its network has shrunk by about 150 branches since 2012. The number of branches is not the cost driver and I think an across-the-board reduction is not sensible, Mandel said. Deutsche Bank plans to shutter roughly 200 of its 700 branches and HVB has closed half its branches. Mandel said Commerzbank aims to maintain its geographical presence and plans four types of retail branch in its revamp. It expects to have between 65-100 flagship branches in large cities that will offer a full range of retail, commercial and wealth management banking services, after the concept did well in test markets Berlin and Stuttgart. Those branches cost around 1 million euros to set up. It is also developing a smaller city outlet offering standard products, with a focus on new customers and service. The revamp will include a category of larger classical branches with cash handling and specialty advisors. Many smaller branches will be classed as advisory offices, without cash handling. Mandel said there were already more than 200 of these. ($1 = 0.8974 euros)   (Additional reporting by Alexander Huebner; editing by Adrian Croft)"

Witherspoon’s involvement in Hello Sunshine will come via her production company Pacific Standard, which counts films “Wild,” “Gone Girl,” and the upcoming HBO series “Big Little Lies” among its credits. As a subsidiary of Hello Sunshine, Pacific Standard will continue to make TV shows and films, but now will also branch out to include shorter-run digital content tailored for social media. AT&T; partnered with longtime media executive Peter Chernin to form Otter Media in 2014 as a way to capitalize on the booming streaming video industry, committing more than $500 million to buy and or launch new companies. Related CoverageDirecTV mobile streaming services in line with regulations, AT&T tells FCCThe new company could give AT&T; an early stake hold in a marketplace currently light on content made both for and by women. A study by USC-Annenberg found that female characters made up only 28.7 percent of all speaking roles in film, while women accounted for just 15 percent of directors.  Witherspoon launched Pacific Standard with her producing partner Bruna Papandrea in 2012 as a means to get more women both behind and in front of the camera in more prominent roles. Papandrea recently left to start her own venture. Otter Media’s portfolio includes digital media company Fullscreen Media (which owns digital studio Rooster Teeth), social marketing agency McBeard, and Gunpowder & Sky, the digital studio launched by former Viacom executive Van Toffler. Otter Media also has invested in the Japanese anime and gaming space with two streaming video services in Crunchyroll and VRV.    Earlier this year, Chernin Group also acquired sports media company Barstool Sports.  AT&T; has been in the process of acquiring Time Warner Inc, a deal expected to close next year should it pass regularly hurdles. Last week, Time Warner's studio Warner Bros. agreed to acquire all of digital media company Machinima, a competitor to Fullscreen. Kerry Tucker will serve as chief executive of Hello Sunshine. Tucker most recently engineered the sale of The Video Genome Project, a content-recommendation start-up, to Hulu.  Seth Rodsky, founding partner of Strand Equity Partners, is partnered with Witherspoon on the deal and will join the Hello Sunshine board.

Anders Bouvin, head of its operations in Britain where the bank has been growing rapidly, will take over from Vang-Jensen who was himself rushed into the top job last year following a shake-up at the bank's main owner Industrivarden. The last job became a little too tough for him. He could not live up to the expectations, Handelsbanken chairman Par Boman said of Vang-Jensen, who was promoted from the role of head of the company's Swedish business. This recruitment was a mistake, Boman told a news conference. Boman cited failings when it came to leading a large number of managers in a bank which has a very decentralised model. Vang-Jensen's moves to slim down operations may also have ruffled feathers at the bank which has long prized a focus on its branch network and giving local managers great autonomy, such as decisions on whether to approve mortgages. During his short time as CEO, Vang-Jensen closed around 60 bank branches mainly in Sweden's biggest cities but also in the countryside, prompting protests from some customers. Overseas Growth Boman said an important role for the CEO was to establish branches abroad. It's a clear mission for our CEO to grow abroad and now we have a CEO who has the possibilities to do that, he said. The new CEO, Bouvin, told reporters the bank sees great growth prospects in specific European markets. We see great growth potential in both the UK and the Netherlands, he said. Right now it is mainly in those two markets. Handelsbanken refers to having six home markets on its website -- including Britain and the Netherlands, as well as Sweden, Denmark, Finland and Norway. The move by one of the best capitalised lenders in Europe took investors by surprise and pushed the bank's share price down by 1.6 percent at 1015 GMT, more than a 0.7 percent drop in the wider Stockholm bourse. Handelsbanken shares have dropped 23 percent since Vang-Jensen became CEO although the bank is still the second-best performer among Sweden's major banks during that time. Its average return on equity is in the teens, higher than the single figure average for European banks. Handelsbanken is a stable bank with a long-term perspective and a CEO change is an incredible surprise, said BNP Paribas analyst Andreas Hakansson. Vang-Jensen became CEO in March 2015 when then-CEO Boman was appointed chairman following a corporate spending scandal at a company also owned by Handelsbanken's main investor which led to several management and board changes. Danske Bank analyst Matti Ahokas said the decision to replace Vang-Jensen signalled a return to basics for the bank. Vang-Jensen probably took a step towards a kind of more modern way as other banks have done, like reducing branches, focusing on technology, he said.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-host-europe-loans-idUSKBN13J1KR","GoDaddy in exclusive talks to buy Host Europe: sources","","November 24, 2016 /  3:00 PM / 8 months ago","","LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. website domain name provider GoDaddy is in exclusive talks to buy peer Host Europe Group (HEG) as it seeks to expand in higher-margin businesses beyond the initial set-up of websites, people close to the matter said.  Arizona-based GoDaddy, the world's largest website address registrar, has branched into hosting websites itself for small businesses and consumers.  Founded in 1997, the company became well-known in the United States for its sometimes outrageous TV marketing campaigns with celebrities or during the Super Bowl and other sporting events. A purchase of HEG would help GoDaddy accelerate its shift into the more profitable web hosting business as well as broaden its customer base in Europe.  HEG, which serves mainly small and medium-sized businesses, is one of Europe's largest independent web hosting firms and could be valued at about 1.7 billion euros ($1.8 billion), or over 12 times its forecast 2016 core earnings of 140 million euros, people familiar with the matter have said previously.  In 2015, HEG posted like-for-like adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of 114 million euros on sales of 280 million. In 2017, Deutsche Bank estimates GoDaddy can generate nearly $1 billion in revenue from domains, $750 million from hosting and another $325 million from selling applications to help customers run businesses on the sites set up through GoDaddy.     The U.S.-based company, backed by private equity firms KKR and Silver Lake, trumped rival bids from German Internet service provider United Internet, which had teamed up with private equity firm Warburg Pincus [WP.UL], and a third bid by buyout firm Centerbridge, the sources said.  Deutsche Telekom this month withdrew from the bidding process, as did Permira, which teamed with Interoute, part-owned by investor Aleph Capital. Cinven, GoDaddy and KKR declined to comment. Silver Lake and HEG were not immediately available to comment. Cinven bought HEG in 2013 for 438 million pounds and expanded the business with acquisitions.  Banks, expected to include Barclays, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, Morgan Stanley and RBC, are lining up debt financing to back a potential deal between the two parties, totaling around 1.5 billion euros, or 4.5 times combined EBITDA, the sources said. If a deal is struck, the financing could be launched before the year end. A financing of this size would be welcomed by Europe’s very liquid leveraged loan market, which has been eager for new paper and event-driven deals as demand has far outweighed supply so far this year.

Attorney General Kamala Harris authorized a seizure warrant against the bank that seeks customer records and other documents, saying there is probable cause to believe the bank committed felonies. The probe marks the latest setback for the bank in a growing scandal that led to the abrupt retirement of its chief executive officer, monetary penalties, compensation clawbacks, lost business and damage to its reputation. Wells Fargo spokesman Mark Folk did not immediately provide a comment in response to requests from Reuters, but was quoted in the Los Angeles Times as saying the bank is cooperating in providing the requested information. A spokeswoman for the California Department of Justice said she could not comment on the probe. The bank's downward spiral kicked into high gear last month. The U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and other regulators ordered the United States' third-largest bank by assets to pay $190 million in fines and restitution to settle civil charges that its branch staff created as many as 2 million accounts without customers' knowledge in order to meet internal sales targets. The CFPB said that high pressure sales tactics and financial incentives fueled the fraud, which was largely carried out by low-level branch employees. About 5,300 of those employees were fired. Shortly after the civil settlement was made public, CEO John Stumpf was called to testify before Congress. Observers have widely criticized his performance, with many saying he appeared ill-prepared to deal with tough questioning by lawmakers including Massachusetts Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren, who called for his resignation and accused him of him gutless leadership. Last week, Stumpf resigned and was replaced by Chief Operating Officer Tim Sloan. This is at least the second criminal probe to be opened into Wells Fargo since last month. In September a source told Reuters that federal prosecutors are also looking into the matter. An affidavit filed by Special Agent Supervisor James Hirt with the California Department of Justice reveals that interviews with possible victims of the fraud have already started. One victim, identified only as Ms. B, told the investigator that she had declined a request by a Wells Fargo teller in late 2011 or 2012 to open new accounts. But sometime in late 2013 or early 2014, she started to receive notices that she and her husband allegedly owned on three life insurance policies held by the bank, the affidavit says. She also told the investigator that Wells Fargo often claimed that her accounts had to be closed and reopened because of problems that it could never fully explain. The constant changes, she added, sometimes caused her to incur fees because her checks would bounce. Another alleged victim, identified as Ms. C, told the investigator she noticed the bank was transferring money from her checking account to her savings account in amounts that grew over time, from $50 to $150. The bank claimed the transfers were done as overdraft protection, but it refused to provide her bank statements when she asked to see them. The seizure warrants by the state are seeking a variety of documents from Wells Fargo, including a list of all unauthorized California customer accounts created between May 2011 and July 2015. It also seeks information about fees, charges and other costs that were incurred and the identity of all Wells Fargo employees that may have opened the accounts."

The director of the Battle of Persian Gulf II, Farhad Azima, said that it was a remarkable coincidence that the release of the film - four years in the making - coincided with a warmongering president sitting in the White House.  I hope that the film shows Trump how American soldiers will face a humiliating defeat if they attack Iran, Azima told Reuters in a telephone interview from the city of Mashhad in eastern Iran.  The 88-minute animation opens with the U.S. Army attacking an Iranian nuclear reactor, and the U.S. Navy in the Gulf hitting strategic locations across the county. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), a powerful branch of the Iranian military, retaliates with full force, raining ballistic missiles on the U.S. warships. They all sink and the film ends as the American ships have turned into an aquarium for fishes at the bottom of the sea, Azima said. Trump has said he will not be as kind as his predecessor Barack Obama was to Iran, warning that military options are not off the table in response to Tehran. He has called into doubt Western powers' nuclear deal with Iran and, responding to an IRGC missile test last month, imposed fresh sanctions on Iranian individuals and entities, some of them linked to the Guards. A picture taken from Animation film Battle of Persian Gulf II depicts an armed confrontation between Iran's Revolutionary Guards and the U.S. Navy. Fatima Zahra Animation Studios/Handout via REUTERSCommander Qassem The main Iranian commander in the film has been intentionally depicted as Qassem Soleimani, the IRGC commander who is overseeing Iran's military operations in Syria and Iraq against Islamist militants. Slideshow (4 Images)Azima said he sought to contact Soleimani to ensure he was not against his appearance in the film but did not receive a reply. However, senior figures close to Soleimani asked the director to keep the character but drop the name Qassem in the final edit. Hollywood has created many films against Iran; There are many computer games in which U.S. soldiers conquer our country. We made this film as an answer to that propaganda, the 35-year old director said. But unlike the massive resources available in Hollywood, he said, Fatima Zahra Animation Studios has a small team and a limited budget. He said they have received no funds from the government and are not linked to the IRGC. Our animators are not working for money, but for their beliefs and their love of the country. Thank God, everyone is surprised that we've managed to create such high-quality production under this poor condition, he said. He said screenings will begin as soon as the film gets the necessary permissions from the cultural authorities. The film trailer has already created a buzz on social media, shared by thousands of people. The director believes young Iranians have shown interest to the film as they want someone to show them power of their country. Reporting by Bozorgmehr Sharafedin; Editing by Toby Chopra"

The bonus boost, which Chief Executive Bill Winters said was needed to motivate and retain staff, came as the lender swung back to a pretax profit of $409 million for 2016, a year after reporting its first loss in more than a quarter of a century. The move comes after rival lenders reported shrinking bonus pools due to underwhelming results. We continue to ensure that our pay remains competitive, and rewarding good performance. We had a meaningful improvement in performance ... so we concluded that this small increase was appropriate, Winters told reporters on a conference call. Winters said that despite the rise, compensation was still about 27 percent lower than what the bank paid out in dollar terms in 2012. StanChart will not pay a dividend for 2016 to shareholders as its restructuring is not complete and the bank faces regulatory uncertainty, Chief Financial Officer Andy Halford told reporters on a conference call. The profit result beat the $366 million expected by analysts, Thomson Reuters data showed. The bank's shares fell 4 percent in London by 1000 GMT. Winters' Discontent Since taking the helm in June 2015, Winters has announced plans to axe more than 15,000 jobs, closed the bank's stock trading business and overhauled its management team as he seeks to restore a slimmed-down StanChart to growing profitability. The former JPMorgan executive has expressed dissatisfaction with the bank's performance, last November branding its income and profit levels unacceptable as it missed out on bumper trading profits reaped by rivals more focused on the United States and Europe. Our financial returns are not yet where they need to be and do not reflect the group's earnings potential, Winters said in Friday's statement. Previous StanChart chairman John Peace said last year Standard Chartered would risk a staff exodus if it cut bonuses, responding to investor anger over high pay when the bank is not paying a dividend. It said in November 2015 that it was scrapping its final dividend. Winters himself received total pay for 2016 of 3.4 million pounds, excluding an additional long term incentive plan if performance targets are met. A total of 139 employees earned over 1 million euros  ($1.06 million), with the highest earning between 6-7 million euros, according to the bank's statement.  StanChart reported a $215 million loss from its stake in Indonesian lender PT Bank Permata Tbk (BNLI.JK), on rising bad loans and restructuring costs.  StanChart is seeking to reduce its interests in the Southeast Asian country to a single entity to comply with regulations, either by merging its branch with Permata or selling its stake in the local lender.

The Justice Department appointed a former FBI director as special counsel to investigate possible collusion between President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign team and Russia. The appointment of a special counsel follows Trump's dismissal of James Comey, his FBI director who was investigating Russia's role in the U.S. election. Media then reported that Trump may have interfered with a federal investigation, a serious allegation that could even lead to his impeachment if verified. Political instability in the United States is shaking markets. You would put a brake on investments to the U.S. when you see those headlines, said Bart Wakabayashi, Tokyo Branch Manager of State Street Bank. The dollar index reached its lowest level since early November, having shed 2.2 percent in the past four sessions. It last stood at 97.42, having given up all the gains it had made following the U.S. election in November. Although Trump's surprise election victory had initially sparked buying in the dollar and U.S. assets on hopes for his tax cuts and infrastructure spending plans, such Trump trades has been wound back. Indeed, the index has fallen 5.8 percent from its 14-year high marked 103.82 set on Jan 3, despite widespread talk that the U.S. currency should be supported by the prospect of higher U.S. interest rates. The Federal Reserve raised rates in March and its officials have said there could be two or three more rate hikes this year. Yet, U.S. political turmoil and softer-than-expected U.S. economic data in the past week, such as retail sales, consumer inflation and housing starts, is leading market players to discount the chance of more rate hikes. Fed Fund futures are now pricing in only about 60 percent chance of a rate hike by June, compared to around 90 percent earlier this month, and are no longer pricing in a 100 percent of one hike even by December. Against that backdrop, the dollar dropped 2.09 percent against the yen on Wednesday, its biggest fall since July 29 last year. It fell to a three-week low of 110.53 yen on Thursday before bouncing back a tad to 111.09 yen, up 0.3 percent from late U.S. levels, on Japanese bargain-hunting. The yen showed limited response to data that showed Japan's GDP grew an annualised 2.2 percent in the first three months of this year, beating economists' forecast of 1.7 percent rise. Although the headline GDP was stronger than expected, the GDP deflator was deeper into negative, pointing to persistent deflationary pressure, said Minori Uchida, chief currency analyst at the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ. The euro hit a six-month high of $1.1174 and last stood at $1.1161. The Swiss franc hit a six-month high of 0.9774 to the dollar on Wednesday before easing back to 0.9789. Against the euro, to which the Swiss currency is closely tied, the franc firmed to 1.09270 franc per euro from last week's eight-month low of 1.0987.

The list of at least 11 waivers include White House adviser Kellyanne Conway and Trump's Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, according to a chart issued on the White House website.

Shortly after taking office in January, Trump signed an executive order barring lobbyists who joined the administration from working on issues related to their prior work. But the administration has the power to grant waivers to particular hires, exempting them from that restriction. Also on the list is Michael Catanzaro, a special assistant to the president and a former oil and gas lobbyist, who is cleared to weigh in on energy policy. Daniel Epstein, associate counsel to the president, may provide legal advice to the White House Office or any agency of the executive branch and to take positions adverse to Cause of Action Institute. Shahira Knight, a special assistant to the president who formerly worked for Fidelity, a financial services company,  may participate in broad policy matters and particular matters of general applicability relating to tax, retirement and financial services issues.

Mulvaney said in the letter that the administration was not seeking to impede efforts by OGE to obtain that information, despite earlier protests from Walter Shaub, the agency's director. Shaub, an appointee under President Barack Obama in the final year of a five-year term, had requested in April copies of waivers the Trump administration granted to former lobbyists now appointed to positions in the government. Those requests were sent to agencies across the administration, seeking waivers that would allow former lobbyists to work on issues they had been involved with as paid advocates.  But OMB requested a stay of that request, prompting a fierce response from Shaub. He called the request highly unusual and said his agency has the authority to take corrective action proceedings against agencies that refuse its requests. In his Friday response, Mulvaney said the requested stay was not an attempt to stifle OGE efforts but rather to provide more time to ensure sufficient consideration was given to legal questions.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nigeria-sterling-bank-idUSKBN16A235","Sterling Bank drops M&A plans for retail-driven growth","","March 3, 2017 /  5:19 PM / 5 months ago","","LAGOS (Reuters) - Sterling Bank (STERLNB.LG) will abandon plans to buy a rival because of the high costs of doing an acquisition and focus instead on organic growth driven by retail customers, its chief financial officer said. Sterling's strategic plan had been to buy another Nigerian bank, based on the expectation that a 30 percent fall in the value of the naira last year would put pressure on banks to consolidate to recapitalize. Abubakar Suleiman, chief finance officer, told Reuters that Sterling was now pursuing organic-led growth as most rivals were too expensive and did not offer many merger benefits that would add value. The mid-sized bank ended talks to buy Keystone Bank last year but said at the time it wanted to raise funds as it looked at other targets. I don't see any candidate right now ... and nobody is selling cheap, so it's probably easier to grow organically, he told Reuters by telephone. Several other Nigerian banks have also shifted their business models after low crude prices helped to push the economy into its first recession in a quarter of a century. Wema Bank (WEMABAN.LG) is focusing on attracting more retail customers via digital banking and Fidelity Bank is also looking to boost retail customers, while FCMB (FCMB.LG) has closed branches. Sterling had hoped that an official naira devaluation would push rivals to seek fresh equity capital ... But no material devaluation has happened yet, Suleiman said, adding that it was now unlikely assuming Nigeria continues to build reserves. The naira lost a third of its official value last year and has been trading at a premium on the black market due to dollar shortages, prompting the central bank to effectively devalue it for private individuals. Shares in Sterling Bank traded flat at 0.73 naira on Friday after falling 4 percent since the start of January. The shares shed 58.5 percent last year. Suleiman said Sterling would issue a 27 billion naira  ($88.74 million) bond this year to boost lending. He said the bank expected to get clarity on the economy by the end of the quarter, including interest rates. He said the bank raised only 8 billion naira last year via bonds because of high interest rates. The central bank has kept interest rates high to support the naira but the government has been selling debt at yields below inflation to reduce its borrowing costs, making it difficult for companies to issue bonds.   Suleiman said Sterling would set a loan growth target for 2017 after the bond sale but would look at between five and 10 percent. The CFO said the bank planned to generate half of its deposits from retail customers by the end of next year from around 35 percent now. He added that the bank was targeting 5 million retail customers by 2020 using digital banking from 1.4 million accounts now. A big part of our investment is driven by retail.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/britain-eu-banks-switzerland-idUSL8N1J55VE","Credit Suisse to cut jobs as it pares back in London","","June 8, 2017 /  3:02 PM / in 2 months","","ZURICH (Reuters) - Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) is to cut roughly 1,500 jobs in London by the end of next year, according to a person familiar with the matter, part of the Swiss bank's efforts to cut costs globally. The cutbacks come as the bank's Zurich neighbor UBS (UBSG.S), the world's largest private bank, also considers moving hundreds of staff out of London as Britain prepares to embark on divorce talks with the European Union. UBS and Credit Suisse joined big U.S. investment banks in setting up their European headquarters in London, giving them access to the European Union market. But now Brexit is forcing the Swiss and others to seek alternatives. For Credit Suisse (CSGN.S), the job cuts, which will take its London staff to roughly 5,000, is part of a paring down of its London operations that began in 2015 as the bank restructured under Chief Executive Tidjane Thiam. One Credit Suisse executive said privately that high bonuses and the cost of doing business in the British capital made it difficult for Credit Suisse to turn a profit on its London operation. Brexit, he said, reinforced the determination to act.  A Credit Suisse spokeswoman said the investment bank as a whole had strong profit growth and that the program of company-wide job cuts was most advanced in London. The bank does not provide a breakdown for the performance of its London operations.  The scale of the London cuts reflects a change in approach towards Europe's biggest financial center. Before it embarked on its cutbacks, Credit Suisse employed more than 9,000 staff and contractors in the city. For the Swiss banks, it was always important to be in London, not least to be close to your wealthy customers, Andreas Venditti, an analyst at Swiss bank Vontobel, said. With Brexit, London has certainly lost some significance. For Credit Suisse, which was under pressure to cut costs anyway, as well as UBS, the timing is fortunate. Brexit is a good opportunity. The scaling back in London coincides with a shift in focus by both UBS and Credit Suisse towards Asia, the region with the fastest-growing number of millionaires. Other European centres could also benefit. Credit Suisse, which already has operations in Poland, opened a branch in Dublin more than a year ago, while UBS could bolster its base in Frankfurt. But UBS is biding its time in London until the end of this year before making any decisions on staff moves, one senior executive said, redoubling lobbying efforts for the status quo in finance to remain after Brexit. It expects roughly 1,000 staff in City of London may have to move after Brexit. But the number could be higher. Its chief executive Sergio Ermotti said up to 30 percent of its roughly 5,400 employees in London could be affected. If Britain's EU departure is abrupt and with no trading agreement in place to cover finance, one senior UBS employee, who asked not to be named, said the Swiss bank could be forced to move the majority of its London staff. Having earlier declined to comment, UBS said that was not correct.  Swiss bankers are still hoping for a smooth Brexit but frustration is growing over the lack of clarity so far. Earlier this year, Ermotti criticized the British government for failing to reassure banks.  The UK, he said is not really helping.

Italy's biggest bank, which could launch its share sale as early as Feb. 6, said on Monday that its Common Equity Tier 1 ratio (CET1) - a key measure of financial strength - would fall to 8 percent, below a minimum threshold of around 10 percent. This is because the bank expects to book 12.2 billion euros in one-off charges in the fourth quarter - a figure already announced to the market - as it cleans up its balance sheet from a mountain of bad loans. The capital deficit will be fully restored after the rights issue is wrapped up, before March 10, the bank said in a statement. It confirmed it still aimed for a CET1 ratio above 12.5 percent in 2019. The lender, identified by financial regulators as Italy's only globally systemically important bank, said besides the 12.2 billion euros in one-off items, it would also be booking charges of around 1 billion euros to cover writedowns in bank bailout fund Atlante and contributions to the National Resolution Fund. As a result the 2016 Group's estimated net financial result is expected to record a loss of approximately 11.8 billion euros, it said. Excluding the one-off items, the bank would have made a net profit in 2016, it said. In December UniCredit announced 14,000 job cuts and more than 900 branch closures as part of plans by Chief Executive Jean-Pierre Mustier, appointed in July, to turn the bank around. Mustier has repeatedly said the share sale, Italy's biggest ever, and massive balance sheet clean-up had not been requested by regulators. However, in a document published on Monday relating to the cash call, UniCredit said the ECB, in its review of the lender, had found several weaknesses. They included low capital ratios, weak profitability, a high level of bad loans in Italy, big costs in Germany and Austria and risks linked to its exposure to Turkey and Russia.     The bank also said four ECB inspections were currently underway. The ECB has asked UniCredit, among other banks, to present a plan for its bad loans by Feb. 28. The bank said the steps announced in December, which include the sale of bad loans worth 17.7 billion euros, should address the issues raised by the ECB, but warned there was a risk they may not be sufficient.  The ECB's banking supervisory chief, Daniele Nouy, told la Repubblica daily in an interview on Monday that Italy had made scant progress on its banks' problematic loans, which stand at 356 billion euros in gross terms - or a third of the euro zone's total.      UniCredit shares closed down 5.5 percent, underperforming a 1.7 percent fall in the European banking index .SX7P, with traders blaming the approaching share sale for the fall.

A Reuters report published earlier this month shone light on a Moldovan Laundromat probe into an alleged Russian-led money laundering scheme, in which $22.3 billion passed through Moldova using Russian shell companies and fictitious loans from offshore companies based in Britain in 2011-2014. The Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP), an East European media network, and Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta have also shared documents and data with the Guardian newspaper and media partners about the alleged involvement of British banks. British lawmakers tabled an urgent parliamentary question after newspaper reports said that UK banks including HSBC , the Royal Bank of Scotland, Coutts and Standard Chartered were named as being among those that did not turn away suspicious money transfers. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the National Crime Agency (NCA) ... will investigate closely whether recent information from the Guardian newspaper regarding money laundering from Russia, or indeed any other media source, would allow the progression of an investigation, Simon Kirby, the 'City' minister responsible for financial services, said in parliament on Tuesday. What is important is that if these allegations are correct, if they present any new information, that both the NCA and the FCA act on it appropriately, added Kirby, responding to a question raised by the opposition Labour Party. The FCA, tasked with ensuring that financial services companies have adequate, proportionate and efficient safeguards  to prevent them being used for financial crime, said it would investigate any evidence that it received. The NCA said the case involved a number of UK-established companies and that, according to current information, the bank accounts involved were almost entirely held in non-UK jurisdictions. It said the money therefore did not generally move through the UK's financial system. The NCA remains willing to consider any formal request for assistance from the Moldovan authorities in connection with their investigation, and will consider whether information provided by the Guardian or other media sources would allow the progression of an investigation, it said in a statement. According to data compiled by the OCCRP and published by the Guardian, HSBC saw $545 million routed through its UK and foreign branches. HSBC is still subject to a five-year deferred prosecution agreement made in 2012 with U.S. authorities over lapses in its anti money laundering controls. HSBC is strongly committed to fighting financial crime, the bank said in a statement. The bank has systems and processes in place to identify suspicious activity and report it to the appropriate government authorities. This case highlights the need for greater information sharing between the public and private sectors, each of whom holds important information the other does not. RBS, which owns Coutts, and Standard Chartered  also said they were committed to combatting financial crime and money laundering. Standard Chartered said it would investigate any indications of suspicious activity. The NCA said potential money laundering investigations were complicated when it was impossible to establish a criminal source for funds, such as drug supply, human trafficking or corruption without cooperation from the foreign jurisdictions.

Since he took office in December 2015, foreign companies have announced new investment plans worth about $33 billion in Argentina, with most coming from companies based in the United States, Germany, Canada, Spain and Brazil.  Total investment, including local companies and joint investments between Argentine and foreign companies, has totaled $58.6 billion, according to Argentina's Trade and Investment Promotion Agency.

In January, Molina reported a loss due to the Obamacare individual insurance program and shares dropped 17 percent. On Tuesday, it reported a first-quarter net income of $1.37 per share. Chief Executive Dr. J. Mario Molina and Chief Financial Officer John Molina, who are brothers and have managed the company for decades, will be replaced by Chief Accounting Officer Joseph White, its new chairman, Dale Wolf, said in a news release. The Molina family, which started the company in 1980 and took it public, controls more than 20 percent of the company, through a trust and individual holdings. Large institutional investor Capitol World Investors is the next largest holder. Molina will seek a permanent CEO and White will remain CFO, the company said. According to the company's proxy filing filed in March, Mario Molina is entitled to a payout worth nearly $20 million in cash and stock and John Molina is entitled to a payout worth more than $10 million. They remain on the board. Capitol World declined to comment. A Molina spokeswoman sent a reporter to an external spokesman, who said that the Molinas were not available for comment and declined to comment beyond the release. Molina shares closed up 18 percent, or $8.95, at $59.75. Investors are likely hoping that the management changes could lead to either future improved operational performance and/or a change in the board's views on strategic directions, Credit Suisse analyst Scott Fidel said in a research note. Wolf had been a director before Dr. Molina was ousted from the chairman job. The lead independent director is Ronna Romney, a Republican politician who was once married to the brother of former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and is the mother of the Republican National Committee chairwoman, Ronna Romney McDaniel.  Mounting Obamacare Issues Molina specializes in the Medicaid program for the poor, but in 2014 it branched out into the individual insurance plans created under the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare. It was a small business until 2017, when Molina's Obamacare program ballooned to more than 1 million members in 9 states, a result of other insurers having dropped out. Dr. Molina had been a staunch supporter of Obamacare, saying the insurer was managing its costs well. But that changed late last year as premiums failed to cover the payments made into the program's risk adjustment mechanism. Dr. Molina, who was reassured at first by promises from President Donald Trump's administration that it would not pull the rug out from under insured Americans as it sought to repeal and replace Obamacare, became a fierce public critic of the healthcare bill proposed by the U.S. House of Representatives. He spent time in Washington talking to policymakers and was quoted by the national press, including the New York Times, about his concerns. Last Thursday, Dr. Molina sent congressional leaders a letter in which he promised to send the government a notice of default if it did not back the subsidies that help members pay for out-of-pocket costs, drop as many as 700,000 members this year and warned that Molina might leave the market in 2018. The company moved its shareholder meeting to May 10 from Wednesday and said it would send out new proxy materials.

Italy plans to start liquidation proceedings for Banca Popolare di Vicenza and Veneto Banca on Saturday, a source close to the matter said, issuing an emergency decree that will effectively remove one its biggest banking headaches by splitting the two lenders' assets into good and bad banks. The country's top retail bank Intesa Sanpaolo (ISP.MI) is set to buy the good assets for one euro, leaving the state to foot the bulk of the bill for losses stemming from the banks' bad loans, legal risks and restructuring costs.  EU state aid rules allow for the possibility of granting state support in these kind of situations, the European Commission, which must rule on the use of state money, said in a statement.  It added it was in constructive discussions with Italian authorities. Good progress is being made to find a solution very soon.  The Italian government has been scrambling to prevent the two lenders from being wound down under European banking rules designed to stop the use of state money in banking crises.  Rome feared that under those rules losses could have been imposed on senior bondholders and large depositors, a politically unpalatable prospect in the run-up to elections next year. Instead, under the Italian plan only junior bondholders and shareholders will be hit, but the cost for taxpayers is likely to be hefty.  With the two banks' soured or risky debts totaling more than 20 billion euros ($22.4 billion), one banker said the government would put in 5 billion euros, while some Italian media reports on Friday said the final bill could be as high as 12 billion euros.

The sale will allow the regular functioning of the banks' branches on Monday morning, it said, adding the terms of the transaction will be made public in coming days. Earlier the European Central Bank said the two banks, which have a capital shortfall of 6.4 billion euros and are bleeding deposits, were failing or likely to fail, setting in motion the process that will lead to them being wound down. The ECB had given the banks time to present capital plans, but the banks had been unable to offer credible solutions going forward, it said in a statement. Pressure on Rome to find a solution for the two Veneto lenders had increased since Spain's Banco Popular POP.MC was rescued by Santander (SAN.MC) this month in a deal orchestrated by European authorities. In Popular's case, no state money was used and Santander is seeking around 7 billion euros of capital from shareholders to help it take on Popular. The Italian plan instead takes advantage of an exception to EU bank rules that allows the use of routine insolvency proceedings with banks not considered systemically important, allowing the process to be handled by the member state. The plan has sparked criticism from some European officials who said Italy was being allowed to cut corners, while at home, opposition politicians have also criticized the scheme put forward by the government. Intesa gets a free gift, the state takes on all the bad stuff and the taxpayer pays, Renato Brunetta, parliamentary leader for former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia (Go Italy!) party said on Thursday. Did we really need to take so much time to come up with such a rubbish solution?

Heavy rainfall, mudslides and hail caused by the annual rainy season has killed 56 people and 22 people were missing across 11 provinces and regions as of Tuesday morning, according to the Ministry of Civil Affairs. More than 750,000 hectares (1.85 million acres) of crops have been damaged and direct economic losses totaled more than 25.3 billion yuan ($3.72 billion), it said.  The government said it had disbursed 700 million yuan ($103 million) in emergency aid to four flood-hit provinces -  Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hunan and Guizhou. Rain in the southern provinces is expected to ease in the coming days, but weather forecasters predict downpours will move to the southwestern province of Sichuan. In what analysts said was a move unprecedented in its scale, the Three Gorges and Gezhouba, two of China's top hydropower plants, closed as much as two-thirds of their capacity to avert flooding further downstream on the Yangtze River.     The move stoked concerns about electricity supplies from China's second-largest power source as a heatwave continued to scorch northern parts of the country, raising the export prices of coal, the fuel the country uses to produce most of its power. Coal from Australia's Newcastle terminal rose to its highest since April, with mining outages tightening supply amid strong northern hemisphere summer demand. The annual rainy season, which arrived in the second half of June, has hit southern Hunan province, one of the nation's largest hog and freshwater fish producers, the most.  High water levels on the Yangtze, Asia's largest river, also slowed barges carrying grain from northern ports to the south, spurring a rise in freight rates and physical corn prices in some regions, analysts and corn buyers said. A man sits in the attic of his flooded house after a flood in Zhaoqing, Guangdong province, China July 4, 2017.StringerZhang Yi, a purchase manager at a feed producer in Hunan, said he had three ships carrying about 5,000 tonnes of corn stuck on waterways near the port of Changsha, the capital of Hunan, since Friday. Corn Prices Rise on Barge Delays Spot corn prices at major ports along the Yangtze and its tributaries, including Changsha, Nanchang in Jiangxi province, and Wuhan in Hubei province, have risen by 30 yuan to 1,800 yuan a ton since last week, according to data provided by China National Grain and Oils Information Center, a government think tank. Slideshow (9 Images)China usually transports corn from northern growing regions to the ports in the south. Then the grain is shipped along the Yangtze and its branches, to central and western provinces including Hunan, Hubei, and Sichuan. The Yangtze river's large watershed also accounts for 60 percent of the nation's freshwater fish output. Cao Delian, manager of the Dabeinong Changlin fish farm, estimated that he has lost about one-third of his carp due to the deluge. It's the biggest loss we've seen in at least 5 years, he told Reuters. On Monday, a natural gas pipeline in Guizhou owned by China National Petroleum Corp collapsed due to a mudslide, causing an explosion that killed at least eight people and injured another 35. In his office in Liuyang, a city near Changsha, Zhang was hoping water levels would continue to subside on Wednesday.  I have stocks of corn that can last for four to five days. As long as it does not rain tomorrow, Changsha port can resume operation and I will get my corn offloaded, Zhang said.

Shanghai will strive to expand net money inflows through FTZ accounts, with many Chinese banks offering incentives to encourage individuals and companies to convert U.S. dollars into yuan. Zhang Xin, deputy head of the People's Bank of China Shanghai headquarters, told a news conference on Wednesday that the central bank would step up anti-money laundering, and under the current circumstances, will strengthen crackdowns on foreign currency flight and step up monitoring abnormal capital flows. The yuan has lost more than 3 percent of its value against the dollar since the end of September, pushed down by a resurgent dollar that has gained further strength since the surprise election of Donald Trump as U.S. president. In a report on Tuesday, Capital Economics estimated that capital outflows last month were the largest since January, and posed a threat to China's exchange rate regime. As part of measures to lure inflows, many Chinese lenders have been offering preferential policies to buyers of the Chinese currency, Zhou Hehua, vice president of Bank of China's Shanghai branch, said on the sidelines of the PBOC's news conference. The Shanghai FTZ was launched in 2013 to promote international trade and cross-border investment, but three years later the city government is trying to balance efforts to accelerate financial reforms in the zone while preventing capital outflows. Beijing is under increasing pressure to stem capital outflows against the backdrop of a slowing domestic economy and a sharply strengthening U.S. dollar, which is being propelled by expectations that President-elect Donald Trump will boost U.S. growth and push up interest rates. On Wednesday, the government announced a series of reform measures in the Shanghai FTZ to encourage innovation and cross-border investment. The measures included allowing private equity funds and projects in the FTZ to raise capital in the zone as well as overseas, and use the proceeds for cross-border investments. In addition, multinational firms will be allowed to set up onshore cross-border yuan capital pools using Shanghai FTZ accounts to manage yuan holdings globally. Bank of China's Zhou said that regulators would like to see an equilibrium between money inflows and outflows in the zone, which would be good for China's financial stability. At this stage, banks would encourage inflows more, and compared with foreign exchange purchases, we would provide better terms to forex sales, regarding preferential policies, he said.

The cutbacks come as the bank's Zurich neighbour UBS , the world's largest private bank, also considers moving hundreds of staff out of London as Britain prepares to embark on divorce talks with the European Union. UBS and Credit Suisse joined big U.S. investment banks in setting up their European headquarters in London, giving them access to the European Union market. But now Brexit is forcing the Swiss and others to seek alternatives. For Credit Suisse, the job cuts, which will take its London staff to roughly 5,000, is part of a paring down of its London operations that began in 2015 as the bank restructured under Chief Executive Tidjane Thiam. One Credit Suisse executive said privately that high bonuses and the cost of doing business in the British capital made it difficult for Credit Suisse to turn a profit on its London operation. Brexit, he said, reinforced the determination to act. A Credit Suisse spokeswoman said the investment bank as a whole had strong profit growth and that the programme of company-wide job cuts was most advanced in London. The bank does not provide a breakdown for the performance of its London operations. The scale of the London cuts reflects a change in approach towards Europe's biggest financial centre. Before it embarked on its cutbacks, Credit Suisse employed more than 9,000 staff and contractors in the city. For the Swiss banks, it was always important to be in London, not least to be close to your wealthy customers, Andreas Venditti, an analyst at Swiss bank Vontobel, said. With Brexit, London has certainly lost some significance. For Credit Suisse, which was under pressure to cut costs anyway, as well as UBS, the timing is fortunate. Brexit is a good opportunity. The scaling back in London coincides with a shift in focus by both UBS and Credit Suisse towards Asia, the region with the fastest-growing number of millionaires. Other European centres could also benefit. Credit Suisse, which already has operations in Poland, opened a branch in Dublin more than a year ago, while UBS could bolster its base in Frankfurt. But UBS is biding its time in London until the end of this year before making any decisions on staff moves, one senior executive said, redoubling lobbying efforts for the status quo in finance to remain after Brexit. It expects roughly 1,000 staff in City of London may have to move after Brexit. But the number could be higher. Its chief executive Sergio Ermotti said up to 30 percent of its roughly 5,400 employees in London could be affected. If Britain's EU departure is abrupt and with no trading agreement in place to cover finance, one senior UBS employee, who asked not to be named, said the Swiss bank could be forced to move the majority of its London staff. UBS declined to comment. Swiss bankers are still hoping for a smooth Brexit but frustration is growing over the lack of clarity so far.

Rome on Sunday approved an emergency decree that leaves the best assets of Banca Popolare di Vicenza and Veneto Banca in the hands of Intesa Sanpaolo, which is taking them on at the symbolic price of just one euro. The government will pay 5.2 billion euros to Intesa, Italy's top retail bank, to ensure its capital ratios and dividend policy will not be affected by the deal, and give it guarantees of up 12 billion euros to shield it from any unexpected loss. The total exposure for the state is for up to 17 billion euros, although the Italian treasury estimates the final bill will be much lower than that. After drawn-out negotiations with Brussels, Italy won permission to liquidate the two banks under national insolvency procedures rather than have European regulators pull the plug on their own, potentially harsher, terms. The Veneto deal comes after Rome was also allowed to bail out the country's fourth biggest bank, Monte dei Paschi di Siena for up to 6.6 billion euros, removing another systemic threat and helping restore confidence in Italy's fragile financial industry. To do that, however, the government has potentially used up the whole 20 billion euros it had set aside to help ailing banks. This is a major step in the direction of a cleaner Italian banking sector. Monte dei Paschi, Veneto and Vicenza were the three main concerns and they are now dealt with - one way or another, fund manager Axiom Alternative Investments said in a note. Shares in Intesa, which is essentially cherry-picking the two banks' best parts for free and is expected by some analysts to start making money on them in 2018, were up 4.3 percent at 1028 GMT. The Italian bank index was up 3.5 percent. On Monday, Intesa said it would close 600 branches and lay off 3,900 people as a result of the Veneto deal, but those restructuring costs are covered by public money. The whole banking system breathed a sigh of relief, as a wind-down of the two Veneto banks under EU rules meant to stop state bailouts would have cost other Italian lenders 12.5 billion euros to guarantee deposits below 100,000 euros - spreading losses across an already battered sector. The Monte dei Paschi and Veneto deals will take some 45 billion euros in bad loans off the banking sector's balance sheet. But even so, the Italian banking industry, Europe's fourth largest, remains saddled with some 300 billion euros of gross soured debts, the legacy of a deep recession and poor lending practices. Banks are under pressure to sell those debts, but are reluctant to do so as they would have to book further writedowns that could force them to tap the market for cash. (Editing by Mark Potter)"

The proposed deal is the latest in wave of mergers and acquisitions in global container shipping that has left the top six shipping lines controlling 63 percent of the market. OOIL's shipping subsidiary, OOCL, has a 2.7 percent slice of the market.  COSCO Shipping is offering HK$78.67 for each OOIL share, a premium of 37.8 percent over OOIL's closing price of HK$57.10 on its last trading date, the companies said in filings with the Hong Kong and Shanghai stock exchanges on Sunday. OOIL's controlling shareholders had on Friday agreed to sell their 68.7 percent stake at that price to COSCO Shipping, which is making the offer with Shanghai Port International Group (SIPG) (600018.SS) that will take 9.9 percent, they said.  COSCO Shipping will have a fleet of more than 400 vessels and capacity exceeding 2.9 million TEUs (twenty-foot equivalent units) should the deal go through, it said. This would make it the world's third largest container shipping line after Denmark's Maersk Line MAERSKb.Co and Switzerland's Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC), according to Singapore-based transport research firm Crucial Perspective. It is currently the fourth-largest behind France's CMA CGM [CMACG.UL]. COSCO Shipping Holdings believes this acquisition will enable both COSCO Shipping Lines and OOIL to realize synergies, enhance profitability and achieve sustainable growth in the long term, the Chinese group said in the statement.  A COSCO container is seen at the Noatum container terminal near Bilboa, in Santurtzi, Spain June 14, 2017.Vincent West - RTS170T5OOCL was founded in 1969 by Hong Kong shipping magnate Tung Chao-yung, whose son, Tung Chee-chen is chairman, president and chief executive of the company, while several Tung children are in senior management roles. The two companies in January dismissed merger rumors but analysts said that OOCL was still a likely bid target due to its long profitable history and relatively low leverage. Both firms are also part of the Ocean Alliance partnership, which also includes CMA CGM and Evergreen Marine Corp (2603.TW), that was formed last year to take on the rival grouping of Maersk Line and MSC. COSCO Shipping itself was created from the state-driven merger of former rivals China Ocean Shipping (Group) Company and China Shipping Group. Shares in the firm, which flagged a return to first-half profit last week, have been suspended since May 16. It said it would finance its part of the deal through external debt financing and that the transaction was still subject to anti-trust reviews by Chinese and U.S. government authorities.  The companies said that they plan to retain OOIL's listing status and maintain its global headquarters and presence in Hong Kong to support the city as a global maritime center.  Should the deal fall through, COSCO Shipping has also agreed to pay OOIL a reverse termination fee of $253 million, they said  UBS AG Hong Kong Branch (UBSG.S) is advising COSCO Shipping and SIPG, while J.P.

U.S. members pay $99 per year for streaming video and two-day shipping. Amazon shares closed up 1.8 percent at $996.47 on Nasdaq. Prime Day is the big overriding story and what's moved the stock up today, said Trip Miller, managing partner at Gullane Capital Partners in Memphis, Tennessee, which has a long position in Amazon. Miller said Amazon's dominance could be seen in how a long list of retailers' shares fell on Monday.   Baird Equity Research analysts have estimated that Prime has about 60 million U.S. members, based on an April survey. Amazon does not disclose the number. It's a real test to see if they can raise that number, said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. She said an Amazon disclosure on the number of subscribers and their location would be telling, to see how big of a phenomenon this is. Spreading Out Among the stocks hurt by Amazon was Best Buy, which fell 6.3 percent to end at $54.23 in its largest daily percentage drop since late May 2016. The decline was partly prompted by reports of an Amazon service launched earlier this year, similar to one from Best Buy, that helps customers set up a 'smart home' with Amazon's voice-controlled assistant Alexa, analysts said. Best Buy's Geek Squad, which offers in-home product installations and repairs, has helped distinguish the electronics retailer from its rivals. Today's news reflects what we know: Consumers love technology but frequently need help getting the most out of it, said Jeff Shelman, senior director of external communications at Best Buy Corp. Investors punished Best Buy shares on a growing concern that it stands to lose if Amazon branches out into its business. That's the vision investors and even competitors have of being 'Amazoned,' said Fort Pitt Capital's Forrest. Amazon's announcement last month of the acquisition of Whole Foods Market Inc (WFM.O) sent stocks of food retailers, producers and packagers, among others, reeling. Fears about Amazon's new service, which is offered only in seven top urban areas on the U.S. West Coast, may be overblown, Forrest said. I think investors are overestimating the power of Amazon and underestimating the cost to enter all of these new markets and their geographies. America is a big place.

Abe has said neither he nor his wife, Akie, was involved in a murky deal for the purchase of state-owned land by Moritomo Gakuen, an educational body in the western city of Osaka that also runs a kindergarten promoting patriotism.

Abe, grilled about the purchase of the land at a rock-bottom price, said on Friday his wife would scrap a plan to become honorary principal of an elementary school the institution will open in April.  Last year, Moritomo Gakuen paid 134 million yen ($1.2 million), or 14 percent of the appraisal price, for an 8,770-sq-m (94,400-square-foot) plot on which to build the elementary school, official data show.  The difference reflects the cost of waste cleanup at the site, officials have said. Finance Minister Taro Aso told parliament this week there were no problems with the deal. Abe said his wife had tried to refuse the role as honorary principal, and only accepted after it was announced to parents.  Despite this, she decided that it would be detrimental for both the students and the parents if she continued, and so she told them she would resign, he added.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/rbs-results-idUSL8N1G918Q","RBS posts ninth straight annual loss on sins of the past","","February 24, 2017 /  8:44 AM / 5 months ago","","LONDON (Reuters) - Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L) reported a sharp rise in losses on Friday as higher misconduct charges and restructuring costs underscored the challenges facing the lender nine years after it was bailed out in the world's biggest bank rescue. RBS, which has not made an annual profit since 2007, booked 6.96 billion pounds ($8.74 billion) of losses for 2016, against a 1.98 billion pound loss in the same period a year earlier.  Once, albeit briefly, the world's largest bank by assets, RBS is in the midst of a vast, multi-year restructuring which includes asset sales, job cuts and wading through a series of legal scandals.  This is a strong core bank getting masked by all the sins of the past, Chief Executive Ross McEwan said on a conference call with reporters. RBS said 2017 will probably be the final year it makes a loss as it moves nearer to closing the darkest chapter in its 290-year history, which has seen it rack up more than 58 billion pounds in losses so far. The Edinburgh-based lender also announced plans to cut 2 billion pounds of costs over the next four years to help offset the challenge of a low interest rate economy that makes it harder for the bank to make money.  Although RBS did not specify where the cuts would fall they are expected to partly hit its branch network where the lender has already eliminated thousands of roles as more customers bank online. Misconduct Issues Total income was moderately down, with the jump in losses mainly driven by a 5.9 billion charge of misconduct issues relating to its behavior in the run up to the 2007-2009 global financial crisis. RBS took charges to set aside money to cover legal cases in the U.S. where analysts expect it to pay the biggest regulatory penalty in its history for mis-selling U.S. securities backed by toxic mortgage loans. Analysts have estimated the bank could have to pay the U.S. Department of Justice as much as 9 billion pounds this year. McEwan said the bank has not begun negotiations with the U.S. government on any settlement. The shares fell 1.9 percent by 0825 GMT.  RBS was the only British lender to fail the Bank of England's stress test in 2016, a sign of how the bank's future is still being dictated by its past. In some rare good news for RBS, the British government is pushing to free the bank from an obligation to sell its Williams & Glyn business to try to end a seven-year struggle to meet European Union state aid demands.  The bank will not know if the European Commission has approved the new state aid plan until the fourth quarter of this year at the earliest, RBS Chief Financial Officer Ewen Stevenson told reporters.  The British government, which owns more than 70 percent of RBS, has said it will not resume selling its stake until the bank settles its U.S. fine and resolves its state aid requirements.

The move comes as French telecoms operator Orange and its partner Groupama also aim to launch Orange bank in mid-May in France, where the online banking market is dominated by ING Direct, Societe Generale's Boursorama and Credit Mutuel Arkea's Fortuneo. It is also part of Carrefour chief executive Georges Plassat's ambition to step up the company's online expansion, as he looks to cement a turnaround that was initially largely focused on revamping the group's physical store network. Plassat said this month that Carrefour targeted a group business volume of 4 billion euros ($4.3 billion) from E-commerce by 2020 against 1.2 billion in 2016. This service is fully in line with our digital transformation and Carrefour's will to innovate, Carrefour France executive director Noel Prioux told a news conference. Under the offer, a client going to a Carrefour store can buy for 5 euros from April 18 onwards a box coupling a current account managed online to a Mastercard payment card. The account allows no overdraft and is accessible to all regardless of income level or resources. It will cost its user one euro per month. We are launching the first current account distributed in France by a retailer, accessible to all with no income limitations, said Carrefour Banque CEO Julien Jaillon. Carrefour Banque, created in 1981 and 40 percent controlled by BNP Paribas, already offers consumer credit, savings, and insurance services to its 2.5 million clients. The new service, which is targeting tech-savvy people in their 20s and 30s as well as families, will initially be available in more than 3,000 Carrefour stores in France. Similar to the 'Nickel' account launched in late 2014 former SocGen communication official by Hughes Le Bret, which offers consumers accounts that can be opened at tobacco stores with only an ID card and a telephone number, C-zam is also available to people otherwise unable to get mainstream accounts. Jaillon did not provide financial targets for C-zam but said he had big ambitions in terms of volume for a service which he said was the most competitive price-wise in France. Carrefour Banque is following in the tracks of the big traditional French banks, which have boosted their online business to counter both low-cost Internet competitors and a drop in the numbers of clients visiting branches, both of which are denting their profits and forcing them to close outlets. $1 = 0.9264 euros

As many as 200 families have been displaced from their homes, while some civilian casualties have also been reported after Pakistani border troops fired rockets and artillery, according to the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC). Islamic State's regional branch claimed responsibility for a bomb attack on Thursday at a Sufi shrine in Pakistan's Sindh province. The toll in that attack has reached 90 people dead and more than 350 wounded, police said on Monday. Pakistan said militants operating out of eastern Afghanistan were behind the attack. Amid a security crackdown, border crossings were closed and Afghan diplomats were summoned to Pakistan's military headquarters in Islamabad and given a list of 76 most-wanted terrorists that Pakistan said were in Afghanistan and demanded they be captured and handed over, the Pakistani army said. Since then, Pakistan says it has killed over 100 terrorists, including some in camps inside Afghan territory in shelling on Friday and over the weekend.   On the weekend, the Afghan government summoned Pakistan's ambassador to protest against the shelling and to express condolences for the shrine attack. NRC's country director in Afghanistan, Kate O'Rourke, said civilians have been caught in the cross-border firing. Whether indiscriminate or specifically targeted, such attacks forcibly displace civilians, violating international humanitarian law, and must stop, she said in a statement. Afghan officials said a number of special forces had been deployed to the border to counter any Pakistani raids. If they continue their attacks we will respond in kind, said Attahullah Khogyani, a spokesman for Afghanistan's eastern Nangarhar province. In Asadabad, the capital of Afghanistan's Kunar province, also on the border, hundreds of Afghans gathered to protest against Pakistan and to ask foreign governments to put pressure on it. The uneasy neighbors have long traded accusations of harboring anti-government militants. Afghanistan has for years complained that insurgent groups like the Taliban have found sanctuary in Pakistan. Afghanistan's ambassador to Pakistan on Monday handed the Pakistan government a list of insurgents and camps suspected to be in Pakistan. Pakistan's army chief, General Qamar Javed Bajwa, said the two governments would work together to prevent cross-border movement by militant groups, the Pakistani government said in a statement.      On Friday, Afghan officials said government forces backed by international troops had killed two dozen Islamic State fighters in recent operations.  Islamic State forces, meanwhile, killed at least 18 Afghan soldiers at a checkpoint in Nangarhar on Thursday. Reporting by Mirwais Harooni.

The deal, which values Avaloq at more than 1 billion Swiss francs, will give the New York-based firm a 35 percent stake in the Swiss group, the partners said on Wednesday. Banks are turning to outside software providers for help in running core banking operations to cut costs, meet stricter regulations and fend off fintech rivals as they address mercurial consumer expectations. Avaloq -- which has wealth managers, boutique banks and a growing number of global finance groups as clients -- has branched out of late, taking on more of banks' back office work in its own service centres and opening new centres in Singapore and Germany. If you can offer a lower cost of operating and processing because the company does it across more than 150 banks and wealth managers with more innovative products than in-house, then that's a win-win, said Adarsh Sarma, a Warburg Pincus managing director. (Avaloq's) biggest products are focused on wealth management, which is the largest fee generator for banks – it's a bright spot. Rivals such as Temenos have grown rapidly as their clients, focused on conserving capital in the face of falling fees and low interest rates, offload more of their technology and back-end operations. But some have struggled to fulfil expanded commitments after signing major contracts. Avaloq said it had been consolidating its back-office business in early 2016, servicing Deutsche Bank's Asian wealth management and Hong Kong and Singapore offices, as well as six European banks. This deal is about being able in a controlled manner to grow again with a mature partner, a spokeswoman said. Warburg Pincus, with $10 billion of its total $44 billion in private equity under management invested in 90 finance and financial technology (fintech) firms, was once the largest investor in one of the world's biggest banking technology companies, Fidelity Information Services. It pointed to its experience in helping businesses to grow. Their global presence ... combined with their extensive experience in financial services and software and large network in the broader banking and wealth management industry will be invaluable as we enter a new stage in the development of Avaloq and its geographic expansion, Avaloq founder and Chief Executive Francisco Fernandez said in a statement. The group, which generated 533 million Swiss francs in sales last year, said its market is set to keep growing. Fernandez will retain a 28 percent stake in the firm, while staff and management will retain a further 27 percent. The deal is expected to close in the second quarter of 2017 with an investment horizon of seven years. $1 = 0.9934 Swiss francs

The Shanghai-listed company offered 1.04 billion new shares at a fixed price of HK$15.84 each, putting the total deal at HK$16.5 billion ($2.12 billion). Guotai Junan's deal was the largest stock sale in the city since the $7.63 billion IPO of Postal Savings Bank of China in September. Concerns over volatility in China's equity markets and a smaller-than-expected discount to the price of its Shanghai-listed stock curtailed demand for the deal, particularly from retail investors, analysts said. Those mom and pop investors have a significant influence over first-day trading in Hong Kong share offerings. The shares were originally offered at a discount of 25 percent to Guotai Junan's closing price in Shanghai on March 24, but a decline in the shares last week narrowed that discount to about 23 percent. There wasn't much demand from the retail investors, said Jasper Chan, assistant manager of corporate finance at Hong Kong brokerage Phillip Securities, which offers margin loans for retail investors to buy into share offerings in the city. The discount was not quite attractive and the market sentiment is not good at the moment. A fixed-price share offering is unusual, with most deals setting an indicative range before deciding on the final pricing, depending on demand. Guotai Junan did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on the share sale. The company plans to use 30 percent of the share sale proceeds to develop its prime broking and lending business for institutional clients and another 30 percent to open new retail branches and launch financial technology (Fintech) services, it said in the prospectus for the sale. The remainder will be used to expand its asset management and overseas businesses, including potential joint ventures with international firms. Guotai Junan secured $598 million in commitments from cornerstone investors for the share sale, including $388 million from private equity firm Apax Partners and $100 million from real estate investment firm Winland Group. The shares will debut in Hong Kong on April 11. Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs, Shanghai Pudong Development Bank International and Guotai Junan's Hong Kong investment-banking arm - Guotai Junan International - acted as joint sponsors for the deal. Guotai Junan also hired another 16 banks as joint bookrunners for the deal. The banks stand to jointly earn $42 million in fees, equivalent to a 2 percent underwriting commission.

The director of the Battle of Persian Gulf II, Farhad Azima, said that it was a remarkable coincidence that the release of the film - four years in the making - coincided with a warmongering president sitting in the White House.  I hope that the film shows Trump how American soldiers will face a humiliating defeat if they attack Iran, Azima told Reuters in a telephone interview from the city of Mashhad in eastern Iran.  The 88-minute animation opens with the U.S. Army attacking an Iranian nuclear reactor, and the U.S. Navy in the Gulf hitting strategic locations across the county. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), a powerful branch of the Iranian military, retaliates with full force, raining ballistic missiles on the U.S. warships. They all sink and the film ends as the American ships have turned into an aquarium for fishes at the bottom of the sea, Azima said. Trump has said he will not be as kind as his predecessor Barack Obama was to Iran, warning that military options are not off the table in response to Tehran. He has called into doubt Western powers' nuclear deal with Iran and, responding to an IRGC missile test last month, imposed fresh sanctions on Iranian individuals and entities, some of them linked to the Guards. A picture taken from Animation film Battle of Persian Gulf II depicts an armed confrontation between Iran's Revolutionary Guards and the U.S. Navy. Fatima Zahra Animation Studios/Handout via REUTERSCommander Qassem The main Iranian commander in the film has been intentionally depicted as Qassem Soleimani, the IRGC commander who is overseeing Iran's military operations in Syria and Iraq against Islamist militants. Slideshow (4 Images)Azima said he sought to contact Soleimani to ensure he was not against his appearance in the film but did not receive a reply. However, senior figures close to Soleimani asked the director to keep the character but drop the name Qassem in the final edit. Hollywood has created many films against Iran; There are many computer games in which U.S. soldiers conquer our country. We made this film as an answer to that propaganda, the 35-year old director said. But unlike the massive resources available in Hollywood, he said, Fatima Zahra Animation Studios has a small team and a limited budget. He said they have received no funds from the government and are not linked to the IRGC. Our animators are not working for money, but for their beliefs and their love of the country. Thank God, everyone is surprised that we've managed to create such high-quality production under this poor condition, he said. He said screenings will begin as soon as the film gets the necessary permissions from the cultural authorities. The film trailer has already created a buzz on social media, shared by thousands of people. The director believes young Iranians have shown interest to the film as they want someone to show them power of their country. Reporting by Bozorgmehr Sharafedin; Editing by Toby Chopra"

The deal was welcomed by investors with Tesco and Booker's shares soaring 9 percent and 16 percent respectively. However, the transaction will face scrutiny from competition authorities as it will add to Tesco's more than 28 percent share of the overall UK grocery market and more specifically its influence in the convenience, confectionery and tobacco markets. Though Booker only owns a handful of stores, it has over 125,000 retail customers, supplying independent retailers who trade under its Premier, Family Shopper, Budgens and Londis brands. It is also Britain's largest cash and carry operator with over 200 branches. Below are details of the key steps of the regulatory process and the views of the major protagonists: Competition and Markets Authority Britain's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) will consider the deal. Analysts and investors said the complexity of Tesco and Booker's businesses meant unpicking the competition implications was a huge challenge to the CMA's processes and the outcome difficult to predict. They said a lot depended on how the CMA defines the markets the two companies operate in - whether it looks at the UK grocery market as one or splits it between mainstream supermarkets and smaller convenience stores. How an earth is the CMA going to determine the competitive dynamics within and between districts where a (Tesco owned) One-Stop trades against a Premier and Londis?, asked Shore Capital analyst Clive Black.     What about where a Tesco superstore has a (smaller) Premier and Budgens close by or more parochial still, a Tesco Express and a Family Shopper. Initial Engagement The deal was announced on Friday and the CMA will already be poring over the details of Tesco's proposal. We'll engage with them over the next few days and weeks, said Tesco Chief Executive Dave Lewis. Phase 1 Investigation After a short period the CMA will formally confirm the start of a Phase 1 investigation, inviting interested parties to comment. That will be the chance for competing retailers, wholesalers, foodservice providers and their respective supply chains to make their representations. After up to 40 working days the CMA could clear the deal, ask Tesco and Booker to offer undertakings in lieu or concessions to avoid a more detailed Phase 2 investigation, or refer the deal to a Phase 2 probe. Phase 2 Investigation Analysts see referral to an in-depth Phase 2 investigation as inevitable. If that inquiry, which lasts up to 24 weeks, does not find a lessening of competition, the transaction will be cleared. If a lessening of competition is found, the CMA can either seek remedies or block the deal.     Tesco's View Lewis said that as the deal was essentially a retailer and a wholesaler coming together it was not an acquisition of stores and therefore not detrimental to competition. What we think will happen is by coming together ... independent retailers get a better deal here than perhaps they do on a standalone basis, he said. Booker's View Booker CEO Charles Wilson said the deal was pro-competition, with benefits for consumers and customers who will see better choice, prices and service. We've had good advice on this and that's why we think we've got a very compelling story to take them (the CMA) through, he said. Independent Retailers' View Some retailers will welcome this, others will be concerned about competing with stores supplied through the merged Booker and Tesco business, and some will be uneasy at the prospect of working in partnership with one of their biggest historical competitors, said James Lowman, CEO of the Association of Convenience Stores. Completion? Tesco and Booker said they do not expect the deal to become effective until late 2017 or early 2018. That's a big clue that they expect the deal to be referred to a Phase 2 probe.

The local political agent, Ikramullah Khan, said the death toll had reached 22, with 70 wounded. Sajid Hussain, a parliamentarian from Parachinar, said gunfire preceded the blast, which he described as a suicide attack. The city is located in an area with a large Shia population. The attack took place in a busy area and a women's mosque appears to be the target, he said. The banned Islamist militant group Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), often referred to as the Pakistani Taliban, said the blast was part of its operation Ghazi, named after a radical Islamist leader killed by Pakistani security forces in 2007. Following a string of earlier incidents this year, the latest attack adds to fears of an increase in sectarian violence in Pakistan, a nuclear-armed state of some 200 million people. Last month, more than 80 people were killed and dozens wounded in an attack on a crowded Sufi shrine in southern Pakistan that was claimed by Islamic State. In January, at least 21 people were killed when an explosion hit a vegetable market in Parachinar, capital of the Kurram tribal region, where Pakistani security forces have battled militant groups for years.

Wounded Carried in Cars, Ambulances Authorities said a military rescue helicopter had been sent to the scene to help evacuate the injured. Slideshow (3 Images)Mumtaz Hussain, a doctor at the Agency Headquarters Hospital in the region, said five bodies, including a woman and two children, and more than three dozen wounded had been brought to the hospital and an appeal for blood donors had been made. Patients are being brought to us in private cars and ambulances and we have received over three dozen patients so far, Hussain told Reuters.  The attacks have shattered hopes that Pakistan may have come through the militant violence that has scarred its recent history and increased pressure on Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's government to show it was improving security. Sharif condemned Friday's attack and said the government would keep up efforts to eliminate the menace of terrorism. In a statement, he said: The network of terrorists has already been broken and it is our national duty to continue this war until the complete annihilation of the scourge of terrorism from our soil. In the wake of last month's attack in southern Sindh province, security forces launched a major crackdown across Pakistan, killing or detaining hundreds of suspected militants and closing off the border with Afghanistan for several days.

The possible change of plan comes as Deutsche Bank is under the threat of a multi-billion-dollar fine from U.S. regulators which has prompted its management to rethink a year-old strategic overhaul that has made faltering progress, people close to the matter said earlier this month. Deutsche Bank, which bought Postbank in several steps from 2008 for a total of 6 billion euros ($6.5 billion), had earmarked the unit for sale in a bid to shrink its balance sheet. But no serious buyers have emerged and a stock market listing is seen as difficult in the current market. With a Postbank divestment unlikely, the bank's supervisory board is set to discuss alternatives at its Wednesday meeting, including its full integration into Deutsche, the people said. Deutsche Bank and Postbank declined to comment. The move, if agreed, would see Deutsche's Postbank holding dismantled and its Bonn headquarters dissolved. The yellow Postbank brand would be kept and Postbank customers would be serviced by a newly created Deutsche Bank retail banking unit, which would also comprise the so called blue bank, as Deutsche Bank-branded retail operations are known, the sources said. The full integration would not only allow Deutsche Bank to cut overhead functions, reduce the number of branches and cut thousands of jobs, but also secure Deutsche Bank's access to Postbank customers' deposits, the sources said. A statue is pictured next to the logo of Germany's Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt, Germany September 30, 2016.Kai Pfaffenbach/File PhotoWhen Deutsche Bank looked at its retail strategy in 2015, it decided to keep its 'blue bank' after regulators signaled concerns that it would lose billions in deposits, which could drive up the lender's refinancing costs in a potential crisis. The full integration is an option which has a lot of internal backing as the deposits have become much more important, one of the sources said. Banking regulators have already been informed about a potential full integration of Postbank, another of the sources said. Postbank had 148 billion euros in assets as of end-June and posted a net profit of 141 million euros in the first half of 2016. It currently employs almost 19,000 staff. It said in July that it expects a drop in 2016 profit. Some investors have said they would not mind a strategy shift as Postbank has shown a steady flow of earnings. But the credibility of management would take a serious hit, a top ten investor has said. ($1 = 0.9195 euros) Editing by Christoph Steitz and Alexander Smith"
"https://www.reuters.com/article/unicredit-equity-idUSL5N1FK1UU","UniCredit expects 11.8 billion euro loss for 2016, misses capital goal","","January 30, 2017 /  8:12 AM / 6 months ago","","MILAN (Reuters) - UniCredit (CRDI.MI) said it expects to book a net loss of around 11.8 billion euros ($12.6 billion) for 2016 and fall short of European Central Bank capital requirements, highlighting the importance of a planned 13 billion euro rights issue. Italy's biggest bank, which could launch its share sale as early as Feb. 6, said on Monday that its Common Equity Tier 1 ratio (CET1) - a key measure of financial strength - would fall to 8 percent, below a minimum threshold of around 10 percent. This is because the bank expects to book 12.2 billion euros in one-off charges in the fourth quarter - a figure already announced to the market - as it cleans up its balance sheet from a mountain of bad loans. The capital deficit will be fully restored after the rights issue is wrapped up, before March 10, the bank said in a statement. It confirmed it still aimed for a CET1 ratio above 12.5 percent in 2019. The lender, identified by financial regulators as Italy's only globally systemically important bank, said besides the 12.2 billion euros in one-off items, it would also be booking charges of around 1 billion euros to cover writedowns in bank bailout fund Atlante and contributions to the National Resolution Fund. As a result the 2016 Group's estimated net financial result is expected to record a loss of approximately 11.8 billion euros, it said. Excluding the one-off items, the bank would have made a net profit in 2016, it said. In December UniCredit announced 14,000 job cuts and more than 900 branch closures as part of plans by Chief Executive Jean-Pierre Mustier, appointed in July, to turn the bank around. Mustier has repeatedly said the share sale, Italy's biggest ever, and massive balance sheet clean-up had not been requested by regulators. However, in a document published on Monday relating to the cash call, UniCredit said the ECB, in its review of the lender, had found several weaknesses. They included low capital ratios, weak profitability, a high level of bad loans in Italy, big costs in Germany and Austria and risks linked to its exposure to Turkey and Russia.     The bank also said four ECB inspections were currently underway. The ECB has asked UniCredit, among other banks, to present a plan for its bad loans by Feb. 28. The bank said the steps announced in December, which include the sale of bad loans worth 17.7 billion euros, should address the issues raised by the ECB, but warned there was a risk they may not be sufficient.  The ECB's banking supervisory chief, Daniele Nouy, told la Repubblica daily in an interview on Monday that Italy had made scant progress on its banks' problematic loans, which stand at 356 billion euros in gross terms - or a third of the euro zone's total.      UniCredit shares closed down 5.5 percent, underperforming a 1.7 percent fall in the European banking index .SX7P, with traders blaming the approaching share sale for the fall.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-trump-nordstrom-idUSL1N1FZ1OQ","Ethics office urges White House to weigh disciplining Conway","","February 14, 2017 /  7:37 PM / 5 months ago","","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House should consider disciplinary action against presidential adviser Kellyanne Conway for appearing to violate government ethics rules by publicly endorsing Ivanka Trump products, the Office of Government Ethics wrote in a letter made public on Tuesday. The letter, dated Monday and addressed to a White House ethics official, asked President Donald Trump's administration to investigate the incident and gave it two weeks to provide its findings and detail any disciplinary steps taken. Conway, Trump's presidential campaign manager and now a senior counselor, said on Fox News last week that Americans should go buy Ivanka's stuff. She spoke after retailer Nordstrom announced it was dropping the branded line of Ivanka Trump, the president's older daughter. Federal ethics rules prohibit executive branch employees from using their positions to endorse products.     There is strong reason to believe that Ms. Conway has violated the Standards of Conduct and that disciplinary action is warranted, Office of Government Ethics Director Walter Shaub wrote in the letter.  Stefan Passantino, the White House ethics official named in the letter, declined to comment. A White House spokesman did not reply to a request for comment.  The ethics office has little enforcement power. It can formally recommend disciplinary action if the White House does not act, Shaub said in a separate letter to two U.S. lawmakers who sought a review of Conway's remarks. That recommendation would not be binding, and the process would take until late April or early May, Shaub said. If the ethics office does formally recommend discipline, it would be up to the White House to decide any steps against Conway.  Norman Eisen, who was ethics chief under President Barack Obama, said Congress also could call hearings or subpoena documents if the White House did not act. Trump himself earlier attacked Nordstrom for dropping his daughter's brand. The ethics rules that bar endorsements do not apply to the president, though critics said his comments were inappropriate. Nordstrom said it made the decision because sales had steadily declined, especially in the last half of 2016, to where carrying the line didn't make good business sense. In his letter to the White House, Shaub wrote that his office's regulatory guidelines include an example violation in which a hypothetical presidential appointee promotes a product in a television commercial. He said Conway's remarks closely mirrored that example of what not to do. White House spokesman Sean Spicer said on Thursday that Conway had been counseled, but Shaub wrote that the Office of Government Ethics had not been informed of any corrective steps.

Trump warned House Republican lawmakers that he will leave Obamacare in place and move on to tax reform if they do not get behind new healthcare legislation and support it in a vote on Friday. Postponement of the vote from Thursday initially knocked the dollar and stock markets, but the dollar was given breathing space as Treasury yields turned higher after Wall Street shares trimmed losses to close little changed. Equities in Asia took heart and firmed on Friday, with Japan's Nikkei rising 1 percent. The dollar had been sold on the assumption that the healthcare bill would not pass, but some of those positions look to have been unwound. The market focus appears to have shifted to how Trump can pass the bill, from if he can push the bill through, said Bart Wakabayashi, branch manager for State Street Bank and Trust in Tokyo. U.S. yields are higher and it's not hard for dollar/yen to attract bids. It is often overlooked but the dollar continues to enjoy underlying support from widening U.S.-Japanese interest rate spreads. The dollar was up 0.35 percent at 111.340 yen, pulling back from a four-month low of 110.620 struck overnight. The U.S. currency was still on track for a 1.2 percent loss against its the yen this week, during which the safe-haven yen benefited from equity market volatility. The yen has also gained from a scandal involving a land deal that has chipped away support for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. While that may appear counterintuitive, the yen has been a safe-haven of choice even when risk events originate domestically. The currency rallied when a devastating earthquake struck Japan in March 2011 and triggered a nuclear disaster, prompting an intervention by Tokyo to arrest its surge. Vote Wait Continues The healthcare vote, which had been expected to be an early legislative win for Trump, is seen by investors as a litmus test for his ability to work with Congress and push through key policies such as tax reform and infrastructure spending. Even if the bill happens to be passed, any bounce by the dollar is likely to be limited. There are plenty of other issues Trump has to contend with going forward, such as tax reforms, said Ayako Sera, senior market economist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust. The dollar index against a basket of major currencies was up 0.2 percent at 99.941. It was on track to lose 0.35 percent this week, during which it stooped to a seven-week low of 99.547. The euro slipped 0.2 percent to $1.0765. The common currency, which advanced to a seven-week peak of $1.0825 on Wednesday, was headed for a 0.3 percent weekly gain. The pound was down 0.3 percent at $1.2490. It scaled a one-month high of $1.2532 overnight on upbeat British retail sales data. The Australian dollar fell to an eight-day low of $0.7610  following a decline in the price of iron ore, the country's key export product.   (Reporting by Shinichi Saoshiro; Editing by Eric Meijer)"

Putin, who has dominated Russian politics for 17 years, has not said whether he will run in presidential elections in March 2018. But the 64-year-old politician, who enjoys high popularity ratings, is widely expected to do so. Saturday's protest in the capital -- called We're sick of him -- was organized by the Open Russia movement founded by Kremlin critic Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Once Russia's richest man, he was freed by Putin in 2013 after spending a decade in jail for fraud, a charge Khodorkovsky said was politically-motivated. One of hundreds shepherded into a queue behind metal barriers by police before handing over their petitions one-by- one, Anna, a 16-year-old Moscow schoolgirl, said she hoped Putin would get the message and not run again. Nothing positive has happened in our country on his watch and I have the sense that things are getting worse, and that the main problem is the fact that those in power are the same, she  told Reuters. Her preference for president was opposition politician Alexei Navalny, who spent 15 days in jail last month after helping organize the biggest anti-government protests since 2012, which ended with over 1,000 arrests. Saturday's event, held in bright sunshine, was more modest, though authorities were taking no chances. A Reuters reporter counted at least 30 police buses and coaches in the area, packed with hundreds of riot police. Videos posted by Russian media showed police in riot gear detaining protesters in St Petersburg, where activists reported over 100 arrests. There was no official confirmation of the arrests.

Slideshow (4 Images)Irina Glushkova, 64, standing in the same line as the schoolgirl, said she and many others simply didn't agree with how Putin governed. I'm sick of the situation, she said. I'm the same age as Putin and I don't think I'm less intelligent than him, but my opinion is not taken into account at all. Authorities have stepped up pressure on Open Russia in recent days. The General Prosecutor's Office ruled on Wednesday that the activity of Open Russia's British arm was undesirable and accused it and other organizations of trying to discredit the election. On Thursday, police searched the Moscow offices of Open Russia's Russian branch. Activists said they confiscated 100,000 blank appeal forms which the foundation had hoped to hand out to people encouraging them to call for Putin to quit.  On Friday, REN TV, a Russian TV channel, broadcast a documentary about Open Russia activists, some of whom it accused of having criminal records, of being drug addicts, and of cultivating close links with the U.S. government. Activists dismissed the program as a cheap stunt designed to discredit them, with at least one noting that REN TV had somehow obtained video footage stored in his mobile phone.

In the first half of the financial year, the cash earnings of Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) (CBA.AX), Westpac Banking Corp (WBC.AX), National Australia Bank Ltd (NAB) (NAB.AX) and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (ANZ) (ANZ.AX) rose by an average of 6.2 percent to a combined A$15.6 billion ($11.53 billion) on flat revenue, according to a KPMG report. With the exception of ANZ, which is shrinking as it sells low-returning assets, analysts forecast the banks will report record cash profits this financial year and all are expected to report further rises next year. CBA's financial year ends on June 30, but the others use a Sept. 30 year-end. As revenue stagnates and the mortgage business struggles with regulations designed to cool red-hot housing markets in Sydney and Melbourne, the banks' profit growth increasingly depends on cost-cutting and boosting margins.. During the latest round of financial results ending Tuesday with CBA's A$2.4 billion third-quarter profit, bank executives told analysts they were cutting jobs, closing branches and investing in technology to keep a lid on costs. The four major banks' average cost to income ratio on a cash basis fell 160 basis points to 43.41 percent in the first half, which is very low compared with an industry median of 66 percent in the United States and 75 percent in Britain.  Australian lenders have relatively low cost-to-earnings ratios in part because they rely less on higher cost investment banking. Still, ANZ Chief Executive Shayne Elliott believes there is more fat to trim. A Commonwealth Bank of Australia logo adorns the wall of a branch in Sydney, Australia, November 5, 2015.David Gray/File PhotoI believe we are entering a lower-growth environment and our response to that is to be really, really tight with the way that we allocate capital and then the same with costs, Elliott said last week.

The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority has indicated they will need to hold additional capital to be considered unquestionably strong, although the exact amount has yet to be revealed. As compliance costs rise, there also has been political pressure for a far-reaching judicial inquiry into financial sector malpractice following a series of scandals. While fending off those calls, the government has announced a number of measures since last year aimed at alleviating public concerns about the power of the big banks.  On Monday it promised a probe into competition in the industry, which is widely expected to target the banks' wealth divisions.

The militants have effectively lost most of the land they held in the barren, mountainous border region of Jroud Arsal, he added.     As soon as the fighting ends, the Shi'ite Iranian-backed Hezbollah would be ready to hand over territory it has captured if the Lebanese army requests it, he said.

In the outskirts of the Lebanese town of Arsal, the operation has focused on the ex-Nusra Front, al-Qaeda's Syria branch until last year when it severed ties and rebranded. The next phase is expected to target a nearby enclave in the hands of Islamic State militants. The Lebanese army, a big recipient of U.S. and British military support, has not taken part in the offensive and has set up defensive positions around Arsal, which Nasrallah described as essential.  Negotiations began on Tuesday between Lebanese officials and the Nusra Front over the withdrawal of remaining militants to insurgent-held territory in Syria, he also said.  There is seriousness, better than at any previous time, Nasrallah said. But he added that militant demands remained unreasonable and that the Lebanese state, the Syrian government, and Hezbollah must each agree to the terms. Hezbollah has played a major role in fighting militants in the border region during the six-year Syrian war, along with critical military support it has provided to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. On the Syrian side of the border, Hezbollah fought shoulder to shoulder with the Syrian army around the town of Fleita in recent days and cleared the area of insurgents, Nasrallah said. Hezbollah fighters pray at Juroud Arsal, Syria-Lebanon border, July 25, 2017.Mohamed AzakirSecurity sources say some two dozen Hezbollah fighters have been killed overall, and nearly 150 militants. Refugee Camps Early in the offensive, Saraya Ahl al-Sham - the FSA rebel faction that had a small presence in the area - pulled its fighters from the front lines, Nasrallah said. The rebels took charge of protecting nearby refugee camps.     We facilitated this, he said. We are ready to work with the Lebanese state and the Syrian government on the withdrawal of the rebel faction to Syria. Slideshow (4 Images)Since the onset of the Syrian conflict, nearly 1.5 million refugees have poured into Lebanon - around a quarter of its population - where most languish in severe poverty. Several thousand refugees live in makeshift camps east of Arsal. The Lebanese army has been helping with the passage of refugees fleeing the recent clashes at the border, with United Nations supervision, according to a security source. The International Rescue Committee said around 390 people, mostly Syrian women and children, escaped to Arsal so far, many of them visibly shaken. Nasrallah said fighters were proceeding cautiously because of the proximity of the refugee camps. The border offensive had been in the works for months and Hezbollah asked the Syrian army to help after deciding to launch the battle, he said. Hezbollah's role in the Syrian conflict has drawn criticism from its Lebanese political opponents, including Sunni leader and Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri. During a state visit by Hariri this week, U.S. President Donald Trump called Hezbollah a threat to Lebanon from within and a menace to the region.    Nasrallah said on Wednesday he would not respond to Trump's comments in order not to embarrass the official Lebanese delegation to Washington.

    By Vijaykumar Vedala
    May 31 (Reuters) - Gold held steady on Wednesday but was set
for its first monthly drop since December as U.S. economic data
boosted the case for an interest rate hike by the Federal
Reserve next month.  
    U.S. consumer spending recorded its biggest increase in four
months in April and monthly inflation rebounded, pointing to
improving domestic demand that could allow the Fed to raise
interest rates next month.             
    Spot gold        was almost flat at $1,262.90 per ounce at
0757 GMT after slipping earlier in the day. It closed 0.3
percent lower on Tuesday after rising to a one-month high of
$1,270.47. For the month, bullion is down 0.4 percent.
    U.S. gold futures         were unchanged at $1,261.80.
    Gold moved in a pretty tight range... Traders are waiting
on the sidelines ahead of the U.S. employment and non-farm
payroll data due on Friday, said Luke Chua, chief operating
officer at BullionStar Singapore.
    A U.S. rate hike is probably coming soon though the Federal
Reserve may want to delay if inflation remains soft, Fed
governor Lael Brainard said on Tuesday.              
    Interest rate futures on Tuesday indicated a nearly 89
percent chance of a June hike, according to CME Group's FedWatch
tool. 
    Higher rates would reduce the demand for non-interest
bearing bullion as well as boosting the U.S. dollar in which
gold is priced. 
    Political tensions in the United States and Europe continue
to support gold and have prevented any major losses for the
metal, said Yuichi Ikemizu, Tokyo branch manager at ICBC
Standard Bank.
    British Prime Minister Theresa May could lose control of
parliament in June 8 election, according to a projection by
polling company YouGov.             
    In Italy, the 5-Star Movement voted over the weekend in
favour of a proportional electoral system, raising the chances
of an unprecedented autumn parliamentary election.             
    Spot gold        may break a support at $1,257 per ounce and
fall to the next support at $1,245, according to Reuters
technical analyst Wang Tao.             
    The extended short term long positioning and a lack of
upside momentum may be signalling that a correction lower may be
on the cards, said Jeffrey Halley, a senior market analyst at
OANDA. 
    In other precious metals, silver        slipped 0.3 percent
to $17.32 an ounce though it was up 0.6 percent for the month. 
    Platinum        was up 0.9 percent at $942.60 an ounce after
falling 1.9 percent in the previous session in its biggest
one-day percentage loss in nearly a month.  
    Palladium        was up 0.5 percent at $808.65 an ounce and
was on track for a monthly decline of 2 percent, its first
monthly decline this year.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-banks-switzerland-idUSKBN18Z237","Credit Suisse to cut jobs as it pares back in London","","June 8, 2017 /  3:02 PM / in 2 months","","ZURICH (Reuters) - Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) is to cut roughly 1,500 jobs in London by the end of next year, according to a person familiar with the matter, part of the Swiss bank's efforts to cut costs globally. The cutbacks come as the bank's Zurich neighbor UBS (UBSG.S), the world's largest private bank, also considers moving hundreds of staff out of London as Britain prepares to embark on divorce talks with the European Union. UBS and Credit Suisse joined big U.S. investment banks in setting up their European headquarters in London, giving them access to the European Union market. But now Brexit is forcing the Swiss and others to seek alternatives. For Credit Suisse (CSGN.S), the job cuts, which will take its London staff to roughly 5,000, is part of a paring down of its London operations that began in 2015 as the bank restructured under Chief Executive Tidjane Thiam. One Credit Suisse executive said privately that high bonuses and the cost of doing business in the British capital made it difficult for Credit Suisse to turn a profit on its London operation. Brexit, he said, reinforced the determination to act.  A Credit Suisse spokeswoman said the investment bank as a whole had strong profit growth and that the program of company-wide job cuts was most advanced in London. The bank does not provide a breakdown for the performance of its London operations.  The scale of the London cuts reflects a change in approach towards Europe's biggest financial center. Before it embarked on its cutbacks, Credit Suisse employed more than 9,000 staff and contractors in the city. For the Swiss banks, it was always important to be in London, not least to be close to your wealthy customers, Andreas Venditti, an analyst at Swiss bank Vontobel, said. With Brexit, London has certainly lost some significance. For Credit Suisse, which was under pressure to cut costs anyway, as well as UBS, the timing is fortunate. Brexit is a good opportunity. The scaling back in London coincides with a shift in focus by both UBS and Credit Suisse towards Asia, the region with the fastest-growing number of millionaires. Other European centres could also benefit. Credit Suisse, which already has operations in Poland, opened a branch in Dublin more than a year ago, while UBS could bolster its base in Frankfurt. But UBS is biding its time in London until the end of this year before making any decisions on staff moves, one senior executive said, redoubling lobbying efforts for the status quo in finance to remain after Brexit. It expects roughly 1,000 staff in City of London may have to move after Brexit. But the number could be higher. Its chief executive Sergio Ermotti said up to 30 percent of its roughly 5,400 employees in London could be affected. If Britain's EU departure is abrupt and with no trading agreement in place to cover finance, one senior UBS employee, who asked not to be named, said the Swiss bank could be forced to move the majority of its London staff. Having earlier declined to comment, UBS said that was not correct.  Swiss bankers are still hoping for a smooth Brexit but frustration is growing over the lack of clarity so far. Earlier this year, Ermotti criticized the British government for failing to reassure banks.  The UK, he said is not really helping.

At a 'feel-good' party conference, leader Martin Schulz accused Merkel of silencing debate on issues like pensions and failing to stand up to the United States. The SPD surged in the polls after naming Schulz as leader in late January, overtaking Merkel's conservatives in some, but those gains have now evaporated and the party is struggling to regain momentum. An Emnid poll on Sunday showed Merkel's conservatives widening their lead to 15 points. In an 80-minute speech before the party agreed its policy manifesto, Schulz, a former president of the European Parliament, was most passionate on Europe. Merkel and (Finance Minister Wolfgang) Schaeuble were very firm when it came to policies like austerity in Europe but you hear little to nothing from them about the rule of law and democracy in the EU, he said, taking aim at Hungary and Poland. Related CoverageFactbox: Investment, social justice top SPD's German election programHe said the SPD aimed to strengthen Europe by stressing the values of human dignity and by investing in innovation.  The chances of denying Merkel a fourth term look slim for the SPD, who are currently junior partners in her right-left coalition, but some have been inspired by the resurgence by Britain's Labour party under Jeremy Corbyn in a June 8 vote.  What we can learn from the British is that we won't let ourselves be depressed by polls. We will fight for our own convictions, SPD General-Secretary Hubertus Heil told Reuters. German Chancellor candidate Martin Schulz of the Social Democratic party (SPD) delivers his speech at the party convention in Dortmund, Germany, June 25, 2017.Wolfgang RattayLike Corbyn, Schulz has succeeded to some extent in appealing to younger voters. Some 40 percent of members who have joined since Schulz's nomination are under 35, says Jusos, the youth branch of the SPD.  Despite a roller-coaster few months, delegates of all ages said they felt energized by Schulz. Martin Schulz spoke in a very committed way, very inspiring, delegate Frank Boermann from Berlin told Reuters. He's managed to lift the party again. Slideshow (13 Images)But the reality of having lost power in two state elections and failing to win in a third this year has knocked morale   despite the cheers and red flags emblazoned with Time for Martin Schulz slogans evident in Dortmund on Sunday. With a sharp fall in the number of refugees arriving in Germany, many voters have forgiven Merkel for her open-door migrant policy and see her as a safe pair of hands. To have any chance of winning in September, the SPD needs to mobilize traditional supporters, who have either not voted or shifted allegiance in the past few years. To that end, Schulz has focused much of his campaign on social justice. He wants to reduce taxes for low-and middle earners, keep pensions stable, extend free education and invest more in infrastructure.  He won a standing ovation for saying he would not sign a coalition deal unless it included a commitment to gay marriage. He has, however, disappointed some on the left by refusing to commit to a wealth tax. To defuse an embarrassing showdown on Sunday, the party is appointing a commission to look into it. The SPD even wheeled out ex-chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, the last Social Democrat to lead Germany, to boost morale. He said they could still win and reminded them of the SPD's fightback to run Merkel close in the 2005 election - the last one he fought.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eurozone-banks-unicredit-cash-call-idUSKBN14V1BA","Aabar set to invest in UniCredit's share sale: sources","","January 11, 2017 /  11:35 AM / in 7 months","","MILAN/ABU DHABI (Reuters) - Abu Dhabi investor Aabar Investments is set to buy more shares in UniCredit (CRDI.MI) in the Italian bank's upcoming 13 billion-euro ($14 billion) share offer, Italy's biggest ever cash call, three sources said on Wednesday. UniCredit, the country's largest bank by assets, will launch the share offer next month to boost its capital base as it embarks on a restructuring plan under new CEO Jean Pierre Mustier. UniCredit has already found a group of banks ready to mop up any unsold shares, unlike rival Monte dei Paschi di Siena (BMPS.MI) which last month had to be rescued by Italy's government after failing to find buyers for its stock. A successful capital raising would be an important sign of market confidence in Italy's battered banking system, weighed down by bad loans and low profitability. Mustier last month unveiled a plan to shift 17.7 billion euros in bad debts off UniCredit's balance sheet, cut 14,000 jobs and close 944 branches by the end of 2019. One of the three sources familiar with the matter said Aabar had confidence in UniCredit's strategy and would buy new shares to keep its stake unchanged. Given the cash call's size, Aabar would need to invest around 650 million euros to maintain its 5 percent stake that makes it UniCredit's second-biggest shareholder behind U.S. investor Capital Research and Management Company. Aabar and UniCredit declined to comment. A fourth source said on Wednesday the bank was set to launch its capital increase soon after approving full-year earnings on Feb. 9. Separately, two sources confirmed a report in daily Il Messaggero saying the bank could sell new shares at a 30-40 percent discount to the theoretical price of the stock when excluding subscription rights. The new shares could be sold at around 1.2-1.3 euros each before a planned reverse stock split, the sources said, adding however the bank had made no final decision on pricing yet. By 1219 GMT (7:19 a.m. ET) shares in UniCredit fell 2.5 percent to 2.61 euros. Mustier, a French investment banker formerly at Societe Generale, arrived at UniCredit in July to oversee a capital strengthening and a streamlining of its operations after capital worries had dogged the Italian bank for years. He immediately started selling assets including Polish subsidiary Bank Pekao PEO.WA and asset manager Pioneer Investments.  The possibility that a slimmed-down UniCredit could become a takeover target has raised alarm in Rome after France's Vivendi (VIV.PA) became the top investor in former monopolist Telecom Italia (TLIT.MI) and aggressively built a large stake in broadcaster Mediaset (MS.MI). Both UniCredit and Societe Generale (SOGN.PA) in November declined to comment on rumors of a possible merger. The head of the Lower House Budget Committee Francesco Boccia on Wednesday told Radio24 there was a French plan to take over UniCredit. There is a design to make UniCredit French, Boccia said.  One of the sources familiar with UniCredit's share issue said a merger deal for the bank was a concrete possibility once Mustier had completed his job.

China's biggest lender by number of branches is now planning to price the IPO between HK$4.76 and HK$4.86 per share, Thomson Reuters publication IFR reported, citing people close to the deal. It had marketed the 12.1 billion new shares on offer in a range of HK$4.68–$5.18. PSBC declined to comment on its IPO pricing. The bank originally sought to raise up to HK$63 billion  ($8.1 billion), counting on its network of more than 40,000 branches and low level of non-performing loans to ask for a valuation higher than Chinese rivals. But many fund managers saw its valuations as too pricey. Its initial marketing range had valued the bank at a price-to-book ratio for 2016 of 0.94 to 1.02 times, far higher than the average of 0.76 for Hong Kong-listed banks. The price to book is relatively high, said Jasper Chan, assistant manager of corporate finance at Hong Kong brokerage Phillip Securities, which offers margin loans for retail investors to buy into IPOs in the city. Most of the banks are now trading below book, so it's not a good investment in the short term. Longer term, some clients may want to hold it because they think the bank will grow. Retail investor demand for margin loans to buy into PSBC's IPO totaled HK$83 million through Monday at Phillip Securities. By comparison, the $18 million listing of contractor Shun Wo Group Holdings Ltd (1591.HK) had HK$5.9 billion worth of margin loans at the brokerage. PSBC secured orders worth up to $5.86 billion from a group of six cornerstone investors, nearly three-quarters of the total IPO, signaling weak demand from a broad range of institutional investors. That would put it near the record 77 percent cornerstone tranche for the $810 million listing of China Development Bank Financial Leasing Co Ltd (1606.HK) in July. Cornerstone investors buy big chunks of IPOs on a preferential basis in exchange for pledging not to sell the shares for at least six months.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/fitch-affirms-chinas-5-state-banks-at-a-idUSFit997462","Fitch Affirms China's 5 State Banks at 'A'; Outlook Stable","","May 23, 2017 /  8:15 AM / 2 months ago","","(The following statement was released by the rating agency) HONG KONG/TAIPEI, May 23 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has today affirmed the Long-Term Foreign-Currency Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) of China's five large state-owned commercial banks at 'A' with Stable Outlooks. The Short-Term IDRs were affirmed at 'F1'. A full list of rating actions is at the end of this rating action commentary. The five banks are: Agricultural Bank of China Limited (ABC), Bank of China Ltd. (BOC), Bank of Communications Co., Ltd. (BOCOM), China Construction Bank Corporation (CCB) and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Limited (ICBC). KEY RATING DRIVERS IDRS, SENIOR DEBT, SUPPORT RATINGS AND SUPPORT RATING FLOORS All of the Long-Term IDRs are based on state support, and are at the banks' Support Rating Floors, reflecting an extremely high probability of extraordinary support from the central government in the event of stress. The banks' Support Ratings (SR) of '1' and Support Rating Floors (SRF) of 'A' reflect their systemic importance and thus an extremely high propensity for the state to support them, if required. Combined, the state-owned commercial banks account for around 38% of sector assets domestically at the end of March 2017 and are viewed as pivotal to the financing of China's economy. The state banks' market shares have been declining over the past few years due to rapid non-loan asset growth at other Chinese commercial banks, in particular joint-stock and city commercial banks, but they remain systemically important to the state in Fitch's view. Fitch believes the state banks continue to play significant roles in supporting domestic growth as well as major roles in financing activities abroad, including expansion by Chinese corporates and infrastructure projects supporting strategic government initiatives, such as the One Belt One Road development plan. Fitch expects tighter market liquidity in 2017, which is aimed at reducing leverage by increasing relative borrowing costs for those entities most exposed to non-loan and non-bank credit. As net liquidity providers, the state banks should benefit from a more favourable outlook for net interest margin. The average corporate borrowing rate for the sector has already increased 19bp since the end of 2016 to 5.63% in March 2017. Although the Chinese authorities have not provided further clarification over domestic systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs), Fitch expects all the state banks to be designated as domestic SIFIs; four of them (ABC, BOC, CCB and ICBC) are already designated as global SIFIs. The central government is ultimately the largest shareholder of all the five state banks, and has a track record of providing solvency and asset-quality support to the banks. Consequently, the banks' SRFs remain closely linked to China's sovereign rating (A+/Stable). As support is not expected to diminish in the foreseeable future, the Outlook on their IDRs remains Stable, unless there is any change to the sovereign rating, which may imply changes in the state's ability or propensity to support the banking system. VIABILITY RATINGS The Viability Ratings (VRs) of China's state banks are in the 'bb' category and remain the highest in the sector. Reduced economic headwinds support the near-term outlook for the state banks, and Fitch expects the banks to be less impacted by changes in regulations or economic challenges given how credit and risks have shifted within the system over the past few years. Relative to other Chinese commercial banks, the state banks generally exhibit superior funding and liquidity, smaller credit exposure and off-balance-sheet activities, and higher loss-absorption capacity. Furthermore, the state banks would likely benefit most from depositor flight to safety, which will provide some support to their VRs in a stress scenario. The state banks are also more likely to act as temporary liquidity providers on behalf of the authorities, if required, where certain parts of the system were under greater liquidity stress. These trends continue to support the higher VRs for state banks relative to other Chinese commercial banks, and Fitch expects greater differentiation in the state banks' financial performances in the future. Financial metrics typically are influenced by the operating environment, which has been negative for some time. This can give rise to heightened challenges to maintain financial stability, but support from various government levels have contributed to the banks reporting financial profiles that compare well with those of many banks in developed markets, although not as well against the profiles of some large banks in emerging markets. The availability of ordinary support from the government and China's deposit-funded banking system give the authorities greater flexibility to work through China's debt problem at their own pace. Recognition of greater asset impairment may only come after the sector has built up further buffers, credit or economic growth is deemed sustainable by China's authorities, or the system is viewed as less vulnerable to contagion. Fitch's analysis of asset quality focuses more on loss-absorption buffers (including factors such as capitalisation, loan-loss reserve coverage, and profitability) than on reported NPL ratios, given the limitations on sector-wide data disclosure and transparency, as well as the significant amount of non-loan credit and the frequency of regulatory intervention to support borrowers. On average, the five state banks had loss-absorption buffers equivalent to around 8% of credit based on end-2016 data  (overall Fitch-rated commercial banks in China: around 6%), which show the level of deterioration they can withstand before some form of remedial action would be likely to be required to restore capital to a sustainable level. The magnitude of these buffers has not changed much from the previous review given the state banks have more stable near-term credit growth relative to other commercial banks in China. China's banking system has been accumulating large off-balance-sheet exposures, including through transactions with non-banks, and it is not always clear in such transactions with whom ultimate risks resides. However, the state banks are considered to be less exposed to such activities than other Chinese commercial banks. In addition, entrusted investments, which represent the banks' investments in asset- and wealth-management product plans, made up around 1% of assets for state banks at end-2016, compared with around 19% for mid-tier banks, Fitch estimates. Short tenors, asset-liability mismatches and limited disclosure of underlying assets associated with these investments may pose liquidity risk to the banks, but Fitch expects such risks to be more manageable by the state banks relative to the smaller banks. The state banks' reported profitability is likely to be under less pressure in 2017 than in 2016, as near-term asset quality still benefits from the government's stimulus efforts in 2016. NPL write-offs and disposals also helped in containing reported NPL figures and Fitch expects this to continue in the current year. The state banks' reported provision coverage on average at end-1Q17 reached around 166% with NPL ratio of 1.6%. Fitch expects the authorities to continue to provide support to help resolve underlying problematic credit over the medium term. The five state banks are the best-capitalised in the system; their reported core capital ratios are stable and are above the regulatory minimum. However, their capital may not be sufficient, given the build-up of risk across the financial system as profitability comes under pressure and reduces internal capital generation. In the short term, increased lending to mortgages and investments in local government bonds should slow risk-weighted asset growth (given their lower risk-weights) relative to overall asset growth, which should help support reported capital ratios. SENIOR DEBT AND SUBORDINATED NOTES The senior debt instruments are rated in line with the banks' IDRs of 'A', as they are considered to be unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the banks. The Tier 2 subordinated (Basel III compliant) note ratings are in accordance with Fitch's hybrid securities criteria, and reflect expectations that the authorities will extend support to the banks to prevent the triggering of non-viability clauses. As such, the anchor rating is the banks' IDRs. However, since the notes are to be fully written down if non-viability is triggered, they are notched twice from the IDRs. SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANIES Amipeace Limited is a wholly owned special purpose vehicle (SPV) of Bank of China Group Investment Limited in Hong Kong. Azure Orbit II International Finance Limited is an offshore SPV managed by Bank of Communications Financial Leasing Co., Ltd (BOCOM Leasing; A/Stable), a wholly owned subsidiary of BOCOM. ABCL Glory Capital Limited is an offshore SPV wholly owned by ABC Leasing International Corporation Limited (ABCLI), but under the management control of ABC Financial Leasing Corporation Limited (ABC Leasing). Both ABCLI and ABC Leasing are wholly owned subsidiaries of ABC. Inventive Global Investments Limited is an offshore SPV wholly owned by ABC International Holdings Limited (ABCI), which is also a wholly owned subsidiary of ABC. All the SPVs were established with the sole purpose of undertaking offshore debt issuance of their parent entities. As wholly owned subsidiaries, Fitch expects these SPVs to receive very strong support from their ultimate parents in the mainland in the event of repayment strains. In fact, current senior debt issuance by Amipeace Limited is guaranteed by BOC's Macau branch, while Azure Orbit II International Finance Limited's debt is guaranteed by BOCOM's Macau branch. The senior debt issuance by ABCL Glory Capital Limited and Inventive Global Investments Limited are guaranteed by ABC's Hong Kong branch. Hence, the Long- and Short-Term Ratings of these instruments are derived from their parents' at 'A' and 'F1' ratings, respectively. RATING SENSITIVITIES IDRS, SENIOR DEBT, SUPPORT RATINGS AND SUPPORT RATING FLOORS Any changes to the IDRs, SRs and SRFs are most likely to be tied to shifts in the central government's propensity or ability to provide timely extraordinary support to these banks. Persistent rapid growth across the financial system (including non-bank credit extension) means that potential claims on the state continue to increase, and there may be potential erosion of the state's ability to support the banks. However, Fitch believes that absent any negative action on the sovereign rating, support for the state banks is less likely to diminish than would be the case for other Chinese commercial banks. It remains unclear how the adherence to a state-controlled status, as stipulated in BOCOM's ownership reform plans, would affect state support for the state banks. For the time being, the agency does not expect the state's propensity to support the state banks to reduce significantly as long as the banks remain highly influenced by the state (including influence from authorities to extend credit in support of public policy). VIABILITY RATINGS Asset quality is currently a high influencing factor for the VRs of these banks. Credit continues to build up within the financial system and we expect asset-quality pressures to remain, although reduced economic headwinds, if sustained, could help lower the pressures in the short term. Risks within the system have increasingly migrated towards the second- and third-tier banks, and as a result the state banks are likely to be better positioned in a sustained economic downturn. There are also some early signs of stronger enforcement of risk-management regulations, particularly with regard to shadow-banking activities, including broader credit monitoring under the Macro Prudential Assessment (MPA), which incorporates wealth management products (WMP) as part of credit. This may lead to improvements in governance and transparency over time and enable regulators to better quantify and manage systemic risk, which Fitch regards as potentially credit positive for China's financial system. VR upgrades for the state banks are possible if Fitch considers the operating environment to be less of a rating constraint than it has in the past. This would likely be evidenced by greater certainty over regulators' commitment to contain financial risks over growth priorities, credit growth being more sustainable, off-balance-sheet activities reducing or being less of a concern (including due to greater transparency around such activities), greater confidence that reported asset-quality ratios will hold, or the banks having improved loss-absorption capacity (building risk buffers, such as raising of additional capital) or strengthened deposit funding and liquidity. The state banks have made improvements in some of these areas, for example, there are signs of more stable credit growth. However, the resilience of such improvements has yet to be proven if more asset impairment is recognised, or if credit growth accelerates in response to policy actions to support economic growth. The VRs may be downgraded in the absence of willingness by the authorities to maintain stability and allowing risks to become more binding constraints, for example, further excessive on- and off-balance sheet growth rendering capital more vulnerable to deterioration, asset quality deterioration undermining solvency, or funding and liquidity strains. Although much of the sector benefits from a degree of ordinary support from the Chinese authorities in the form of forbearance, whether in relation to on- or off-balance sheet exposures or strict interpretation of prudential limits, the state banks arguably benefit most. However, if this support was to reduce, the state banks' VRs could come under pressure as vulnerabilities would become further exposed. SENIOR DEBT AND SUBORDINATED NOTES The ratings on the senior debt instruments and subordinated notes are primarily sensitive to a change in the banks' IDRs.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-wells-fargo-accounts-california-idUSKCN12J2O9","California launches criminal probe into Wells Fargo account scandal","","October 19, 2016 /  9:22 PM / 9 months ago","","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The California Attorney General's Office has launched a criminal investigation into Wells Fargo (WFC.N) over allegations it opened millions of unauthorized customer accounts and credit cards, according to a seizure warrant seen by Reuters. Attorney General Kamala Harris authorized a seizure warrant against the bank that seeks customer records and other documents, saying there is probable cause to believe the bank committed felonies. The probe marks the latest setback for the bank in a growing scandal that led to the abrupt retirement of its chief executive officer, monetary penalties, compensation clawbacks, lost business and damage to its reputation. Wells Fargo spokesman Mark Folk did not immediately provide a comment in response to requests from Reuters, but was quoted in the Los Angeles Times as saying the bank is cooperating in providing the requested information. A spokeswoman for the California Department of Justice said she could not comment on the probe. The bank's downward spiral kicked into high gear last month. Related CoverageWells scandal shows bank culture still a problem: Fed's DudleyThe U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and other regulators ordered the United States' third-largest bank by assets to pay $190 million in fines and restitution to settle civil charges that its branch staff created as many as 2 million accounts without customers' knowledge in order to meet internal sales targets. The CFPB said that high pressure sales tactics and financial incentives fueled the fraud, which was largely carried out by low-level branch employees. About 5,300 of those employees were fired. Shortly after the civil settlement was made public, CEO John Stumpf was called to testify before Congress. Observers have widely criticized his performance, with many saying he appeared ill-prepared to deal with tough questioning by lawmakers including Massachusetts Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren, who called for his resignation and accused him of him gutless leadership. A Wells Fargo Bank is shown in Charlotte, North Carolina, U.S., September 26, 2016.Mike BlakeLast week, Stumpf resigned and was replaced by Chief Operating Officer Tim Sloan. This is at least the second criminal probe to be opened into Wells Fargo since last month. In September a source told Reuters that federal prosecutors are also looking into the matter. An affidavit filed by Special Agent Supervisor James Hirt with the California Department of Justice reveals that interviews with possible victims of the fraud have already started. One victim, identified only as Ms. B, told the investigator that she had declined a request by a Wells Fargo teller in late 2011 or 2012 to open new accounts.  But sometime in late 2013 or early 2014, she started to receive notices that she and her husband allegedly owned on three life insurance policies held by the bank, the affidavit says. She also told the investigator that Wells Fargo often claimed that her accounts had to be closed and reopened because of problems that it could never fully explain. The constant changes, she added, sometimes caused her to incur fees because her checks would bounce. Another alleged victim, identified as Ms. C, told the investigator she noticed the bank was transferring money from her checking account to her savings account in amounts that grew over time, from $50 to $150.  The bank claimed the transfers were done as overdraft protection, but it refused to provide her bank statements when she asked to see them. The seizure warrants by the state are seeking a variety of documents from Wells Fargo, including a list of all unauthorized California customer accounts created between May 2011 and July 2015. It also seeks information about fees, charges and other costs that were incurred and the identity of all Wells Fargo employees that may have opened the accounts. Reporting by Sarah N.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-treasury-saudi-charity-idUSKCN11M2GQ","U.S. removes defunct Saudi-linked American charity from blacklist","","September 16, 2016 /  10:55 PM / 10 months ago","","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Friday removed a defunct charity with links to Saudi Arabia from its sanctions blacklist as part of a settlement with the charity that ends a lengthy dispute arising from claims that it funneled money to terrorists, the Treasury Department said. The U.S. decision in 2004 to blacklist the Oregon-based Al Haramain Islamic Foundation sparked a legal battle in which the charity's lawyers accused the government of hiding behind classified evidence and national security claims to shut down a legitimate charity.  The case, and others in the years after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the United States, concerned civil liberties advocates, who accused the U.S. government of using overly broad authorities, opaque procedures and secret evidence to close Islamic charities. According to court records, lawyers for Al Haramain realized the government was monitoring legally privileged communications with their client when the government accidentally gave them a Top Secret document related to the surveillance. A Treasury spokeswoman said in a statement on Friday that its Office of Foreign Assets Control delisted Al Haramain's U.S. branch after the charity had agreed to dissolve. Foreign branches of Al Haramain, including in Somalia, Bosnia and Kenya, remain on the blacklist. The decision is an acknowledgement that there was no basis to designate them in the first place, said Lynne Bernabei, a lawyer for the organization. Saudi officials had no immediate comment on the Treasury decision, but Riyadh has said that it has cracked down on terrorism finance. Allegations about Saudi Arabia's role in funding terrorism have come under renewed focus this year. In July, Congress released a long-classified section of the official report on the Sept. 11 airplane attacks, describing potential links between some of the hijackers and Saudi officials. The report said information from the Federal Bureau of Investigation showed the al-Haramain Islamic Foundation (HIF) has clear ties to the Saudi Government, and intelligence reporting suggests it is providing financial and logistical support to al-Qa'ida. The report said Al Haramain had established a U.S. office in Oregon in 1993, which it said received about $700,000 from parent offices in Saudi Arabia. The U.S. government froze the Oregon charity's assets in February 2004 pending investigation, and later named it a specially designated global terrorist, blacklisting it in September 2004 and claiming it was a U.S. branch of the Saudi organization. The Oregon charity's lawyers argued it was not a subsidiary of any other organization, but did distribute publications and receive donations from the Saudi charity. The lawyers argued that the government had refused to provide the charity with specific charges or a summary of the classified evidence it claimed to have, and failed to provide probable cause before it froze the group's assets. A U.S. appeals court found in 2011 that the government had enough evidence to blacklist the Oregon charity, but had violated the group's due process rights by not disclosing the evidence against it and failing to provide reasons for its investigation. A spokesman for the Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Reporting by Yeganeh Torbati; Editing by John Walcott and Leslie Adler"
"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-deutsche-bank-postbank-idUSKCN12P1J8","Deutsche Bank could integrate Postbank in strategic u-turn: sources","","October 25, 2016 /  11:56 AM / 9 months ago","","FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) is considering a u-turn in its retail banking strategy and may opt for a full integration of its Postbank (DEUPF.PK) operations instead of a sale, three people close to the bank said. The possible change of plan comes as Deutsche Bank is under the threat of a multi-billion-dollar fine from U.S. regulators which has prompted its management to rethink a year-old strategic overhaul that has made faltering progress, people close to the matter said earlier this month. Deutsche Bank, which bought Postbank in several steps from 2008 for a total of 6 billion euros ($6.5 billion), had earmarked the unit for sale in a bid to shrink its balance sheet. But no serious buyers have emerged and a stock market listing is seen as difficult in the current market. With a Postbank divestment unlikely, the bank's supervisory board is set to discuss alternatives at its Wednesday meeting, including its full integration into Deutsche, the people said. Deutsche Bank and Postbank declined to comment. The move, if agreed, would see Deutsche's Postbank holding dismantled and its Bonn headquarters dissolved. The yellow Postbank brand would be kept and Postbank customers would be serviced by a newly created Deutsche Bank retail banking unit, which would also comprise the so called blue bank, as Deutsche Bank-branded retail operations are known, the sources said. The full integration would not only allow Deutsche Bank to cut overhead functions, reduce the number of branches and cut thousands of jobs, but also secure Deutsche Bank's access to Postbank customers' deposits, the sources said. A statue is pictured next to the logo of Germany's Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt, Germany September 30, 2016.Kai Pfaffenbach/File PhotoWhen Deutsche Bank looked at its retail strategy in 2015, it decided to keep its 'blue bank' after regulators signaled concerns that it would lose billions in deposits, which could drive up the lender's refinancing costs in a potential crisis. The full integration is an option which has a lot of internal backing as the deposits have become much more important, one of the sources said. Banking regulators have already been informed about a potential full integration of Postbank, another of the sources said. Postbank had 148 billion euros in assets as of end-June and posted a net profit of 141 million euros in the first half of 2016. It currently employs almost 19,000 staff. It said in July that it expects a drop in 2016 profit. Some investors have said they would not mind a strategy shift as Postbank has shown a steady flow of earnings. But the credibility of management would take a serious hit, a top ten investor has said. ($1 = 0.9195 euros) Editing by Christoph Steitz and Alexander Smith"

The bank said it booked 100 million euros in impairment charges in the third quarter, bringing the nine-month total to 400 million euros, to strengthen its coverage of non-performing loans to 99 percent from 91 percent a year ago. CEO Nuno Amado said 2016 was absolutely unusual in terms of impairments, which should not happen again. The bank's fully-implemented common equity Tier 1 ratio, a measure of its capital strength, also fell to 9.5 percent from 10 percent a year ago. Capital levels at Portuguese banks have been a cause of concern to investors as the country's banking system, saddled with debt and bad loans, is still reeling from two bank rescues by the state in 2014 and 2015. BCP is negotiating with Fosun Group, China's biggest private conglomerate, over its offer to buy a sizeable stake in the Portuguese bank, which should give a welcome capital boost. In July, Fosun made a firm offer to buy a 16.7 percent stake in BCP via a dedicated capital increase and might boost that holding to 30 percent later.  Earlier on Wednesday, shareholders decided to postpone to Nov. 21 a vote on increasing a voting rights cap to 30 percent from 20 percent, which is a key condition of Fosun's offer. Amado said the delay was due to the ongoing talks, which are moving in a good direction and should be over by Nov. 21. The lender's net interest income rose 3.5 percent to 907 million euros on the back of a positive performance in Portugal and to a lesser extent abroad, the bank said. Operating costs fell 5 percent after the closure of branches and dismissals. Core income rose 8.4 percent, reflecting a strong performance in Portugal, the bank said in a statement, adding that after stripping out one-off items, particularly the provisions, its consolidated profit improved to 74.5 million euros from 6.5 million a year ago. The bank's shares closed 0.96 percent lower before the results were announced, outperforming the broader market in Lisbon which fell 1.5 percent on Wednesday.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/britain-banks-branches-idUSL4N1953AF","Britain's poorer communities, hit hardest by bank closures, may face shutout","","June 20, 2016 /  6:50 AM / a year ago","","LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's largest banks are disproportionately closing branches in the lowest-income areas while expanding in wealthier ones, taking bricks-and-mortar services away from communities where they are arguably needed most, an analysis by Reuters shows. HSBC (HSBA.L), Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L), Barclays (BARC.L) and Lloyds Banking Group (LLOY.L) are among banks that have cut 600 branches from April 2015 to April 2016.  More than 90 percent of the closures were in areas where the median household income is below the British average of 27,600 pounds ($39,042), according to an analysis of Office for National Statistics data on average incomes in the locations where branches were closed. By comparison, five out of the eight branches opened by these banks over the same period were in some of the wealthiest neighborhoods in Britain -- Chelsea, Canary Wharf, St Paul's, Marylebone and Clapham, all in the capital, London. The banks say in an era of falling revenues, they must look for ways to cut costs, which includes reducing staff as well as closing branches, an obvious measure as more and more people do their banking online. They say they choose which branches to close on the basis of where they have the fewest customers and deny they specifically target poorer areas. But campaigners say banks are cutting too fast in places where people are less able to fall back on digital banking services because of a lack of access, finances or ability to use the internet.    We are witnessing the creation of a dual financial system: one for the middle class and wealthy and another for the poor, said Fionn Travers Smith of Move Your Money, which campaigns for ethical banking. The situation is similar in the United States, where 1,600 branches closed in 2015, according to SNL financial. The result, according to a 2014 study by MIT economist Hoai-Luu Nguyen, is a decline in lending, especially in low-income areas. High Street bank branches are important to communities who use them for basic functions such as withdrawing money and cashing checks, politicians and business people told Reuters. The village of Cross Hands with a population of 4,500 in southwest Wales is a classic example. It is set to lose its last branch when the local Lloyds closes at the end of July.  Local businesspeople say the closure will mean they are forced to travel to nearby Tumble, a 90-minute round trip by infrequent buses for many residents without cars.  It's going to have a big financial impact as I will have to close the shop during that time, said Jo Payne, who is set to open a café in Cross Hands next month and will need to deposit cash takings, which cannot be done online. A worker passes a sign for Bank Street in the Canary Wharf financial district in London October 21, 2010.Luke MacGregorPayne said the loss of ATMs in the village from branch closures has also hurt business, as few shops take credit cards. About a third of cash machines now charge customers to withdraw money, and studies such as one by Nottingham University say when branches close, less-regulated financial institutions, including payday loan providers and cash-checking centers, fill the void at a higher cost to customers. If we want businesses to thrive in areas with scattered populations and lower incomes, they must keep at least the last bank in every community open, said Nia Griffith, Labour member of parliament for Llanelli and Shadow Secretary of State for Wales. With a population of 3 million, Wales has been plagued by high unemployment and poverty since the closure of coal mines in the 1980s. Western Wales and the Valleys has the highest level of poverty in northern Europe, with the average income at 67 percent of the European Union average, according to 2013 EU statistics. The large banks were three times more likely to shut a branch in Wales than in the southeast or London, the wealthiest areas of Britain, when closures were averaged out for the size of their populations, the Reuters analysis showed. The fact that poorer areas are being hit the worst by branch closures, means you're going to see a perfect storm making it harder for them to regenerate, said Jonathan Edwards, an MP for Carmarthen East and Dinefwr in southwest Wales.HSBC, Barclays, RBS and Lloyds say they have signed up to protocols aimed at minimizing the impact of branch closures, including partnering with the post office to offer services and carrying out impact studies before closures. Banks say they have not canceled any planned closures as a result of the studies, but have delayed some. 'HEART OF THE VILLAGE'Taxpayer-owned RBS has closed the most branches overall in the last year and is responsible for more than one in every three branch closures among the top four banks. Lenders are expected to accelerate the closure of branches because of new technology and cost-cutting; a study by investment bank UBS published in January predicted half of Britain's branches may disappear in the next five years. A senior executive at a top four British lender said banks are stripping out unprofitable parts of the network to focus on more affluent urban areas, where customers are likely to buy products such as savings and insurance to boost profit.The majority of branch closures will be this year and next, the executive said. Customer behavior (toward online banking) has evolved faster than we thought and it's about cutting back to the minimum scale that's needed. Yet government data shows about 8.6 million adults among Britain's 64 million population -- mainly the poor and the elderly -- do not have access to the internet because they are deterred by the costs or lack the expertise. A report on financial inclusion produced by the Financial Conduct Authority last month even predicted poorer people could be shut out from in-person banking. It is possible that, in the future, only the wealthy or those willing to pay for a personal service will be able to talk to bank staff in person, the report said.Laura Evans of Cross Hands estate agents Peters and Co said she typically visits the village's soon-to-be-closed branch twice a day to pay in hundreds of pounds worth of cash and cheques. Evans said she will now have to drive to Tumble, and fears what will happen if that bank closes too.  Older residents of the village she has spoken to have little interest in going online to do their banking, Evans said, and will feel the loss of the branch even more keenly. For older people it's a social occasion going in to the branch, she said. It takes the heart out of the village to close it.   Editing by Rachel Armstrong, Sinead Cruise and Sonya Hepinstall"

Paxton, a Republican, attached a brief in asking the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in California for permission to argue in support of Trump's temporary ban on travelers from seven predominantly Muslim countries. Texas is the first state to back Trump in the closely watched litigation. A group of 15 states and the District of Columbia have filed papers with the appeals court in support of Washington state's challenge to Trump's Jan. 27 order, saying it harms their educational institutions and economies. Paxton said the full court should reconsider whether a lower court judge was justified in halting the ban.  U.S. District Judge James Robart in Seattle suspended Trump's order across the country on Feb. 3. Washington state argued that it violated constitutional protections against religious discrimination. That ruling was upheld by a three-judge panel of the 9th Circuit in San Francisco last week, raising questions about Trump's next step. The appeals court will soon vote on whether to reconsider the case with an 11-judge panel. Trump's directive, which he said was necessary to protect the United States from attacks by Islamist militants, barred people from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen from entering the country for 90 days. Refugees were banned for 120 days, except those from Syria, who were banned indefinitely. The rulings put the order on hold until the courts can rule on the underlying merits. Ultimately, they will have to address questions about the extent of the president's power on matters of immigration and national security.   Traditionally, judges have been extremely cautious about stepping on the executive branch’s authority in such matters, legal experts said. In the brief, Paxton said the order had a clear national security goal, to ensure proper vetting of foreigners seeking entry into the United States. It reflects national-security interests implicated by the ongoing War on Terror against radical Islamic terrorists. Paxton rejected any claim that the order discriminates against Muslims while favoring Christian minorities. If that argument is accepted, he said, it would jeopardize the government's ability to help persecuted religious minorities abroad by granting them refugee status.  Texas led the legal fight against President Barack Obama’s plan to protect up to four million immigrants from deportation, joined by 25 other Republican-led states. The challengers won a February 2015 nationwide injunction blocking the program before it was due to go into effect.   In June 2016, the Supreme Court split 4-4 in the case, leaving in place an appeals court ruling in favor of the states.. A major question in that litigation was whether Texas had legal standing to sue, an issue that the Supreme Court did not resolve. In Wednesday's brief, Texas did not address whether Washington and other states had standing to sue over Trump’s ban.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-rbs-results-idUSKBN1630SV","RBS posts ninth straight annual loss on sins of the past","","February 24, 2017 /  8:44 AM / 5 months ago","","LONDON (Reuters) - Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L) reported a sharp rise in losses on Friday as higher misconduct charges and restructuring costs underscored the challenges facing the lender nine years after it was bailed out in the world's biggest bank rescue. RBS, which has not made an annual profit since 2007, booked 6.96 billion pounds ($8.74 billion) of losses for 2016, against a 1.98 billion pound loss in the same period a year earlier.  Once, albeit briefly, the world's largest bank by assets, RBS is in the midst of a vast, multi-year restructuring which includes asset sales, job cuts and wading through a series of legal scandals.  This is a strong core bank getting masked by all the sins of the past, Chief Executive Ross McEwan said on a conference call with reporters. RBS said 2017 will probably be the final year it makes a loss as it moves nearer to closing the darkest chapter in its 290-year history, which has seen it rack up more than 58 billion pounds in losses so far. The Edinburgh-based lender also announced plans to cut 2 billion pounds of costs over the next four years to help offset the challenge of a low interest rate economy that makes it harder for the bank to make money.  Although RBS did not specify where the cuts would fall they are expected to partly hit its branch network where the lender has already eliminated thousands of roles as more customers bank online. Misconduct Issues Total income was moderately down, with the jump in losses mainly driven by a 5.9 billion charge of misconduct issues relating to its behavior in the run up to the 2007-2009 global financial crisis. RBS took charges to set aside money to cover legal cases in the U.S. where analysts expect it to pay the biggest regulatory penalty in its history for mis-selling U.S. securities backed by toxic mortgage loans. Analysts have estimated the bank could have to pay the U.S. Department of Justice as much as 9 billion pounds this year. McEwan said the bank has not begun negotiations with the U.S. government on any settlement. The shares fell 1.9 percent by 0825 GMT.  RBS was the only British lender to fail the Bank of England's stress test in 2016, a sign of how the bank's future is still being dictated by its past. In some rare good news for RBS, the British government is pushing to free the bank from an obligation to sell its Williams & Glyn business to try to end a seven-year struggle to meet European Union state aid demands.  The bank will not know if the European Commission has approved the new state aid plan until the fourth quarter of this year at the earliest, RBS Chief Financial Officer Ewen Stevenson told reporters.  The British government, which owns more than 70 percent of RBS, has said it will not resume selling its stake until the bank settles its U.S. fine and resolves its state aid requirements.

Leila de Lima, who last year led a Senate probe into alleged extrajudicial killings during Duterte's anti-drugs campaign, said the arrest was payback for taking on a president who had acted like a dictator. On Tuesday she called Duterte a sociopathic serial killer who had a criminal mind. The truth will come out at the right time, de Lima told reporters outside the Senate office where she spent the night, moments before law enforcers marshaled her into a waiting van. De Lima, her former driver and bodyguard and a former prison official were ordered arrested after a judge found merit in criminal charges filed by the justice ministry last week. She faces two more drug-related charges in the same court and described the cases as all lies. Bail is not permitted under the charges and if found guilty, de Lima faces a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. House speaker Pantaleon Alvarez, a close ally of Duterte, described her arrest as a victory of the war against drugs, adding no one is above the law, not even a senator.  Philippine Senator Leila De Lima waves from a police van after appearing at a Muntinlupa court on drug charges in Muntinlupa, Metro Manila, Philippines February 24, 2017.Erik De CastroBut de Lima's supporters quickly came to her defense, with Vice President Leni Robredo describing the arrest as political harassment. Senator Paulo Benigno Aquino, a cousin of former president Benigno Aquino, called it a concern for anyone who will dissent on any of the policies of this administration.  The criminal complaint alleged de Lima received 5 million pesos ($99,850) from a former prison official when she was justice minister between 2010 and 2016. Slideshow (5 Images)The allegations she was in cahoots with drugs gangs surfaced when she led a Senate investigation, which probed alleged summary executions during Duterte's bloody drugs war and a pattern of similar killings over the 22 years in which he was mayor of Davao City. That investigation found no proof of wrongdoing by Duterte,  who disparaged de Lima almost daily in televised speeches in which he made lurid allegations about her private life and even suggested she hang herself. She filed a complaint with Supreme Court to try to muzzle the president. At the heart of de Lima's campaign has been the 7,700 deaths since Duterte took office eight months ago, more than 2,500 in police operations. The cause of many of the other deaths remain in dispute and human rights groups believe many of them were extrajudicial killings. De Lima was removed as head of her Senate probe by Duterte's allies and days later came under investigation herself in a congressional inquiry in which witnesses, several of them convicts, identified her as a key player in the narcotics trade. Phelim Kine of the New York-based Human Rights Watch said Duterte had effectively expanded his 'drug war' from the urban poor to the legislative branch by arresting de Lima.

A deadly chemical attack was launched this week from that base. Comments: House Speaker Paul Ryan This action was appropriate and just. Resolving the years-long crisis in Syria is a complex task, but Bashar al-Assad must be held accountable and his enablers must be persuaded to change course. I look forward to the administration further engaging Congress in this effort.  Republican Senators John Mccain and Lindsey Graham Building on tonight’s credible first step, we must finally learn the lessons of history and ensure that tactical success leads to strategic progress. That means following through with a new, comprehensive strategy in coordination with our allies and partners to end the conflict in Syria. Senator Bob Corker, Chairman Senate Foreign Relations It is critical that Assad knows he will no longer enjoy impunity for his horrific crimes against his own citizens, and this proportional step was appropriate. As we move forward, it will be important for the administration to engage with Congress and clearly communicate its full strategy to the American people. Representative Ed Royce, Chairman House Foreign Affairs  Assad was warned, repeatedly, by the U.S. and the U.N. that the intentional targeting of innocent men, women and children is intolerable. Now Assad has been caught red-handed carrying out another abhorrent chemical attack, and the administration has taken a measured response. REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF, RANKING MEMBER, HOUSE INTELLIGENCE I will be reintroducing an authorization for use of military force against ISIS and al Qaeda when Congress returns to session. Congress cannot abdicate its responsibility any longer and should vote on any use of force not made in self defense. This is necessary whether action is taken against terrorist groups or, as here, against regime capabilities. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer “Making sure Assad knows that when he commits such despicable atrocities he will pay a price is the right thing to do.‎ It is incumbent on the Trump administration to come up with a strategy and consult with Congress before implementing it. SENATOR BEN CARDIN, TOP DEMOCRAT ON SENATE FOREIGN RELATIONS I cannot emphasize this enough, any longer-term or larger military operation in Syria by the Trump administration will need to be done in consultation with the Congress. Furthermore, it is the president’s responsibility to inform the legislative branch and the American people about his larger policy in Syria, as well as the legal basis for this action and any additional military activities in that country. SENATOR MARCO RUBIO, REPUBLICAN ON SENATE FOREIGN RELATIONS What must follow is a real and comprehensive strategy to ensure that Assad is no longer a threat to his people and to U.S. security, and that Russia no longer has free rein to support his regime. Republican Senator Rand Paul While we all condemn the atrocities in Syria, the United States was not attacked. The president needs congressional authorization for military action as required by the Constitution, and I call on him to come to Congress for a proper debate. Our prior interventions in this region have done nothing to make us safer, and Syria will be no different. Senator Dick Durbin, Democratic Whip My preliminary briefing by the White House indicated that this was a measured response to the Syrian nerve gas atrocity. Any further action will require close scrutiny by Congress, and any escalation beyond air strikes or missile strikes will require engaging the American people in that decision. Democratic Senator Chris Coons While I’m encouraged that the Trump administration has felt compelled to act forcefully in Syria against the Assad regime, I’m gravely concerned that the United States is engaging further militarily in Syria without a well-thought-out, comprehensive plan. Frankly, the president’s actions today generate more questions than answers. Reporting by Patricia Zengerle and Roberta Rampton; Editing by Lisa Shumaker"

Central European University (CEU) found itself in the eye of a political storm after Hungary's parliament passed the new law last week setting tougher conditions for the awarding of licenses to foreign-based universities. Critics said the new terms would hurt academic freedoms and were especially aimed at CEU, founded by the Hungarian-born Soros after the collapse of Communism and considered a bastion of independent scholarship in the region. In an apparent change of tack, Education Secretary Laszlo Palkovics said CEU, which specializes in social sciences, could continue to operate if it delivered its teaching and issued its degrees through its existing Hungarian sister school. We never wanted to close down CEU, Palkovics told news website HVG.hu. The question is whether CEU insists on having a license in Hungary or having courses in Hungary honored with a CEU degree ... (CEU's own) license has little significance. Despite this, thousands of Hungarians protested in central Budapest against what they said was a crackdown on free thought. Thousands of students broke off from an earlier protest in Heroes' Square and marched some 3.5 km to the parliament, chanting Europe! Europe! and Free country! Free university!

They have pressed ahead since 2010 with new moves every day that hurt democracy in some way, Robert Ferenczi, a 55-year-old protester from Budapest, told Reuters in Heroes' Square. The dispute over the university has come to symbolize rival visions of Hungary's future. Soros, whose ideal of an open society is squarely at odds with Orban's self-styled illiberal democracy, has often been vilified by the prime minister. Slideshow (11 Images)CEU itself was taken by surprise at Palkovics' comments. The solution evoked by State Secretary Palkovics in the press does not appear to be legally and operationally coherent and certain, it said by email. CEU has not been approached directly by Secretary Palkovics with this information. Exchanges in the press are no substitute for sustained direct contact on a confidential basis. We look to the Hungarian government to initiate negotiations with CEU so that we can resolve this. Government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs said the government would not suspend the law but added: We are going to have talks with everyone; if the Soros university is driven by good intentions, it will be able to solve the problem. The law said the CEU must open a branch in its home state of New York alongside its campus in Budapest and secure a bilateral agreement of support from the U.S. government. Both of those conditions would have been prohibitive by a deadline of January 2018, and CEU rejected them from the start. The United States asked Hungary to suspend the implementation of the law, and the European Union on Wednesday threatened Orban with legal action for moves that it saw as undemocratic. The European Union was adamant Hungary must show its actions would not harm democratic safeguards. Taken cumulatively, the overall situation in Hungary is a cause of concern, European Commission First Vice President Frans Timmermans said.

The Grande Synthe camp of tightly-packed wooden cabins, set up just over a year ago, was 70 percent destroyed by the blaze on Monday night after clashes between Iraqi Kurds and Afghans, Michel Lalande, a top regional official, told Reuters. The Kurds originally formed a majority, but the population of the camp, near Dunkirk on the Channel coast, has swelled with the arrival of many Afghans. Yesterday, at 5 or 6 in the evening, the fight started between Afghans and the Kurdish. The Afghans were few, but they wanted to kill because they all had knives and other things, said a 21-year-old Iraqi migrant, who gave his name only as Mohamed. Grande Synthe was home to one of the largest groups of migrants on the French coast seeking to reach Britain since the sprawling Jungle shanty town outside the nearby port of Calais was shut down last October.  Francois Guennoc, vice-president of humanitarian group Auberge des Migrants, blamed tensions in the camp on its over-population. Since the closure of Calais, the population had risen from about 850 people to 1,700 in recent days, he told France Inter radio. Last week, some camp residents tried to block the nearby highway with tree trunks and branches in an attempt to stop traffic and clamber onto trucks in the hope of reaching Britain. A French fireman walks between standing shelters the day after a fire destroyed large swathes of the Grande-Synthe migrant camp near Dunkirk in northern France April 11, 2017 following skirmishes on Monday that injured several people.Pascal RossignolSights like these in recent years to some extent drove Britons to vote for a divorce from Europe last summer. The large influx into Europe of migrants fleeing poverty and war elsewhere is also a hot button issue in France, where the far-right anti-immigration leader Marine Le Pen is a frontrunner in the presidential election less than two weeks away. Le Pen repeated on Tuesday that she would close migrant camps and France's borders, also drastically cutting migration should she be elected. Slideshow (8 Images)This chaos has to end, she said in a statement. Opinion polls show Le Pen tied with centrist Emmanuel Macron in the first round on April 23, then losing to him in the run-off of the two top scoring candidates on May 7.     Riot police intervened to stop the clashes, but five migrants were hurt in knife fights, regional authorities said. Another migrant was in serious condition after being knocked over by a vehicle on a nearby motorway. Sixty firefighters fought the blaze but by Tuesday, much of the camp was reduced to heaps of smoking debris. Lalande said it was unlikely that the camp, set up by medical aid charity Medecins Sans Frontieres, could be rebuilt.  Authorities were working to find alternative accommodation for the migrants. Around 500 were given shelter in three municipal gymnasiums and the government said it would speed up admission to reception centers for migrants wanting to apply for asylum in France.

The European Central Bank has since put the capital shortfall that the bank must fill at 8.8 billion euros. The Italian government is expected to pump 6.6 billion euros into the bank, taking a stake of around 70 percent. [nL5N1EL0X3] [nR1N1DP27R] But for state aid to be unlocked, the European Commission must approve the bank's restructuring and negotiations are dragging on.  Morelli's own business plan, unveiled in October, envisaged 2,600 layoffs - around 10 percent of the bank's employees - and 500 branch closures, but he said Brussels is demanding a much more stringent approach in terms of cost cuts and revenue targets.  [nL4N1CV2E1] Morelli told a shareholder meeting on Wednesday he did not know the final number of job cuts. A source close to the matter said the EU was asking for a staff reduction of more than 5,000 people.  We are negotiating a plan that will be radically different from the one that the bank had presented to the market, Morelli said. We have told our counterparts that we need to find the right compromise ... Right now I am not in a position to give numbers (on layoffs). One big hurdle is the bank's mountain of problem loans, which stand at 46 billion euros on a gross basis - the highest amount relative to a bank's capital in Italy. Monte dei Paschi's failed capital raising last year was designed to cover losses from the planned disposal of 28 billion euros of its most toxic soured debts.  Morelli said the bank needed to get rid of such loans as soon as possible, but also said the timing and details of the sale were still being discussed as Monte dei Paschi wanted to minimize further loan losses. He said it would take years for the bank to reverse a 28 billion euros loss in commercial deposits suffered in 2016 when customers were worried about its survival. Italy is trying to shore up its problem banks to avoid losses for creditors and depositors that could undermine confidence in the banking system. Monte dei Paschi is not the only Italian bank that is seeking a state bailout. Two regional lenders, Banca Popolare di Vicenza and Veneto Banca, last month also requested a so-called precautionary recapitalization by the state. The ECB has put the combined capital shortfall for these two lenders at 6.4 billion euros.  [nL8N1HJ4TM] Editing by Jane Merriman"

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eurozone-banks-italy-veneto-idUSKBN19E2IH","Italy to start winding down Veneto banks Saturday after EU green-light","","June 23, 2017 /  9:15 PM / a month ago","","MILAN/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The European Commission on Friday gave preliminary approval for  an Italian plan to wind down two ailing Veneto-based regional lenders with state money in a move that may allow Rome to solve its latest banking crisis on its own terms.   Italy plans to start liquidation proceedings for Banca Popolare di Vicenza and Veneto Banca on Saturday, a source close to the matter said, issuing an emergency decree that will effectively remove one its biggest banking headaches by splitting the two lenders' assets into good and bad banks. The country's top retail bank Intesa Sanpaolo (ISP.MI) is set to buy the good assets for one euro, leaving the state to foot the bulk of the bill for losses stemming from the banks' bad loans, legal risks and restructuring costs.  EU state aid rules allow for the possibility of granting state support in these kind of situations, the European Commission, which must rule on the use of state money, said in a statement.  It added it was in constructive discussions with Italian authorities. Good progress is being made to find a solution very soon.  The Italian government has been scrambling to prevent the two lenders from being wound down under European banking rules designed to stop the use of state money in banking crises.  Rome feared that under those rules losses could have been imposed on senior bondholders and large depositors, a politically unpalatable prospect in the run-up to elections next year. Instead, under the Italian plan only junior bondholders and shareholders will be hit, but the cost for taxpayers is likely to be hefty.  With the two banks' soured or risky debts totaling more than 20 billion euros ($22.4 billion), one banker said the government would put in 5 billion euros, while some Italian media reports on Friday said the final bill could be as high as 12 billion euros. The logo of Veneto Banca bank is seen in Venice, Italy, January 31, 2016.Alessandro Bianchi/File PhotoThe emergency decree to be approved on Saturday will create the conditions for a sale of the banks' good assets to Intesa, the source said.  The sale will allow the regular functioning of the banks' branches on Monday morning, it said, adding the terms of the transaction will be made public in coming days. Earlier the European Central Bank said the two banks, which have a capital shortfall of 6.4 billion euros and are bleeding deposits, were failing or likely to fail, setting in motion the process that will lead to them being wound down. The ECB had given the banks time to present capital plans, but the banks had been unable to offer credible solutions going forward, it said in a statement. Pressure on Rome to find a solution for the two Veneto lenders had increased since Spain's Banco Popular POP.MC was rescued by Santander (SAN.MC) this month in a deal orchestrated by European authorities. In Popular's case, no state money was used and Santander is seeking around 7 billion euros of capital from shareholders to help it take on Popular. The Italian plan instead takes advantage of an exception to EU bank rules that allows the use of routine insolvency proceedings with banks not considered systemically important, allowing the process to be handled by the member state. The plan has sparked criticism from some European officials who said Italy was being allowed to cut corners, while at home, opposition politicians have also criticized the scheme put forward by the government. Intesa gets a free gift, the state takes on all the bad stuff and the taxpayer pays, Renato Brunetta, parliamentary leader for former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia (Go Italy!) party said on Thursday. Did we really need to take so much time to come up with such a rubbish solution?

The proposed deal is the latest in wave of mergers and acquisitions in global container shipping that has left the top six shipping lines controlling 63 percent of the market. OOIL's shipping subsidiary, OOCL, has a 2.7 percent slice of the market.  COSCO Shipping is offering HK$78.67 for each OOIL share, a premium of 37.8 percent over OOIL's closing price of HK$57.10 on its last trading date, the companies said in filings with the Hong Kong and Shanghai stock exchanges on Sunday. OOIL's controlling shareholders had on Friday agreed to sell their 68.7 percent stake at that price to COSCO Shipping, which is making the offer with Shanghai Port International Group (SIPG) (600018.SS) that will take 9.9 percent, they said.  COSCO Shipping will have a fleet of more than 400 vessels and capacity exceeding 2.9 million TEUs (twenty-foot equivalent units) should the deal go through, it said. This would make it the world's third largest container shipping line after Denmark's Maersk Line MAERSKb.Co and Switzerland's Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC), according to Singapore-based transport research firm Crucial Perspective. It is currently the fourth-largest behind France's CMA CGM [CMACG.UL]. COSCO Shipping Holdings believes this acquisition will enable both COSCO Shipping Lines and OOIL to realize synergies, enhance profitability and achieve sustainable growth in the long term, the Chinese group said in the statement.  A COSCO container is seen at the Noatum container terminal near Bilboa, in Santurtzi, Spain June 14, 2017.Vincent West - RTS170T5OOCL was founded in 1969 by Hong Kong shipping magnate Tung Chao-yung, whose son, Tung Chee-chen is chairman, president and chief executive of the company, while several Tung children are in senior management roles. The two companies in January dismissed merger rumors but analysts said that OOCL was still a likely bid target due to its long profitable history and relatively low leverage. Both firms are also part of the Ocean Alliance partnership, which also includes CMA CGM and Evergreen Marine Corp (2603.TW), that was formed last year to take on the rival grouping of Maersk Line and MSC. COSCO Shipping itself was created from the state-driven merger of former rivals China Ocean Shipping (Group) Company and China Shipping Group. Shares in the firm, which flagged a return to first-half profit last week, have been suspended since May 16. It said it would finance its part of the deal through external debt financing and that the transaction was still subject to anti-trust reviews by Chinese and U.S. government authorities.  The companies said that they plan to retain OOIL's listing status and maintain its global headquarters and presence in Hong Kong to support the city as a global maritime center.  Should the deal fall through, COSCO Shipping has also agreed to pay OOIL a reverse termination fee of $253 million, they said  UBS AG Hong Kong Branch (UBSG.S) is advising COSCO Shipping and SIPG, while J.P.

U.S. job growth surged more than expected in June and employers increased hours for workers, suggesting the Fed could stick to its plan for its third interest rate hike this year and begin to reduce its balance sheet despite sluggish wage gains and tepid inflation. Against the yen, the dollar was 0.2 percent higher at 114.16 , after notching a high of 114.21, its loftiest level since May 11. The dollar index, which gauges the greenback against a currency basket, was steady at 96.012. The solid jobs report gives us more reason to expect the Fed to announce that it's prepared to start trimming its balance sheet, said Mitsuo Imaizumi, Tokyo-based chief foreign exchange strategist for Daiwa Securities. By contrast, the Bank of Japan is nowhere near a policy exit, and it's taking steps that weaken the yen, he said. On Friday, the BOJ sought to keep Japanese government bond yields near its policy target, embarking on a special market operation as well as increasing the size of its regular JGB purchase operations. BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda on Monday reiterated in a speech at a quarterly meeting of the central bank's regional branch managers that the central bank is resolved to maintain its massive stimulus programme until inflation is stably above its 2 percent target. Data released on Monday showed Japan's core machinery orders unexpectedly tumbled in May and the government downgraded the outlook for orders for the first time in eight months, raising doubts about the strength of the country's economic recovery. Recent positioning data showed that some investors pared their long dollar positions ahead of the jobs report, amid concerns that a spate of lacklustre data would prompt the Fed to alter its hawkish plans. Speculators this week slashed net long bets on the U.S. dollar to their lowest since mid-May 2016 in the week ended July 4, according to calculations by Reuters and Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released on Friday. The value of the dollar's net long positions dropped to $135 million, from net longs of $4.5 billion the previous week. The latest week marked the first time since mid-April 2016 that net long dollar positioning fell to under $1 billion. A majority of foreign exchange strategists polled by Reuters were less bullish on the dollar than at the start of the year and more optimistic about the euro. Still, higher U.S. Treasury yields underpinned the dollar. The benchmark 10-year U.S. yield stood at 2.389 percent in Asian trading, not far from its U.S. close of 2.393 percent on Friday, when it touched a more than eight-week high of 2.398 percent after the jobs report. Ultimately, the broader theme remains in play, and that is volatility remains really low, said Sue Trinh, head of Asia FX strategy at Royal Bank of Canada in Hong Kong. In such a climate, investors are more apt to do carry trades, in which they borrow lower-yielding currencies such as the yen to buy higher-yielding ones. The euro edged down slightly on the day to $1.1404 but gained against its Japanese counterpart. The euro was 0.3 percent higher at 130.20 yen, after rising as high as 130.275 yen, its highest since February 2016. (Editing by Shri Navaratnam and Jacqueline Wong)"
"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-stocks-idUSKBN19V2VC","Amazon up ahead of Prime Day, new service hits Best Buy","","July 10, 2017 /  11:45 PM / 17 days ago","","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Amazon.com (AMZN.O) shares rose on Monday ahead of the world's largest online retailer's own version of Black Friday, while its new service to help set up 'smart homes' weighed on rival Best Buy Co Inc (BBY.N). Prime Day, a 30-hour sale set to start at 9:00 p.m. EDT (0100 GMT Tuesday), is Amazon's biggest marketing push of the year, with deals to draw new subscribers to its Prime shopping club. U.S. members pay $99 per year for streaming video and two-day shipping. Amazon shares closed up 1.8 percent at $996.47 on Nasdaq. Prime Day is the big overriding story and what's moved the stock up today, said Trip Miller, managing partner at Gullane Capital Partners in Memphis, Tennessee, which has a long position in Amazon. Miller said Amazon's dominance could be seen in how a long list of retailers' shares fell on Monday.   Baird Equity Research analysts have estimated that Prime has about 60 million U.S. members, based on an April survey. Amazon does not disclose the number. It's a real test to see if they can raise that number, said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. She said an Amazon disclosure on the number of subscribers and their location would be telling, to see how big of a phenomenon this is. Spreading Out Among the stocks hurt by Amazon was Best Buy, which fell 6.3 percent to end at $54.23 in its largest daily percentage drop since late May 2016. The decline was partly prompted by reports of an Amazon service launched earlier this year, similar to one from Best Buy, that helps customers set up a 'smart home' with Amazon's voice-controlled assistant Alexa, analysts said. Best Buy's Geek Squad, which offers in-home product installations and repairs, has helped distinguish the electronics retailer from its rivals. Today's news reflects what we know: Consumers love technology but frequently need help getting the most out of it, said Jeff Shelman, senior director of external communications at Best Buy Corp. Investors punished Best Buy shares on a growing concern that it stands to lose if Amazon branches out into its business. That's the vision investors and even competitors have of being 'Amazoned,' said Fort Pitt Capital's Forrest. Amazon's announcement last month of the acquisition of Whole Foods Market Inc (WFM.O) sent stocks of food retailers, producers and packagers, among others, reeling. Fears about Amazon's new service, which is offered only in seven top urban areas on the U.S. West Coast, may be overblown, Forrest said. I think investors are overestimating the power of Amazon and underestimating the cost to enter all of these new markets and their geographies. America is a big place.

The error first occurred in Update 2) By Anggy Polanco and Andrew Cawthorne CARACAS, July 25 (Reuters) - Two more people named to an alternative Supreme Court in defiance of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's government were arrested on Wednesday by intelligence agents during a fast-escalating political showdown, the opposition said. Jesus Rojas and Zuleima Gonzalez were seized in central Anzoategui state, after another appointee Angel Zerpa's arrest at the weekend, the opposition-led National Assembly said. Venezuela's majority-backed opposition is demanding Maduro abandon a Sunday election to create a controversial congress with powers to rewrite the country's constitution and override all other institutions. Foes say that will institutionalize dictatorship by the ruling Socialist Party. But Maduro insists it is the only way to empower the people and bring peace after four months of anti-government unrest that have killed more than 100 people. The Constituent Assembly will be a blank check for the executive to decide everything, state prosecutor Luisa Ortega, who has broken with Maduro this year, told a local paper. The main business guild Fedecamaras also backed the opposition, issuing a statement on Wednesday that called the coming weekend vote unconstitutional and unnecessary. We demand the executive branch abandon its intention to impose a new constitution, said the group, which is hated by government supporters for its central role in a short-lived 2002 coup against Maduro's predecessor Hugo Chavez. Facing intense foreign pressure including the threat of economic sanctions by U.S. President Donald Trump, Maduro has vowed the vote will go ahead despite imperial pressure. Usurpers He has called for the arrest of the 13 people named by the opposition to the alternative court last week, calling them usurpers. The existing Supreme Court has consistently backed Maduro and shot down all measures by the opposition-led National Assembly. The office of the vice presidency, which oversees state intelligence service Sebin, did not answer phone calls seeking comment on the latest reported arrests in Anzoategui. Venezuela's opposition has called for a two-day strike from Wednesday at 6 a.m. (1000 GMT) to try and force Maduro to abandon the vote. Millions took part in a one-day strike last week, where five people died in clashes. Many Venezuelans were stocking up on food on Tuesday in anticipation of closed shops and trouble, exacerbating already bulging lines at supermarkets and ATMS. Some fretted they would not be able to find food and would lose money by being unable to work for two days. People are desperate, there's a lot of tension, one of the checkouts collapsed due to all the pressure in the line, said housewife Patricia Vargas, 41, exiting a supermarket. Venezuela is undergoing a major economic crisis, with many suffering food shortages and runaway inflation in a fourth year of sharp recession. Opposition leaders met late on Monday with former Spanish leader Jose Rodriguez Zapatero, who has been trying to mediate Venezuela's crisis. The meeting at the house of Leopoldo Lopez, a prominent opposition leader recently granted house arrest after three years in jail, sparked rumors of a possible behind-the-scenes negotiation of Venezuela's crisis.

EFG agreed to buy rival Swiss bank BSI Ltd from Brazil's BTG Pactual in February 2016 to nearly double in size so it could compete better in Switzerland's crowded private banking market. But BSI has been mired in legal problems, chiefly related to transactions linked to the scandal-hit Malaysian sovereign fund 1MDB, which resulted in the closure of BSI's Singapore branch last year. Its offices in Como and Milan may also have to shut. Following billions of dollars of client withdrawals last year, wealthy EFG customers withdrew a net 5.5 billion Swiss francs ($5.8 billion) in the first six months of 2017. EFG said while it expected its business to stabilise in the second half and in 2018, it was unlikely to reach its medium-term target of 3 percent to 6 percent net new money growth until 2019. We believe for next year we should expect no attrition, hopefully then a good development, most probably still below target or at the low end of the target, Deputy CEO Piergiorgio Pradelli told a news conference to announce first-half results. The net new money target, a closely-watched indicator of future earnings in private banking, is due to kick in once EFG has completed the integration of BSI, which is expected by the end of this year. EFG's total assets under management fell 4 percent to 138.4 billion francs in the first half, below the average estimate in a Reuters poll of four analysts of 141 billion francs. The net new money development remains disappointing and is the main reason for our relatively cautious stance on the shares, wrote Baader Helvea analyst Tomasz Grzelak, who rates the stock hold. EFG shares were trading down 1 percent at 1215 GMT, paring gains after earlier jumping more than 6 percent. For the first six months of the year, EFG posted a 19.2 million franc IFRS net profit. That beat the average estimate in the analyst poll for a 15.6 million franc loss, though the forecasts ranged from a loss of 75 million to a profit of 20.9 million, as it was unclear how much of the cost of integrating BSI would be come in the period. EFG had said previously it expected to spend 165 million francs this year integrating BSI. $1 = 0.9533 Swiss francs

Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan spoke glowingly of a broad turnaround in the consumer business that began in 2009, calling its $2 billion in quarterly profit a milestone on a call with analysts on Tuesday. In the midst of the Great Recession, the unit had 6,000 financial centers, 100,000 employees, two-thirds the amount of deposits and little in the way of digital banking capabilities. Regulatory changes put into place following the 2008 financial crisis soon began to curtail revenue, as did strategic decisions like cutting back on business generated from third parties. The business recently has been benefiting from the cost cuts as well as improved technology, growth in deposits and a focus on higher-quality borrowers, Moynihan said.  In the second quarter, the division managed to increase deposits at a lower cost and use those cheaper funds to fuel loan growth, helping it to record a higher profit than any other unit. Overall, Bank of America hit a target of spending 60 cents for every dollar of revenue it produces, down from 63 cents a year earlier. Investors have been watching that metric closely as a sign of how efficiently the bank is run. Bank of America, the second-largest U.S. lender by assets,  is working to cut annual operating expenses to $53 billion next year. Consumer banking helped Bank of America deliver net income of $4.9 billion, or 46 cents per share, up 11 percent from the year-ago period. Analysts had been expecting 43 cents, on average, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The bank's total revenue of $23.07 billion also beat the average analyst estimate of $21.78 billion. This was a good quarter all around for BofA, said Evercore ISI analyst Glenn Schorr. You really have to look hard to find a few issues to talk about. Moynihan and Chief Financial Officer Paul Donofrio both characterized the second quarter as one of the best in the bank's history. But its stock was down 1.1 percent at $23.75 at midday, following a 8.4 percent year-to-date rise through Monday's close. Even as big banks have reported better results, investors have been disappointed that profits are not growing faster. Last week, shares of JPMorgan Chase & Co, Wells Fargo & Co and Citigroup Inc each fell after beating analysts' estimates, as did Goldman Sachs Group Inc on Tuesday. Bank of America's profit and revenue beats were overshadowed by net interest income falling short of expectations, analysts said. That metric, which rose 8.6 percent to $10.99 billion during the second quarter, helps gauge the difference between a bank's cost of funding and the income it generates from those funds. Bank of America is considered the most interest-rate sensitive among big U.S. banks because of the way its balance sheet is constructed in terms of loan maturities, types of funding and hedges. Apart from its global markets unit, which suffered a downturn in trading like other Wall Street banks, Bank of America's other business lines also produced higher profits. Wealth and investment management reported record net income of $804 million, and a record pretax profit margin of 28 percent. Both the wealth business and retail brokerage, which sits inside the consumer business, attracted more assets. Global banking also earned more money, with growth in corporate and commercial loans, more revenue from transaction services and higher investment banking fees related to those customers. Non-interest expenses rose 1.7 percent, partly due to charges related to closing data centers. But the bank still managed to hit Moynihan's efficiency target and produced 5 percentage points of operating leverage, which measures how well a company can maintain revenue while cutting costs.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-muslimbrotherhood-idUSKBN15A363","Trump administration debates designating Muslim Brotherhood as terrorist group","","January 29, 2017 /  4:35 PM / 6 months ago","","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A debate is under way in the Trump administration about whether the United States should declare the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization and subject it to U.S. sanctions, according to U.S. officials and people close to President Donald Trump's transition team. A faction led by Michael Flynn, Trump's National Security Advisor, wants to add the Brotherhood to the State Department and U.S. Treasury lists of foreign terrorist organizations, the sources said. I know it has been discussed. I'm in favor of it, said a Trump transition advisor, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue. The advisor said Flynn's team discussed adding the group to the U.S. list of terrorist groups but said it was ultimately unclear when or even if the administration ultimately would go ahead with such a move. Other Trump advisors, as well as many veteran national security, diplomatic, law enforcement and intelligence officials argue the Brotherhood has evolved peacefully in some countries, according to officials and people close to Trump's entourage. They worry that a U.S. move to designate the entire Brotherhood a terrorist group would complicate relations with Turkey, a key American ally in the fight against Islamic State, and where the Islamist-rooted AKP Party that dominates the Turkish government of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is in power. Tunisia's Islamist Ennahda Party has also participated in democratic elections. The Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, the country's oldest Islamist movement, was designated as a terrorist organization in that country in 2013. It is not clear which faction within the U.S. administration has the upper hand, and Senator Ted Cruz and Representative Mario Diaz-Balart this month introduced legislation to add the Brotherhood to the terrorist list. There was no immediate comment from the White House. Mixed Record Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates among others have designated the group on their terrorist lists, and Trump's nominee for Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, described the Brotherhood an an agent of radical Islam, during his Senate confirmation hearing. U.S. criminal law prohibits people in the United States from knowingly providing material support to designated terrorist organizations, and members of such groups are banned from entering the United States.Some conservative and anti-Muslim activists have argued for years that the Brotherhood, which was founded in Egypt in 1928 and sought to establish a worldwide Islamic caliphate by peaceful means, has been a breeding ground for terrorists. Some branches of the Brotherhood, including the Palestinian group Hamas, have engaged in anti-government violence and provoked violent government reactions. Ayman al-Zawahiri, the leader of al-Qaeda, was once a member of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood. Other offshoots in Turkey and Tunisia have forsworn violence and come to power by democratic means. Muslim Brotherhood President Mohammed Mursi became Egypt's first freely elected president in June 2012 in the aftermath of the ousting of long-time ruler Hosni Mubarak. An army takeover stripped Mursi of power in 2013 following mass protests against his rule. Hundreds of Islamists have since been killed and arrested. Sisi and Trump spoke by phone this week and the two leaders discussed ways to boost the fight against terrorism and extremism. A U.S. official who declined to be identified told Reuters there had been discussions at the State Department which looked at intelligence and information on the group in which it was thought it would be difficult to justify legally, in terms of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood, to meet the criteria. It's one thing to say one group's ideology has been used to influence a terrorist organization and another thing to say that this group is a terrorist organization, said the U.S. official. Following the Sept. 11, 2001, al Qaeda attacks on the United States, the George W. Bush administration launched investigations into the Brotherhood and related Islamist movements. After years of investigations, however, the U.S. and other governments, including Switzerland's, closed investigations of the Brotherhood leaders and financial group for lack of evidence, and removed most of the leaders from sanctions lists. A British government review into Egypt's outlawed Muslim Brotherhood published in December 2015 concluded that membership of or links to the political group should be considered a possible indicator of extremism but stopped short of recommending that it should be banned.

The bank said it booked 100 million euros in impairment charges in the third quarter, bringing the nine-month total to 400 million euros, to strengthen its coverage of non-performing loans to 99 percent from 91 percent a year ago. CEO Nuno Amado said 2016 was absolutely unusual in terms of impairments, which should not happen again. The bank's fully-implemented common equity Tier 1 ratio, a measure of its capital strength, also fell to 9.5 percent from 10 percent a year ago. Capital levels at Portuguese banks have been a cause of concern to investors as the country's banking system, saddled with debt and bad loans, is still reeling from two bank rescues by the state in 2014 and 2015. BCP is negotiating with Fosun Group, China's biggest private conglomerate, over its offer to buy a sizeable stake in the Portuguese bank, which should give a welcome capital boost. In July, Fosun made a firm offer to buy a 16.7 percent stake in BCP via a dedicated capital increase and might boost that holding to 30 percent later.  Earlier on Wednesday, shareholders decided to postpone to Nov. 21 a vote on increasing a voting rights cap to 30 percent from 20 percent, which is a key condition of Fosun's offer. Amado said the delay was due to the ongoing talks, which are moving in a good direction and should be over by Nov. 21. The lender's net interest income rose 3.5 percent to 907 million euros on the back of a positive performance in Portugal and to a lesser extent abroad, the bank said. Operating costs fell 5 percent after the closure of branches and dismissals. Core income rose 8.4 percent, reflecting a strong performance in Portugal, the bank said in a statement, adding that after stripping out one-off items, particularly the provisions, its consolidated profit improved to 74.5 million euros from 6.5 million a year ago. The bank's shares closed 0.96 percent lower before the results were announced, outperforming the broader market in Lisbon which fell 1.5 percent on Wednesday.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/eurozone-banks-unicredit-cash-call-idUSL5N1F130K","Aabar set to invest in UniCredit's share sale: sources","","January 11, 2017 /  11:35 AM / in 7 months","","MILAN/ABU DHABI (Reuters) - Abu Dhabi investor Aabar Investments is set to buy more shares in UniCredit (CRDI.MI) in the Italian bank's upcoming 13 billion-euro ($14 billion) share offer, Italy's biggest ever cash call, three sources said on Wednesday. UniCredit, the country's largest bank by assets, will launch the share offer next month to boost its capital base as it embarks on a restructuring plan under new CEO Jean Pierre Mustier. UniCredit has already found a group of banks ready to mop up any unsold shares, unlike rival Monte dei Paschi di Siena (BMPS.MI) which last month had to be rescued by Italy's government after failing to find buyers for its stock. A successful capital raising would be an important sign of market confidence in Italy's battered banking system, weighed down by bad loans and low profitability. Mustier last month unveiled a plan to shift 17.7 billion euros in bad debts off UniCredit's balance sheet, cut 14,000 jobs and close 944 branches by the end of 2019. One of the three sources familiar with the matter said Aabar had confidence in UniCredit's strategy and would buy new shares to keep its stake unchanged. Given the cash call's size, Aabar would need to invest around 650 million euros to maintain its 5 percent stake that makes it UniCredit's second-biggest shareholder behind U.S. investor Capital Research and Management Company. Aabar and UniCredit declined to comment. A fourth source said on Wednesday the bank was set to launch its capital increase soon after approving full-year earnings on Feb. 9. Separately, two sources confirmed a report in daily Il Messaggero saying the bank could sell new shares at a 30-40 percent discount to the theoretical price of the stock when excluding subscription rights. The new shares could be sold at around 1.2-1.3 euros each before a planned reverse stock split, the sources said, adding however the bank had made no final decision on pricing yet. By 1219 GMT (7:19 a.m. ET) shares in UniCredit fell 2.5 percent to 2.61 euros. Mustier, a French investment banker formerly at Societe Generale, arrived at UniCredit in July to oversee a capital strengthening and a streamlining of its operations after capital worries had dogged the Italian bank for years. He immediately started selling assets including Polish subsidiary Bank Pekao PEO.WA and asset manager Pioneer Investments.  The possibility that a slimmed-down UniCredit could become a takeover target has raised alarm in Rome after France's Vivendi (VIV.PA) became the top investor in former monopolist Telecom Italia (TLIT.MI) and aggressively built a large stake in broadcaster Mediaset (MS.MI). Both UniCredit and Societe Generale (SOGN.PA) in November declined to comment on rumors of a possible merger. The head of the Lower House Budget Committee Francesco Boccia on Wednesday told Radio24 there was a French plan to take over UniCredit. There is a design to make UniCredit French, Boccia said.  One of the sources familiar with UniCredit's share issue said a merger deal for the bank was a concrete possibility once Mustier had completed his job.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-business-georgia-exclusive-idUSKBN14U0U5","Exclusive: Trump pulled out of project in ex-Soviet Georgia to avoid conflict of interest - ex-partner","","January 10, 2017 /  8:50 AM / in 7 months","","TBILISI (Reuters) - The Trump Organization pulled out of a $250-million real estate project in ex-Soviet Georgia to avoid a potential conflict with Donald Trump's role as president, Trump's former business partner in the project told Reuters. The Trump Organization declined to comment on the assertion that it quit the project due to conflict-of-interest concerns, and the Trump transition team did not respond to a request for comment. Since winning election as U.S. president, Donald Trump has said he would take steps to ensure he had no conflict of interests with his business. However, he has given few details on how he will do that. Trump planned to give his brand name to Georgian developer Silk Road Group, to build a 47-storey residential tower in the Georgian Black Sea resort of Batumi, a plan he had announced during his visit to the South Caucasus country in April 2012. SRG and the Trump Organization announced their joint decision to terminate the project last week, but did not elaborate on the reasons.  The only reason (for project termination) was that Mr. Trump was elected as the U.S. president and could not continue business abroad as it would pose a conflict of interest, Giorgi Ramishvili, SRG head, told Reuters in an interview. I appreciate that the Trump Organization said in the statement that it had continued to hold our company and Georgia in the highest regard. Federal law does not prohibit the president's involvement in private business while in office, even though lawmakers and executive branch officials are subject to conflict-of-interest rules. Nevertheless, Trump has come under pressure from Democrats, and some of his Republican allies, to avoid any conflict of interests. Trump has said he plans to transfer control of his businesses to his oldest three children. Georgia will present the White House with a thorny foreign policy problem. A close U.S. ally seeking membership of NATO, it accuses Russia of propping up separatists in two breakaway regions on its territory. That could complicate Trump's drive for friendlier relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Asked to comment on the reasons for pulling out of the Georgia project, the Trump Organization sent Reuters a joint statement with SRG announcing the decision but not giving a reason. Alan Garten, the Trump Organization's general counsel, said the organization stood by its statement and declined to comment on Ramishvili's assertion the deal was cancelled due to conflict-of-interest concerns. The Trump transition team, which typically defers to the Trump Organization on business issues, did not respond to a request for comment. The Trump Organization has canceled licensing deals in  some other countries, including Brazil and Azerbaijan, but has not publicly cited conflict of interest concerns as the reason for those decisions. Ramishvili said his company, one of the largest private investment companies in the South Caucasus, would still go ahead with the Batumi tower project. He said his company was ready to invest not less than the $250 million that was originally planned. It won't have Trump's name, but it may be called the Fifth Avenue Tower as it will look similar to the Trump Tower in New York, Ramishvili said. Ramishvili said he believed Trump would keep Georgia on his mind during his presidency. I'm sure that President Trump will always remember positive emotions that he had during his visit to our country, when he dubbed Georgia as one of the amazing places in the world, Ramishvili said. I'm happy that I've brought this iconic figure to Georgia and I'm sure that he will be a great president.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-succession-interiormin-idUSKBN19C1TK","Nephew replaces veteran Saudi security chief in targeting militants","","June 21, 2017 /  1:59 PM / a month ago","","DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's new interior minister, until now a little-known 33-year-old law graduate, replaces his veteran uncle as security chief at a time when the kingdom is confronting threats posed by Sunni Islamic State fighters and Shi'ite militants in the east. Prince Abdulaziz bin Saud bin Nayef was appointed on Wednesday to replace Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, who was stripped of his positions and removed as second in line to the throne of the world's biggest oil exporter. King Salman made his son Mohammed bin Salman, 31, his heir and crown prince. Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, 57, who was wounded in an al Qaeda assassination attempt in 2009, put down an al Qaeda bombing campaign and kept close ties to the U.S. intelligence community where he had a reputation as safe and reliable. A son of the late Crown Prince Nayef who had served as interior minister since 1975 until his death from a heart attack in 2012, Prince Mohammed had been closely identified with the formidable and effective security structure built by his father. His replacement by his nephew sidelines Prince Mohammed but keeps the security file in the hands of the Nayef branch of the Al Saud family, which is likely to reassure other royals as power is increasingly consolidated by King Salman and his son. Mohammed bin Nayef had strong personal support from the security forces and intelligence apparatus, said Jane Kinninmont, a Middle East expert at Chatham House. The interior ministry thus stays with the descendants of Prince Nayef, but with less experience at the helm, she wrote on Twitter. Prince Abdulaziz studied in Riyadh before entering private business, but after King Salman ascended to the throne in 2015 he was appointed adviser to the Royal Court for matters including border control, according to Saudi-owned Al Arabiya television. He recently became adviser to the defense minister. Generation of Young Leaders The new interior minister, who attended Dhahran Ahliyyah School and King Saud University, is part of a new batch of young leaders who have rocketed to the kingdom's upper ranks since King Salman took over.  Younger Saudis regard their ascent as evidence their generation is taking a central place in modernizing and reforming a country whose patriarchal traditions have for decades made power the province of the older generations.  The interior ministry portfolio will play a key role in implementing the reforms as well as fighting militancy and dealing with dissent at home. FILE PHOTO - Crown Prince Muhammad bin Nayef of Saudi Arabia confers with a member of his delegation during a high-level meeting on addressing large movements of refugees and migrants at the United Nations General Assembly in Manhattan, New York, U.S., September 19, 2016.Lucas Jackson/File PhotoSaudi Arabia follows the ultra-conservative Wahhabi school of Sunni Islam, but sees Islamist militants as posing the biggest threat to its own stability. Islamic State denounces the Al Saud family as ungodly rulers for their alliance with the United States and has staged attacks in the country. Senior Wahhabi clerics, whose influence in Saudi society forms part of a covenant with the royal family dating back 250 years, endorse execution by beheading for offences that include apostasy, adultery and sorcery, oppose women driving or working and describe Shi'ites as heretics. The clerics sharply differ, however, from al Qaeda and Sunni militants of Islamic State in opposing violent revolt against the government. Saudi Arabia crushed a campaign of al Qaeda attacks in 2003-06 but has been hit by Islamic State bombings in the past two years. Saudi security police closely monitor Saudis with suspected connections to militants and have detained more than 15,000 suspects in the years since al Qaeda's campaign.     Taking the Security Reins The new interior minister has little experience compared to his uncle in fighting militancy as he takes the reins of an extensive policing and intelligence apparatus which critics say has been used to stamp out dissent both from Islamists and more secular activists. Michael Hanna, senior fellow at Washington-based think-tank The Century Foundation, wrote on Twitter that Mohammed bin Nayef's removal also represented the loss of a long-standing, trusted U.S. (counter-terrorism) partner. The other main internal security concern in Saudi Arabia is in Qatif, home to about one million mostly Shi'ite Muslims in the oil-producing Eastern Province. Since 2011 frequent protests have shaken the area. While mostly peaceful, Shi'ites angry at what they say is repression of their community have sometimes attacked security forces. Diplomats and analysts will be keen to establish where the new, young interior minister stands on the big issue facing Saudi Arabia: reconciling social change and a young population with conservative tradition and an oil-dependent economy. They will also be anxious to see to what extent he sticks with or changes the policies of his uncle in a kingdom where ultimate power lies with the king. U.S. embassy cables released by WikiLeaks showed Mohammed bin Nayef relatively hawkish on Iran, asking U.S. officials on how best to protect key infrastructure when at war with Iran. During his five years in charge of the interior ministry, the government's tolerance for dissent has shown no sign of loosening as a steady stream of activists have been detained and imprisoned on charges that include talking to foreign media.

China stocks also fell, with strength in utility stocks  offset by weak bank and property shares. The Hang Seng index dropped 0.9 percent, to 21,625.25 points, while the Hong Kong China Enterprises Index lost 1.3 percent, to 9,208.96 points. The CSI300 index fell 0.3 percent, to 3,327.58 points, while the Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.2 percent, to 3,131.76 points. In the Hong Kong stock market, which is more exposed to its global counterparts, the appetite for risk was curbed by a weaker Wall Street, where investors worried that a post-election rally meant that stocks were overvalued. Meanwhile, trading was thin with many investors already departing ahead of the weekend's Christmas break. Investors are inactive as the holiday is near, said Linus Yip, strategist at First Shanghai Securities Ltd, adding there was little news to change the market's sluggish trend. Yip said sentiment was also partly hurt by the weaknesses among Chinese companies listed in Hong Kong, with banks dragged down by persistent liquidity concerns on the mainland. Nearly all sectors in Hong Kong retreated at the lunch break, with financial stocks among the biggest decliners, down more than 1 percent. In China, markets were dampened by news the insurance regulator was making it much harder for insurers to get new licences, in the latest move to rein in some insurers' aggressive stock investments that have raised concerns. A recent bond scandal also weighed on sentiment after China's central bank asked its branches to look into entrusted bond holding agreements between some commercial banks and non-financial firms. Property stocks fell after President Xi Jinping said China's approach to regulating its red-hot property market would include financial, fiscal, tax, land, and regulatory measures as Beijing looks to develop a long-term mechanism for an industry prone to speculation. The markets wobble in a narrow range today, but room for further declines is limited, said Zhang Yanbin, an analyst at Zheshang Securities, adding that some state-owned enterprises (SOE) continued to benefit from Beijing's support of mixed-ownership reform. Energy shares received a boost from index heavyweight PetroChina Co Ltd, which climbed to a nearly one-year intraday high on restructuring hopes. But companies remain short of money as China's fiscal year-end on Dec. 31 is close, so they are unwilling to go long on stocks, Zhang said. Reporting by Jackie Cai and John Ruwitch; Editing by

"https://www.reuters.com/article/china-offshore-yuan-idUSL4N1EV1CF","China's offshore yuan hovers around one-month high, funding cost surges","","January 5, 2017 /  3:35 AM / in 7 months","","HONG KONG, Jan 5 (Reuters) - China's offshore yuan  retreated in Hong Kong after making its biggest gain in a year in overnight trade, but it was still hovering around a one-month high as surging funding costs forced yuan short sellers to square positions and stop losses. The offshore yuan changed hands at 6.8918 near midday. It rose 1.3 percent by the New York close to 6.8689 per dollar, its biggest gain since Jan. 11 last year, when it rose 1.5 percent. Short-term interest rate is too high now, with overnight borrowing cost of the yuan surpassing 40 percent, said Ngan Kim Man, deputy head of treasury at China Everbright Bank's Hong Kong branch. The overnight yuan borrowing rate in Hong Kong has been elevated since Christmas holiday and the fixing hit one-year high on Thursday at 38.34 percent, and that compared to 4.82 percent at the beginning of December. If yuan short sellers do not square their positions, they will see losses immediately as the funding cost is really high, Ngan said. The yuan is still under heavy depreciation pressure this year, and this expectation pushed investors, especially those in offshore markets, to build large short yuan positions to wait to collect profits. In 2016, the yuan weakened 6.63 percent against the dollar, its biggest move since 1994. China has been making great efforts to stabilise its currency ahead of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration and the Chinese New Year later this month by taking actions that affect both onshore and offshore markets. The People's Bank of China has set stronger than expected yuan daily midpoints for onshore trade and state banks were seen offering dollars in the past few days, in order to stop the yuan from falling too quickly and to stabilise market expectations. On Thursday, with the global dollar index easing from a 14-year peak, the PBOC set a much stronger yuan midpoint at 6.9307, marking the biggest daily strengthening in percentage terms since Dec. 6. The movement yesterday was not triggered by an outright intervention from PBOC. Alternatively, it is more like a knee-jerk reaction as there were massive stop-loss flows in the market, said Zhou Hao, senior EM economist at Commerzbank. These wild movements of USD-CNH indicate that the market will remain volatile in the short term, but won't change the fact that yuan is under pressure to weaken, Zhou said. Offshore market players say a shrinking yuan pool in Hong Kong, as fewer people are seeking yuan-denominated assets amid expectations the currency will weaken further, has also contributed to the volatility in offshore yuan rates. Yuan deposits in the world's biggest offshore yuan hub fell by 5.3 percent from a month earlier to 627.6 billion yuan ($90.23 billion) in November, the lowest level since January 2013. China's foreign exchange regulator said on Saturday that from the start of the year it would step up scrutiny on individual foreign currency purchases and strengthen punishment for illegal money outflows. The move reflects Beijing's concern over the high level of capital outflows in recent months, though individuals buying foreign currency was only a small part of the problem.

China's biggest lender by number of branches is now planning to price the IPO between HK$4.76 and HK$4.86 per share, Thomson Reuters publication IFR reported, citing people close to the deal. It had marketed the 12.1 billion new shares on offer in a range of HK$4.68–$5.18. PSBC declined to comment on its IPO pricing. The bank originally sought to raise up to HK$63 billion  ($8.1 billion), counting on its network of more than 40,000 branches and low level of non-performing loans to ask for a valuation higher than Chinese rivals. But many fund managers saw its valuations as too pricey. Its initial marketing range had valued the bank at a price-to-book ratio for 2016 of 0.94 to 1.02 times, far higher than the average of 0.76 for Hong Kong-listed banks. The price to book is relatively high, said Jasper Chan, assistant manager of corporate finance at Hong Kong brokerage Phillip Securities, which offers margin loans for retail investors to buy into IPOs in the city. Most of the banks are now trading below book, so it's not a good investment in the short term. Longer term, some clients may want to hold it because they think the bank will grow. Retail investor demand for margin loans to buy into PSBC's IPO totaled HK$83 million through Monday at Phillip Securities. By comparison, the $18 million listing of contractor Shun Wo Group Holdings Ltd (1591.HK) had HK$5.9 billion worth of margin loans at the brokerage. PSBC secured orders worth up to $5.86 billion from a group of six cornerstone investors, nearly three-quarters of the total IPO, signaling weak demand from a broad range of institutional investors. That would put it near the record 77 percent cornerstone tranche for the $810 million listing of China Development Bank Financial Leasing Co Ltd (1606.HK) in July. Cornerstone investors buy big chunks of IPOs on a preferential basis in exchange for pledging not to sell the shares for at least six months.

NIGERIA The naira is seen strengthening, helped by the central bank's decision to make it easier for small businesses to purchase dollars from the official window, and potentially cutting demand on the black market. On Tuesday, the central bank cut the amount of paperwork small and medium-size businesses must provide to buy dollars. The move was aimed at improving liquidity, cutting hurdles for businesses and helping narrow the gap between official and black market exchange rates. The naira was quoted at 395 to the dollar on the black market on Thursday, stronger from last Thursday's 410 per dollar. On the official window it was quoted at 315 a dollar against 306.20 last Thursday. The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) this week increased dollar sales to forex bureau operators to $40,000 each per week from $20,000 each previously, boosting liquidity and helping the naira to gain at the black market. KENYA The Kenyan shilling is projected to stay under pressure in the coming week due to end-month dollar demand from oil importers, traders said. At 1010 GMT, commercial banks quoted the shilling at 103.30/50 to the dollar, compared to last Thursday's close of 103.20/40. The shilling will remain under pressure next week as markets prepare for end-month demand, said a trader from a major commercial bank. Uganda The Ugandan shilling is expected to trade with a strengthening bias, as flat appetite for hard currency from importers forces banks to trim their long positions. At 1013 GMT commercial banks quoted the shilling at 3,605/3,615, stronger than last Thursday's close of 3,610/3,620. A trader from a leading commercial bank said regular hard currency buyers from sectors like telecoms and manufacturers don't seem to have much appetite lately ... probably because of slow sales. This, he said, would spur banks to cut back on their dollar holdings. Tanzania The Tanzanian shilling  will hold steady in the days ahead, a trader said, on the back of an expected uptick in appetite for dollars toward the end of the month. Commercial banks quoted the shilling at 2,237/2,242 to the dollar on Thursday, little changed from 2,230/2,240 a week ago. End of month dollar inflows are expected to bring some stability to the local currency next week, said Mohamed Laseko, a dealer at CRDB Bank. ZAMBIA The kwacha is seen trading in a firm position as companies convert some of their hard currency holdings in preparation for payment of salaries and other regular end-month obligations. At 1115 GMT on Thursday, the currency of Africa's No 2 copper producer was quoted at 9.3000 per dollar from a close of 9.4156 a week ago, according to Reuters data. There seems to be a fair amount of dollars coming into the market, which are able to sustain the demand for the greenback, the Zambian branch of South Africa's First National Bank (FNB) said in a note. Ghana Ghana's cedi is expected to be stable against the dollar on the back of hard currency inflows into a recent bond auction. Though demand for the greenback has been firm in the weeks leading to the Easter break, the inflow of dollars towards the recent bond issue has been more than enough to curtail it, said Joseph Biggles Amponsah of Dortis Research in Accra. The cedi touched record lows of 4.720 last month but it has since rebounded, in part due to what Amponsah said was renewed economic confidence following the annual budget speech last month. It stood at 4.1400/4.1600 to the dollar at 1211 GMT on Thursday, according to Thomson Reuters data. Reporting by Elias Biryabarema, Chris Mfula,; Oludare Mayowa,

In the consumer division, Bank of America managed to increase deposits at a lower cost and use those cheaper funds to fuel loan growth. That business posted profits higher than any other unit, and contributed more to the bottom line. Overall, Bank of America hit a target of spending 60 cents for every dollar of revenue it produces, down from 63 cents a year earlier. Investors have been watching that metric closely as a sign of how efficiently the bank is run. Bank of America, the second-largest U.S. lender by assets, is working to reduce annual operating expenses to $53 billion next year. This was a good quarter all around for BofA, said Evercore ISI analyst Glenn Schorr. You really have to look hard to find a few issues to talk about. Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan and Chief Financial Officer Paul Donofrio both characterized the second quarter as one of the best in the bank's history. These results tell us that responsible growth is working, Donofrio said in a call with journalists on Tuesday. Bank of America delivered net income of $4.9 billion, or 46 cents per share, up 11 percent from the year-ago period. Analysts had been expecting 43 cents, on average, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The bank's total revenue of $23.07 billion also beat the average analyst estimate of $21.78 billion. Its shares were slightly down at $23.98 in premarket trading, following a 8.4 percent year-to-date rise through Monday's close. Even as big banks have reported better results, investors have been disappointed that profits are not growing faster. Last week, shares of JPMorgan Chase & Co, Wells Fargo & Co and Citigroup Inc each fell after beating analysts' estimates, as did Goldman Sachs Group Inc on Tuesday. Gains across Bank of America's businesses were broad, but particularly in its consumer bank. The business reported loan growth across residential mortgages, credit cards and autos compared with the year-ago quarter. Even as interest rates rose during the quarter following a rate hike from the U.S. Federal Reserve, Bank of America managed to lure an additional $17 billion in deposits while paying less to attract those funds. Analysts consider Bank of America the most interest-rate sensitive among big U.S. banks because of the way its balance sheet is constructed in terms of loan maturities, types of funding and hedges. Its net interest income, which measures the difference between its cost of funding and the income it generates from those funds, rose 8.6 percent to $10.99 billion in the second quarter. Apart from its global markets unit, which suffered a downturn in trading like other Wall Street banks, Bank of America's other business lines also produced higher profits. Wealth and investment management reported record net income of $804 million, and a record pretax profit margin of 28 percent. Both the wealth business and retail brokerage, which sits inside the consumer business, attracted more assets. Global banking also earned more money, with growth in corporate and commercial loans, more revenue from transaction services and higher investment banking fees related to those customers. Non-interest expenses rose 1.7 percent, partly due to charges related to closing data centers. But the bank still managed to hit Moynihan's efficiency target and produced 5 percentage points of operating leverage, which measures how well a company can maintain revenue while cutting costs.

Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan spoke glowingly of a broad turnaround in the consumer business that began in 2009, calling its $2 billion in quarterly profit a milestone on a call with analysts on Tuesday.

Regulatory changes put into place following the 2008 financial crisis soon began to curtail revenue, as did strategic decisions like cutting back on business generated from third parties.

Muhammad Haniv, head of the specials cases branch in the tax office, said Google's refusal to cooperate after it was sent a letter in April requesting to be allowed to examine the company's tax reports had raised suspicions. He told a news conference that the probe would not be launched until the end of the month at the earliest. PT Google Indonesia, incorporated in 2011, said it was complying with the government. We continue to cooperate fully with local authorities and pay all applicable taxes, a Google Indonesia spokesman said in an emailed response to questions. The government had also asked to examine the tax reports of the Indonesian offices of three other U.S. Internet based companies - Yahoo YHOO.O, Twitter (TWTR.N) and Facebook (FB.O). Those three companies have complied, officials said. The Google logo adrons the entrance of Google Germany headquarters in Hamburg, Germany July 11, 2016. Picture taken July 11, 2016.Morris Mac MatzenYahoo and Google have formed Indonesian limited liability companies, while Twitter and Facebook operate branches of their Asia-Pacific offices in Indonesia.        The government believes these companies owe income and value added tax on billions of dollars of revenue they generate from advertising in Indonesia, the tax office said. Haniv said Google's Indonesian entity was only allocated around 4 percent of the total revenues generated from the country, and it was this amount that was taxed, which he described as too small and unfair. The communications ministry had estimated the value of digital advertising in Indonesia at about $800 million last year. The ministry said all of it was untaxed. There was no immediate explanation for the wide discrepancy of the two agencies' estimates for digital advertising revenue.     Indonesia is facing a sizeable revenue shortfall this year as the resource-rich country can no longer rely on commodity-related income. In a separate development, the tax office said it is checking whether Ford Motor Co (F.N) had avoided paying appropriate taxes, after a local newspaper reported that the U.S. car maker modified imported Everest model vehicles sold in Indonesia to pay a lower tax rate. If the car maker is proven to have caused state losses, it may have to pay back taxes of up to four times the amount it owed, according to Indonesian law. We have always strictly complied with all Indonesia government regulations and policy, including all import-related tax and customs requirements, related to each of our Ford vehicles officially marketed and sold in the country, a Ford spokesman said. Ford announced in January it is closing all operations in Southeast Asia's biggest economy, where it held less than a 1 percent market share.

Moscow and the Syrian army told rebel fighters this week to leave opposition-held neighborhoods with light weapons through two corridors by Friday evening, and said civilians would be allowed to evacuate by other exit points. There was no sign of any evacuations, however. I wish civilians would exit ... but I expect that won't happen, not under these circumstances, Fadi Ismail, an official based in Aleppo in Syria's reconciliation ministry, told Reuters via telephone. Ismail said fighters from al Qaeda's former Syria branch were preventing both rebels and civilians who wished to leave from doing so, and that factions appeared determined to fight on. Jabhat al-Nusra is in control of all of the crossings. For civilians, it's impossible to leave as long as Nusra controls the area, he said, referring to the group which now calls itself Jabhat Fateh al-Sham. We're communicating with civilians and even with some militants, the ones who want to leave. Unfortunately, when militants want to leave it's individual cases, not (entire) factions handing themselves over. Rebels say that Fateh al-Sham has a very small presence in Aleppo city itself, although the powerful group has been crucial for the fight against President Bashar al-Assad's forces and their allies more widely in Aleppo province. Ismail said prospects for a deal with rebels looked bleak, and he expected military action to resume if no one left on Friday. All the messages (from rebels) that I used to receive were 'we're coming for you with car bombs', he said. There was nothing to suggest reconciliation would happen. Asked what would happen if no one evacuated, he said: There must be military action, of course.  Russia is expected to resume its bombardment of Aleppo once the evacuation window closes later on Friday. Moscow says it has not launched air strikes on the city for more than two weeks as Damascus calls on rebels to leave. Insurgents have meanwhile launched a counter attack to try to break the siege on eastern Aleppo, which has been mostly surrounded by pro-government forces since July. Assad seeks the recapture of Aleppo as a strategic prize in the civil war, which is in its sixth year. Some 250,000 people are trapped in eastern Aleppo, and around 1.5 million live in the government-held western neighborhoods.

The comments by Mohammad Shah Alam, head of the Forensic Training Institute of the Bangladesh police's criminal investigation department, are the first sign that investigators have got a firm lead in one of the world's biggest cyber heists, which had prompted months of international finger-pointing. Arrests are soon likely, he said.  On Thursday, the head of a Bangladesh government panel that investigated the heist said five bank officials were guilty of negligence but that they were only unwitting accomplices. Alam told Reuters his investigations had discovered that some bank officials had knowingly created vulnerabilities in the bank's connection to the SWIFT global messaging and payments system.  Bangladesh Bank's SWIFT network was made insecure by some bank employees in connivance with some foreign people, he said. They knew what they were doing. He declined to name the suspects or say how many there were.  Alam said investigators were now trying to find out how the mid-ranking officials were connected to the hackers and whether they benefited financially from the heist. Asked if the officials would be arrested, he said: We are very close to it.     The apparent momentum comes after months of trading blame among Bangladesh Bank, the New York Fed, SWIFT, and a Philippine lender that received much of the stolen funds before they disappeared. The heist prompted an international probe headed by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation. Separately SWIFT, or the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, told Reuters its messaging system has been targeted in a meaningful number of other attacks this year using a similar approach as the Bangladesh incident. Bangladesh Bank spokesman Subhankar Saha declined to comment on Alam's comments. A New York Fed spokeswoman also declined comment.  Another investigator in Dhaka, who declined to be named, said more than 100 Bangladesh Bank employees had been interviewed in connection with the heist, and some were barred from leaving the country.  In early February, the hackers used the SWIFT network to send fake orders requesting the transfer of nearly $1 billion from Bangladesh Bank's account at the New York Fed.  Many of the transfer orders were blocked or reversed but, after a series of oversights and miscommunications, the New York Fed ultimately sent $81 million to four fake accounts in a branch of Rizal Commercial Banking Corp (RCBC) (RCB.PS) in the Philippines. Most of the funds then disappeared into Manila's loosely regulated casino industry. Additional reporting and writing by Krishna N.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/india-markets-weekahead-idUSKBN14005U","India Markets Weekahead: Will the rally hold?","","December 11, 2016 /  5:57 AM / 8 months ago","","REUTERS - By Ambareesh Baliga The Nifty rode on positive global cues to gain over 2 percent during the week to close at 8,262 despite the RBI disappointing investors by holding rates steady and a rather mixed message from the ECB.  U.S markets continued trade at record highs on expectations that the incoming Donald Trump administration will usher in tax cuts, deregulation and fiscal stimulus.  The rupee appreciated sharply against a basket of currencies after the RBI policy review. Despite a rise in the dollar index, the USD/INR pair broke the key support of 68 to settle near 67.5.  The RBI kept key interest rates steady due to an upside risk to inflation from an increase in commodity prices and withdrew the temporary 100 percent hike in the cash reserve ratio, which is likely to lead to a cut in bank lending rates.  The RBI believes that the impact of demonetisation would cause only short-term growth disruption, but cut the country’s growth estimate to 7.1 percent for FY17 from an earlier 7.6 percent. The ECB left interest rates unchanged and surprised markets by saying its quantitative easing programme consisting of extensive bond purchases will be extended for a longer-than-expected nine months. Markets, however, took a positive cue from this. Among the macro data announced during the week, IIP shrank an annual 1.9 percent in October despite being a festive month, worsening from a 0.7 percent rise in the previous month. This suggests an industrial recovery was elusive even before the government’s November decision to ban larger bank notes.  India's services sector activity declined sharply last month to 46.70 from 54.50 in October as cash shortage hit the sector. This would also get reflected in Q3 results which could be the worst for companies in many years.  SIAM has hinted that passenger vehicle OEMs are planning to cut down production cycles to manage inventories due to poor sales post demonetisation. We could have a nasty surprise with December sales data.   However, Maruti said it does not plan to take any production cuts given a waiting period of 6 months on its Baleno and Brezza cars. Hence there would be a clear distinction between models which have a waiting period and those which are off-the-shelf. The coming week is an important one as the much-awaited Federal Reserve's monetary policy statement is due on Wednesday. Economic growth in the U.S. has picked up in the second half of the year, with Q3 GDP coming in at a 2.9 percent. The labour market has shown strength and inflation has picked up. The odds are now in favour of a rate hike in what would be the Fed’s first such move in a year and only its second in nearly a decade. Investors will also keenly watch developments in the ongoing winter session of Parliament which ends on December 16.  On the demonetisation front, the pain still continues for citizens with never-ending queues at bank branches as well as at ATMs. Out of the nearly 15 trillion rupees in demonetised notes, about 12 trillion rupees have been deposited with banks till now. Does this mean people with black money have found a way to put most of their illegal cash back into the system? This is leading to the fear that the risk/reward of the cash crackdown may not favour the establishment.  The Nifty has moved beyond the 8,000-8,200 band but we could witness profit booking at higher levels as was witnessed on Friday. IIP data, which showed an unexpected contraction in October, will also cast its shadow when markets reopen on Monday. Utilise any upside to book partial profits."
"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-muslimbrotherhood-idUSKBN15D0VV","Trump administration debates designating Muslim Brotherhood as terrorist group","","January 29, 2017 /  4:35 PM / 6 months ago","","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A debate is under way in the Trump administration about whether the United States should declare the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization and subject it to U.S. sanctions, according to U.S. officials and people close to President Donald Trump's transition team. A faction led by Michael Flynn, Trump's National Security Advisor, wants to add the Brotherhood to the State Department and U.S. Treasury lists of foreign terrorist organizations, the sources said. I know it has been discussed. I'm in favor of it, said a Trump transition advisor, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue. The advisor said Flynn's team discussed adding the group to the U.S. list of terrorist groups but said it was ultimately unclear when or even if the administration ultimately would go ahead with such a move. Other Trump advisors, as well as many veteran national security, diplomatic, law enforcement and intelligence officials argue the Brotherhood has evolved peacefully in some countries, according to officials and people close to Trump's entourage. They worry that a U.S. move to designate the entire Brotherhood a terrorist group would complicate relations with Turkey, a key American ally in the fight against Islamic State, and where the Islamist-rooted AKP Party that dominates the Turkish government of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is in power. Tunisia's Islamist Ennahda Party has also participated in democratic elections. The Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, the country's oldest Islamist movement, was designated as a terrorist organization in that country in 2013. It is not clear which faction within the U.S. administration has the upper hand, and Senator Ted Cruz and Representative Mario Diaz-Balart this month introduced legislation to add the Brotherhood to the terrorist list. There was no immediate comment from the White House. Mixed Record Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates among others have designated the group on their terrorist lists, and Trump's nominee for Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, described the Brotherhood an an agent of radical Islam, during his Senate confirmation hearing. U.S. criminal law prohibits people in the United States from knowingly providing material support to designated terrorist organizations, and members of such groups are banned from entering the United States.Some conservative and anti-Muslim activists have argued for years that the Brotherhood, which was founded in Egypt in 1928 and sought to establish a worldwide Islamic caliphate by peaceful means, has been a breeding ground for terrorists. Some branches of the Brotherhood, including the Palestinian group Hamas, have engaged in anti-government violence and provoked violent government reactions. Ayman al-Zawahiri, the leader of al-Qaeda, was once a member of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood. Other offshoots in Turkey and Tunisia have forsworn violence and come to power by democratic means. Muslim Brotherhood President Mohammed Mursi became Egypt's first freely elected president in June 2012 in the aftermath of the ousting of long-time ruler Hosni Mubarak. An army takeover stripped Mursi of power in 2013 following mass protests against his rule. Hundreds of Islamists have since been killed and arrested. Sisi and Trump spoke by phone this week and the two leaders discussed ways to boost the fight against terrorism and extremism. A U.S. official who declined to be identified told Reuters there had been discussions at the State Department which looked at intelligence and information on the group in which it was thought it would be difficult to justify legally, in terms of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood, to meet the criteria. It's one thing to say one group's ideology has been used to influence a terrorist organization and another thing to say that this group is a terrorist organization, said the U.S. official. Following the Sept. 11, 2001, al Qaeda attacks on the United States, the George W. Bush administration launched investigations into the Brotherhood and related Islamist movements. After years of investigations, however, the U.S. and other governments, including Switzerland's, closed investigations of the Brotherhood leaders and financial group for lack of evidence, and removed most of the leaders from sanctions lists. A British government review into Egypt's outlawed Muslim Brotherhood published in December 2015 concluded that membership of or links to the political group should be considered a possible indicator of extremism but stopped short of recommending that it should be banned.

Federal prosecutors accused Sergio Cabral, 53, of leading a criminal organization that took 224 million reais ($66 million) in bribes from construction firms in exchange for infrastructure contracts from 2007 to 2014, the years he served as governor.  The projects included the renovation of the famed Maracana soccer stadium, where the final match of soccer's 2014 World Cup was held, along with public works in some of Rio's biggest slums and the construction of a major highway around the city's outskirts. Federal police and prosecutors are also investigating several infrastructure projects related to this year's Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro. They have not yet taken any action on those inquiries. As Cabral, the most powerful figure in Rio politics for the past decade, was driven out of the garage of his apartment building on Thursday morning in a black federal police SUV, dozens of people who had gathered hurled insults as TV cameramen and photographers encircled the vehicle. Cabral made no comment. His lawyer declined to comment when reached by phone. Following anti-corruption rallies, Cabral resigned his governorship in April 2014 with nine months left in his second term. Cabral's arrest capped the decline of the Rio de Janeiro branch of the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (PMDB), President Michel Temer's party, which was voted out of the city government last month amid graft probes into a number of its prominent figures. It creates a nervous environment which could delay our economic recovery if investors get cold feet, a presidential aide told Reuters. The aide also said the Rio state government was close to insolvency, and the Temer administration fears a domino effect hitting the finances of other Brazilian states. Adriana Ancelmo (L), wife of former Rio's governor Sergio Cabral arrives at the Federal Police headquarter to give a testimony in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, November 17, 2016.Ricardo MoraesCabral is the latest high-profile politician to be arrested in a two-year corruption probe known as operation Car Wash, which began by unraveling a massive political kickback scheme at state-run oil company Petrobras.  Cabral was a close ally of former President Dilma Rousseff, removed from office in August on charges of illegally using money from state banks to bankroll public spending, and former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, whose trial on corruption charges in the Petrobras probe begins on Monday. Executives from several construction firms have turned state's witness and the companies have signed leniency deals. That has provided testimony about endemic corruption in Brazil's political and business establishment, igniting dozens of new inquiries like the one resulting in Cabral's detention.  Slideshow (2 Images)Testimony from executives of the construction and engineering firms Andrade Gutierrez and Carioca Engenharia formed the basis of Thursday's arrests, prosecutors said. There are strong indications of the cartelization of works executed with federal resources, through the payment of bribes to Sergio Cabral and other (state) employees, federal prosecutor Lauro Coelho said.  Operation Car Wash also stoked the political upheaval that ultimately toppled leftist president Rousseff. Cabral's arrest is unlikely to hit the Temer administration directly, but it will fuel political instability as the investigation seems to be setting its sight on the PMDB and other parties, Leonardo Barreto of Brasilia-based consultancy Factual Informacao e Analise said.  Cabral's arrest came a day after another former Rio governor, Anthony Garotinho, was arrested for alleged voter fraud in a state struggling with a severe fiscal crisis and anti-austerity protests.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-japan-education-idUSKBN13X1UV","Japanese kindergarten teaches students pre-war ideals","","December 8, 2016 /  4:06 PM / 8 months ago","","TOKYO (Reuters) - At first glance, the Tsukamoto kindergarten looks like any other school in Japan, but its unique curriculum is reminiscent of pre-war Japan. The private school, which has been visited by Akie Abe, wife of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, aims to instil in its 3- to 5-year-old students a sense of patriotism with a curriculum focused on Japanese traditions and culture. Its mornings start with uniformed children singing the national anthem in front of the country's flag and reciting in stilted Japanese the pre-war Imperial Rescript on Education, containing commandments set out in 1890 to nurture ideal citizens under the Emperor Meiji. These embody Confucian virtues and demanded devotion to the emperor and sacrifice for the country. Be filial to your parents, affectionate to your brothers and sisters, they chant. Should emergencies arise, offer yourselves courageously to the state. After World War Two, occupying U.S. forces abolished the rescript, which many saw as a source of the obedience and moral certitude that helped fuel Japanese militarism. In 1947, the postwar government passed the Fundamental Law on Education to bolster the liberal and democratic values of the postwar pacifist constitution. Tsukamoto kindergarten, in Osaka, introduced the rescript 15 years ago, although school officials say it is not intended to fuel nationalism. What we're aiming to foster in education is patriotism or 'Japanese-ism', expanding Japan's spirit all over the world, not so-called nationalism. These are totally different, said Yasunori Kagoike, principal of the kindergarten. Kagoike heads the Osaka branch of Nippon Kaigi, or Japan Conference, a nationalist lobby group with close ties to Abe and his Cabinet and for which education reform is a key tenet.      A student stops to bow to a portrait of Japanese former Emperor Hirohito and Empress Kojun at Tsukamoto kindergarten in Osaka, Japan, November 30, 2016.Ha KwiyeonProtecting the Nation Cultural activities at the school, where the walls are lined with images of the imperial family to which students bow throughout the day, include learning traditional Japanese musical instruments, martial arts and board games. Students also take trips to military bases. Kagoike said he hopes other schools will adopt their curriculum so children are prepared to protect their nation against potential threats from other countries. If an imperialist nation is trying to harm Japan, we need to fight against it. For that, revising Article 9 of Japan's Constitution is indeed necessary and should be carried out as soon as possible, he said. Slideshow (2 Images)Article 9 of the U.S.-drafted constitution renounces war and, if read literally, bans the maintenance of armed forces, although Japan's military, called the Self-Defense Forces, has over 200,000 personnel and is equipped with high-tech weapons. Revising the constitution is one of the key policy targets of Abe's Liberal Democratic Party. His government has already stretched its limits to give the military a bigger role. Using an analogy of stopping a burglar getting into the house, teacher Chinami Kagoike - the principal's daughter - said she teaches students it is necessary to fight against such threats to protect themselves and their families.   Strengthening Japan would be subject to severe criticism from various countries, she said. But instead of pulling away from this, I teach children that the Japanese government has clearly demonstrated its will, so you also need to break silence and go forward and say you want to protect your family. The kindergarten plans to open a primary school next year and Akie Abe will be the honorary principal, according to school brochures. Michael Cucek, an adjunct professor at Temple University's Tokyo campus, said Abe's wife is often seen as a proxy for the prime minister, who during his first, 2006-2007 term oversaw the revision of the education law to put patriotism back in school curricula.

If we had to make our best guess today, there will be another decline in coal but it will be much less on a percentage basis and obviously much less on a dollar basis, Chief Executive Michael Ward told Reuters in an interview. The magnitude (of decline) will be nothing like this year. Ward spoke the day after CSX posted a better-than-expected profit despite falling freight volumes, in particular coal, where they were down 21 percent. Jim Corridore, a CFRA Research equity analyst, wrote in a client note after CSX's results that valuations across the rail group, and at CSX remain at the higher end of their historical ranges. We see no near-term catalyst for the shares to outperform the S&P; 500 .SPX.  U.S. railroads have seen coal volumes plummet since 2014 as utilities switched to burning cheaper natural gas. In addition, a strong U.S. dollar has hurt coal exports. Ward said the hot summer reduced coal inventories in the southern U.S. states to 105 days from 150 days and to 90 days from 95 days in northern sates - but historically they have been closer to 70 days and 55 days respectively.  The railroads need a long, cold winter to reduce inventories.  CSX executives told analysts on Thursday that fourth-quarter earnings should be flat to slightly down with freight volumes to be relatively flat. What we really need is some economic growth, Ward said. Basically for two years the U.S. industrial economy has been shrinking and what we need is for that to turn around.  Hurricane Matthew hit CSX's network last week, affecting 2,900 miles (4,667 km) out of 9,000 miles of CSX track across Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina, Ward said.  The railroad has restored service in Florida and Georgia, and on its main line through South Carolina and North Carolina, using generators. Some branch lines in both states, however, remain closed and some may be out of action for up to two weeks as flood waters slowly recede, he said.  Ward said he has put $1 million of his own money toward a fund for employees whose homes were damaged and said he has asked CSX to match his donation. CSX shares were up 2.7 percent at $31.03 in early afternoon trading. Reporting by Nick Carey; Editing by Alan Crosby"

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-banks-branches-idUSKCN0Z60BX","Britain's poorer communities, hit hardest by bank closures, may face shutout","","June 20, 2016 /  6:50 AM / a year ago","","LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's largest banks are disproportionately closing branches in the lowest-income areas while expanding in wealthier ones, taking bricks-and-mortar services away from communities where they are arguably needed most, an analysis by Reuters shows. HSBC (HSBA.L), Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L), Barclays (BARC.L) and Lloyds Banking Group (LLOY.L) are among banks that have cut 600 branches from April 2015 to April 2016.  More than 90 percent of the closures were in areas where the median household income is below the British average of 27,600 pounds ($39,042), according to an analysis of Office for National Statistics data on average incomes in the locations where branches were closed. By comparison, five out of the eight branches opened by these banks over the same period were in some of the wealthiest neighborhoods in Britain -- Chelsea, Canary Wharf, St Paul's, Marylebone and Clapham, all in the capital, London. The banks say in an era of falling revenues, they must look for ways to cut costs, which includes reducing staff as well as closing branches, an obvious measure as more and more people do their banking online. They say they choose which branches to close on the basis of where they have the fewest customers and deny they specifically target poorer areas. But campaigners say banks are cutting too fast in places where people are less able to fall back on digital banking services because of a lack of access, finances or ability to use the internet.    We are witnessing the creation of a dual financial system: one for the middle class and wealthy and another for the poor, said Fionn Travers Smith of Move Your Money, which campaigns for ethical banking. The situation is similar in the United States, where 1,600 branches closed in 2015, according to SNL financial. The result, according to a 2014 study by MIT economist Hoai-Luu Nguyen, is a decline in lending, especially in low-income areas. High Street bank branches are important to communities who use them for basic functions such as withdrawing money and cashing checks, politicians and business people told Reuters. The village of Cross Hands with a population of 4,500 in southwest Wales is a classic example. It is set to lose its last branch when the local Lloyds closes at the end of July.  Local businesspeople say the closure will mean they are forced to travel to nearby Tumble, a 90-minute round trip by infrequent buses for many residents without cars.  It's going to have a big financial impact as I will have to close the shop during that time, said Jo Payne, who is set to open a café in Cross Hands next month and will need to deposit cash takings, which cannot be done online. A worker passes a sign for Bank Street in the Canary Wharf financial district in London October 21, 2010.Luke MacGregorPayne said the loss of ATMs in the village from branch closures has also hurt business, as few shops take credit cards. About a third of cash machines now charge customers to withdraw money, and studies such as one by Nottingham University say when branches close, less-regulated financial institutions, including payday loan providers and cash-checking centers, fill the void at a higher cost to customers. If we want businesses to thrive in areas with scattered populations and lower incomes, they must keep at least the last bank in every community open, said Nia Griffith, Labour member of parliament for Llanelli and Shadow Secretary of State for Wales. With a population of 3 million, Wales has been plagued by high unemployment and poverty since the closure of coal mines in the 1980s. Western Wales and the Valleys has the highest level of poverty in northern Europe, with the average income at 67 percent of the European Union average, according to 2013 EU statistics. The large banks were three times more likely to shut a branch in Wales than in the southeast or London, the wealthiest areas of Britain, when closures were averaged out for the size of their populations, the Reuters analysis showed. The fact that poorer areas are being hit the worst by branch closures, means you're going to see a perfect storm making it harder for them to regenerate, said Jonathan Edwards, an MP for Carmarthen East and Dinefwr in southwest Wales.HSBC, Barclays, RBS and Lloyds say they have signed up to protocols aimed at minimizing the impact of branch closures, including partnering with the post office to offer services and carrying out impact studies before closures. Banks say they have not canceled any planned closures as a result of the studies, but have delayed some. 'HEART OF THE VILLAGE'Taxpayer-owned RBS has closed the most branches overall in the last year and is responsible for more than one in every three branch closures among the top four banks. Lenders are expected to accelerate the closure of branches because of new technology and cost-cutting; a study by investment bank UBS published in January predicted half of Britain's branches may disappear in the next five years. A senior executive at a top four British lender said banks are stripping out unprofitable parts of the network to focus on more affluent urban areas, where customers are likely to buy products such as savings and insurance to boost profit.The majority of branch closures will be this year and next, the executive said. Customer behavior (toward online banking) has evolved faster than we thought and it's about cutting back to the minimum scale that's needed. Yet government data shows about 8.6 million adults among Britain's 64 million population -- mainly the poor and the elderly -- do not have access to the internet because they are deterred by the costs or lack the expertise. A report on financial inclusion produced by the Financial Conduct Authority last month even predicted poorer people could be shut out from in-person banking. It is possible that, in the future, only the wealthy or those willing to pay for a personal service will be able to talk to bank staff in person, the report said.Laura Evans of Cross Hands estate agents Peters and Co said she typically visits the village's soon-to-be-closed branch twice a day to pay in hundreds of pounds worth of cash and cheques. Evans said she will now have to drive to Tumble, and fears what will happen if that bank closes too.  Older residents of the village she has spoken to have little interest in going online to do their banking, Evans said, and will feel the loss of the branch even more keenly. For older people it's a social occasion going in to the branch, she said. It takes the heart out of the village to close it.   Editing by Rachel Armstrong, Sinead Cruise and Sonya Hepinstall"
"https://www.reuters.com/article/saudi-oger-restructuring-arab-bank-idUSL5N1E02KS","Jordan investors set to buy Arab Bank stake after Saudi bid fades","","December 5, 2016 /  4:40 PM / 8 months ago","","AMMAN/DUBAI, Dec 5 (Reuters) - A Jordanian consortium has bid for Saudi Oger's 20 percent stake in Arab Bank Group  after the family of Saudi Arabia's Fawaz Alhokair dropped its own $1.1 billion offer, banking sources told Reuters on Monday. A deal with investors led by Arab Bank Group's chairman Sabih al Masri, a leading Jordanian businessmen with extensive holdings in banking and hotels, could be imminent, they said. The Alhokair family was in talks to buy the stake in the Jordan-based bank, one of the Arab world's largest privately owned banks, after construction giant Saudi Oger began seeking buyers to help ease cashflow problems brought on by difficulties in the Saudi building sector.. Saudi Oger is owned by the family of Lebanese Prime Minister-designate Saad al-Hariri and the Arab Bank sale was expected to help it repay a $1.03 billion loan from regional and international banks due to mature in February. The Alhokair family and Saudi Oger were not immediately available for comment. A transaction has been finalised. Sabih Masri has put together a Jordanian led deal to purchase the shares from Oger after the Alhokair offer played itself out, one source said, adding that the valuation was based on the bank's share price. Arab Bank's shares closed at 6.06 dinars ($8.5) on Monday and bankers said the Alhokair family's bid had been driven by the bank's stock market value being well below its book value. The banks' 40 percent stake in Saudi Arabia's Arab National Bank, was also a major attraction for the Alhokair family group, which is best known for its fashion retailing business. Two sources said the Jordanian consortium was not bidding with Alhokair and there was no auction. Alhokair is out for whatever reason and Sabih al Masri is in...it's not a competition. The Jordanian group did not come in with a higher price. There is no bidding war, one said. It was not clear what had ended an Alhokair deal, but Jordanian authorities, who consider Arab Bank a pillar of the country's economy, had resisted any non-Jordanian investor becoming the single largest shareholder in the bank. There has historically been a battle to keep the bank as Jordanian as possible. Whoever buys 20 percent and becomes the largest shareholder surely would influence it. This would have be alarming to the Jordanians, a senior financial source said. Jordan sought to prevent Hariri family business entities from dominating the bank nearly a decade ago and some board members had questioned why a foreign investor should buy the stake at a fire sale price, a third source said. Local investors were also angry that Alhokair was not seeking to buy the stake with its own money but mostly with cash raised from a banking syndicate, with the shares as collateral. Arab Bank's growth has long been tied to its regional and global expansion. The bank has assets of more than $46 billion, 600 branches on five continents and a reputation for withstanding political upheaval.   (Editing by Alexander Smith)"
"https://www.reuters.com/article/indonesia-freeport-idUSL3N1HK3BY","Indonesia eyes truce with Freeport as losses mount for both sides","","April 12, 2017 /  8:59 AM / 4 months ago","","JAKARTA (Reuters) - Losses amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars appear to be pushing the Indonesian government and mining giant Freeport McMoRan to resolve a row that has crippled operations at Grasberg, the world's richest copper mine, for three months. Freeport says it has lost revenue of about $1 billion since the export of copper concentrate from Grasberg was halted on Jan. 12 under new rules issued by the government. The government has lost millions of dollars in royalties and is worried about layoffs and a slowing economy in the restive Papua region, where the giant mine is located. There's a lot of grandstanding in public – that, with our economy being close to a $1 trillion a year now, Freeport is a small matter, said a senior Indonesian government official, who estimated the lost royalties and taxes from the mine at about $1 billion a year.  But truth be told, a $1 billion a year reduction in fiscal revenue is a lot, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Indonesia halted Freeport's copper concentrate exports under new rules that require the Phoenix, Arizona-based company to adopt a special license, pay new taxes and royalties, divest a 51 percent stake in its operations and relinquish arbitration rights. Freeport threatened in February to take the dispute to arbitration, saying the rules were in effect a form of expropriation. But now, Indonesia has promised to allow Freeport to export its copper concentrate once again, while negotiations continue over the next six months on contentious issues, including on divestment, economic and legal protection and smelting investment. The compromise comes ahead of a visit to Indonesia by U.S. Vice President Mike Pence next week. Pressure to resolve the row could also come from Freeport's third-biggest shareholder, activist investor Carl Icahn, who has been appointed a special adviser to President Donald Trump. For Indonesia, tensions at Grasberg could hamper its efforts to calm the Papua region, where a low-level insurgency has simmered for decades. The mine's social and environmental footprint also remains a source of friction. Papua's GDP growth is expected to drop to 3 percent this year due to the Freeport dispute, down from 9.21 percent in 2016, according to the Papua branch of Indonesia's central bank. A slump in Papua's economy could aggravate tensions with Jakarta, complicating efforts by President Joko Widodo to enforce policies to extract more from its natural resources. When there is a crisis at Freeport, it will send major ripples through Papuan society, said Achmad Sukarsono, an Indonesian expert at the Eurasia consultancy. Papua Economy In Timika, a sprawling town of around 250,000 people and a supply hub for Grasberg, the Freeport dispute has hit businesses, caused a slump in house prices and stalled credit, residents say.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-border-idUSKBN16021V","Conservative U.S. justices skeptical in cross-border shooting case","","February 21, 2017 /  4:41 PM / in 5 months","","(Reuters) - Conservative U.S. Supreme Court justices on Tuesday expressed skepticism about reviving a lawsuit filed by the family of a Mexican teenager against a U.S. Border Patrol agent who fatally shot the 15-year-old from across the border in Texas in 2010. Among the concerns raised by justices was whether non-U.S. citizens injured by drone attacks overseas that are directed from the United States could file similar claims if the lawsuit was allowed to move forward. In a closely watched case that could affect U.S. immigration actions under President Donald Trump's administration, the court's liberal justices expressed sympathy toward allowing the case to move forward, indicating the justices could be headed toward a 4-4 split. Such a ruling would leave in place a lower court's decision to throw out the civil rights claims against the agent, Jesus Mesa, filed by the family of Sergio Hernandez. The Supreme Court potentially could delay action on the case to see if Trump's nominee to fill a vacancy on the court, conservative appeals court judge Neil Gorsuch, is confirmed by the U.S. Senate. Gorsuch could then potentially cast the deciding vote. A ruling would normally be due by the end of June.  Justice Anthony Kennedy, a conservative who sometimes sides with the liberal justices in close cases and whose vote could be pivotal in this one, voiced doubt about the family's arguments during the court's hour-long argument. Kennedy indicated the question of how to compensate victims of cross-border shootings is one that the U.S. and Mexican governments should resolve. You've indicated that there's a problem all along the border. Why doesn't that counsel us that this is one of the most sensitive areas of foreign affairs where the political branches should discuss with Mexico what the solution ought to be?, Kennedy asked the Hernandez family's lawyer, Robert Hilliard. Chief Justice John Roberts, another conservative, brought up the sensitive question of whether U.S. officials could be sued for drone attacks overseas. How do you analyze the case of a drone strike in Iraq where the plane is piloted from Nevada? Why wouldn't the same analysis apply in that case? he asked Hilliard. The justices heard the case at a time that the security of the lengthy U.S.-Mexico border is a hot topic, with President Donald Trump moving forward with plans for a border wall he said is needed to combat illegal immigration. The case is one of three the justices currently are considering that concern the extent to which the U.S. Constitution provides rights to non-U.S. citizens. That issue has become more pressing in light of Trump's January order, put on hold by the courts, to block entry into the United States by people from seven Muslim-majority countries and refugees. Trump is preparing a rewritten version of the ban. The case raises several legal questions, including whether or not the U.S. Constitution's ban on unjustified deadly force applied to Hernandez because he was a Mexican citizen on Mexican soil when the shooting occurred in June 2010. The court could resolve the case by simply deciding not to apply a 1971 Supreme Court ruling in a case involving federal drug enforcement agents that allowed such lawsuits in limited circumstances. The court has been reluctant in subsequent cases to extend that ruling to other types of conduct. Kennedy seemed unwilling to take that step, saying the Hernandez shooting would be an extraordinary case in which to allow a lawsuit against a federal official. Liberal justices appeared more willing to examine whether some U.S. rights extend to border areas where the U.S. government exercises a certain amount of authority even beyond the border line, as it does in the culvert where Hernandez was killed. Justice Elena Kagan said it could be described as a no-man's land that is neither one thing or another thing. Likewise, Justice Stephen Breyer said the border area could be viewed as a special kind of physical place where U.S. law could extend in certain instances. Hernandez's lawyers cited a report by the Washington Monthly magazine that said over a five year period, border agents were involved in 10 cross-border shootings, killing six Mexican nationals. Justice Sonia Sotomayor, another liberal, said that in order to deter such shootings, why should there not be a civil remedy to ensure that border police are complying with the Constitution? The incident took place at a border crossing between El Paso, Texas and Ciudad Juarez, Mexico. The U.S. Border Patrol said at the time that Hernandez was pelting U.S. agents with rocks from the Mexican side of the Rio Grande before the shooting. U.S. authorities have asserted that Mesa shot Hernandez in self-defense. Lawyers for Hernandez's family disputed that account, saying he was playing a game with other teenagers in which they would run across a culvert from the Mexican side and touch the U.S. border fence before dashing back. The FBI also said Hernandez was a known immigrant smuggler who had been pressed into service by smuggling gangs that took advantage of his youth.  The family appealed a 2015 ruling by the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals throwing out the lawsuit."

Popolare di Vicenza, which is 99 percent owned by rescue fund Atlante after failing to raise cash in an initial share offering, is working on the plan and Chairman Gianni Mion said on Wednesday it could be ready in a couple of months. Atlante has said Popolare di Vicenza, like rival Veneto Banca which it also took over after a flopped share issue, have an unsustainable level of costs compared to their income. Mion said Popolare di Vicenza needed to convince unions that it would need to cut between 1,300 and 1,500 jobs, out of a total workforce of 5,400 employees as of the end of June. It's a big number, he told reporters on the sidelines of an event. We probably made a mistake by not saying it right away ... We're not in a position to wait.  Popolare di Vicenza reported a first-half loss of 795 million euros last month, adding to 2.2 billion euros in losses over the previous two years. To relaunch the bank we need more money, Mion said. The plan will clarify what the capital needs are and we'll see what Atlante can do and what other investors can do instead. Atlante has said it wants to sell its holdings in Popolare di Vicenza and Veneto Banca as soon as possible but must first clean up their balance sheets from soured debts. Mion said the bank had to solve its cost problems before looking for new investors. Popolare di Vicenza continued to discuss a possible merger with Veneto Banca, he said. The two banks risked buckling under a bad loan pile after a deep recession in Italy bankrupted thousands of small businesses. Like other Italian lenders, they need to close branches to cope with a stagnating economy and negative interest rates.  Both banks are being investigated for mis-selling their shares to hundreds of small shareholders who lost their money in the rescue by Atlante. The banks have said they are working with prosecutors to look into what happened. Popolare di Vicenza will hold a board meeting on Wednesday where it will discuss plans to pursue legal action against former executives over the mis-selling of shares and plans to hold talks with shareholder groups to reach settlements, Mion said.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-mnuchin-idUSKBN13O2W4","Trump expected to name former Goldman banker Mnuchin for Treasury: source","","November 29, 2016 /  10:47 PM / 8 months ago","","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President-elect Donald Trump is expected to name former Goldman Sachs partner and Hollywood financier Steven Mnuchin as his nominee for Treasury secretary, a source said on Tuesday, putting a Wall Street veteran in the top U.S. economic Cabinet post. Mnuchin, who was Trump's presidential campaign finance chairman, could be named as early as Wednesday, said a Republican source close to the decision. Mnuchin was chosen over several high-profile candidates, including JPMorgan Chase Chairman Jamie Dimon and Republican U.S. Representative Jeb Hensarling, chairman of the powerful House Financial Services Committee.  Mnuchin is the first person with extensive Wall Street experience to head the Treasury since his former boss, Henry Paulson, the former Goldman Sachs chief executive who served under President George W. Bush and steered Treasury through the chaotic initial stages of the 2008-2009 financial crisis. The current Treasury secretary, Jack Lew, worked for two years at Citigroup but has spent most of his career in government or academia. The selection of Mnuchin was first reported by The New York Times. A relatively little-known but successful private equity investor and hedge fund manager, Mnuchin spent 17 years at Goldman Sachs before leaving in 2002, when he launched Dune Capital Management. With Dune, Mnuchin has invested in movies produced by Rupert Murdoch's 20th Century Fox and Time Warner Inc's Warner Bros, including blockbusters Avatar, Mad Max: Fury Road and Suicide Squad.” Acquired Failed Bank The son of a Goldman Sachs partner who became an art dealer, Mnuchin worked hard to step outside his father's shadow and make a name for himself, former colleagues said, rising to become the firm's chief information officer in 1999. He wanted to prove that he was there on the merits, said a former Goldman colleague, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Mnuchin's experience running Goldman's mortgage-backed bond trading desk would later prove valuable when an opportunity arose in 2009 to buy the deeply discounted assets of failed California mortgage lender IndyMac Bank from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation during the financial crisis.  He assembled an investor group that included hedge fund  manager John Paulson to buy the assets for $1.55 billion, and moved to Los Angeles.  After rebranding the operation OneWest Bank, Mnuchin built it with other assets and professional sports team sponsorships into Southern California's largest bank, with 73 branches and $23 billion in assets. His group sold OneWest to CIT Group Inc last year for $3.4 billion. The bank came under fire for its foreclosure practices as housing advocacy groups accused it of being too quick to foreclose on struggling homeowners. In 2011, dozens of demonstrators descended on Mnuchin's $26.5 million home in the wealthy Bel Air neighborhood to protest OneWest's eviction tactics, according to the Los Angeles Times. This month, two housing groups filed a complaint asking the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to investigate complaints that OneWest engaged in discriminatory redlining practices against black and Latino communities. Mnuchin must be confirmed by the Senate and the top Democrat on the chamber's Finance Committee signaled he may be in for tough questioning. Given Mr. Mnuchin’s history of profiting off the victims of predatory lending, I look forward to asking him how his Treasury Department would work for Americans who are still waiting for the economic recovery to show up in their communities, Democratic Senator Ron Wyden said in a statement.  Although Mnuchin has a reputation for being a behind-the-scenes player in Hollywood, he appears on screen in the 2016 film Rules Don't Apply, according to the IMDB movie database. The drama, which opened in theaters on Nov. 23, stars Warren Beatty, who also wrote and directed the film.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-trump-idUSL1N1E711L","UPDATE 7-Exxon CEO could face struggle getting confirmed as Trump secretary of state","","December 12, 2016 /  6:53 PM / in 8 months","","(Updates with Tillerson chosen, Perry expected at energy) By Doina Chiacu and Gina Cherelus WASHINGTON/NEW YORK, Dec 12 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Chief Executive Rex Tillerson will be President-elect Donald Trump's choice as secretary of state, a source familiar with the matter said on Monday, but he could face a struggle getting confirmed by U.S. senators concerned about his close ties to Russia. Trump will announce his pick as secretary of state on Tuesday morning, and the source said it would be Tillerson. Trump called Republican Mitt Romney, another candidate for the top diplomatic job, to tell him he would not get it. Lawmakers from both major parties have raised questions about Tillerson and former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton, who has been mentioned as a possible No. 2 State Department official and has voiced hawkish views on Iraq and Iran. In a separate development, Trump is expected to pick former Texas Governor Rick Perry as his nominee for energy secretary, the source said. Perry met Trump on Monday at Trump Tower in New York. Republicans and Democrats said Tillerson, who is also president of Exxon Mobil Corp, would be asked about his ties to Russia, having met President Vladimir Putin several times. He won fresh praise from Moscow on Monday. In 2013, Putin bestowed a Russian state honor, the Order of Friendship, on Tillerson, citing his work strengthening cooperation in the energy sector. Senator John McCain, a leading foreign policy voice and 2008  Republican candidate for president, told Reuters in an interview: I have concerns. It's very well known that he has a very close relationship with Vladimir Putin. Calling Putin a KGB agent who is bent on restoring the Russian Empire, McCain said he would await confirmation hearings if Tillerson is nominated before making a judgment on the nomination. Another Republican, Senator Marco Rubio, who serves on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that would review a Tillerson nomination, has voiced similar worries. Renewed allegations of Russian hackers meddling in the Nov. 8 election, coupled with Trump's stated admiration of Putin, have stoked concern. Washington is at odds with Moscow over a range of issues that include Syria, Ukraine and NATO's presence in Eastern Europe. Trump, a Republican, is due to succeed Democratic President Barack Obama on Jan. 20. During Trump's presidential campaign, Democrats and longtime government officials voiced alarm when Trump repeatedly praised Putin. Bolton Also a Concern Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he was optimistic Trump's nominees would be confirmed by the Senate, but he declined to comment on any future nominees such as Tillerson. McConnell called all of Trump's choices so far pretty impressive. Senator Charles Schumer, the incoming Senate Democratic leader, told CBS This Morning that the bottom line is, every one of these nominees, particularly a guy like Tillerson, needs a thorough, thorough hearing. Talks about his closeness with Putin will come forward, Schumer said. Bolton has also generated bipartisan concern. On Sunday, Republican Senator Rand Paul said he would work to stop Bolton from being confirmed to any Trump administration post. His worldview is naive, Paul said on ABC's This Week. He still believes in regime change. He's still a big cheerleader for the Iraq war. He's promoted a nuclear attack by Israel on Iran. He wants to do regime change in Iran. In 2005, then-President George W. Bush installed Bolton as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations in a temporary recess appointment that sidestepped U.S. Senate confirmation. He took that step after Democrats used procedural rules in place at the time to block the nomination. Bolton left the job at the end of 2006 when the temporary appointment was ending. Senate rules have since changed, making it harder for a minority of senators to stop judicial and executive branch nominations. Additional reporting by Steve Holland, Matt Spetalnick and

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-arabs-summit-idUSKBN16Z29A","Arab leaders seek common ground at summit on Palestinian state","","March 28, 2017 /  4:08 PM / 4 months ago","","Dead Sea, JORDAN (Reuters) - Divided Arab leaders arriving in Jordan for a summit on Wednesday are seeking common ground to reaffirm their commitment to a Palestinian state, a longstanding goal that U.S. President Donald Trump last month put into doubt.  The Dead Sea meeting is expected to have a bigger turnout than recent Arab summits, Jordanian officials say, and security forces cast a high profile in the capital Amman with armored vehicles standing at traffic junctions as leaders flew in. While they are highly unlikely to bridge rifts over the regional role of Iran or intractable wars in Syria and Yemen, Arab leaders remain united in supporting a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  We are concerned that there should be an Arab consensus on the Palestinian file so that this reflects clearly in the discussions of Arab states and their leaders with the new American administration, Palestinian Foreign Minister Riyad al-Maliki told Reuters.  Before taking office in January, Trump promised to move the U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem - something adamantly opposed by Arabs as tantamount, in their view, to recognizing Israeli sovereignty over Jerusalem. The Palestinians want Arab East Jerusalem - which Israel captured in a 1967 war and later annexed in a move not recognized internationally - as the capital of a future state encompassing the Israeli-occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Israeli-Palestinian peace talks have been frozen since 2014.        Trump also, during a White House news conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last month, he indicated he was open to a one-state solution to the conflict. That would be deeply problematic for both sides, as it would mean either two systems for two peoples - something Palestinians would see as apartheid and endless occupation - or equal rights for all, which would compromise Israel’s Jewish character.  The Arab monarchs and presidents attending Wednesday's summit will meet at the Dead Sea, only a few km (miles) from the West Bank and with Israeli settlements visible to the naked eye.  The United States is sending a representative to the summit, Maliki said. Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi and Jordan's King Abdullah are both scheduled to meet Trump soon.  Jordan's King Abdullah II welcomes Prime Minister and Vice-President of the United Arab Emirates and ruler of Dubai Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum during a reception ceremony at the Queen Alia International Airport in Amman, Jordan March 28, 2017.Muhammad HamedA draft resolution on Jerusalem and seen by Reuters will require all Arab states to respond to any move by any country to move its embassy there, without specifying the United States.  The Palestinian issue is the central issue. It is the root cause of conflict in the region and its resolution is the key to peace and stability. We hope we will be able to again relaunch efforts that would get serious negotiations restarted again, said Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi.  Splits Over Iran, Wars in Yemen, Syria The biggest disagreement among Arab countries is over the regional role of Iran, an ally of Syria and Iraq and the Shi'ite Hezbollah movement that dominates Lebanon, but regarded by Saudi Arabia and some other Sunni Muslim states as a bitter adversary.  Slideshow (14 Images)Shi'ite Iran and Saudi Arabia support opposing sides in the civil wars in Syria and Yemen, which have caused humanitarian catastrophes, and in political and factional disputes simmering for years in Bahrain and Lebanon.  The Middle East's political feuds have stoked sectarian tensions between Islam's main Sunni and Shi'ite branches in recent years, contributing to increased militant violence.  We meet in a difficult Arab era dominated by crisis and conflicts that deprive our region of the security and stability they need to attain our people's rights, Safadi said in a meeting with fellow foreign ministers before the summit.  A Jordanian official told Reuters that the final statement from the summit was expected to include a condemnation of Iran for what it called meddling in internal Arab affairs, and to call on it to refrain from using force or threats. Iran denies any such interference.  A summit meeting of the Organization for Islamic Cooperation included a similar line in its final statement last year.  Friction also smolders between Saudi Arabia, the richest Arab state, and Egypt, the most populous one - close allies for decades before the 2011 Arab Spring uprisings - over approaches to Syria's war and the demarcation of their marine border.  The kingdom's oil giant Saudi Aramco resumed petroleum shipments to Egypt earlier this month, suggesting relations may be improving, and Egypt's Sisi is hoping for a bilateral meeting with King Salman in Amman this week.  There could actually be a product of the Arab summit - a unified attitude towards Washington's policy in Palestine. They might disagree on all other issues, but I think this is the unifying one, said Mustafa Alani, an Iraqi security expert with close ties to the Saudi Interior Ministry.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/global-forex-idUSL4N1IC1RE","FOREX-Dollar slips after Trump fires FBI director","","May 10, 2017 /  3:42 AM / in 3 months","","* Concerns about possible North Korean test also underpin yen * Dollar pressured as U.S. Treasury yields turn lower * Euro edges back toward 6-month highs touched after Macron's win TOKYO, May 10 (Reuters) - The dollar slid on Wednesday and the perceived safe-haven yen gained after U.S. President Donald Trump abruptly fired FBI Director James Comey in a move that shocked Washington and piqued investors' aversion to risk. Comey had been leading his agency's investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign and possible collusion with Trump's campaign. Democrats immediately accused Trump of having political motives. Any U.S. political uncertainty tends to weigh on the dollar, as a divided Congress could derail Trump's promised tax reform and stimulus steps. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, slipped 0.2 percent to 99.415 , moving away from Tuesday's three-week high of 99.688. The Comey news is being treated as a risk-off event, and the headlines were sparking the dollar's move down, said Bart Wakabayashi, branch manager for State Street Bank and Trust in Tokyo. The 'Trump trade' lifted the dollar after the election, but now we have to see if he can deliver on all of his promises, Wakabayashi said. Lower U.S. yields also pressured the dollar. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield slipped to 2.388 percent in Asian trade, down from Tuesday's U.S. close of 2.407 percent. It had scaled five-week peaks overnight, as interest rate futures priced in close to a 90 percent chance that the U.S. Federal Reserve will raise interest rates again at its next meeting in June. The dollar dipped 0.2 percent against its Japanese counterpart to 113.74 yen, below its overnight high of 114.325, which was its highest since March 15. Rekindled fears that North Korea could be gearing up for another weapons test also underpinned the yen. In the early morning hours of Asian trade, the yen started to strengthen, and it could have been the reaction of overseas markets to a North Korean diplomat's comments, said Mitsuo Imaizumi, Tokyo-based chief foreign-exchange strategist for Daiwa Securities. In an interview with Sky News on Tuesday, Pyongyang's ambassador to the UK, Choe Il, said North Korea is ready to conduct a sixth nuclear test. Strategists have said such a test was likely at some point in the future, but the remarks reminded markets that military tensions could escalate at any time on the Korean peninsula. South Korea's newly elected liberal leader Moon Jae-in, who will be sworn in on Wednesday, is expected to try to engage Pyongyang with dialogue and aid, breaking from his predecessor's hardline policies. With this in the background, as well as the present uncertainty in the U.S., the dollar will trade heavily today below the 114-yen level, Imaizumi said. The euro slipped 0.1 percent against the yen to 123.60 , moving away from Monday's one-year high of 124.58. Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda refrained from commenting on the exchange rate during a lower house fiscal and monetary policy committee meeting on Wednesday, but said a weak yen would help raise Japanese prices this fiscal year. Kuroda said he was not currently thinking about ways to change the BOJ's present policy mix. The euro added 0.2 percent to $1.0895, edging back toward a six-month high of $1.1024 hit on Monday, after centrist Emmanuel Macron's victory in the French presidential election on Sunday. European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi is scheduled to speak at the Dutch House of Representatives later on Wednesday. Investors will be waiting to see if he alters his dovish tone in light of recent strength in the euro zone economy. Reporting by Tokyo markets team; Editing by Simon

His neighbor in the apartment upstairs sold easily with an online agent. In London, says Ash, a house sells itself. What does a (traditional) estate agent contribute? A growing number of people are being attracted by the cut-price fees of online estate agents in Britain. The sector has caught the eye of big-name investors like fund manager Neil Woodford and traditional branch-based agencies which once dismissed online rivals are having to react. Mindful of the impact web-based start-ups have had on industries like gambling, taxi services and banking, traditional high-street agents are beefing up their own digital businesses, cutting fees and costs and cherry-picking the competition. You're (either) watching and wondering what's going to happen or you're going to step in and take action, says Ian Wilson, chief executive of estate agents Martin & Co, which has over 300 offices and in September said it would buy online rival EweMove. Fees from residential home sales in the UK are worth about 4 billion pounds a year, according to government data. Online agents' fees of between 500-1,000 pounds have pushed traditional estate agent commissions down to around 1.3 percent of the value of a sale from about 1.8 percent five years ago, according to analysts at UBS. They see fees falling further, to 1 percent. The industry is highly fragmented with the UK market leader Countrywide, which has 822 branches, having only a 5 percent market share. Rightmove, the country's top property portal reckons the many web-based agencies now account for 5 percent of its listings having doubled their share in two years. This may herald a wave of dealmaking. High street chain Connells, one of the UK's biggest players, bought online agency Hatched a year ago while Savills (SVS.L) bought a minority stake in Yopa in June. Second placed agency LSL Property Services owns the Your Move chain of branches. I can only see M&A; in the sector increasing exponentially, said Rachael Elliott at consultancy BCMS. We're at the beginning of seeing quite a boom.     Some online agencies underestimated the value customers place on local knowledge. A growing number like EweMove use a hybrid model with local property agents to provide valuations and advice but no costly branch network. As the pressure ratchets up Countrywide has responded with its own online business. It has also said it will close about 7 percent of its high street network as it looks to cut costs. Countrywide and another traditional bricks-and-mortar estate agent Foxtons, have reported declines in first-half profits and warned of tough times to come. Foxtons said its first-half profits had dropped 42 per cent from a year earlier, while LSL has also warned on full-year profits.  Shares in Foxtons and Countrywide have lost two-thirds of their value since early 2014, while LSL's have halved. The industry employs around 250,000 people. Rob Ellice, chief executive of easyProperty, backed by easyjet founder Stelios Haji-Ioannou, says it operates on about 20 percent of the staff of a traditional real estate agent. Purplebricks which launched in 2014, is the biggest online agency and was the first to list on the stockmarket just 19 months later. It is a hybrid operator backed by highly regarded Neil Woodford and says it is now the third biggest in the industry overall having overtaken Connells. UBS reckons it commands a 2 percent market share. Its value has risen from 240 million pounds to 321 million pounds. Industry leaders and analysts forecast online operators could capture 25-50 percent of the market by 2025. Just three or four players are likely to dominate the online segment, according to Patrick Brophy, who manages global real estate investments for Janus Capital and has invested in UK real estate agents.  Other leading online agents include emoov, HouseSimple which is backed by Charles Dunstone, the founder of mobile phone retailer Carphone Warehouse and Tepilo which was launched by television personality Sarah Beeny. Many other online estate agents like Houses.co.uk have tried their luck over the last decade and failed in the cut-throat market. Purplebricks has had to work hard for its success. It spends 1 million pounds a month on advertising and is currently lossmaking. It expects to become profitable this financial year. Unlike traditional players who only collect their fee when they sell a property, hybrid agents charge for listing a home whether or not it is sold, helping them to charge less.  While that can work in a booming market, it could prove a barrier when markets struggle. Traditional agencies say they still contribute valuable personal service and negotiation skills which will ultimately safeguard their business as they also invest in their technology. Britain's housing market weathered the initial shock of the vote to leave the European Union but confidence is forecast to dip.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hungary-soros-president-idUSKBN17C23M","Hungary's president signs law that could oust Soros-founded college","","April 10, 2017 /  5:53 PM / 4 months ago","","BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Hungary's president late on Monday signed legislation on foreign universities that could force a top international school founded by U.S. financier George Soros out of the country, triggering a fresh protest in Budapest against the move. Tens of thousands of Hungarians had rallied on Sunday in one of the biggest demonstrations against right-wing Prime Minister Viktor Orban's 7-year-old rule, denouncing a law that critics and opposition parties say targets the Central European University (CEU) set up by Soros, a Hungarian-born global campaigner for liberal open society. Late on Monday hundreds of protesters walked to the state radio office, in a spontaneous rally, and put up a European Union flag on the building, according to a video posted on local website Index. Protesters faced a line of police and Index said police used paprika spray on them. The protest ended about 0020 GMT on Tuesday. Another protest is scheduled for Wednesday. More than 500 leading international academics, including 17 Nobel Laureates, have come out in support of CEU, founded in Budapest in 1991 after the collapse of communism, saying it was one of the pre-eminent centers of thought in Hungary. President Janos Ader, a long-time political ally of Orban, said the legislation did not infringe academic freedom or international laws and urged the government to hold talks with universities. It is the interest of all of us that the value created at foreign universities in Hungary in the past years should continue and accumulate further and academic work should continue undisturbed, Ader told state news agency MTI. CEU said in a statement that it was willing to negotiate with the government to find a solution to enable it to stay in Budapest but that academic freedom was not negotiable. The legislation constitutes a premeditated political attack on a free institution that has been a proud part of Hungarian life for a quarter of a century, the statement said. We will oppose this legislation to the full extent of the law. Orban, who faces elections in 2018, is not expected to backtrack on the legislation as it constitutes a major plank of his political strategy defending national interests against what his government calls foreign meddling in Hungarian affairs. Orban, whose Fidesz party has a firm lead in opinion polls, has often vilified Soros, whose ideals are squarely at odds with the Hungarian premier's view that European culture is under an existential threat from migration and multiculturalism.  Disinformation Orban told parliament on Monday that there was a disinformation campaign under way against Hungary similar to the criticism it received from fellow European Union countries over its tough line against refugees and migrants. The government does not close down any universities and does not close down CEU either ... The aim of the government is to ensure that all universities are governed by the same rules and there should not be privileges, he said.  The new law requires foreign universities to have campuses both in Budapest and their home country. The CEU operates in Budapest but is the only international college with no branch outside Hungary. CEU has said its dual U.S.-Hungarian identity permitted it to comply with both Hungarian and U.S. laws and award both Hungarian and U.S.-accredited degrees. It has said it is committed to staying in Hungary.  After a similar protest a few years ago against a government plan to tax Internet traffic, Orban scrapped the move. But the situation with foreign universities is different, said Attila Juhasz, a political analyst at think tank Political Capital. This is a long-form strategy that they (Fidesz) want to maintain until the elections, so it is much more difficult to backtrack on this, Juhasz said. This is not just about CEU, this all fits into the campaign against Soros. This is part of the political ideology that is a foundation stone of Orban's system - national interests against foreign interests. Orban's right-wing government has been tightening up on dissent in other ways as well, proposing tighter rules on non-governmental organizations (NGOs), which will have to register with authorities if they have a yearly foreign income of 7.2 million forints ($25,000).

Freeport says it has lost revenue of about $1 billion since the export of copper concentrate from Grasberg was halted on Jan. 12 under new rules issued by the government. The government has lost millions of dollars in royalties and is worried about layoffs and a slowing economy in the restive Papua region, where the giant mine is located. There's a lot of grandstanding in public – that, with our economy being close to a $1 trillion a year now, Freeport is a small matter, said a senior Indonesian government official, who estimated the lost royalties and taxes from the mine at about $1 billion a year. But truth be told, a $1 billion a year reduction in fiscal revenue is a lot, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Indonesia halted Freeport's copper concentrate exports under new rules that require the Phoenix, Arizona-based company to adopt a special license, pay new taxes and royalties, divest a 51 percent stake in its operations and relinquish arbitration rights. Freeport threatened in February to take the dispute to arbitration, saying the rules were in effect a form of expropriation. But now, Indonesia has promised to allow Freeport to export its copper concentrate once again, while negotiations continue over the next six months on contentious issues, including on divestment, economic and legal protection and smelting investment. The compromise comes ahead of a visit to Indonesia by U.S. Vice President Mike Pence next week. Pressure to resolve the row could also come from Freeport's third-biggest shareholder, activist investor Carl Icahn, who has been appointed a special adviser to President Donald Trump. For Indonesia, tensions at Grasberg could hamper its efforts to calm the Papua region, where a low-level insurgency has simmered for decades. The mine's social and environmental footprint also remains a source of friction. Papua's GDP growth is expected to drop to 3 percent this year due to the Freeport dispute, down from 9.21 percent in 2016, according to the Papua branch of Indonesia's central bank. A slump in Papua's economy could aggravate tensions with Jakarta, complicating efforts by President Joko Widodo to enforce policies to extract more from its natural resources. When there is a crisis at Freeport, it will send major ripples through Papuan society, said Achmad Sukarsono, an Indonesian expert at the Eurasia consultancy. Papua Economy In Timika, a sprawling town of around 250,000 people and a supply hub for Grasberg, the Freeport dispute has hit businesses, caused a slump in house prices and stalled credit, residents say. Mastael Arobi, who owns a car rental business there, has cut his fleet by two-thirds because of slow business and is worried about the interest he pays on loans. We are half-dead thinking about repayments, he said. Transport operators in Timika had similar complaints, with a motorcycle taxi driver saying it was hard to make even a third of the up to 300,000 rupiah ($22.50) he used to make each day. Since these furloughs and layoffs began we have stopped providing credit to Freeport workers, said Joko Supriyono, a regional manager at Bank Papua in Timika, who said ATM transactions had declined by around two-thirds since January. Freeport, which employs more than 32,000 staff and contractors in Indonesia, has now demobilised just over 10 percent of its workforce, a number expected to grow until the dispute is resolved. Persipura, the main soccer club in Papua and one of Indonesia's most decorated teams, announced last month that Freeport, its top sponsor, had stopped its funding. Indonesian Vice President Jusuf Kalla said in a recent interview that while he did not anticipate political pressure, Washington should not politicise the Freeport issue. Another Indonesian government official said moves to allow Freeport to export temporarily were aimed at showing that the government is willing to find a solution, and to send a positive message, especially to foreign investors, who are watching the saga closely. We are not changing our stance. Our basic stance on 51 percent divestment, our demand for smelters - all that is still there. But in negotiations, you should give a little to assure the other side that we are still open to some options, said the official. The two sides had opted for a temporary solution to break a deadlock in issues that cannot be resolved quickly, said Bambang Gatot, Director General of Coal and Minerals in the mining ministry, A spokesman for Freeport Indonesia declined to comment on the warming ties with the government. A senior Freeport McMoRan executive said last week the company was awaiting details of a temporary export permit from the Indonesian government that would allow it to ramp up production.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-silkroad-northeast-idUSKBN1852PQ","For one Chinese city, new 'Silk Road' leaves old problems unsolved","","May 9, 2017 /  11:06 PM / 3 months ago","","HUNCHUN, China (Reuters) - In August, 2014, planners in the northeastern Chinese city of Hunchun argued in state media that it should be included in the One Belt, One Road project, Beijing's vision laid out the previous year of a new Silk Road across Asia to Europe. In 2015, the official Xinhua news agency ran stories about how Hunchun was accelerating its OBOR plans, and early in 2016, China's cabinet released a list of Chinese cities included in OBOR: Hunchun was on the map. The fact that the list came about slowly, and that some cities felt moved to lobby to be included, underlines how the pet project of Chinese President Xi Jinping is as amorphous as it is ambitious. The challenge of defining exactly what OBOR means will come to the fore later this month, when heads of state and senior officials from around the world gather in Beijing for the first major summit dedicated to the project. Frankly, I don't really know what the belt and the road are. The reason being that I think Beijing doesn't know either, said Tom Miller of Gavekal Dragonomics, who recently wrote a book on the New Silk Road. In theory, incentives for cities, companies and countries to be involved are strong: hundreds of billions of dollars are expected to be spent on roads, railways, pipelines, ports and industrial zones stretching from Sri Lanka to Djibouti. But as Hunchun shows, the reality of OBOR can be complicated and requires buy-in from other countries. The city's position at the apex of Russia, North Korea and China is a blessing and a curse. While Russia is gradually opening up to more trade, North Korea has stalled. Tantalisingly close to the sea but without a sea port after Russia's annexation in 1860, local businesses said they wanted to ship more goods via Rason, a nearby North Korean port earmarked as an export hub to China, Japan, South Korea and beyond. That would open a shipping route to southern China, but with sanctions in place against Pyongyang, global tensions rising over its arms program and Rason developing slowly, expectations of progress are low. We currently transport goods by rail to southern China. We'd like to ship from Rason, but at present that's not happening, said Wang Hai, general manager of Guanghai Import and Export Trading Company in Hunchun, a small firm with 12 staff, both Chinese and Russian. Hunchun is a hub for northeast Asia, so in theory it should play a big role in 'One Belt, One Road', but for now it hasn't been able to get its act together. (For a graphic on China's Hunchun city, click tmsnrt.rs/2qVcSJI) Russia More Promising? North Korea remains largely shut to the outside world, and China, while remaining its main economic and diplomatic backer, has signed up for tough U.N. sanctions against it. A view outside Guanghai Import and Export Trading Company in Hunchun, Jilin province, China, March 29, 2017. Picture taken March 29, 2017.Sue-Lin WongBut China said on Tuesday that North Korea would be sending a delegation to the upcoming OBOR summit. Russian President Vladimir Putin will also attend, reflecting his country's importance in China's OBOR strategy; in Hunchun, some enterprises are already seeing benefits from mutual trade. Xingyang Seafood, for example, imports 90 percent of its seafood from Russia and 10 percent from North Korea, said chairman Zhao Yang. The main advantage of being in Hunchun is that we are close to Russia, Yang told Reuters. The company is headquartered in northern China's Shandong province, but in 2015 it opened a branch in Hunchun to exploit its proximity to Russia. How does North Korea help us? It doesn't help us at all, they have hardly any seafood left there. Hunchun's spokesman Hao Qiang declined to comment about the city's relationship with North Korea, because of the current political situation, and would not say how many North Koreans were working in the city. But we can talk about Hunchun's trade with Russia, the city's clean air and successful tree-planting initiatives. In addition to oil and gas export opportunities between Russia and China, Putin has spoken of roads and bridges being built to strengthen links. Russia has struggled, however, to lure enough people to sparsely populated regions bordering China's northeast, and there are concerns among Russians of creeping colonization if too much land is leased to the Chinese. They (Chinese) will live there, their relatives will come, they will deepen their roots there, they will take Russian women as wives, firebrand opposition politician Vladimir Zhirinovsky said in 2015, when proposals to lease Russian land to Chinese farmers were put forward. We will only have problems. I see no advantages. For Hunchun, OBOR is the latest in a series of development programmes aimed at revitalising Jilin province and China's northeast. In the 1990s, the United Nations backed the Tumen River Area Development Project, which became the Greater Tumen Initiative linking China, Mongolia, South Korea and Russia. The benefits of large-scale state investment are clear. From 25th place among smaller cities in Jilin in terms of economic growth, Hunchun now stands third. Foreign trade has doubled since 2011, according to city statistics. Whether OBOR can add value over the longer term is uncertain, Peter Cai wrote in a report for the Lowy Institute, an Australian think-tank. If the Chinese government fails to connect its domestic projects with overseas components, OBOR will be little different from other domestic infrastructure programmes, greatly diminishing its economic and strategic value.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tesla-germany-idUSKBN17S28R","Tesla hikes pay to quell unrest at key German supplier","","April 26, 2017 /  4:09 PM / 3 months ago","","PRUEM, Germany (Reuters) - Luxury electric carmaker Tesla (TSLA.O) offered pay rises and job guarantees to defuse labor tensions at a key German supplier, whose founder and chief executive left the company late last month, German labor officials said on Wednesday. Klaus Grohmann, former head of Grohmann Engineering, a maker of automated manufacturing systems, has left the company, Tesla and German trade union IG Metall said on Wednesday.  Grohmann Engineering has helped Tesla rivals Daimler (DAIGn.DE) and BMW (BMWG.DE) build production facilities for electric car batteries. Tesla agreed to buy the company in November and it is key to the Silicon Valley carmaker's bid to succeed in the mass market by massively ramping up output. Since the takeover, Tesla has given job guarantees and pay rises to the firm's 700 employees in the small town of Pruem close to the Belgian border, under threat of strike action organized by IG Metall, the powerful labor union which dominates Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE). The union said job guarantees and the offer of employee stock options have significantly reduced the prospect of a strike. Still, IG Metall is demanding a collective wage bargaining contract and improved pay. The union has complained that pay at Grohmann is 25 to 30 percent below an industry-wide collective agreement for the metalworker electric industry. The head of Grohmann's works council, Uwe Herzig, said Tesla had offered another 1,000 euro ($1,089) one-off payment after Easter, on top of job guarantees, pay rises and stock options. In March Tesla offered employees a pay raise of 150 euros a month. This was followed up just before Easter with an offer of 10,000 euros in stock options for four years, and a pledge to guarantee jobs for five years, Herzig said. Herzig said Klaus Grohmann, under whose leadership Tesla had planned to run the business, retired at the end of last month. In November we were told that everything would remain the same, and then on March 31 we were surprised to hear that he will retire, Herzig told a news conference, adding Klaus Grohmann had not been seen at the company since then. A Tesla logo is seen in the dealership in Berlin, Germany, November 18, 2015.Hannibal Hanschke  - RTS7VPEHerzig said the founder's departure had been sudden and he had not had a chance to speak with Tesla Grohmann's new management, despite efforts to reach out. Tesla confirmed Klaus Grohmann's departure on Wednesday. Part of Mr. Grohmann's decision to work with Tesla was to prepare for his retirement and leave the company in capable hands for the future, a Tesla spokesperson said on Wednesday. Given the change in focus to Tesla projects, we mutually decided that it was the right time for the next generation of management to lead. A Klaus Grohmann listed in the German telephone directory as living close to Pruem was not immediately reachable by phone. Tesla has pledged to create an additional 1,000 jobs at Grohmann, which it has renamed Tesla Grohmann Automation, as it seeks to increase output to half a million vehicles next year from around 80,000 in 2016. The union wants to see Tesla's management adopt pay agreements and negotiating tactics more in line with what other workers in the metalworking industry are getting. Herzig said Tesla's acquisition of Grohmann made many workers leery that the company would now stop doing work for other customers, making it too dependent on Tesla's fortunes. We want additional guarantees given in more formal ways as an additional assurance to the workforce some parts of which need reassuring given the recent changes, Herzig told Reuters. Christian Schmitz, head of IG Metall's Trier branch, said concessions made by Tesla to guarantee jobs were encouraging but they were not the collective wage and job guarantees customary among German unionized workforces. Guarantees to individual workers are easier to rescind than collective wage deals that are binding for an entire workforce, Schmitz said.($1 = 0.9185 euro) Additional reporting by David Shepardson in Washington; Additional reporting and writing by Georgina Prodhan; Editing by Mark Potter, Chris Reese and David Gregorio"

Lloyds said underlying profit before tax was a better-than-expected 2.1 billion pounds ($2.70 billion), in what will likely be the lender's last earnings update before a return to full private ownership following its state bailout during the 2008 financial crisis. These results continue to demonstrate the strength of our customer focused, simple and low risk business model, Chief Executive Antonio Horta-Osorio said in a statement. The bank's shares were up 3.5 percent by 0721 GMT on Thursday, the best performer in the STOXX European Bank Index . Rival Royal Bank of Scotland was up 1.8 percent ahead of its own results announcement on Friday. Lloyds reported its net interest margin rose to 2.8 percent from 2.74 percent a year ago and said it expected the measure to hold at the new level this year, again defying expectations the key measure of profitability would dip on economic uncertainty. The bank said it had not seen signs of rising defaults among consumers using credit cards and other unsecured borrowing methods, an area the Bank of England said in January it was watching closely. Within unsecured we are not seeing signs of credit deterioration, consumer behaviour is holding up, Chief Financial Officer George Culmer told reporters on a conference call. The bank's common equity tier 1 ratio, a closely watched measure of balance sheet strength, now stands at 14.3 percent, making it one of the best capitalised lenders among its major European peers. Taxpayers have recouped all of the 20.3 billion pounds ($26 billion) invested in the bailout of Lloyds during the 2008 financial crisis, British finance minister Philip Hammond said last week. Britain's government, which has been selling off chunks of its shares every three or four weeks this year, plans to sell its small remaining stake in Lloyds in the coming months. The return to private ownership nine years on from the crisis would mark a sharp contrast in fortunes with rival Royal Bank of Scotland Group, which is still more than 70 percent taxpayer owned and has not made an annual profit since its own bailout. Provisions While Lloyds's booming profits in recent years signal its diverging fortunes from RBS since the 2008 crisis, it is still plagued by some of the costs from its behaviour in that era. Lloyds booked a 100 million pound charge on Thursday to pay for a compensation scheme for victims of a fraud by its HBOS unit for which six people were jailed this year. Britain's financial watchdog earlier this month said it has reopened its probe into the scam at the Reading branch of HBOS, in which two bankers siphoned off cash from struggling business clients. Chief Executive Horta-Osorio has apologised for the 'criminal behaviour' of its former employees. The bank also took a further 100 million pound charge to cover other misconduct issues. Lloyds set aside a previously-announced 350 million pounds to compensate customers mis-sold loan insurance, following an order by  Britain's financial watchdog in March that lenders should contact some customers whose claims had previously been rejected. The bank has so far set aside more than 17 billion pounds to pay customers back the cost of payment protection insurance, more than any other bank, in Britain's costliest consumer scandal.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-guantanamo-saudi-idUSKBN14P28W","Four Yemeni detainees transferred from Guantanamo to Saudi Arabia","","January 5, 2017 /  6:45 PM / 7 months ago","","RIYADH/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Pentagon sent four Yemeni detainees from the Guantanamo Bay military prison to Saudi Arabia on Thursday, launching President Barack Obama's final flurry of prisoner transfers despite Donald Trump's demand for a freeze. It was the first phase of Obama's plan to move as many as 19 prisoners to four countries - Oman, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and possibly Italy - to shrink Guantanamo's inmate population as much as possible before the Republican president-elect is sworn in on Jan. 20. There were emotional reunions with families at the royal airport in the capital Riyadh, with one man bending down to kiss his sobbing mother's feet as she cried God is great.  Fifty-five prisoners now remain at Guantanamo. About 40 will still be left by the time Obama leaves office, meaning that he will be unable to fulfill his longstanding pledge to close the controversial facility at the U.S. naval base in Cuba. Trump has vowed to keep it open and load it up with some bad dudes. The four Yemenis, all captured as part of the Afghanistan conflict and held without trial for up to 15 years, were on a U.S. list recommended for transfer. They were sent to Saudi Arabia because the Obama administration has ruled out returning Yemenis to their homeland, which is engulfed in civil war and has an active al Qaeda branch. The men were identified as Mohammed Rajab Sadiq Abu Ghanem, Salem Ahmed Hadi bin Kanad, Abdullah Yehya Yousef al-Shibli and Mohammed Bawazir. Bawazir was among prisoners who protested with a lengthy hunger strike. He was cleared for transfer by an inter-agency review in 2010 and was about to be sent to the Balkans last January but refused because he wanted to go to a country where he had family, a U.S. official said. Ghanem and Kanad were deemed too risky to release in 2010 but their cases were re-examined and both were declared eligible for transfer last year. Shibli was approved for transfer in 2010. A man kisses the head of a freed Yemeni detainee after his arrival at King Khalid International Airport in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.Faisal Al NasserFinal Transfers The Obama administration notified Congress last month of its intention to make up to 19 additional transfers, Reuters has reported. Detainees transferred on Thursday or due to leave in coming days make up the bulk of 23 prisoners declared to be safe for repatriation or resettlement. Slideshow (8 Images)Despite that, Trump said on Tuesday all of those held at Guantanamo should remain. These are extremely dangerous people and should not be allowed back onto the battlefield, he tweeted. The White House has dismissed his objections and said transfers from Guantanamo, opened by former President George W. Bush to hold terrorism suspects rounded up overseas after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, will continue until he takes office. Of the prisoners left at Guantanamo, 10 face charges in military commissions, including alleged plotters of the Sept. 11 attacks. About two dozen have not been charged but have been deemed too dangerous to release. It was unclear whether the four detainees who arrived in Saudi Arabia would be released immediately. Last April, the Islamic kingdom - a top U.S. ally - accepted nine Yemenis and put them through a government-run rehabilitation program that seeks to reintegrate militants into society. The United States coordinated with the government of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to ensure these transfers took place consistent with appropriate security and humane treatment measures,” the Pentagon said in a statement. Obama, who has called Guantanamo a recruiting tool for terrorists, has slowly whittled the number of detainees down from 242 when he took office. Under Bush, the prison came to symbolize harsh detention practices that opened the United States to accusations of torture. Obama's efforts to close the prison have been blocked by mostly Republican opposition in Congress, which has barred him from moving any prisoners to the U.S. mainland.

New York authorities on Friday slapped Mega International Commercial Bank with the fine for violations that included lax attention to risk exposure in Panama, the first time in a decade that a Taiwan-based financial institution has been penalized by U.S. authorities. The fine is a major embarrassment for the Taiwan government because Mega Financial, whose management has close ties to key government officials, is an industry pillar in the island's financial system. The disciplinary action comes as anti-money laundering (AML) controls at banks in Greater China are under intense scrutiny abroad, following a series of high-profile judicial investigations and regulatory probes in the United States and Europe. Taiwan authorities are examining documents from Mega Financial and its banking unit as part of the investigation, Chang Chieh-chin, deputy head prosecutor with the Taipei District Public Prosecutors Office, told Reuters by telephone.  The former chairman of Mega Financial Tsai Yeou-tsair is a defendant in the case and has been banned from traveling outside of Taiwan, Chang said, adding that current Chairman Shiu Kuang-si was asked into the prosecutors office late on Tuesday to assist with the investigation.  Tsai has quit as a board director of Cathay Financial Holding Co, another Taiwanese firm, due to personal reasons, Cathay said in a statement Tuesday. Prosecutors also are reviewing information from the island's finance ministry and Financial Supervisory Commission regarding the matter. We are gathering information and will review it to see if there has been any violation of criminal law in Taiwan, Chang said. The New York State Department of Financial Services (DFS) said Mega's U.S. compliance program was a hollow shell with insufficient transaction monitoring and reporting controls and inconsistent compliance policies. The bank's compliance staff also lacked familiarity with U.S. AML regulations while several were also conflicted because they held multiple roles, the DFS said in a court document. The DFS found that nearly $11.5 billion of credit transactions took place between Mega's New York and Panama branches in 2013 and 2014. The bank's head office was indifferent toward risks associated with transactions involving Panama, despite the fact it was recognized as a high risk jurisdiction, the DFS said in a statement.     Mega Financial chairman Shiu defended the bank's conduct, saying it did not help customers launder money overseas. Mega International Commercial's New York branch failed to report a suspect transaction to U.S. authorities, as required by law, he told Reuters.  Mega Financial Holding Company Executive Vice President and Compliance Officer Chen Chung-Hsing speaks during a news conference in Taipei, Taiwan August 23, 2016.Tyrone SiuMega's branch in Colon, Panama, had closed an account by a customer from Central or South America because it was deemed a suspicious account, he said.  When money was remitted to the shuttered account, the branch rejected and returned the funds to the originating bank, he said. However, under U.S. rules, remittances involving suspicious accounts must be declared to New York financial authorities, which Mega failed to do, he said. Mega Financial said in a statement that about 200 corporate customers are mentioned in the Panama Papers, most of whom are Taiwanese firms with offshore banking accounts. It said it was checking the identities of these customers. The leak earlier this year of more than 11.5 million documents, the so-called Panama Papers, put a spotlight on the shadowy world of offshore companies used for tax evasion, prompting authorities across the world to investigate possible financial wrongdoing by the rich and powerful. Slideshow (3 Images)Mega Financial shares slumped 6.3 percent on Monday, after news of the U.S. fine. They were down 0.2 percent on Tuesday.  Well-Connected Bank Mega International Commercial has two branches in Panama: one in Panama City since 1974 and one in the Colon Free Zone since 1982, according to the bank's website.  The bank, which was created from the merger of two state-run local banks more than a decade ago, is one of Taiwan's largest banks by asset size. It is viewed by analysts as a well-connected financial group and its head is appointed by the government. Shiu, the brother-in-law of Taiwan's central bank governor, was appointed by the finance ministry this month as chairman of Mega Financial. He had been its president till 2014, before leaving to join other state-run banks in Taiwan. Chinese banks' aggressive overseas expansion has met with a number of regulatory hurdles in recent years.  Last year the U.S. Federal Reserve instructed both Bank of China (BoC) and China Construction Bank Corp to improve their anti-money laundering (AML) procedures. In Spain, six Industrial and Commercial Bank of China bankers were arrested in February, suspected of facilitating money laundering and fraud. The bank has said it implemented AML regulations and operated strictly within the law. Many Chinese banks are now beefing up their risk management and compliance controls in response to the crackdown, Reuters reported in June.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/host-europe-loans-idUSL8N1DP41I","GoDaddy in exclusive talks to buy Host Europe: sources","","November 24, 2016 /  3:00 PM / 8 months ago","","LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. website domain name provider GoDaddy is in exclusive talks to buy peer Host Europe Group (HEG) as it seeks to expand in higher-margin businesses beyond the initial set-up of websites, people close to the matter said.  Arizona-based GoDaddy, the world's largest website address registrar, has branched into hosting websites itself for small businesses and consumers.  Founded in 1997, the company became well-known in the United States for its sometimes outrageous TV marketing campaigns with celebrities or during the Super Bowl and other sporting events. A purchase of HEG would help GoDaddy accelerate its shift into the more profitable web hosting business as well as broaden its customer base in Europe.  HEG, which serves mainly small and medium-sized businesses, is one of Europe's largest independent web hosting firms and could be valued at about 1.7 billion euros ($1.8 billion), or over 12 times its forecast 2016 core earnings of 140 million euros, people familiar with the matter have said previously.  In 2015, HEG posted like-for-like adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of 114 million euros on sales of 280 million. In 2017, Deutsche Bank estimates GoDaddy can generate nearly $1 billion in revenue from domains, $750 million from hosting and another $325 million from selling applications to help customers run businesses on the sites set up through GoDaddy.     The U.S.-based company, backed by private equity firms KKR and Silver Lake, trumped rival bids from German Internet service provider United Internet, which had teamed up with private equity firm Warburg Pincus [WP.UL], and a third bid by buyout firm Centerbridge, the sources said.  Deutsche Telekom this month withdrew from the bidding process, as did Permira, which teamed with Interoute, part-owned by investor Aleph Capital. Cinven, GoDaddy and KKR declined to comment. Silver Lake and HEG were not immediately available to comment. Cinven bought HEG in 2013 for 438 million pounds and expanded the business with acquisitions.  Banks, expected to include Barclays, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, Morgan Stanley and RBC, are lining up debt financing to back a potential deal between the two parties, totaling around 1.5 billion euros, or 4.5 times combined EBITDA, the sources said. If a deal is struck, the financing could be launched before the year end. A financing of this size would be welcomed by Europe’s very liquid leveraged loan market, which has been eager for new paper and event-driven deals as demand has far outweighed supply so far this year.

Chief Executive Bharat Masrani said the bank had pegged back its earnings target in Canada in the expectation that the country's economic output will remain modest in 2017 and 2018. We think it is prudent to moderate our medium term growth expectation for the Canadian retail segment from the 7 percent plus target identified at our investor day to mid-single digits, he told analysts on a conference call. Canada's second biggest bank said earnings, excluding one-off items, rose to C$1.22 per share in the fourth quarter to Oct. 31, from C$1.14 a year earlier, matching the average forecast of analysts, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Total net income, excluding one-off items, rose to C$2.35 billion from C$2.18 billion the year before. Net income at its Canadian business was flat at C$1.5 billion while net income at its U.S. retail business rose by 18 percent to C$701 million. Analysts said the bank's performance contrasted negatively with forecast-busting results by CIBC on Thursday and Bank of Nova Scotia earlier this week. Shares in TD closed on Thursday down 0.8 percent. The bank said its core tier 1 ratio, a key measure of its financial strength, stood at 10.4 percent at the end of October, the lowest of the four major Canadian banks to report fourth-quarter earnings so far. In an interview, Chief Financial Officer Riaz Ahmed said he was comfortable with the bank's capital strength. I think we're very well capitalised and I don't see any shareholder value in running it up unnecessarily, he said. Ahmed said he expected the bank to benefit from an improving U.S. economy during 2017. TD is one of the ten biggest banks in the United States, where it has a major retail presence with 1,300 branches. If these conditions are sustained into 2017, I think we'll be well poised to deliver inside our medium-term 7 to 10 percent earnings growth objective, he said. Ahmed said the bank continued to evaluate acquisition opportunities in the U.S. but rising valuations were deterring  deals. For the full year, net income, excluding one-off items, rose to C$9.29 billion from C$8.75 billion the year before. $1 = 1.3414 Canadian dollars

The pan-European STOXX 600 index fell 0.2 percent, following a 1.5 percent rise in the previous session. Building materials supplier Travis Perkins dropped 5.7 percent and was on track for its biggest daily loss since July after the firm warned its 2016 profit would be hit by a disappointing performance in its plumbing and heating business. The company also said that it would close more than 30 branches. It seems to be the suppliers that are really getting hit, Ken Odeluga, market analyst at City Index, said. On the secondary level of the home market, where you've got the materials providers, they may be seeing the first negative impact from the slide of the pound and the rise in the input and output costs. Consumer goods maker Reckitt Benckiser also fell, down 3.2 percent after reporting a bigger than expected slowdown in underlying third-quarter sales growth. The factors behind the subdued performance are as previously guided, so the South Korean litigation/de-stocking, a weak Russian performance and Hygiene growth hit the failure of a Scholl/Amope NPD initiative to land, Darren Shirley, analyst at Shore Capital Markets, said in a note. Price pressures and a drop in the value of sterling hit Dutch coatings and paints maker Akzo Nobel, which retreated 2.7 percent after reporting a slide in quarterly sales.

Italian yields also hit one-months lows, as the prospects of snap elections in Italy dimmed after former prime minister Matteo Renzi said on Sunday it was up to his successor to decide whether Italy should hold its next national election before the term of the current legislature ends in early 2018. Polls released over the last few days have shown Macron, a former economy minister running without the support of any traditional political party, extending his lead over the far-right's Marine Le Pen in a May presidential election runoff. Both would first have to get through the first round in April. Unease at Le Pen's strong showing in France's presidential race has hurt French government bonds in recent weeks, with her anti-euro stance unnerving investors. The election is held in two stages and Le Pen is expected to get more votes in the first round of voting than Macron or conservative Francois Fillon. But Macron is seen as ultimately coming out on top and his bid has been boosted by last week's alliance with centrist Francois Bayrou. Concerns about Le Pen gaining ground were also eased after French Socialist presidential candidate Benoit Hamon and hard-left candidate Jean-Luc Melenchon indicated on Sunday that they had failed to agree on a possible alliance. Christophe Caresche, head of the reformist branch of the Socialist party in the lower house of parliament, meanwhile told a newspaper on Sunday he would endorse Macron. Macron gained further support in the polls, said DZ Bank rates strategist Rene Albrecht. Another important point is that it looks like Hamon and Melenchon won't merge, so there is less of a chance that we will have a left-wing candidate that could outpace Macron or Fillon. France's 10-year bond yield fell as much as 4 basis points to a one-month low of 0.88 percent, outperforming top-rated German Bund yields, which were slightly higher on the day at 0.20 percent. That pushed the French/German yield gap to around 68 bps, its tightest level in over a week and down from around 84 bps last week -- the widest since late 2012. Italy's 10-year bond yield fell to a one-month low at 2.13 percent. Italian Factor In addition to easing French jitters, analysts said expectations for snap Italian elections, viewed as another key risk, had fallen after Renzi's weekend comments. My understanding is that the news from French domestic politics and polls are behind this re-pricing of (French bond) OATs, as are the more distant prospects for Italian elections -- now more likely to take place in autumn at the earliest, versus as soon as June that was feared before the weekend, said Commerzbank strategist David Schnautz. Renzi, who quit as premier in December, had earlier called for elections to be brought forward to June, eager for a swift return to office. With that in mind, he wanted to wrap up his ruling Democratic Party's (PD) leadership vote in early April to enable a snap ballot. But the PD said on Friday that it would hold its leadership contest only on April 30, a decision that effectively rules out any snap national election in June.

Tesla agreed to buy the company in November and it is key to the Silicon Valley carmaker's bid to succeed in the mass market by massively ramping up output. Since the takeover, Tesla has given job guarantees and pay rises to the firm's 700 employees in the small town of Pruem close to the Belgian border, under threat of strike action organized by IG Metall, the powerful labor union which dominates Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE). The union said job guarantees and the offer of employee stock options have significantly reduced the prospect of a strike. Still, IG Metall is demanding a collective wage bargaining contract and improved pay. The union has complained that pay at Grohmann is 25 to 30 percent below an industry-wide collective agreement for the metalworker electric industry. The head of Grohmann's works council, Uwe Herzig, said Tesla had offered another 1,000 euro ($1,089) one-off payment after Easter, on top of job guarantees, pay rises and stock options. In March Tesla offered employees a pay raise of 150 euros a month. This was followed up just before Easter with an offer of 10,000 euros in stock options for four years, and a pledge to guarantee jobs for five years, Herzig said. Herzig said Klaus Grohmann, under whose leadership Tesla had planned to run the business, retired at the end of last month. In November we were told that everything would remain the same, and then on March 31 we were surprised to hear that he will retire, Herzig told a news conference, adding Klaus Grohmann had not been seen at the company since then. A Tesla logo is seen in the dealership in Berlin, Germany, November 18, 2015.Hannibal Hanschke  - RTS7VPEHerzig said the founder's departure had been sudden and he had not had a chance to speak with Tesla Grohmann's new management, despite efforts to reach out. Tesla confirmed Klaus Grohmann's departure on Wednesday. Part of Mr. Grohmann's decision to work with Tesla was to prepare for his retirement and leave the company in capable hands for the future, a Tesla spokesperson said on Wednesday. Given the change in focus to Tesla projects, we mutually decided that it was the right time for the next generation of management to lead. A Klaus Grohmann listed in the German telephone directory as living close to Pruem was not immediately reachable by phone. Tesla has pledged to create an additional 1,000 jobs at Grohmann, which it has renamed Tesla Grohmann Automation, as it seeks to increase output to half a million vehicles next year from around 80,000 in 2016. The union wants to see Tesla's management adopt pay agreements and negotiating tactics more in line with what other workers in the metalworking industry are getting. Herzig said Tesla's acquisition of Grohmann made many workers leery that the company would now stop doing work for other customers, making it too dependent on Tesla's fortunes. We want additional guarantees given in more formal ways as an additional assurance to the workforce some parts of which need reassuring given the recent changes, Herzig told Reuters. Christian Schmitz, head of IG Metall's Trier branch, said concessions made by Tesla to guarantee jobs were encouraging but they were not the collective wage and job guarantees customary among German unionized workforces. Guarantees to individual workers are easier to rescind than collective wage deals that are binding for an entire workforce, Schmitz said.($1 = 0.9185 euro) Additional reporting by David Shepardson in Washington; Additional reporting and writing by Georgina Prodhan; Editing by Mark Potter, Chris Reese and David Gregorio"

European stocks were headed for a subdued start, with financial spreadbetter CMC Markets expecting Britain's FTSE 100 and France's CAC 40 to open flat. Germany's DAX is predicted to start the day down 0.1 percent. Oil fell back following a brief recovery after Saudi Arabia and several other Arab states severed ties with Qatar, accusing it of supporting extremism and undermining regional stability. A potential risk to monitor might be that Qatar will view this as being provided with less encouragement to comply with the agreed (OPEC) production quota, said Jameel Ahmad of futures brokerage FXTM. Stocks in Qatar plunged more than 8 percent overnight to their lowest since January 2016. U.S. crude was 0.5 percent lower at $47.18 a barrel on Tuesday, after falling 0.55 percent on Monday. Global benchmark Brent retreated 0.4 percent to $49.26, extending Monday's 1 percent slide. The dollar index touched a seven-month low ahead of testimony before the U.S. Congress from former FBI director James Comey on Thursday. There will be intense interest in what Comey might say about his conversations with U.S. President Donald Trump about an investigation into former National Security Advisor Mike Flynn, who was fired for failing to disclose conversations with Russian officials. The dollar is already on the defensive after Friday's jobs data, and now it's facing potential geopolitical risk in the form of Comey's testimony, said Bart Wakabayashi, Tokyo Branch Manager of State Street Bank. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of trade-weighted peers, fell to its lowest level since the November U.S. election. At 0524 GMT, it was down 0.2 percent, to 96.611. The dollar slid 0.5 percent to 109.90 yen on Tuesday, close to the six-week low hit earlier in the session. News on Monday of U.S. services sector activity slowing in May as new orders tumbled also hit the dollar. The dollar further came under pressure from a stronger euro, on expectations the European Central Bank will take a less dovish tone than in the past at its Thursday meeting. The ECB may even discuss dropping some of its pledges to ramp up stimulus if needed, four people with direct knowledge of the discussions told Reuters last week. The common currency was 0.1 percent higher at $1.127 on Tuesday. Sterling advanced 0.2 percent to $1.293 on Tuesday. The lead of British Prime Minister Theresa May over the opposition Labour Party ahead of Thursday's general election has narrowed to just 1 percentage point, according to a poll conducted before the attacks in London on Saturday. Other polls in recent days have found bigger leads for the Conservatives of up to 11 and 12 points. Even if May does just about enough to increase the majority - that could still potentially be sterling positive, said ING currency strategist Viraj Patel. The weaker dollar lifted gold, with spot gold hitting a six-week high earlier on Tuesday and last trading up 0.4 percent at $1,284.74 an ounce. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan lost 0.15 percent, pulling back from a two-year high hit on Monday. Japan's Nikkei dropped 0.6 percent, tripped by a stronger yen. South Korean markets were closed for a holiday. Australian shares tumbled 1.4 percent. The Australian dollar pared earlier losses - made after the second-quarter current account deficit disappointed investors hoping for a surplus - to trade flat at $0.7489 after the Reserve Bank of Australia kept its benchmark rate at a record low 1.5 percent, as expected. Chinese shares and Hong Kong shares bucked the trend, rising almost 0.1 percent and 0.35 percent respectively. Overnight, Wall Street indexes slipped between 0.1 percent and 0.2 percent, with Apple Inc. leading losses on the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-healthcare-idUSL1N1JO09F","Facing revolt on healthcare bill, U.S. Senate Republicans delay vote","","June 27, 2017 /  10:10 AM / a month ago","","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Republican leaders postponed a vote on a healthcare overhaul on Tuesday after resistance from members of their own party, and President Donald Trump summoned Republican senators to the White House to urge them to break the impasse. The delay put the future of a longtime top Republican priority in doubt amid concerns about the Senate bill from both moderate and conservative Republicans. With Democrats united in their opposition, Republicans can afford to lose only two votes among their own ranks in the Senate. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had been pushing for a vote ahead of the July 4 recess that starts at the end of the week. The legislation would repeal major elements of Obamacare and shrink the Medicaid government healthcare program for the poor. We're going to press on, McConnell said after announcing the delay, adding that leaders would keep working to make senators comfortable with the bill. We're optimistic we're going to get to a result that is better than the status quo. At the White House meeting with most of the 52 Republican senators, Trump said it was vital to reach agreement on the Senate healthcare measure because Obamacare was melting down.  So we're going to talk and we're going to see what we can do. We're getting very close, Trump told the senators. But he added, If we don't get it done, it's just going to be something that we're not going to like, and that's okay. McConnell, whose party has a razor-thin majority in the 100-member Senate, told reporters that Republican leaders would work through the week to win over the 50 senators needed to pass the bill, with a vote planned after the recess. Vice President Mike Pence could provide the crucial vote needed to break a tie. I think we can get 50 votes to yes by the end of the week, Republican Senator Roger Wicker said after the White House meeting. Related CoverageTop Senate Republican expresses optimism on healthcare bill after Trump meetingRepublican Opposition Grows The House of Representatives last month passed its own version of a healthcare bill, but the Senate bill has been criticized from both the left and the right. Moderate Republicans worried millions of people would lose their insurance. Conservatives said the bill does not do enough to erase Obamacare. The bill's prospects were not helped by a Congressional Budget Office analysis on Monday saying it would cause 22 million Americans to lose insurance over the next decade, although it would reduce the federal deficit by $321 billion over that period. The report prompted Senator Susan Collins, a Republican moderate, to say she could not support the bill as it stands. At least four conservative Republican senators said they were still opposed after the CBO analysis. U.S. President Donald Trump meets with Senate Republicans about healthcare in the East Room of the White House in Washington, U.S., June 27, 2017. Trump is flanked by Senators Susan Collins (R-ME) and Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK).Kevin LamarqueThree more Republicans, Rob Portman of Ohio, Jerry Moran of Kansas and Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, said after the delay was announced that they oppose the current draft. Portman and Capito cited the bill's Medicaid cutbacks and how that would hurt efforts to combat the opioid epidemic that has taken a heavy toll in their states. The Medicaid program was expanded under former President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law. I think giving time to digest is a good thing, Republican Senator Bob Corker said after the delay was announced. Uncertainty on Wall Street Slideshow (12 Images)U.S. stock prices fell, as the decision to postpone the vote added to investor worries about Trump's ability to deliver on his promises of tax reform and deregulation, as well as changes to the health sector. Those expected changes have driven a rally in U.S. stocks this year. The benchmark S&P; 500 index closed down 0.8 percent, and the Dow Jones industrial average finished down 0.46 percent. “The market likes certainty and now there’s uncertainty. What is this going to look like when this gets out of the next iteration? said Peter Costa, president of trading firm Empire Executions Inc. Passing the measure would be a win for Trump as he seeks to shift attention after weeks of questions over Russia's role in last year's U.S. presidential election. McConnell has promised since 2010 that Republicans, who view Obamacare as a costly government intrusion, would destroy the law root and branch if they controlled Congress and the White House. Republicans worry a failure to deliver will cost them votes in next year's congressional elections. If the Senate passes a healthcare bill, it will either have to be approved by the House or the two chambers would reconcile the differences in a conference committee. Otherwise, the House could pass a new version and send it back to the Senate. Lawmakers are expected to leave town by Friday for their July 4 holiday break, which runs all next week. The Senate returns to work on July 10, the House on July 11. Lawmakers then have three weeks in session before their month-long August recess.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-otc-trump-idUSKBN18J2VY","Watergate, Whitewater precedent sets stage for Russia probe","","May 23, 2017 /  8:25 PM / 2 months ago","","(Reuters) - On Monday, lawyers for former Trump administration national security adviser Michael Flynn informed the Senate Intelligence Committee that Flynn does not intend to produce documents subpoenaed by the committee. In a six-page letter explaining why, Flynn’s counsel from Covington & Burling cited (among other cases) the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2000 decision in U.S. v. Hubbell, which held that a witness can’t be compelled to respond to a subpoena so broad that it amounts to a prosecutorial fishing expedition.  The Hubbell precedent, as you’ve probably guessed, involved onetime Clinton Associate Attorney General Webb Hubbell, who was implicated in the Whitewater investigation and ended up pleading guilty to two felonies. The case is one of at least three Supreme Court decisions in previous presidential investigations that’s likely to get a vigorous re-airing as Congress and special counsel Robert Mueller delve into possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russian officials.  The most famous of the old Supreme Court cases is, of course, U.S. v. Nixon, the 1974 ruling in which the justices ordered President Nixon to turn over documents and audiotapes to Watergate special prosecutor Leon Jaworski. The Nixon decision restricted the president’s right to claim executive privilege to shield his communications with close aides.  Generally, those communications are presumed to be cloaked under confidentiality, but the Supreme Court said executive privilege is qualified, not absolute, and can be overcome in a criminal investigation. As I wrote earlier this month, the Trump administration made noises about asserting executive privilege to block testimony by fired Acting Attorney General Sally Yates, although it ended up backing down.  There’s been conjecture that the White House might assert privilege to shield the president’s conversations with fired FBI director James Comey. If it does, legal scholars told me, the Trump administration is likely to lose under the Nixon precedent.  The president’s communications with White House lawyers may also be exposed, thanks to the Supreme Court’s 1998 decision in In re Lindsey. The Lindsey case, like the Hubbell precedent, stems from independent counsel Ken Starr’s long-running Whitewater investigation. The grand jury looking into President Clinton’s affair with Monica Lewinsky subpoenaed Deputy White House counsel Bruce Lindsey to testify. Lindsey refused to answer some questions, citing the president’s attorney-client privilege.  The Supreme Court concluded, however, that government lawyers “stand in a far different position from members of the private bar,” the justices said. “When an executive branch attorney is called before a federal grand jury to give evidence about alleged crimes within the executive branch, reason and experience, duty and tradition dictate that the attorney shall provide that evidence.”  In contrast to the Nixon and Lindsey decisions, the Hubbell opinion that Flynn’s lawyers cited Monday curbed a presidential inquisition rather than the president’s power to resist a special investigation. In that case, independent counsel Starr issued a sweeping subpoena for documents from Hubbell, who had already pled guilty to overbilling clients of the Rose Law Firm before he joined the Clinton administration. Hubbell’s plea agreement required him to cooperate in the Clinton investigation, but Starr’s team suspected he hadn’t turned over everything he had.  When Hubbell cited his Fifth Amendment right and balked at complying with the subpoena, the independent investigator granted him immunity and obtained a court order directing him to produce the demanded documents. Hubbell turned over more than 13,000 pages – and ended up facing a new indictment for tax and fraud charges.  The Supreme Court agreed with Starr that witnesses can be compelled, despite the Fifth Amendment, to turn over subpoenaed documents that may contain incriminating evidence. But the justices also said that the act of producing documents may be akin to testifying, when the production confirms the existence and authenticity of otherwise unknown documents sought in a broad subpoena. In those circumstances, the court ruled, witnesses have a Fifth Amendment right not to testify against themselves.  “The constitutional privilege against self-incrimination protects the target of a grand jury investigation from being compelled to answer questions designed to elicit information about the existence of sources of potentially incriminating evidence,” the Supreme Court said in dismissing the new Hubbell indictment. “That constitutional privilege has the same application to the testimonial aspect of a response to a subpoena seeking discovery of those sources.”  According to Flynn’s lawyers, the Senate Intelligence Committee’s subpoena to their client is as overly broad as Starr’s to Hubbell. “The committee does not know whether responsive documents exist, who may possess them, or where they are located,” the letter said. “This is precisely the sort of testimonial information that the Fifth Amendment privilege is designed to protect from compelled disclosure.”  The Senate Committee is reportedly weighing its response to the Flynn letter. (No response had been announced by mid-afternoon on Tuesday.) Options include civil or criminal contempt proceedings. Flynn counsel Robert Kelner of Covington declined to comment.  As test cases on presidential power to limit the damage from special investigations, Nixon, Lindsey and Hubbell are in a club no one wants to join. But I suspect we are going to hear a lot about them as the Russia investigations move along."

The National Policy Institute, a think tank that is part of the alt-right movement that includes neo-Nazis, white supremacists and anti-Semites, held a gathering at the federally owned Ronald Reagan Building on Saturday. The alt-right movement came to the fore during the U.S. presidential election. President-elect Donald Trump has drawn criticism for naming Steve Bannon, former head of a website linked to the alt-right, as his chief White House strategist.  Trump's transition team issued a statement on Monday saying Trump has continued to denounce racism, CNN reported. President-elect Trump has continued to denounce racism of any kind and he was elected because he will be a leader for every American, Trump-Pence Transition spokesman Bryan Lanza said in a statement.  The gathering on Saturday drew scores of protesters who blocked traffic around the building to express their outrage over the meeting.  A video by The Atlantic taken inside the conference showed Richard Spencer, leader of the National Policy Institute, shouting, Hail Trump, hail our people, hail victory! as some of the people in attendance lifted their hands in a Nazi salute. The Holocaust did not begin with killings: it began with words, the Holocaust Memorial Museum said in a statement. The museum calls on all American citizens, our religious and civic leaders and the leadership of all branches of the government to confront racist thinking and divisive hateful speech. Some of those who attended the nationalist meeting later gathered for a banquet at Maggiano's Little Italy restaurant in northwest Washington. Protesters converged on the site and prompted the restaurant to close to protect the safety of staff and guests, the management said in an apology on Facebook. The restaurant said the booking was a last-minute affair made under a different name, so staff were unaware that the National Policy Institute was dining there and did not know what the group represented. After the event, an attendee sent a tweet in which she made a 'Seig Heil salute' in support of Hitler and white supremacy. This expression of support of Hitler is extremely offensive to us, as our restaurant is home to teammates and guests of every race, religion and cultural background, the Facebook post said. The restaurant apologized to the surrounding neighborhood and said it was donating the profits from its sales on Friday, $10,000, to the Washington office of the Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish civil rights group. The Ronald Reagan Building, the biggest structure in the U.S. capital city, is federally owned, but run by Trade Center Management Associates, a unit of Drew Co., a Boston real estate development company. The firm defended allowing the nationalist group to use the venue. It said in a statement that its contract mandates that unless there is a security threat by an organization or person who asks for meeting space, the building is available for rental. The agenda of the National Policy Institute's Saturday meeting included a breakdown of the 2016 election and plans for the growth of the alt-right. The nonprofit Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate groups, described Spencer as an academic racist who backs creation of an Aryan homeland. Twitter Inc suspended several accounts linked to the alt-right last week, including Spencer's.  The move followed the microblogging service's announcement that it would upgrade some features to better combat cyber-bullying. Editing by Kevin Drawbaugh, Andrew Hay and Lisa Shumaker"

"https://www.reuters.com/article/mega-fhc-taiwan-probe-idUSL1N1B40BD","Taiwan probes Mega Financial after U.S. money laundering-related fine","","August 23, 2016 /  11:51 AM / a year ago","","TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan is investigating if Mega Financial Holding Co and its banking unit broke local criminal laws in a case that led to U.S. authorities fining the state-controlled group $180 million for anti-money laundering violations. New York authorities on Friday slapped Mega International Commercial Bank with the fine for violations that included lax attention to risk exposure in Panama, the first time in a decade that a Taiwan-based financial institution has been penalized by U.S. authorities. The fine is a major embarrassment for the Taiwan government because Mega Financial, whose management has close ties to key government officials, is an industry pillar in the island's financial system. The disciplinary action comes as anti-money laundering (AML) controls at banks in Greater China are under intense scrutiny abroad, following a series of high-profile judicial investigations and regulatory probes in the United States and Europe. Taiwan authorities are examining documents from Mega Financial and its banking unit as part of the investigation, Chang Chieh-chin, deputy head prosecutor with the Taipei District Public Prosecutors Office, told Reuters by telephone. The former chairman of Mega Financial Tsai Yeou-tsair is a defendant in the case and has been banned from travelling outside of Taiwan, Chang said, adding that current Chairman Shiu Kuang-si was asked into the prosecutors office late on Tuesday to assist with the investigation. Tsai has quit as a board director of Cathay Financial Holding Co, another Taiwanese firm, due to personal reasons, Cathay said in a statement Tuesday. Prosecutors also are reviewing information from the island's finance ministry and Financial Supervisory Commission regarding the matter. We are gathering information and will review it to see if there has been any violation of criminal law in Taiwan, Chang said. The New York State Department of Financial Services (DFS) said Mega's U.S. compliance program was a hollow shell with insufficient transaction monitoring and reporting controls and inconsistent compliance policies. The bank's compliance staff also lacked familiarity with U.S. AML regulations while several were also conflicted because they held multiple roles, the DFS said in a court document. The DFS found that nearly $11.5 billion of credit transactions took place between Mega's New York and Panama branches in 2013 and 2014. The bank's head office was indifferent toward risks associated with transactions involving Panama, despite the fact it was recognised as a high risk jurisdiction, the DFS said in a statement. Mega Financial chairman Shiu defended the bank's conduct, saying it did not help customers launder money overseas. Mega International Commercial's New York branch failed to report a suspect transaction to U.S. authorities, as required by law, he told Reuters. Mega's branch in Colon, Panama, had closed an account by a customer from Central or South America because it was deemed a suspicious account, he said. When money was remitted to the shuttered account, the branch rejected and returned the funds to the originating bank, he said. However, under U.S. rules, remittances involving suspicious accounts must be declared to New York financial authorities, which Mega failed to do, he said. Mega Financial said in a statement that about 200 corporate customers are mentioned in the Panama Papers, most of whom are Taiwanese firms with offshore banking accounts. It said it was checking the identities of these customers. The leak earlier this year of more than 11.5 million documents, the so-called Panama Papers, put a spotlight on the shadowy world of offshore companies used for tax evasion, prompting authorities across the world to investigate possible financial wrongdoing by the rich and powerful. Mega Financial shares slumped 6.3 percent on Monday, after news of the U.S. fine. They were down 0.2 percent on Tuesday. Well-Connected Bank Mega International Commercial has two branches in Panama: one in Panama City since 1974 and one in the Colon Free Zone since 1982, according to the bank's website. The bank, which was created from the merger of two state-run local banks more than a decade ago, is one of Taiwan's largest banks by asset size. It is viewed by analysts as a well-connected financial group and its head is appointed by the government. Shiu, the brother-in-law of Taiwan's central bank governor, was appointed by the finance ministry this month as chairman of Mega Financial. He had been its president till 2014, before leaving to join other state-run banks in Taiwan. Chinese banks' aggressive overseas expansion has met with a number of regulatory hurdles in recent years. Last year the U.S. Federal Reserve instructed both Bank of China (BoC) and China Construction Bank Corp  to improve their anti-money laundering (AML) procedures. In Spain, six Industrial and Commercial Bank of China  bankers were arrested in February, suspected of facilitating money laundering and fraud. The bank has said it implemented AML regulations and operated strictly within the law. Many Chinese banks are now beefing up their risk management and compliance controls in response to the crackdown, Reuters reported in June.

Speder's departure follows a Hungarian government investigation earlier this year of his business interests as it tried to loosen the billionaire's influence over its savings bank sector. In June the central bank, run by Gyorgy Matolcsy, a close ally of Prime Minister Viktor Orban, fined FHB over a 2012 bond issue. FHB bought back the bond, hitting its capital position and prompting a review for a possible downgrade by Moody's. Zoltan Speder was the member and the chairman of the Board of Directors since 29 April 2008. He had (an) extraordinary part in the development of FHB Banking Group during the past years, FHB said in a filing with the Budapest Stock Exchange announcing Speder's resignation. It did not name a successor. The bank did not say why Speder quit at FHB, the smaller of two listed local banks after OTP, central Europe's largest independent lender. An FHB spokesman declined comment. FHB said an asset management company controlled by Speder, A64 Vagyonkezelo, sold 15.57 million FHB shares at 480 forints ($1.77) each in an off-market transaction to savings and loans groups Fokusz Takarekszovetkezet and B3 TAKAREK Szovetkezet. Speder sold the shares, representing a 14.35 percent stake in FHB, at a discount to Friday's closing price of 499 forints, according to Reuters data. Fokusz and B3 said the transaction would benefit FHB by providing a transparent and predictable ownership background as well as outstanding potential for growth. Savings banks have been an important avenue for Orban to secure more than half of the bank sector in Hungarian hands, part of a maverick economic policy that has earned him criticism from the European Union. On June 9, police raided FHB's office and some of Speder's other business interests such as the Hungarian Postal Service. His media company was also hit by a tax probe, and government-friendly media published reports sharply critical of Speder. The reason and the timing of those moves was unclear, but analysts and media commentators suspect Speder, once close to Orban, fell out of favour with the premier. Other parts of the banking industry also complained that FHB was enjoying tax breaks and other benefits intended for savings and loans banks, even though FHB is a classic commercial retail lender. Shares in FHB, which has a market capitalisation of $119.3 million, have fallen 8.4 percent over the past three months, underperforming the blue chip index, which gained 4.5 percent. Including FHB, the savings sector has a 9.1 percent market share by total assets, with about 1,500 branch offices and 1 million customers, according to data on its web site.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/nigeria-wema-bank-idUSL8N1AI4IO","Nigeria's Wema Bank plans 20 bln naira bond issue this month","","August 1, 2016 /  4:25 PM / a year ago","","LAGOS, Aug 1 (Reuters) - Nigeria's Wema Bank, which aims to expand its branch network this year, plans to issue 20 billion naira ($63 million) in bonds this month, its chief finance officer said on Monday. The bank is issuing local currency bonds after scrapping plans last year to issue a $100 million seven-year dollar bond because of currency risks. We expect to open in a couple of weeks. We are awaiting final regulatory approvals and we expect to conclude the process this quarter, Tunde Mabawonku told Reuters by phone. Wema, which won regulatory approval last year to switch from a regional to a national bank, plans to re-open branches in Nigeria which it closed to become a regional player, he said. Wema obtained shareholders' approval in May to issue bonds or preference shares this year to raise 20 billion naira in the first tranche of a 50 billion naira programme, but market conditions then deteriorated. The Nigerian naira has dropped 40 percent since June, when Nigeria ditched its 16-month-old peg of 197 naira to the dollar in a bid to lure back foreign investors who had fled after a plunge in the price of oil, Nigeria's economic mainstay. Mabawonku said the mid-tier lender was watching debt markets closely for rates, adding that it had a target break-even rate at which it wanted to issue the notes. Nigeria's one-year treasury bill is offering around 18 percent yield, traders say. Yields on fixed income securities have been rising in recent months with the central bank mopping up naira liquidity to lure back foreigners. The central bank lifted interest rates by 200 basis points last week to 14 percent to help fight inflation, which hit a 10-year high of 16.5 percent in June. Yes the economy has slowed but there are still business opportunities, Mabawonku said. We are opening locations in areas where we are not present and we see that the population is underbanked. Wema, which has more than 100 branches, has also said it aimed to buy a mid-sized commercial lender to build scale. Last week Wema reported an 11 percent rise in half-year pretax profit to 1.30 billion naira.  ($1 = 319.50 naira)   (Editing by Susan Fenton)"
"https://www.reuters.com/article/banks-charities-idUSL3N1JQ4ZD","Three hundred UK charities hit by global crackdown on illegal funds","","July 27, 2017 /  5:16 AM / a day ago","","LONDON (Reuters) - More than 300 UK-based charities have had their bank accounts closed in the last two years after being caught up in a global crackdown on illegal money flows, forcing the government to explore how to allow them easier access to the financial system. Thousands more charities have had operations disrupted by delayed payments causing financial losses and risks to employees, Britain's Charity Finance Group, that helps to organize charity financing, told Reuters. Major charities Oxfam and Save the Children say they were amongst those hit. The government is setting up a panel of charity executives, bankers and officials to meet in the coming months to drive new policy thinking to allow legitimate charities to operate unhindered, an official told Reuters. The decision to assemble the working group comes ahead of a review by the inter-governmental Financial Action Task Force (FATF) next March of Britain's efforts to tackle money-laundering and financing of militant groups.  At the FATF meeting, Britain could face criticism of its failure to tackle the problem of charities losing access to the banking system, charity sector analysts said.  The FATF has recorded over 100 cases worldwide of alleged abuse of charities for terrorist finance. In one example in the city of Birmingham in 2011, three people were convicted of impersonating Muslim Aid charity workers to fund a bomb attack. But legitimate charities say they have been cut off from the financial system because banks have been alarmed by billion-dollar fines meted out for breaching sanctions, anti-terror financing and anti-money laundering rules. Charity officials say the clamp-down on charities by banks is causing government-backed aid efforts to fail, humanitarian workers to be put at risk and potential recipients to suffer.  Save the Children believes a more aligned approach between governments, regulators, and NGOs will help to reduce financial crime, whilst ensuring critical and life-saving humanitarian work continues, the group said in a statement for this article. HSBC and Co-Operative Bank closed the most charity bank accounts in the last two years, according to a Reuters survey of more than 30 case studies. Both banks, along with other big institutions, said they were taking action to better understand the needs and internal governance of charity clients. Hsbc Sets Up Team In the last two years, HSBC hired some 35 staff to work in a team dedicated to the charity sector, according to a source familiar with the hirings. The specialists aim to ensure charities comply with global financial rules. A problem that hit mainly smaller Muslim-related charities after September 11, 2001 attacks in America accelerated in the last few years to involve thousands of charities. Delayed and declined payments have become a regular recurrence in the sector with charities experiencing disruption to their objectives on a daily or weekly basis, a director at UK-based umbrella group Muslim Charities Forum, Monowara Gani,  told Reuters.  Many British charities affected were reluctant to speak on the record about their experiences because they were worried that other banks might cut them off, or that donations could dry up if their banking problems were publicized.  One small human rights charity funded by Britain's Foreign Office, which did not want to be identified, closed down this year after being unable to open a bank account, two sources familiar with the situation said. This illustrated the problem posed to British international aid policy by the banks' fear of being punished for breaching regulations, said the sources who declined to be named. Around 20 per cent or nearly $1 billion a year of the government's bilateral assistance funds distributed by the Department for International Development are channeled through charities, according to government data. FILE PHOTO: The Oxfam logo is seen on a signage outside a store in Dalston in east London, Britain November 28, 2008.Simon Newman/File PhotoWe continue to engage with humanitarian organizations to understand and discuss what impact the wider security context may be having on their operations overseas in conflict-affected states, said the government official, who confirmed a panel had been set up to engage with the issue.   Risk Rules The humanitarian sector is struggling with a policy vacuum,  leaving commercial organizations such as banks to set the risk rules for delivery of publicly-funded aid, said Mike Parkinson, policy adviser for Oxfam UK, which has encountered delays in opening bank accounts overseas. Some banks are responding to the problem, but others are  reluctant to serve a sector deemed to have a medium-high risk of terrorist financing in a 2015 British government report. We feel like banks used to be competing for charity business, but now they are pushing us away, said Tim Boyes-Watson, executive director of British-based Mango which specializes in helping charities manage their finances. Boyes-Watson said Mango is working on creating a certification system that would aim to make approved charities easier for banks to work with, but that implementing and regulating such a scheme could prove costly. Slideshow (2 Images)In addition to hiring a team dedicated to the charity sector, HSBC in April sent a guide called Keeping your Charity Safe to 11,000 charity and non-profit customers. We will continue to work with the UK government and industry bodies to support the not-for-profit sector, a spokeswoman for the bank said in an email.  Co-Operative Bank has closed accounts for dozens of organizations in the last few years including branches of the Cuba Solidarity Campaign and the Nicaragua Solidarity Campaign. Amnesty International UK in December 2016 published a report criticizing the bank's handling of those closures, which were often abruptly communicated to the charities. The bank said it was unethical not to comply with legal and regulatory rules. A spokesman for the bank said it has introduced a new exit forum to manage closures of charities' accounts better and will soon publish a summary of its account closure data. Understanding Charity Clients Barclays has sent a mandatory questionnaire to all of its charity clients in recent months asking them how they deal with financial crime and sanctions-related issues. The idea is that if we understand charity clients better and get confident in their internal governance, we should be better placed to make payments for them, said David McHattie, head of the charities team at Barclays. McHattie said no customers have lost their accounts as a result of unsatisfactory answers to the questionnaire, but that the bank has asked some clients to improve their processes.  While Britain's government, banks, and charity officials take steps to tackle the problem, aid workers say the consequences of losing access to banking are getting worse. I've been talking to banks for over a year and still don't have an account, so I'm having to send money for life-saving care through Western Union which is expensive and time-consuming, said the head of one medical aid organization operating in Syria who did not wish to be named.  Other aid organizations without bank accounts are resorting to more primitive, risky methods.  A number of organizations I know are back to throwing bags of cash over the border into Syria, said Lisa Reilly, executive coordinator at the European Interagency Security Forum which works to improve the safety of aid workers.

Members of a new Dutch branch of the group 'Soldiers of Odin', set up in Finland in 2015, said in a post on Facebook they had detained an asylum seeker whom they accused of assaulting women in the northern Dutch town of Winschoten. The group had appealed to members to hunt for the man. The group denied using violence against the man, saying he was approached in the street and waited voluntarily for police to arrive. They called on members to hunt an asylum seeker in posts on Facebook, said police spokesman Ernest Zinsmeyer. The person in question had been assaulted, but it is unclear who did it. That's what we are investigating. One of the founders of the Finnish branch of Soldiers of Odin was convicted last month for aggravated assault. On its Dutch-language Facebook page, Soldiers of Odin said a branch had been opened in Groningen, a province in the northern Netherlands. The Soldiers of Odin, named after the king of the gods in Norse mythology, have triggered fears of a rise in vigilante movements in the Nordic countries as the numbers of immigrants rise.  Dutch far-right leader Geert Wilders, who is leading opinion polls ahead of March 15 elections but does not advocate violence, has called for the borders to be closed to Muslim immigrants.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/india-modi-corruption-idUSL4N1DD059","Anger rising in India as banks slow to dispense cash to millions","","November 12, 2016 /  7:25 AM / in 9 months","","NEW DELHI, Nov 12 (Reuters) - Anger was rising across India on Saturday as banks struggled to dispense cash after the government withdrew large denomination notes in a shock move aimed at uncovering billions of dollars of unaccounted wealth hidden from the taxman. Hundreds of thousands of people stood outside banks for a third day for long hours trying to replace 500 and 1,000 rupee bank notes that were abolished earlier in the week. These bills made up more than 80 percent of the currency in circulation leaving millions of people without cash and threatening to grind large parts of the cash-driven economy to  a halt. There is chaos everywhere, said Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejrilwal and a bitter foe of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He said Modi's move had upended the lives of the poor and working while the rich - whose wealth he had sought to target - had found loopholes to get around the new rules. People argued and banged the glass doors of a branch of  Standard Chartered in southern Delhi after the security guards blocked entry, saying there were already too many people inside the bank. Others turned on Modi, criticising his ongoing visit to Japan while countrymen suffered at home. He is taking bullet train rides in Japan and here you have old people knocking on bank doors for cash, said Prabhat Kumar, a college student who said he had spent six hours at the queue. He has made a terrible mistake. Nearly half of India's 202,000 ATMs were shut on Friday and those that operated quickly ran out of the new notes as scores of people descended upon them. Traders in Delhi's vegetable market said they were considering to shut down the market as cash was running out and banks were dispensing a limited amount. We might have to close down until the situation stabilises, said Metharam Kriplani, the president of the Chambers of Azadpur Fruit and Vegetable Traders said. People in Mumbai said grocers were charging ten times the price of salt in return for accepting the old cash notes and in Benguluru some people were using their old notes to buy one-time insurance policies. The government has asked people to redeem the old 500 and 1,000 rupees notes by Dec. 30.  The central bank said there was enough cash available with banks and that it had made arrangements to deliver the new bank notes all over the country. But in Dudko, about 75 kms (45 miles) from Delhi, villagers said they were struggling to pay for food and fuel, four days into the cash crunch. One family was marrying off their daughter later this month and were worrying about their money stuck in the bank. Bank officials are saying they will give the money on Monday. How will we make purchases, said Sunita, the mother. Much of India's rural economy is powered by cash transactions with few people having bank accounts or operating one even if they have an account. Modi's move was aimed at shrinking the black economy, the term widely used to describe transactions that take place outside formal channels and which could be as high as 20 percent of gross domestic product, according to investment firm Ambit. Bribe and crime proceeds also go into this underground economy. Modi said he also wanted to strike against counterfeit 500 and 1,000 rupee notes that anti-India militants were using to finance acts of violence.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/film-baahubali-india-idUSL3N1HC1SN","India's biggest film franchise hot on Hollywood's heels","","April 13, 2017 /  1:19 AM / 3 months ago","","HYDERABAD, India (Reuters) - Dozens of animators work into the night in India's southern city of Hyderabad, fueled by caffeine and huddled over computer screens in a darkened studio to put the finishing touches on India's biggest and most ambitious film. The makers of Baahubali 2 hope its top-notch visual effects will wean Indian audiences from Hollywood blockbusters, enticing them with the magical kingdoms, rampaging armies and towering palaces of a homegrown fantasy epic. If art was easy, everybody would do it, said Pete Draper, co-founder of Makuta VFX, which is stitching the film's live-action scenes together with computer-generated imagery. Every single shot has its own challenges. Working hours right now are crazy. We are finishing daily at 4 a.m. Agencies that closely track the box office say Baahubali 2 is the most highly awaited Indian film of the decade. But the competition for Spider-Man and other movie franchises from overseas isn't coming from Bollywood. When it opened in cinemas in 2015, dubbed versions of Baahubali: The Beginning, made in the Telugu language widely spoken in India's southern states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, resonated with audiences nationwide. It used computer-generated imagery to depict ancient kingdoms and bloody wars in a quintessentially Indian battle of good versus evil. Film-maker S.S. Rajamouli aims to do even better when the next installment is released on April 28. Inspired by Hollywood epics such as Ben Hur and The Ten Commandments when growing up, Rajamouli wanted to create a tentpole franchise that delivered a memorable movie experience. But younger audiences were looking to Hollywood franchises such as The Fast and the Furious, and the superheroes of the Marvel and DC Comics universe for the big-screen thrills Indian cinema was unable to provide. They have heavy budgets, they have huge star casts and huge studios backing them, Rajamouli, 43, said in an interview in Hyderabad, his home city. People walk past a poster of an Indian movie Baahubali: The Beginning outside a movie theater in New Delhi, India, April 12, 2017. Picture taken April 12, 2017.Adnan AbidiBut if we make 10 percent of it in an Indian context, with our stories, our heroes and heroines ... we can easily compete. Visual effects head Draper was at the sprawling movie set every day of filming to make sure location shots and actors' movements synchronized with CGI-enhanced rendering on screen. By day, the half-built palace, an arena, the torso of a statue and a stone temple flanked by blue screens don't look sufficiently formidable, so the team of nearly 80 animators has been given the task of fleshing out the heft and detail. People walk past a poster of an Indian movie Baahubali: The Beginning outside a movie theater in New Delhi, India, April 12, 2017. Picture taken April 12, 2017.Adnan AbidiTo keep down production costs on a budget of $67 million, work on the CGI-heavy movie was distributed among 35 studios across continents. We didn't have any studio backing us. Raising capital was a challenge, said Prasad Devineni, one of the producers. If all goes well, a record-breaking run for Baahubali 2 would be a wake-up call for Bollywood, where cinema attendance has halved from a decade ago. In 2016, Indian box-office collections fell to 99 billion rupees ($1.5 billion), down from 101 billion a year earlier. Bollywood, reliant on a tried-and-tested formula of romances and masala thrillers, has failed to develop its own big-ticket franchises, piggy-backing instead on Baahubali, with top producer Karan Johar marketing the movie in Hindi this month. With a spinoff TV series, an animated offering for Amazon videostreaming, a comic book and a possible third film in the works, Baahubali could lure back Indian audiences. It has shown us the way - how to market, build euphoria around it, said Rajkumar Akella, India managing director at global box-office tracker comScore. The makers always envisaged the film as a franchise, with many narratives branching off its storyline, to hook the maximum number of viewers later.Our audiences might be watching English films, or Hollywood films, and getting used to them, but the blood doesn't change, the DNA doesn't change, said Rajamouli.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-forex-idUSKCN18E03L","Dollar nurses losses as Washington rocked by new probe into Trump campaign","","May 18, 2017 /  12:46 AM / 2 months ago","","TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar wallowed near six-month lows against a basket of major currencies on Thursday as the U.S. political crisis appeared to deepen, threatening to delay efforts by President Donald Trump to implement his economic stimulus plans. Political instability in the United States is shaking markets. You put a brake on investments to the U.S. when you see those headlines, said Bart Wakabayashi, Tokyo Branch Manager of State Street Bank. The Justice Department appointed a former FBI director as special counsel to investigate possible collusion between President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign team and Russia. The appointment of a special counsel follows Trump's dismissal of James Comey, his FBI director who was investigating Russia's role in the U.S. election.  Media then reported that Trump may have interfered with a federal investigation, a serious allegation that could even lead to his impeachment if verified. Some politicians might try to begin the impeachment process, and if they do, that would take much time to carry it out, and while it is ongoing, it would be almost impossible to push fiscal stimulus through, said Masashi Murata, currency strategist for Brown Brothers Harriman in Tokyo, noting that it took almost two years for the Bill Clinton impeachment process to proceed though Congress. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against six major rivals, fell as low as 97.333 .DXY on Wednesday, its lowest level since Nov. 9, having given up all the gains it had made following the U.S. presidential election in November.  It last stood at 97.588, flat from late U.S. trade, and down more than 2 percent over the past four sessions.      Trump's surprise election victory had initially sparked buying in the dollar and U.S. assets on hopes for his tax cuts and infrastructure spending plans, but such Trump trades have been wound back. The dollar index has now fallen more than 5 percent from its 14-year high of 103.82 set on Jan 3, despite expectations of higher U.S. interest rates that should bolster the U.S. currency. The Federal Reserve raised rates in March and its officials have said there could be two or three more rate hikes this year. Yet, U.S. political turmoil and softer-than-expected U.S. economic data such as retail sales, consumer inflation and housing starts in the past week is leading market players to discount the chance of more rate hikes. Fed Fund futures <0#FF:> are now pricing in only about 60 percent chance of a rate hike by June, compared to around 90 percent earlier this month, and are no longer pricing in a 100 percent chance of a hike even by December. Against that backdrop, the dollar dropped 2.09 percent against the yen on Wednesday, its biggest fall since July 29 last year.  It fell to a three-week low of 110.53 yen early on Thursday before bouncing back slightly to 111.25 yen JPY=, up 0.5 percent from late U.S. levels on bargain-hunting by Japanese investors.  The yen gave a limited response to data showing Japan's GDP grew an annualized 2.2 percent in the first quarter, handily beating economists' forecast of 1.7 percent rise. Although the headline GDP was stronger than expected, the GDP deflator was deeper into negative, pointing to persistent deflationary pressure, said Minori Uchida, chief currency analyst at the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ. The euro EUR= hit a six-month high of $1.1174 and last stood at $1.1143, down 0.1 percent on the day.     My feeling is that the current level of the euro is too high, and isn't sustainable based on fundamentals, when U.S. growth and the economy are not so bad, so I'm feeling that the current levels are a very good chance to sell the euro against the dollar, Brown Brothers Harriman's Murata said. I'm guessing that some ECB officials will speak up about euro strength having a downside for the eurozone economy, he added. The Swiss franc CHF= hit a six-month high of 0.9772 to the dollar on Wednesday before easing back to 0.9805.  Against the euro, to which the Swiss currency is closely tied, the franc firmed to 1.0923 franc per euro EURCHF= from last week's eight-month low of 1.0988.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/handjani-iran-idUSL2N1IK2AR","COLUMN-What Iran’s high-stakes election means for voters and the world","","May 18, 2017 /  8:23 PM / 2 months ago","","(Amir Handjani is a Senior-Non-Resident Fellow at the Atlantic Council and a Fellow with the Truman National Security Project. The opinions expressed are his own.) By Amir Handjani May 18 (Reuters) - On May 19, Iranians go to the polls to either re-elect President Hassan Rouhani to a second term or give one of his reactionary opponents a chance to govern, and in doing so ride the populist wave that seems to have engulfed much of the globe. Conventional wisdom in Washington is that Iran is a radical theocracy and its elections don’t matter because real power is in the hands of the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), who answer only to him and not to the elected branches of the Iranian government. The truth is more complex: Elections in Iran are hugely significant in shaping Tehran’s foreign and domestic policy. Although they may be imperfect by Western standards, they are the only means through which the Iranian people can voice their support or criticism of unelected pillars of the deep state. Look no further than the differences between President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who served from 2005 to 2013, and Rouhani, his successor. Ahmadinejad, who ran on a populist platform that sought to redistribute wealth across Iranian society, had no interest in curtailing Iran’s nuclear program and questioned Israel’s right to exist. In style and substance, he was different from the more moderate Rouhani, who is even-tempered and sophisticated in his dealings with the West and managed to get support from all factions of Iran’s elected and unelected government in negotiating the nuclear deal. Rouhani enjoys the backing of former President Mohammad Khatami, who served from 1997 to 2005. Khatami is the de facto godfather of Iran’s Green Movement, the reformist camp that took to the streets to protest the 2009 re-election of Ahmadinejad. In part because he favors more liberalization of Iran’s economy and greater engagement with the West, Rouhani has broad support among Iran’s youth, who want more civil liberties and less government intrusion in their private lives. He also has the support of those in the international community who would like to see Iran prioritize negotiation, rather than confrontation, with global powers. Rouhani’s chief opponent is the conservative cleric Ebrahim Raisi. Raisi is rumored to be the IRGC’s preferred choice for supreme leader when Khamenei, 77, passes. While Iran’s supreme leader does not explicitly endorse any candidate, it is clear from Khamenei’s criticism of Rouhani’s foreign and domestic policy that he prefers the president’s hardline rival. Last year Khamenei appointed Raisi to lead Astan Quds Razavi, the most powerful religious foundation in Iran. Raisi is also the custodian of the Imam Reza shrine in Mashad, the most visited and important holy site in Iran, and has strong base of support among rural, religious, poor and hardline clerics. Raisi hopes to follow in the footsteps of Khamenei, who served two terms as Iran’s president before becoming supreme leader. But if he loses the election by a wide margin, that path is less likely, as his backers would struggle to justify his ascension to absolute power when voters didn’t even want him to be president. Raisi has promised his supporters more cash handouts and a redistribution of the country’s wealth. He has campaigned on tackling corruption and confronting U.S. policies in the region, which he believes undermine Iran’s security. If this rhetoric sounds familiar, it’s because it is. It is the same platform that helped propel Ahmadinejad to victory in 2005. At the time, Iran was at a crossroads, as it is now. It had two terms of Khatami, the reformist. Its economy was beginning to rebound. Its relationship with its Arab neighbors was improving and diplomatic engagement with the West, particularly with Europe, was becoming the norm rather than the exception. Domestically there was greater tolerance for diverging points of view as a record number of newspapers had started circulating. In every respect, Iran took a giant step backward by the time Ahmadinejad’s presidency ended. The country became isolated internationally with sanctions that choked its already struggling economy. The electorate was divided internally as many Iranians viewed Ahmadinejad’s 2009 re-election as illegitimate because of allegations of widespread voter fraud. A win for Rouhani would be a win for moderation. It would mean that Iran’s revolution is evolving in ways that could satisfy its people, who want a government willing to meet their everyday needs. It would also mean that the West has a negotiating partner that wants to bring Iran back in from the diplomatic cold and become a responsible member of the international community. The world will be watching closely. (By Amir Handjani)"
"https://www.reuters.com/article/brazil-corruption-idUSL2N1IL171","Brazil plea-bargain testimony says president took $4.6 million in bribes","","May 18, 2017 /  2:07 PM / 2 months ago","","SAO PAULO/BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's top court released plea-bargain testimony on Friday accusing President Michel Temer and his two predecessors of receiving millions of dollars in bribes, the most damaging development yet in a historic political corruption probe. The testimony made public by the Supreme Court is from executives of the world's largest meatpacking company, and raises serious doubts about whether Temer can maintain his grip on the presidency. The scandals that have engulfed Brazil's political class and many business elites reduce the chances that Temer, a conservative who took office after leftist former President Dilma Rousseff was impeached last year, can push through economic reforms crucial for Latin America's biggest country to recover from its worst recession on record.  The Supreme Court on Thursday said it approved an investigation of Temer for corruption and obstruction of justice. Calls for his resignation intensified, including an editorial in the O Globo newspaper, which is normally criticized by leftists for backing conservative politicians.  This is easily the worst moment in Brazil since we returned to democracy, said Claudio Couto, a political scientist at the Getulio Vargas Foundation, a top university, calling the claims the mother of all plea bargains. This testimony is hitting everyone, all the major political players and, most importantly, a sitting president, he added.  The revelations came from testimony given by executives at JBS SA (JBSS3.SA). Once a small meat producer, JBS grew exponentially during 13 years of government by former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and Rousseff's Workers Party, primarily through acquisitions funded by low-cost loans from Brazil's development bank.  The JBS executives said they made about 500 million reais ($154 million) in illegal payments to politicians and bureaucrats in recent years in exchange for winning contracts, getting easy credit from state-run banks and resolving tax and other disputes with the government. Related CoverageBrazil watchdog opens new probes into JBS-related insider tradingTemer's office denied in a statement that he obstructed justice by interfering in the probe and also denied accusations he took bribes. Lawyers for Lula said he was innocent. Rousseff denied any wrongdoing in a statement. In addition to the three presidents, congressmen, ministers and several governors and mayors of major cities were named in the testimony. It implicates ruling and opposition parties alike.  According to the testimony, JBS paid Temer 15 million reais ($4.6 million) in bribes. It also alleges that Lula, who is already facing five corruption trials, received $50 million in bribes in offshore accounts from JBS, while Rousseff took $30 million in bribes, also in offshore accounts.  The corruption scandals that have polarized Brazil center on political kickbacks in exchange for firms winning contracts at state-run enterprises, especially at oil company Petrobras (PETR4.SA).  They have led to over 90 convictions of businessmen and politicians and prompted the investigation of dozens of sitting congressmen and a third of Temer's cabinet.     The motorcade of Brazilian President Michel Temer drives past graffiti which reads 'Out with Temer' in Brasilia, Brazil May 19, 2017.Ueslei MarcelinoSupreme Court Justice Edson Fachin wrote this week that an immediate investigation into Temer was required because the alleged criminal practices are underway or about to occur. Temer on Thursday, in a terse address, said he would not resign from the presidency. His defiance came as the Supreme Court released an audio tape of him speaking with JBS Chairman Joesley Batista. In the recording, secretly made by Batista in a March visit to Temer, the president appeared to condone the payment of hush money to former lower house speaker Eduardo Cunha, who last year orchestrated Rousseff's impeachment and was later convicted for corruption. Slideshow (7 Images)Many politicians fear that if Cunha should turn state's witness, his testimony could implicate scores of congressmen and members of the executive branch. The constant march of indictments and new scandals has led to near paralysis in Brasilia, the capital, and led to widespread calls among Brazilians for new elections. But new elections would require a constitutional amendment. If Temer resigns or is forced from office, the constitution at present says Congress must choose a caretaker president and vice president to govern until the next election, scheduled for late next year. The JBS testimony also tainted one other prominent politician - Aecio Neves, a senator. Suspended from the chamber in the wake of the allegations, Neves led the chief opposition to Workers Party governments and placed a close second behind Rousseff in 2014 presidential elections. Executives said JBS had paid Neves 80 million reais in illegal funding for that campaign as well as 2 million recently to support a new abuse of authority law that seeks to make it easier for suspects and defendants to sue investigators, prosecutors and judges.  The measure, which passed the Senate last month, must still be approved by the lower house. It has been sharply criticized by those leading Brazil's crackdown on corruption. Prosecutors wrote in the document released on Friday that they had proof Neves collaborated with Temer in attempts to slow or halt anti-corruption investigations.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-court-border-idUSL1N1G60ZB","Conservative U.S. justices skeptical in cross-border shooting case","","February 21, 2017 /  4:41 PM / in 5 months","","(Reuters) - Conservative U.S. Supreme Court justices on Tuesday expressed skepticism about reviving a lawsuit filed by the family of a Mexican teenager against a U.S. Border Patrol agent who fatally shot the 15-year-old from across the border in Texas in 2010. Among the concerns raised by justices was whether non-U.S. citizens injured by drone attacks overseas that are directed from the United States could file similar claims if the lawsuit was allowed to move forward. In a closely watched case that could affect U.S. immigration actions under President Donald Trump's administration, the court's liberal justices expressed sympathy toward allowing the case to move forward, indicating the justices could be headed toward a 4-4 split. Such a ruling would leave in place a lower court's decision to throw out the civil rights claims against the agent, Jesus Mesa, filed by the family of Sergio Hernandez. The Supreme Court potentially could delay action on the case to see if Trump's nominee to fill a vacancy on the court, conservative appeals court judge Neil Gorsuch, is confirmed by the U.S. Senate. Gorsuch could then potentially cast the deciding vote. A ruling would normally be due by the end of June.  Justice Anthony Kennedy, a conservative who sometimes sides with the liberal justices in close cases and whose vote could be pivotal in this one, voiced doubt about the family's arguments during the court's hour-long argument. Kennedy indicated the question of how to compensate victims of cross-border shootings is one that the U.S. and Mexican governments should resolve. You've indicated that there's a problem all along the border. Why doesn't that counsel us that this is one of the most sensitive areas of foreign affairs where the political branches should discuss with Mexico what the solution ought to be?, Kennedy asked the Hernandez family's lawyer, Robert Hilliard. Chief Justice John Roberts, another conservative, brought up the sensitive question of whether U.S. officials could be sued for drone attacks overseas. How do you analyze the case of a drone strike in Iraq where the plane is piloted from Nevada? Why wouldn't the same analysis apply in that case? he asked Hilliard. The justices heard the case at a time that the security of the lengthy U.S.-Mexico border is a hot topic, with President Donald Trump moving forward with plans for a border wall he said is needed to combat illegal immigration. The case is one of three the justices currently are considering that concern the extent to which the U.S. Constitution provides rights to non-U.S. citizens. That issue has become more pressing in light of Trump's January order, put on hold by the courts, to block entry into the United States by people from seven Muslim-majority countries and refugees. Trump is preparing a rewritten version of the ban. The case raises several legal questions, including whether or not the U.S. Constitution's ban on unjustified deadly force applied to Hernandez because he was a Mexican citizen on Mexican soil when the shooting occurred in June 2010. The court could resolve the case by simply deciding not to apply a 1971 Supreme Court ruling in a case involving federal drug enforcement agents that allowed such lawsuits in limited circumstances. The court has been reluctant in subsequent cases to extend that ruling to other types of conduct. Kennedy seemed unwilling to take that step, saying the Hernandez shooting would be an extraordinary case in which to allow a lawsuit against a federal official. Liberal justices appeared more willing to examine whether some U.S. rights extend to border areas where the U.S. government exercises a certain amount of authority even beyond the border line, as it does in the culvert where Hernandez was killed. Justice Elena Kagan said it could be described as a no-man's land that is neither one thing or another thing. Likewise, Justice Stephen Breyer said the border area could be viewed as a special kind of physical place where U.S. law could extend in certain instances. Hernandez's lawyers cited a report by the Washington Monthly magazine that said over a five year period, border agents were involved in 10 cross-border shootings, killing six Mexican nationals. Justice Sonia Sotomayor, another liberal, said that in order to deter such shootings, why should there not be a civil remedy to ensure that border police are complying with the Constitution? The incident took place at a border crossing between El Paso, Texas and Ciudad Juarez, Mexico. The U.S. Border Patrol said at the time that Hernandez was pelting U.S. agents with rocks from the Mexican side of the Rio Grande before the shooting. U.S. authorities have asserted that Mesa shot Hernandez in self-defense. Lawyers for Hernandez's family disputed that account, saying he was playing a game with other teenagers in which they would run across a culvert from the Mexican side and touch the U.S. border fence before dashing back. The FBI also said Hernandez was a known immigrant smuggler who had been pressed into service by smuggling gangs that took advantage of his youth.  The family appealed a 2015 ruling by the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals throwing out the lawsuit."
"https://www.reuters.com/article/pakistan-blast-idUSL4N1G14HB","Suicide attack on Pakistani shrine kills 72, claimed by Islamic State","","February 16, 2017 /  3:36 PM / 5 months ago","","KARACHI, Pakistan (Reuters) - A suicide bomber attacked a crowded Sufi shrine in southern Pakistan on Thursday, killing at least 72 people and wounding dozens more in the deadliest of a wave of bombings across the South Asian nation this week. A spokesman for medical charity Edhi said the attacker appeared to have targeted the women's wing of the shrine, and around 30 children accompanying their mothers were dead. Islamic State, the Middle East-based militant group which has a small but increasingly prominent presence in Pakistan, claimed responsibility for the attack, the group's affiliated news agency AMAQ reported. Senior police officer Shabbir Sethar told Reuters from a local hospital that the death toll was likely to rise. At least 72 are dead and over 150 have been injured, Sethar said by telephone. Television footage from the famous Lal Shahbaz Qalandar shrine in the town of Sehwan Sharif showed army and paramilitary medical teams reaching the site and injured people being taken to nearby hospitals in ambulances and a military helicopter. We were there for the love of our saint, for the worship of Allah, a wailing woman told the Dawn News television channel outside the shrine, her headscarf streaked in blood. Who would hurt us when we were there for devotion? The attack comes as the Pakistani Taliban and rival Islamist militant groups carry out their threats of a new offensive. The violence has shattered a period of improving security, underscoring how militants still undermine stability in the nuclear-armed country of 190 million people. The high death toll at the shrine makes it one of the worst attacks in Pakistan in recent years. Related CoverageIslamic State claims suicide attack on shrine in Pakistan: AMAQIn August last year, at least 74 people, mostly lawyers, were killed in a suicide bombing of a hospital in the southwestern city of Quetta. In November, an explosion claimed by Islamic State ripped through a Muslim shrine in southwestern Pakistan, killing at least 52 people and wounding scores. Sindh Sufis At a crossroads of historic trade routes, religions and cultures, the southern province of Sindh where the shrine is located has always been a poor but religiously tolerant region, helping to shield it from much of the Islamist violence more common in other parts of Pakistan. The country's powerful military, which has cracked down on insurgent groups in recent years leading to a sharp drop in militant violence, vowed a swift, decisive response.

No more restraint for anyone, Army Chief Qamar Bajwa said in a statement. Shortly after the blast, the army announced it was closing the border with Afghanistan with immediate effect for security reasons. Insurgents operate on either side of the neighbors' long and porous frontier. Different militant groups, often trying to outdo each other, say they are responsible for the bombings. In the case of the Quetta hospital blast, both a faction of the Pakistani Taliban - Jamaat-ur-Ahrar - and Islamic State claimed responsibility. Jamaat also said it was responsible for a bombing in the eastern city of Lahore earlier this week that killed 13 people.

Stand United The bomber entered the shrine as crowds massed on Thursday, a statement from the Sindh police spokesman said. Rescue officials said dozens of wounded people were being ferried in private cars to hospitals. The nearest major hospital was nearly an hour's drive away in Dadu district.  Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif quickly condemned the bombing, decrying the assault on the Sufi religious minority. He vowed to fight Islamist militants, who target the government, judiciary and anyone who does not adhere to their strict interpretation of Sunni Islam. The past few days have been hard, and my heart is with the victims, Sharif said. But we can't let these events divide us, or scare us. We must stand united in this struggle for the Pakistani identity, and universal humanity. An ancient mystic branch of Islam, Sufism has been practiced in Pakistan for centuries. Lal Shahbaz Qalander is Pakistan's most revered Sufi shrine, dedicated to a 13th-century saint whose spirit is invoked by devotees in ecstatic daily dancing and singing rituals in Sehwan Sharif. Thursdays are an especially important day for local Sufis, meaning that the shrine was packed at the time of the blast. Most of Pakistan's myriad radical Sunni militant groups - including the Pakistani Taliban's various factions and Islamic State loyalists - despise Sufis, Shi'ite Muslims and other religious minorities as heretics.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/jpmorgan-outlook-idUSL3N1GD4GQ","JPMorgan eyes boosting dividends, buybacks as capital piles up","","February 28, 2017 /  12:38 PM / 5 months ago","","(Reuters) - No. 1 U.S. bank JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) may return more money to shareholders than it earns over the next few years, it forecast on Tuesday, an encouraging sign for investors who have been waiting for richer dividends and share repurchases. The prediction came in documents posted on JPMorgan's website for its annual investor day, where top executives offered their vision for the four major business lines and financial targets for the broader institution. Although JPMorgan is sticking to its long-term target of returning 55 percent to 75 percent of net income to shareholders, the bank could pay out as much as 120 percent in the medium term, according to a presentation. That would mean JPMorgan is generating more than enough profit to invest in its businesses and meet regulatory capital requirements, and can even reduce some of that capital. The new prediction is up from a 65 percent medium-term scenario that JPMorgan offered last year. It does feel like we have reached an inflection point for capital, Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said at the event. There is no good reason why JPMorgan could not have a capital ratio at the lower end of a targeted range, she added. The bank aims to maintain enough high-quality capital to cover 11 percent to 12.5 percent of its risk-weighted assets. Big U.S. banks have encountered a slew of new capital requirements in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, many of them implemented over a period of years. They also must get their capital plans approved by the Federal Reserve through an annual stress test, meaning that banks cannot unilaterally decide to increase dividends or share repurchases. Prior to the crisis, it was not unusual for big banks to distribute all of their earnings to shareholders. JPMorgan, the largest U.S. lender, has managed to stay ahead of capital requirements while increasing earnings and boosting payouts, but not to that level. Last year, it returned $15 billion to shareholders, roughly 61 percent of earnings. At Tuesday's confab at JPMorgan's headquarters in New York, Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon and other top executives mingled with investors, analysts and reporters. It drew hundreds of money managers who got a chance to press managers about a wide range of topics, from geopolitics to expense ratios. Dimon said he remains confident about the U.S. economy. The future is very bright, Dimon said, adding that the outlook will be even better if the federal government overhauls corporate taxes, thins out redundant regulation and boosts spending on public infrastructure. JPMorgan said it plans to spend more this year to grow its credit-card business and stay competitive in an industry that has become increasingly technology-focused. But even with higher costs, the bank maintained its long-term targets for a cost-to-revenue ratio of 55 percent and for a return on tangible common equity of about 15 percent, signaling management's belief that the investments will pay off. Dimon said the additional spending is important to continue the company practice of steadily investing in its businesses. He added that about half of the expected increase in reported expenses is due to accounting requirements for additional auto leasing the company is doing in partnership with car manufacturers. Although executives say JPMorgan is focused on efficiency, they have also pushed back against the idea that they should, for instance, cut branches to get a quick profit boost. They have instead advocated for investing in key businesses, like credit cards, as well as technology that can help JPMorgan lure more customers and keep existing ones happy. One of its slides characterized its approach to costs as: Innovate, automate, and eliminate waste. Innovation was a theme for the day, with displays highlighting JPMorgan's technology bona fides in ATMs, cyber security and trader experience, among other things. JPMorgan's shares rose 19 cents to close at $90.62. They have risen about 29 percent since Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 8.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/cia-wikileaks-autos-idUSL2N1GM09K","RPT-CIA 'mission' on cars shows concern about next-generation vehicles","","March 9, 2017 /  12:03 PM / 5 months ago","","(Repeats story first published on Wednesday) By Alexandria Sage SAN FRANCISCO, March 8 (Reuters) - WikiLeaks documents showing the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency considered a mission against connected car technology underscores auto industry concern that the science behind the next generation of vehicles could be turned against them. Cyber security is considered key to the rollout of tomorrow's self-driving and today's connected cars, which resemble computers on wheels with a host of communications routes that hackers could target. If consumers are to trust smart vehicles, they must deem them safe from attack. Security experts cite the terrifying hypothetical example of a remote attack on a fully autonomous vehicle with no steering wheel or brakes, in which the passenger would have no recourse to regain manual control of the car. You have a lot of car companies trying to design cars to be better suited to automation, which means they're more attractive to hackers, said auto consultant Roger Lanctot of Strategy Analytics. A major strategy for automakers is to reduce the number of communications gateways to crucial systems and to require services offered by third parties to go through a single secure path. WikiLeaks documents show the CIA citing vehicle systems and a car operating system from QNX, owned by Blackberry Ltd , as potential mission areas for the CIA's Embedded Devices Branch to consider. The QNX operating system, which is used by most global automakers, provides a a comprehensive, multi-level, policy-driven security model ... to mitigate attacks, the company said in a statement to Reuters. But given the collection of software, hardware and network components that make up a connected car, security is only as strong as its weakest link, it said. While the CIA's interest in cars brought widespread attention, the industry has already received wakeup calls about cars' potential to be hacked. Researchers in 2015 used a wireless connection to turn off a Jeep Cherokee's engine, prompting a recall of 1.4 million vehicles by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. In September last year, Chinese cyber security researchers hacked a Tesla Inc Model S sedan, remotely tapping the brakes and popping the trunk. The electric carmaker subsequently patched the bugs using an over-the-air fix. Tesla did not respond to a request for comment on its cyber security protocol. The hacking of the Jeep and the Tesla brought it home to the industry that even if its improbable it's technically possible, said Mark Wakefield, global co-head of the automotive practice at AlixPartners. If a car was seen as vulnerable, it could be a big brand problem, Wakefield said. Hacks could also expose private information shared between car and third parties - credit card numbers, account numbers or passwords - to theft. A January survey by the University of Michigan's Transportation Research Institute found that 33 percent of respondents said they were extremely concerned over hacking of full self-driving cars to cause crashes. Closing Down the Ways in The number of ways into cars has proliferated, from cell phone signals to dongles. One such gateway is the standard OBD-II port found under the steering wheel historically used for onboard diagnostics. Today, hundreds of after-market devices use the port, whether to monitor driving for insurance needs or provide conveniences like safety alerts. The security of these devices is important, as it can provide an attacker with a means of accessing vehicle systems and driver data remotely, warned the FBI in a March 2016 bulletin on cyber security risks to motor vehicles. Carmakers are also building walls between non-crucial infotainment systems and driving controls so that any breach is blocked before it could compromise key functions like brakes. The first step the industry is tackling is intrusion detection, said Lanctot. But what to do when a breach is detected is complicated, because shutting off parts of a car could be unsafe, he said. Tesla was first to champion over-the-air technology in which wireless software updates are sent remotely to cars. Although some have argued such updates are a way in for hackers, Tesla and others see them a key protection to upgrade security and repair vulnerabilities quickly. In January, U.S. lawmakers introduced a bill calling for cyber security standards for new cars but so far U.S. regulators have issued recommendations, not rules, on how carmakers should shield their computer systems from hackers. The industry is years away from solving the cyber security problem, Lanctot said, noting that the first generation of cars built after the Jeep hack that include some kind of detection capabilities will not be seen until early in 2018.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-turkey-germany-idUSKBN15H0MZ","Merkel urges Turkey's Erdogan to uphold freedoms, allow dissent","","February 2, 2017 /  7:49 AM / 6 months ago","","ANKARA (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel stressed the importance of freedom of opinion in talks with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan on Thursday, during a visit meant to help improve frayed ties between the two NATO allies. In her first trip to Ankara since a failed military coup in Turkey last July, Merkel, said she had agreed with Erdogan on the need for closer cooperation in the fight against terrorism, including the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK). Germany and Turkey have been at odds over Ankara's crackdown on dissidents since the abortive July 15 coup, as well as its allegations - rejected by Berlin - that Germany is harboring Kurdish and far-leftist militants. With the (attempted) putsch, we saw how the Turkish people stood up for democracy and for the rules of democracy, Merkel told a news conference, when asked about concern over proposed constitutional changes that would strengthen Erdogan's powers. In such a time of profound political upheaval, everything must be done to continue to protect the separation of powers and above all freedom of opinion and the diversity of society, she said, adding she had also raised the issue of press freedom. Opposition is part of democracy, Merkel said. Turkey's allies, including Germany, fear Erdogan is using the coup attempt as a pretext to curtail dissent and Erdogan's opponents fear the planned constitutional changes will lead to an authoritarian state. The constitutional reform bill was submitted to Erdogan later on Thursday, parliamentary sources said. Once he approves it, the electoral commission will set a date for a referendum, expected in April. It is out of the question for the separation of powers to be abolished, Erdogan said of the proposals, which would replace Turkey's parliamentary system with an executive presidency. It gives more opportunity for the executive branch to work more swiftly. The judiciary will retain its power and function as usual with the new system. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and German Chancellor Angela Merkel walk past a picture of Turkish Republic state founder Kemal Ataturk at the presidential palace during the first visit since July's failed coup in Ankara, Turkey, February 2, 2017.Umit BektasPost-Coup Crackdown Erdogan also said Turkey may provide evidence to the German authorities after around 40 mostly high-ranking Turkish soldiers who worked at NATO facilities in Germany were reported to have requested asylum. Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Veysi Kaynak said on Wednesday that Berlin was sheltering members of what Ankara calls the Gulenist Terrorist Organisation (FETO), the network of U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, which Turkey blames for the coup bid. Gulen denies involvement. If the Gulenists involved in the coup are fleeing to Germany, the Justice Ministry may send information and documents, Erdogan said, adding that the United States should take quicker action on an extradition request for Gulen. Slideshow (2 Images)Turkey's defense minister has urged Berlin to reject the asylum applications and warned that a failure to do so could damage relations. Berlin has said the applications will be considered on a case-by-case basis. More than 100,000 people have been sacked or suspended from the police, military, civil service and private sector on suspicion of supporting Gulen since the attempted coup. Some 40,000 people have been jailed pending trial. Merkel, who later met Prime Minister Binali Yildirim, said the two countries could do more together to fight the PKK, considered a terrorist organization by Turkey, the European Union and the United States. Turkey wants European countries to do more to root out PKK members there.   We talked in particular about how the PKK and everything associated with it in Germany is being observed and how we're also taking action against it because as I said, the PKK is, as a terrorist organization, banned in Germany too, Merkel said. Our intelligence services and interior ministries need to work together more closely. In January Germany's chief prosecutor launched an investigation into possible spying by Turkish clerics and Merkel said during her visit to Ankara that irritation or the feeling that people are being observed or spied on needs to be eliminated from the outset. Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said in an interview with Passauer Neue Presse newspaper that domestic Turkish conflicts should not be played out in Germany and that the country would not tolerate violence, spying or surveillance.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/brazil-corruption-amnesty-idUSL2N1GT0T7","Brazilian corruption probe sends politicians running for cover","","March 17, 2017 /  5:28 PM / 4 months ago","","BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian politicians are scrambling to negotiate an amnesty for illicit funding as part of efforts to shield themselves from a widening graft probe that has engulfed President Michel Temer's government and the Congress. Lawmakers have for months sought a legislative slight-of-hand to evade the rapidly expanding Car Wash investigation that has exposed systematic corruption on contracts at state enterprises, particularly oil firm Petrobras. Panic in Brasilia hit fever pitch this week after Prosecutor General Rodrigo Janot, the country's top prosecutor, called for investigations into bribery and political kickbacks that reportedly target six cabinet ministers and over 100 lawmakers. The scandal has reached into Temer's inner circle and, though he is not a target of investigation, threatens his survival and the fate of proposed reforms to curb an untenable budget deficit and pull Brazil out of its worst recession. The corridors of Congress emptied on Wednesday - the day after Janot's request to the Supreme Court was made public - as the political class was convulsed by speculation over who would be on the secret list and how to avoid joining more than 80 businessmen and politicians already in jail. Prosecutors say they are well aware of the efforts to confound their investigation, but remain confident that rising public indignation and the weight of evidence of various crimes will ensure those responsible are brought to justice. There are easily more than 100 politicians we have asked the Supreme Court to be investigated, a senior member of the prosecution team said. When secrecy is lifted and the details made public, we'll have some turbulent days. Lawmakers told Reuters the thrust of behind-the-scenes negotiations is aimed at an amnesty for the widespread practice of obtaining undeclared campaign funds under the table from private companies. That would entail a new law to make the practice, known as caixa dois, a crime but which would prevent retroactive punishment, effectively pardoning anyone guilty of the practice to date. They are trying to put this to the vote, but I don't think they will have the courage to pull this off, said Green Party Deputy Antonio Carlos Thame, an anti-corruption campaigner. Anyone supporting the bill, which has no official sponsor, would face the wrath of an enraged Brazilian electorate in next year's elections. Two attempts to discretely push the measure through the lower house failed last year. It's an insult to public opinion. The intention is clearly to obstruct the Car Wash investigation, said leftist Senator Randolfe Rodrigues, who has sponsored a bill to abolish court prerogatives for politicians.     Anti-Corruption Outcry A general view of Brazil's National Congress during sunrise in Brasilia, Brazil March 13, 2017.Ueslei MarcelinoJanot's request for investigations - the biggest to date in the three-year-old probe - stemmed from 950 depositions given in December by 77 executives from the Odebrecht construction conglomerate.  The company in December signed the world's largest leniency deal with Brazilian, U.S. and Swiss prosecutors and admitted bribing politicians across Latin America and in Africa. Carlos Lima, a federal prosecutor who has helped lead the probe, told Reuters he thinks upward of 350 new investigations could stem from the Odebrecht testimony.  Adding to the worries in Brasilia is mounting public pressure on Congress to abolish the special forum rules that almost guarantee impunity for politicians.  That law means politicians, members of the executive branch and thousands of other officials can only be investigated if the Supreme Court gives permission.  Any trial must then play out in the over-burdened top court, where cases drag on for years and less than 1 percent of politicians get convicted. Supreme Court justices are proposing the prerogative be curbed or eliminated, but lawmakers under investigation, including the government's leader in the Senate, Romero Jucá, are insisting only Congress can make that change.      Even if politicians can avoid conviction, many are conscious that the reputational damage inflicted by the scandal may thwart their hopes of reelection next year. That has put electoral reform back on the agenda. The favored proposal is to move to a system of closed lists in which voters would cast ballots for parties and not individual candidates. That would allow politicians implicated in the investigation to escape the direct wrath of voters. Despite that, Senator Rodrigues expects voters to expel tainted lawmakers in 2018, resulting in a renewal of Congress from where a more honest generation of leaders will arise.      Lima, the prosecutor based in southern Brazil, was also phlegmatic about lawmakers efforts to create an amnesty for 'caixa dois': even if they pull it off, many of those facing investigation would have to answer for other crimes, he said. They would likely face a trial regardless, Lima said, adding that the Odebrecht testimony - once it is made public - will make it clear that bribery was endemic in public life.  The political class needs to understand how this amnesty of corruption would be viewed by the population, Lima said. It would be a crime against the Brazilian people.

U.S. President Donald Trump has denounced an agreement between Iran and major powers on its nuclear program as a bad deal, and his administration has put Tehran on notice after the test-firing of a ballistic missile. Under previous Western sanctions, India had devised a barter-like scheme acceptable to Washington that allowed it to make some oil payments to Tehran in rupees through a small state bank, UCO Bank (UCBK.NS). Indian companies were then able to receive payments for goods exported to Iran using the oil money held in non-convertible rupee balances at UCO, maintaining a trade lifeline between two countries with long historical ties. But since sanctions were partly lifted early last year the rupee account has been run down by more than 90 percent to just 20 billion rupees ($305 million) because Indian refiners have resumed paying for Iranian oil in euros. Whilst the federal government and central bank have approved oil payments in euros - which Iran prefers because the currency is readily convertible - they have not given the all-clear for trade in the opposite direction to be settled in other currencies, leaving exporters stuck. We are working on a mechanism through euros and looking for a common correspondent bank in Europe to act as an intermediary for India and Iran, said R.K. Takkar, chairman of UCO Bank.

No timeline has been fixed as yet to implement the new mechanism, however, as both sides await the outcome of Iran's presidential election in May and seek clarity on the Trump administration's approach toward Tehran, he said.

Foreign minister Sushma Swaraj told parliament recently that Iran had yet to ratify a trilateral pact to set up the transit corridor to Afghanistan that was signed on a visit last year by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The government is still in a wait-and-watch mode and closely monitoring Trump's approach towards Iran, said a senior official who joined Modi on his trip to Iran.    India, Iran's top oil client after China, boosted exports to Tehran during sanctions as Western nations boycotted it.

Foreign minister Sushma Swaraj told parliament recently that Iran had yet to ratify a trilateral pact to set up the transit corridor to Afghanistan that was signed on a visit last year by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The government is still in a wait-and-watch mode and closely monitoring Trump's approach towards Iran, said a senior official who joined Modi on his trip to Iran.    India, Iran's top oil client after China, boosted exports to Tehran during sanctions as Western nations boycotted it.     Yet India has lost out since the lifting of sanctions, with its exports to Iran declining to $2.4 billion in 2016 from $3.2 billion in the previous year.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-malaysia-kim-police-idUSKBN1710UA","Exclusive: Malaysia mistook slain Kim Jong Nam for South Korean","","March 30, 2017 /  8:21 AM / 4 months ago","","KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysian authorities wrongly identified the slain half-brother of North Korea's leader as a South Korean national and first alerted Seoul's embassy in Kuala Lumpur soon after his death, sources familiar with the incident told Reuters. The police error did have a silver lining: It enabled Seoul to quickly inform Kuala Lumpur the dead man was probably Kim Jong Nam, half-brother to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Kim was murdered around mid-morning on Feb. 13, when Malaysian police say two women smeared super toxic VX nerve agent on his face at the budget terminal of Kuala Lumpur International Airport.  After examining the victim's passport, Malaysian authorities confused the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, the formal name of North Korea, with the Republic of Korea, the official name of its estranged southern neighbor, the sources said. Malaysian authorities contacted the South Korean embassy, sending along copies of documents found on Kim’s body. After the mix-up was realized, North Korea’s diplomatic mission in Kuala Lumpur was informed on the day of the murder, the sources said. Malaysian police did not respond to requests for comment. The confusion over Kim’s nationality also explains why it was the South Korean media that initially broke the news. Within 24 hours of his death, South Korea’s National Intelligence Service had briefed lawmakers in Seoul that Kim Jong Nam was believed dead. It then was leaked to the South Korean media. Hours after the news emerged in South Korea, Malaysian police confirmed that a North Korean man had died at the airport, without disclosing his identity.  Out in the Open South Korean and U.S. intelligence sources say North Korea masterminded the attack, which Pyongyang denies. North Korea does not even acknowledge the dead man is Kim Jong Nam. Pyongyang continues to refer to him as Kim Chol, the name on the diplomatic passport Kim was carrying when he died.  South Korean intelligence officers say Kim Jong Un had issued standing orders for the elimination of his elder half-brother. Kim Jong Nam’s murder was remarkably public, according to North Korea analysts. The assassins chose an airport covered by CCTV cameras and a designated weapon of mass destruction possessed by only a few states, North Korea among them. “The effect had to be planned,” said Robert L. Gallucci, a former U.S. chief negotiator with North Korea over its nuclear program. “They wanted to underline impunity, that they can act with impunity.” Kim Jong Nam at Beijing airport in 2007.   Kyodo/via REUTERSThe brazen nature of the assassination also made collecting evidence relatively easy. After the first chaotic day, the investigation was taken over by Malaysia’s Special Branch - which combines the roles of elite police unit and domestic intelligence agency. The two women who smeared the VX nerve agent on Kim - described by police as Vietnamese “entertainment outlet employee” Doan Thi Huong and Indonesian “spa masseuse” Siti Aisyah - were arrested three days after the killing.  According to lawyers, families and consular officials, the two women believed they were involved in a prank. Cctv Airport Footage Three days after the women's detention, four North Koreans were named as ringleaders of the plot, all of whom left Malaysia soon after the murder. Slideshow (3 Images)Captured by CCTV footage at the airport, the men  - later identified by South Korea as agents of Pyongyang’s ministry of state security - were nearby when Kim was poisoned.  While South Korea and Malaysia were caught unawares by Kim’s trip to Malaysia, the alleged state security agents at the airport suggests North Korea was well informed. Three of the four arrived in Malaysia before Kim did. The other one landed a day later, on February 7, police have said. Malaysian police believe the women were recruited by another North Korean national, Ri Ji U, also known as James.  Two other North Koreans, Hyon Kwang Song, second secretary at the Kuala Lumpur embassy, and Kim Uk Il, a staff member of North Korea’s state airline Air Koryo, were also named as suspects. Ri, Hyon and Kim are believed to be holed up in the North Korean embassy, where Malaysian police are prevented from entering without permission under the Vienna Convention that lays out the international rules of diplomacy. Another “important” but unnamed North Korean national is also being sought, Malaysian police inspector-general Khalid Abu Bakar said last week. North Korea and Malaysia's historically close ties began to unravel in the wake of Kim's death, hitting a nadir when Pyongyang banned nine Malaysian citizens from leaving the country in retaliation for the Kim investigation. Malaysia's Prime Minister Najib Razak initially announced a tit-for-tat ban, accusing North Korea of “effectively holding our citizens hostage”. A day later, he struck a more conciliatory tone, saying the dispute would be solved through quiet negotiations. On Thursday, he said a deal had been struck - Kim Jong Nam's body had been released to North Korea and the nine Malaysians had been allowed to board a plane home.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-italy-privatisation-analysis-idUSKBN1702Y9","Italy privatization drive peters out as 2018 election moves closer","","March 29, 2017 /  8:14 PM / 4 months ago",""," (This story was refiled to fix name of EFG in paragraph six) By Gavin Jones ROME (Reuters) - Italy's commitment to selling off public assets is petering out as politicians look ahead to elections early next year, making it harder to cut the country's huge public debt and leaving it vulnerable to any rise in interest rates. In late 2015, then-Prime Minister Matteo Renzi said the debt would come down the following year for the first time in eight years, thanks partly to privatizations worth 0.5 percent of gross domestic product. In the end, the state managed to sell less than a fifth of its targeted amount and the national debt rose to a new high of almost 133 percent of gross domestic product, the highest ratio in the euro zone after Greece. Renzi confirmed the same privatization target for this year before he resigned in December after Italians rejected his planned constitutional reform in a referendum, but the prospects for selling state assets have continued to dwindle. With the ruling Democratic Party (PD) embroiled in a bruising leadership battle and elections slated for early 2018, senior PD members including Renzi himself have recently voiced doubts about whether privatizations are a good idea after all. As elections come into sight, privatizations don't seem to be the government's focus, said Gianluigi Mandruzzato, head of economic analysis at BSI, part of EFG International (EFGN.S). The most appetizing items on the government's slate are the state railway company, which is wholly state owned, and the post office, of which 65 percent remains in public hands after a first tranche was sold in 2015. But it failed to follow up with the sale of a planned second tranche of the post office in 2016, citing unfavorable market conditions. While the market picture has improved, with the Milan bourse up 5.5 percent this year after falling about 10 percent in 2016, the political will seems to have disappeared. Infrastructure Minister Graziano Delrio recently admitted to problems in selling the railways and Antonello Giacomelli, a junior industry minister, warned of the dangers of letting the post office fall into the hands of foreign investment banks which could close branches and cut staff. Politics has taken precedence over economic concerns and there are no privatizations on the horizon now, said Stefano Micossi, an economics professor and director general of Assonime, the association of Italy's listed companies. They are unpopular with the unions and politicians who see state companies as a source of jobs and favors to hand out, he added. There is enormous resistance from the PD and also inside the government. The Post Office, whose top management was changed by the Treasury this month, declined to comment on whether privatization would go ahead this year. The state railways is supposed to spin off its high speed and long distance train businesses by July with a view to selling them by the end of the year, but has still not named the advisers for the spin-off. The company said the privatization required government legislation, which it was discussing with relevant ministers. Rising Bond Yields From a numerical point of view, the targeted privatization revenues can only marginally chip away at the public debt, which the European Commission forecasts will reach a new record high this year. Mandruzzato said the drift in the privatization target was not good news in terms of commitment and credibility. Italy has the most sluggish growth in the 19-nation euro zone and an unstable political outlook, and it has repeatedly backslid on promised deficit cuts. The result is that markets have become increasingly leery of its government bonds. The spread between Italian benchmark bond yields and their safer German equivalent has risen to almost 2 percentage points from 1 percentage point a year ago, and the rise would have been far steeper without the support of the European Central Bank. Under its quantitative easing program the ECB has been buying several billion euros of Italian bonds every month.  After it cuts back on these purchases, as it is set to do next month, some analysts say the issue of Italy's debt sustainability may resurface and its yields could surge as they did in 2011 and 2012 at the height of the euro zone debt crisis. Mandruzzato said the trigger for a sudden market sell-off is often unexpected and in Italy's case there are a lot of potential candidates.  One could be a ratings downgrade, as it was when Standard & Poors cut Italy's sovereign rating in September 2011. Both Fitch and Moody's currently have a negative outlook on Italy, meaning a downgrade could be in the pipeline.

Heavy rainfall, mudslides and hail caused by the annual rainy season has killed 56 people and 22 people were missing across 11 provinces and regions as of Tuesday morning, according to the Ministry of Civil Affairs. More than 750,000 hectares (1.85 million acres) of crops have been damaged and direct economic losses totaled more than 25.3 billion yuan ($3.72 billion), it said.  The government said it had disbursed 700 million yuan ($103 million) in emergency aid to four flood-hit provinces -  Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hunan and Guizhou. Rain in the southern provinces is expected to ease in the coming days, but weather forecasters predict downpours will move to the southwestern province of Sichuan. In what analysts said was a move unprecedented in its scale, the Three Gorges and Gezhouba, two of China's top hydropower plants, closed as much as two-thirds of their capacity to avert flooding further downstream on the Yangtze River.     The move stoked concerns about electricity supplies from China's second-largest power source as a heatwave continued to scorch northern parts of the country, raising the export prices of coal, the fuel the country uses to produce most of its power. Coal from Australia's Newcastle terminal rose to its highest since April, with mining outages tightening supply amid strong northern hemisphere summer demand. The annual rainy season, which arrived in the second half of June, has hit southern Hunan province, one of the nation's largest hog and freshwater fish producers, the most.  High water levels on the Yangtze, Asia's largest river, also slowed barges carrying grain from northern ports to the south, spurring a rise in freight rates and physical corn prices in some regions, analysts and corn buyers said. A man sits in the attic of his flooded house after a flood in Zhaoqing, Guangdong province, China July 4, 2017.StringerZhang Yi, a purchase manager at a feed producer in Hunan, said he had three ships carrying about 5,000 tonnes of corn stuck on waterways near the port of Changsha, the capital of Hunan, since Friday. Corn Prices Rise on Barge Delays Spot corn prices at major ports along the Yangtze and its tributaries, including Changsha, Nanchang in Jiangxi province, and Wuhan in Hubei province, have risen by 30 yuan to 1,800 yuan a ton since last week, according to data provided by China National Grain and Oils Information Center, a government think tank. Slideshow (9 Images)China usually transports corn from northern growing regions to the ports in the south. Then the grain is shipped along the Yangtze and its branches, to central and western provinces including Hunan, Hubei, and Sichuan. The Yangtze river's large watershed also accounts for 60 percent of the nation's freshwater fish output. Cao Delian, manager of the Dabeinong Changlin fish farm, estimated that he has lost about one-third of his carp due to the deluge. It's the biggest loss we've seen in at least 5 years, he told Reuters. On Monday, a natural gas pipeline in Guizhou owned by China National Petroleum Corp collapsed due to a mudslide, causing an explosion that killed at least eight people and injured another 35. In his office in Liuyang, a city near Changsha, Zhang was hoping water levels would continue to subside on Wednesday.  I have stocks of corn that can last for four to five days. As long as it does not rain tomorrow, Changsha port can resume operation and I will get my corn offloaded, Zhang said.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eurozone-banks-italy-monte-dei-paschi-idUSKBN19Q0KE","Monte Paschi looks to leave 'emergency room' and return to profit","","July 5, 2017 /  6:29 AM / 23 days ago","","MILAN (Reuters) - Italian bank Monte dei Paschi di Siena (BMPS.MI) set out plans  to get out of the emergency room and return to profit on Wednesday, clearing the way for a state bailout that should remove the biggest threat to the country's financial stability. The world's oldest bank said on Wednesday it expected a net profit of more than 1.2 billion euros ($1.4 billion) in 2021, from a loss of 3.2 billion euros last year, as part of a restructuring plan approved by European authorities.  It's a conservative plan. We're not shooting at unrealistic targets, Chief Executive Marco Morelli told analysts on a conference call to present the new plan.  Morelli said no mergers were planned at the moment. There is no Plan B on the table, he said. Burdened by bad loans and a mismanagement scandal, Monte dei Paschi has for years been at the forefront of Italy's slow-brewing banking crisis. Italy's fourth-largest lender was forced to request state aid in December after its attempt to raise capital from private investors failed.  On Tuesday the European Union approved a 5.4 billion euro state bailout after it agreed to a drastic overhaul in a move that will leave Rome holding around 70 percent of the bank. EU officials speaking on condition of anonymity said Italy would have to exit the bank at the latest by the end of the 5-year plan. What we experienced in the last nine months is pretty much unheard of: It's like an ER department with an emergency every five minutes, Morelli said. Italy has pledged more than 20 billion euros of taxpayer money in the space of a week to rescue three of its banks, but the country's wider financial sector is still weighed down by around 300 billion euros of non-performing loans (NPLs). At the end of last month, Rome committed up to 17 billion euros to rescue regional banks Popolare di Vicenza and Veneto Banca though it said the final bill would be much lower, adding the state might even turn a profit from the bailouts.  FILE PHOTO: The entrance of Monte dei Paschi di Siena bank's headquarters is seen in Siena, Italy, July 1, 2016.Stefano Rellandini/File PhotoThe Monte Paschi plan looks good but we need to see execution. Still, coming after the Veneto rescues it settles nerves about Italy's banking system, said Zenit fund manager Stefano Fabiani. Path to Profit In its 2017-2021 plan, Monte dei Paschi sees a headcount reduction of around 5,500 to just over 20,000 and a fall in the number of branches to around 1,400 from some 2,000 in 2016 as it seeks to ensure the lender is profitable in the long term. It expects to reach a return on equity of more than 10 percent in 2021 while its CET1 ratio, a measure of financial strength, is seen at 14.7 percent from 8.2 percent in 2016.  Crucially, the bank will sell 28.6 billion euros of gross bad loans, of which 26.1 billion will be securitized through a transfer to a privately funded vehicle on market terms, with the operation partially funded by bank rescue fund Atlante II. The bank said it would sell securitized notes to Atlante II at 21 cents on the euro. We are in line if not slightly above recent market transactions, Morelli said. The CEO, who expects the bank's shares to relist in the second half of September, said 5.5 billion euros in deposits were recovered in the first quarter, adding liquidity was no longer an issue. The bank managed to stay alive, he said, referring to the close shadowing of the lender by European authorities. We negotiated the plan with the EU Commission line by line.  Rome is under the spotlight for taking advantage of exceptions in EU rules designed to stop the use of taxpayer money to deal with bank crises. Policymakers now want Italy to come up with a solution for tackling NPLs without requiring any more government money to prop up its beleaguered banking sector. European Central Bank vice president Vitor Constancio said on Wednesday there needed to be swift action to establish a stronger secondary market in Europe for non-performing loans and policy changes to incentivise banks, investors and the authorities to tackle the issue more effectively. Partial solutions and further delays are not options if we want to tackle the problem of NPLs he wrote in Italy's main business newspaper Il Sole 24 Ore.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/global-forex-idUSL3N1KC20G","FOREX-Dollar near two-year lows vs euro after Draghi comments","","July 21, 2017 /  4:52 AM / 7 days ago","","* Australian dollar plunges on RBA Debelle's remarks * ECB's Draghi says bank will discuss bond-buying plan in autumn * Dollar index close to lowest since August 2016 * BOJ holds steady, mitigating dollar's losses vs yen By Lisa Twaronite TOKYO, July 21 (Reuters) - The dollar headed for weekly losses on Friday, wallowing at its lowest levels against the euro in nearly two years after what markets perceived as hawkish talk from European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi. But the Australian dollar skidded against the greenback after contrastingly dovish comments from a Reserve Bank of Australia official. The dollar index, which tracks the U.S. currency against a basket of six major rivals, was flat on the day at 94.322, not far from its overnight low of 94.090, its deepest nadir since August 2016. It was down 0.9 percent for the week. The euro caught its breath and steadied at $1.1626 after climbing as high as $1.1659 on Thursday, its loftiest level since August 2015. Draghi said that no exact date had been set for discussing any changes to the ECB's ultra-easy monetary programme but did say policymakers would revisit the topic in the autumn. His comments were perceived as hawkish, even though the ECB didn't tip its hand as to when it will begin balance sheet normalisation and in fact left the door open to additional easing if needed, said Bill Northey, chief investment officer at U.S. Bank Private Client Group in Helena, Montana. The dollar edged up 0.1 percent against the yen to 112.06 , after touching an overnight low of 111.48, its lowest since June 27. It was on track to shed 0.4 percent for the week. The euro crept 0.1 percent higher against its Japanese counterpart to 130.32 yen, within sight of last week's high of 130.76 yen, its highest since February. It was on track to gain 1 percent for the week. The dollar's losses against the yen were mitigated by market expectations that the Bank of Japan will keep its massive stimulus programme in place far longer than other major central banks amid stubbornly weak inflation. On Thursday, the BOJ kept monetary policy steady as expected and postponed the timeframe to achieve its ambitious inflation target for a sixth time, though it slightly raised its economic growth forecasts. Concerns over low inflation will likely keep the Federal Reserve from raising U.S. rates at its policy meeting next week, analysts said. Fed Chair Janet Yellen signalled caution in her congressional testimony last week, with disappointing U.S. inflation and retail sales data a week ago adding to evidence that the central bank has reason to take its time in tightening even as it has vowed to do so. When you look at dollar/yen, the Fed has explicitly said they're on a rate-hiking curve, and the BOJ has said this week that they still have a specific 2 percent inflation figure in mind, and they're going to hit it,  said Bart Wakabayashi, branch manager for State Street Bank in Tokyo. So I would have expected the dollar to be even higher than where it is against the yen now, and this background is definitely limiting the dollar's losses, he said. U.S. President Donald Trump's failure to garner enough support for his healthcare bills in the Senate this week also weighed on the dollar, as it raised fears about similar obstacles in passing his stimulus and tax reform agendas. The Australian dollar plunged after a top central banker said on Friday that the Reserve Bank of Australia doesn't need to follow the leader when it comes to global monetary tightening. Just as the policy rate in Australia did not need to decline to the very low levels seen in other parts of the world, the fact that other central banks increase their policy rates does not automatically mean that the policy rate here needs to increase, RBA Deputy Governor Guy Debelle said in a speech in Adelaide. The Aussie tumbled 0.9 percent to $0.7889 after falling as low as $0.7875 earlier. The New Zealand dollar added 0.4 percent to $0.7423 after rising as high as $0.7429, its highest level since September 2016, after New Zealand Finance Minister Steven Joyce told Bloomberg in an interview that he was not worried about the strength of the local dollar.

Australian banks offer generous inducements to brokers to sign up new borrowers and negotiate larger loans, a system dismantled in the United Kingdom following the global financial crisis.     The Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC) criticized the model in a report earlier this year, saying it encouraged risky behavior and mis-selling, and created conflicts of interests.  Now, with record low interest rates fuelling a surge in home prices and household debt, the government is working on a review that could lead to an overhaul of the country's A$1.7 trillion  ($1.35 trillion) mortgage market. Big banks, reliant on mortgage brokers for more than half of new loans written in recent years, are quietly pushing for changes that would reduce the influence of brokers, sources said.         We are still working on the report, it's a hard one, said a senior official at Treasury, which is running the review. Banks are hoping for a big shake-up. The mortgage broking industry is not with the banks. There is a lot of tension, said the official, who asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to talk to the media.  The Treasury will release its findings in due course, a spokeswoman for the minister of revenue and financial services told Reuters.   Heavy Debt As property prices in Sydney and Melbourne have surged by 70 percent or more in five years, Australia's household debt has jumped to 190 percent of disposable income. That has raised alarm bells among regulators about customers' ability to pay off loans in a downturn and its domino effect on the broader economy. Mortgage brokers have contributed to the surge as loans made by them are typically larger, riskier and are paid off more slowly, according to ASIC. The inherent conflict of interest between banks and brokers means that in a downturn there is an increased possibility of higher bad debt than if the banks had sold all the loans through their own branches, said Omkar Joshi, portfolio manager at Regal Funds Management which has A$1.7 billion in assets. Mortgage brokers do not take on the credit risk but are remunerated based on loan size and duration.     A pair of shoes sits outside a tent that has been erected by homeless people outside the main entrance to the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) building located in central Sydney, Australia, July 18, 2017.David GrayAustralia's banking sector is dominated by four major lenders - Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Westpac Banking Corp, ANZ Banking Group, National Australia Bank.  Banks pay brokers more than A$2 billion annually in payments, including trailing commissions that can continue over the lifetime of the loan. Some banks also offer brokers 'soft dollar' benefits such as loyalty programmes and overseas travel to exotic locations.  In contrast to Australia, all forms of commission to brokers are banned in the Netherlands, and trailing commissions are rare in the United Kingdom and New Zealand. These payments are an illustration of excesses built into the financial system following a 26 year economic boom in Australia, said UBS banking analyst Jonathan Mott. We expect the banks to negotiate materially lower fee-for-service mortgage commissions in coming months.      Others expect banks to continue paying commissions to brokers, although some forms of fee such as overseas junkets and volume-based incentives are likely to be abandoned. Better Rates, Better Service Brokers, most of whom derive their entire income from commissions, argue the big banks want commissions slashed because their earnings growth is under pressure and they are losing market share to smaller lenders and non-bank players. Quite often you're getting a better rate going through a broker than from a bank, said Thomas Patrk, senior finance adviser at Sydney-based mortgage broker Orium Finance. So the whole thing about commissions being a problem is really being driven by the banks. They are losing market share to smaller players who are more nimble, offering better service, better rates. The market share of Australia's big banks shrunk to under 65 percent in home loans this year from 77 percent in 2013.      A review of retail banking remuneration commissioned by the Australian Bankers' Association (ABA) in April recommended doing away with volume-based incentives, soft-dollar payments and higher pay to brokers who engage in sales campaigns. The review asked banks to implement the recommendations as quickly as possible and no later than 2020 but progress has been slow.     CBA, Australia's No.1 mortgage lender, is running behind its own July 1 deadline to implement many of the recommendations on sales commissions, including to third-parties. We haven't made any decisions about changes or how they will be implemented at this stage, a spokeswoman for CBA told Reuters.    NAB said it was committed to moving to a new structure, while others noted the challenges around measures involving brokers. We recognize some initiatives particularly those where third parties carry the primary responsibility for progressing matters... may ultimately require regulatory or legislative intervention, Westpac said in a statement.  ANZ said it was working closely with the mortgage broker industry and the ABA to make sure the changes were implemented. Editing by Lincoln Feast"

Jesus Rojas and Zuleima Gonzalez were seized in central Anzoategui state after another appointee, Angel Zerpa, was  arrested at the weekend, the opposition-led National Assembly said. Venezuela's majority-backed opposition is demanding Maduro abandon a Sunday election to create a controversial congress with powers to rewrite the country's constitution and override all other institutions. The opposition has called for a two-day strike from Wednesday at 6 a.m. (1000 GMT) to try to force Maduro to abandon the vote. Millions took part in a one-day strike last week, during which five people died in clashes. Critics say the congress would institutionalize dictatorship by the ruling Socialist Party. But Maduro insists it is the only way to empower the people and bring peace after four months of anti-government unrest that has killed more than 100 people.  The main business guild Fedecamaras also backed the opposition, issuing a statement on Tuesday that called the coming weekend vote unconstitutional and unnecessary. We demand the executive branch abandon its intention to impose a new constitution, said the group, which is scorned by government supporters for its central role in a short-lived 2002 coup against Maduro's predecessor Hugo Chavez. The office of the vice presidency, which oversees state intelligence service Sebin, did not answer telephone calls seeking comment on the latest reported arrests in Anzoategui. Former Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero has spoken with the opposition and with ruling Socialist Party officials about postponing the constituent assembly election, according to three opposition sources.  The talks have not yielded any concrete results, they said, adding that Zapatero was scheduled to speak with Maduro on Tuesday evening. Maduro over the weekend said the government had held talks with the opposition and that postponing the vote had been on the table but that the opposition did not follow through.  On Tuesday he showed no sign that he was planning to scrap the vote or alter its timeline.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-election-chartres-idUSKBN15O1AL","In French bellwether city, scandal deepens election uncertainty","","February 9, 2017 /  11:40 AM / 6 months ago",""," CHARTRES, France (Reuters) - Chartres has in past decades been a bellwether for France's presidential elections, but ahead of this spring's poll the signal from this white-collar city appears to be blurred by a scandal that has fed into a wave of anti-establishment feeling.  In at least the past four elections, the affluent city famous for its towering thirteenth century gothic cathedral has voted in close alignment with the final national result.  Lying in the Beauce plain 90 km (56 miles) southwest of Paris, Chartres counts perfume makers including Guerlain (LVMH.PA) and Danish pharmaceutical firm Novo Nordisk (NOVOb.CO) as local companies. It should be a fertile ground for center-right challenger Francois Fillon.  The 62-year-old former prime minister's clean-cut, clean-living image had held appeal in Chartres, run for over 15 years by a conservative mayor.  But embarrassing revelations that his family for years benefited from large parliamentary salaries have hurt that image.  In a Reuters poll of 100 people in Chartres city center, more than half said their vote was undecided. The survey intends to provide a snapshot of views in a single location and is not intended to reflect nationwide opinions.  For many in Chartres, the Fillon debacle was a factor behind their indecision.  We are living at a time when the word integrity is becoming meaningless for our politicians. We've had some blatant examples in the past week, 86-year-old Maurice Beauzac told a Reuters multimedia team.  Fillon looked a shoo-in for the Elysee palace before the scandal surfaced two weeks ago, campaigning on a free-market platform to reduce regulation and haul down the stubbornly high unemployment rate.  Related CoverageJobs, integrity top voter concerns in French bellwether city in Reuters pollNow opinion polls suggest he will crash out in the first round. So too will the candidate of the ruling Socialist Party, Benoit Hamon, the surveys indicate, as mainstream parties battle against a rising tide of populism across Europe.  The favorites to reach the runoff vote on May 7 are the far-right National Front's leader, Marine Le Pen, and independent challenger Emmanuel Macron who has yet to release a full manifesto.  Among those polled by Reuters in Chartres, 25 percent said unemployment was their number one concern, while 19 percent named a lack of integrity, or honesty, as their main worry.    Infographic ID: '2kras5j'     A combination picture shows people holding up blackboards showing the most important election issues for them, including health, education, and unity, as they pose for Reuters in Chartres, France February 1, 2017.Stephane MaheFed Up  The high level of uncertainty in Chartres underlines how wide open the presidential race remains. It also points to the disaffection many voters feel towards the political elite.  People are becoming less and less interested in politics, said Sebastien Renault, a 35-year-old florist. It's a world of sharks out there, one eating the other.  It is a sentiment that will worry the main political parties, especially in a place where unemployment runs almost two points below the national average of nearly 10 percent, and a median annual salary of 30,000 euros places it in the top 10 for cities of its small size.  Like France, Chartres is fed up with the traditional political system but it's not only linked with the recent affairs, said Mayor Jean-Pierre Gorges.  Slideshow (14 Images)It's just that the situation in this country has been deteriorating for the past 40 years. Almost everybody has somebody in his family who is out of work.  France's outgoing president, Francois Hollande, was elected in 2012 on a promise to create jobs, winning the hearts of socialists by declaring banks to be his main enemy and pledging extra taxes for millionaires.  But he later launched reforms -- including cutting corporate taxes and legislation to make it easier for companies to hire and fire -- that traditional socialists viewed as a betrayal of left-wing values.  Now it is the anti-European Union Le Pen who rails against free-trade who is pitching herself as the true defender of French workers' interests.  For a photo essay: reut.rs/2k3TE0J Against this backdrop, some in the National Front are optimistic the party will get a boost from the Fillon scandal.  I think all of this clearly plays in Marine's favor, said Aleksandar Nikolic, the youthful head of the National Front's regional branch.  Nikolic expressed surprise that immigration and security ranked low among the concerns of those polled by Reuters.  When we ask the people here what their main concerns are, security and immigration clearly come first, he said.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iranian-election-commentary-idUSKCN18D2LE","Commentary: What Iran’s high-stakes election means for voters and the world","","May 17, 2017 /  8:10 PM / in 2 months","","On May 19, Iranians go to the polls to either re-elect President Hassan Rouhani to a second term or give one of his reactionary opponents a chance to govern, and in doing so ride the populist wave that seems to have engulfed much of the globe.  Conventional wisdom in Washington is that Iran is a radical theocracy and its elections don’t matter because real power is in the hands of the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), who answer only to him and not to the elected branches of the Iranian government.  The truth is more complex: Elections in Iran are hugely significant in shaping Tehran’s foreign and domestic policy. Although they may be imperfect by Western standards, they are the only means through which the Iranian people can voice their support or criticism of unelected pillars of the deep state.  READ MORE FROM REUTERS:Commentary: President Trump is now the leaker in chiefCommentary: How Comey's dismissal will impact TrumpCommentary: The next super weapon could be biological Look no further than the differences between President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who served from 2005 to 2013, and Rouhani, his successor. Ahmadinejad, who ran on a populist platform that sought to redistribute wealth across Iranian society, had no interest in curtailing Iran’s nuclear program and questioned Israel’s right to exist. In style and substance, he was different from the more moderate Rouhani, who is even-tempered and sophisticated in his dealings with the West and managed to get support from all factions of Iran’s elected and unelected government in negotiating the nuclear deal.    Rouhani enjoys the backing of former President Mohammad Khatami, who served from 1997 to 2005. Khatami is the de facto godfather of Iran’s Green Movement, the reformist camp that took to the streets to protest the 2009 re-election of Ahmadinejad. In part because he favors more liberalization of Iran’s economy and greater engagement with the West, Rouhani has broad support among Iran’s youth, who want more civil liberties and less government intrusion in their private lives. He also has the support of those in the international community who would like to see Iran prioritize negotiation, rather than confrontation, with global powers.  Rouhani’s chief opponent is the conservative cleric Ebrahim Raisi. Raisi is rumored to be the IRGC’s preferred choice for supreme leader when Khamenei, 77, passes. While Iran’s supreme leader does not explicitly endorse any candidate, it is clear from Khamenei’s criticism of Rouhani’s foreign and domestic policy that he prefers the president’s hardline rival. Last year Khamenei appointed Raisi to lead Astan Quds Razavi, the most powerful religious foundation in Iran. Raisi is also the custodian of the Imam Reza shrine in Mashad, the most visited and important holy site in Iran, and has strong base of support among rural, religious, poor and hardline clerics.  Raisi hopes to follow in the footsteps of Khamenei, who served two terms as Iran’s president before becoming supreme leader. But if he loses the election by a wide margin, that path is less likely, as his backers would struggle to justify his ascension to absolute power when voters didn’t even want him to be president.      Raisi has promised his supporters more cash handouts and a redistribution of the country’s wealth. He has campaigned on tackling corruption and confronting U.S. policies in the region, which he believes undermine Iran’s security.    If this rhetoric sounds familiar, it’s because it is. It is the same platform that helped propel Ahmadinejad to victory in 2005. At the time, Iran was at a crossroads, as it is now. It had two terms of Khatami, the reformist. Its economy was beginning to rebound. Its relationship with its Arab neighbors was improving and diplomatic engagement with the West, particularly with Europe, was becoming the norm rather than the exception. Domestically there was greater tolerance for diverging points of view as a record number of newspapers had started circulating.  In every respect, Iran took a giant step backward by the time Ahmadinejad’s presidency ended. The country became isolated internationally with sanctions that choked its already struggling economy. The electorate was divided internally as many Iranians viewed Ahmadinejad’s 2009 re-election as illegitimate because of allegations of widespread voter fraud.  A win for Rouhani would be a win for moderation. It would mean that Iran’s revolution is evolving in ways that could satisfy its people, who want a government willing to meet their everyday needs. It would also mean that the West has a negotiating partner that wants to bring Iran back in from the diplomatic cold and become a responsible member of the international community. The world will be watching closely.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-banks-job-cuts-factbox-idUSKBN1441NI","Factbox: Job cuts announced by European banks in 2016","","December 15, 2016 /  1:27 PM / 7 months ago","","LONDON (Reuters) - Some of the top banks in Europe have said this year that they plan to cut a total of fewer than 50,000 jobs, a sharp drop from the number announced in 2015. This may signal a turn in the sector's drive to maintain competitiveness through cost-cutting, although some lenders are looking at forming joint ventures with rivals to improve efficiency further. Data compiled by Reuters shows 17 of Europe's biggest banks have announced a total of about 46,000 staff cuts since the beginning of the year – 65 percent lower than the 130,000 job losses announced by 10 of the region's largest lenders in the second half of 2015 alone.  Here are plans announced by some banks this year: Commerzbank (CBKG.DE)     Germany's second biggest lender said it would cut 7,100 jobs and suspend its dividend. In August, executives discussed a possible merger with Deutsche Bank, but the lenders said they shelved the project as both wanted to complete current restructuring efforts before taking any steps in that direction. ING (INGA.AS)     The Dutch bank said in October it plans to shed 7,000 jobs and invest in its digital platforms to make annual savings of 900 million euros ($1 billion) by 2021. UniCredit (CRDI.MI) Italy's biggest bank has said it would cut 14,000 jobs by 2019, of which 6,500 new cuts were announced this year. This would include slashing 3,900 jobs in Italy and 1,500 in Germany. The bank recently unveiled plans to raise 13 billion euros to shore up its balance sheet and distance itself from Italy's broader banking crisis. Credit Suisse (CSGN.S)     Switzerland's second largest bank said it would cut 6,163 jobs during this year, nearly half of which would be from its investment banking division and trading operations.  In March it said it would cut an additional 2,000 jobs from its Global Markets business on top of 4,000 cuts announced in January, after CEO Tidjane Thiam said he had been unaware of trading positions that triggered big writedowns in the first quarter. Lloyd's (LLOY.L) The British lender announced 3,640 job cuts owing to branch closures, and offshoring of IT and back-office operations. ABN AMRO (ABNd.AS)     The Dutch bank said it would cut up to 2,875 jobs as part of cost cutting measures which would be offset by increasing spending on online and mobile banking platforms, and on raising salaries for remaining employees. Alior Bank ALRR.WA     The Polish bank said it planned a restructuring that would include layoffs of up to 2,600 staff by the end of 2017. Banco Popular POP.MC     Spain's Banco Popular said in September it would close around 300 branches under a restructuring plan that would affect up to 2,592 employees. Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L) The partly British-government owned lender said it would cut 1,948 jobs as it offshores IT and back-office operations and shrinks its investment banking division. Santander (SAN.MC) The Comisiones Obreras union said in April that Spain's biggest bank would cut a total of 1,660 workers as part of an overhaul in response to rising regulatory costs and a push into digital services. Barclays (BARC.L) Barclays will cut about 1,000 jobs in investment banking worldwide and 150 staff from its corporate banking arm in Dubai as new Chief Executive Jes Staley tries to reduce costs and boost returns. Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE)      Germany's biggest lender said in October it would slash 1,000 jobs in the country, on top of an overhaul announced last year which includes shedding 9,000 worldwide. Concerns about the solvency of Deutsche Bank have grown on European markets due to the possibility that the U.S. Department of Justice will fine it up to $14 billion for mis-selling mortgage-backed securities in the run up to the 2008 financial crisis.  Societe Generale (SOGN.PA) French bank Societe Generale announced 675 jobs cuts, 125 of which would be at its investment banking division, with 550 taking place over five years as part of a consolidation. The bank said the plan, part of a push to cut costs at its retail network while investing in digital banking, would not rely on mandatory redundancies. UBS (UBSG.S) Switzerland's biggest lender said it would cut up to 471 jobs, a majority of which would be from investment banking, while fewer than 100 employees would go from its wealth management division. HSBC (HSBA.L) Europe's biggest bank said it would cut 466 staff in France. Last year it announced layoffs of 50,000 staff – almost a fifth of its workforce at the end of 2014 – in a drive towards automation and consolidation of IT and back-office operations. Danske Bank (DANSKE.CO)     The Danish lender said it laid off 77 employees and another 244 out of 8,000 had accepted voluntary redundancy as part of an effort to cut costs. Rabobank     The Dutch co-operative bank said in June it had agreed a deal with Kepler Cheuvreux KEPLR.UL to outsource its equity research and brokerage business to Europe's largest independent broker, with around 15 of the bank's analysts and 15 traders to lose their jobs as a result.  Last year the bank said it would cut 9,000 staff, or about a fifth of its 47,000 workforce. Standard Chartered (STAN.L)     The British bank said it was set to cut about a tenth of its global corporate and institutional banking headcount. It was not immediately clear how many of the bank's global total of 84,477 employees at the end of June would be affected. Reporting by Ritvik Carvalho; editing by David Stamp"

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-corruption-idUSKCN18E1YX","Brazil plea-bargain testimony says president took $4.6 million in bribes","","May 18, 2017 /  2:07 PM / 2 months ago","","SAO PAULO/BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's top court released plea-bargain testimony on Friday accusing President Michel Temer and his two predecessors of receiving millions of dollars in bribes, the most damaging development yet in a historic political corruption probe. The testimony made public by the Supreme Court is from executives of the world's largest meatpacking company, and raises serious doubts about whether Temer can maintain his grip on the presidency. The scandals that have engulfed Brazil's political class and many business elites reduce the chances that Temer, a conservative who took office after leftist former President Dilma Rousseff was impeached last year, can push through economic reforms crucial for Latin America's biggest country to recover from its worst recession on record.  The Supreme Court on Thursday said it approved an investigation of Temer for corruption and obstruction of justice. Calls for his resignation intensified, including an editorial in the O Globo newspaper, which is normally criticized by leftists for backing conservative politicians.  This is easily the worst moment in Brazil since we returned to democracy, said Claudio Couto, a political scientist at the Getulio Vargas Foundation, a top university, calling the claims the mother of all plea bargains. This testimony is hitting everyone, all the major political players and, most importantly, a sitting president, he added.  The revelations came from testimony given by executives at JBS SA (JBSS3.SA). Once a small meat producer, JBS grew exponentially during 13 years of government by former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and Rousseff's Workers Party, primarily through acquisitions funded by low-cost loans from Brazil's development bank.  The JBS executives said they made about 500 million reais ($154 million) in illegal payments to politicians and bureaucrats in recent years in exchange for winning contracts, getting easy credit from state-run banks and resolving tax and other disputes with the government. Related CoverageBrazil watchdog opens new probes into JBS-related insider tradingTemer's office denied in a statement that he obstructed justice by interfering in the probe and also denied accusations he took bribes. Lawyers for Lula said he was innocent. Rousseff denied any wrongdoing in a statement. In addition to the three presidents, congressmen, ministers and several governors and mayors of major cities were named in the testimony. It implicates ruling and opposition parties alike.  According to the testimony, JBS paid Temer 15 million reais ($4.6 million) in bribes. It also alleges that Lula, who is already facing five corruption trials, received $50 million in bribes in offshore accounts from JBS, while Rousseff took $30 million in bribes, also in offshore accounts.  The corruption scandals that have polarized Brazil center on political kickbacks in exchange for firms winning contracts at state-run enterprises, especially at oil company Petrobras (PETR4.SA).  They have led to over 90 convictions of businessmen and politicians and prompted the investigation of dozens of sitting congressmen and a third of Temer's cabinet.     The motorcade of Brazilian President Michel Temer drives past graffiti which reads 'Out with Temer' in Brasilia, Brazil May 19, 2017.Ueslei MarcelinoSupreme Court Justice Edson Fachin wrote this week that an immediate investigation into Temer was required because the alleged criminal practices are underway or about to occur. Temer on Thursday, in a terse address, said he would not resign from the presidency. His defiance came as the Supreme Court released an audio tape of him speaking with JBS Chairman Joesley Batista. In the recording, secretly made by Batista in a March visit to Temer, the president appeared to condone the payment of hush money to former lower house speaker Eduardo Cunha, who last year orchestrated Rousseff's impeachment and was later convicted for corruption. Slideshow (7 Images)Many politicians fear that if Cunha should turn state's witness, his testimony could implicate scores of congressmen and members of the executive branch. The constant march of indictments and new scandals has led to near paralysis in Brasilia, the capital, and led to widespread calls among Brazilians for new elections. But new elections would require a constitutional amendment. If Temer resigns or is forced from office, the constitution at present says Congress must choose a caretaker president and vice president to govern until the next election, scheduled for late next year. The JBS testimony also tainted one other prominent politician - Aecio Neves, a senator. Suspended from the chamber in the wake of the allegations, Neves led the chief opposition to Workers Party governments and placed a close second behind Rousseff in 2014 presidential elections. Executives said JBS had paid Neves 80 million reais in illegal funding for that campaign as well as 2 million recently to support a new abuse of authority law that seeks to make it easier for suspects and defendants to sue investigators, prosecutors and judges.  The measure, which passed the Senate last month, must still be approved by the lower house. It has been sharply criticized by those leading Brazil's crackdown on corruption. Prosecutors wrote in the document released on Friday that they had proof Neves collaborated with Temer in attempts to slow or halt anti-corruption investigations.

The 40-year-old father of one was among millions of east Europeans who moved to wealthier western Europe in search of better-paid jobs after their countries joined the EU from 2004, leaving huge labor market gaps behind. With economic prospects improving across eastern Europe and wages rising due partly to a shortage of workers, official data show tens of thousands of people returning to the region, where the cost of living remains well below western levels. Those numbers will not cure chronic labor shortages overnight. Thousands of people are still planning to leave, and latest data show emigrants from both Hungary and Bulgaria still outnumber returnees. But the first waves of returnees still signal something of a turning point for a region where migration has hitherto worked largely as a one-way street. Kiss left home in 2010 to take up a job in a hotel kitchen in northern Italy after his video rental and massage businesses crashed during the global crisis, which hit Hungary hard. I had to find something to be able to maintain the same standard of living, said Kiss, whose son, now eight, was just 10 months old when he started working abroad. Kiss, who has recently acquired a barista certification, plans to use his savings to launch a cafe in Budapest with a fellow Hungarian with whom he worked while abroad. Distance and this way of life take a very hard toll on your relationships, he said. For me, too, not coming home now would have probably meant the end of my family. Official statistics show 17,000 Hungarians returned last year, up from below 15,000 a year earlier. More than 9,000 Bulgarians have been returning home every year since 2014, double the numbers of earlier years. Many are young people returning to start their own business, mainly in the IT sector, or to join growing outsourcing business opportunities. In Poland, the region's biggest economy, net international migration turned positive last year for the first time since World War Two, official statistics show. Meanwhile, net migration of EU citizens to Britain, a top target for east Europeans along with Germany or Italy, fell last year as new arrivals from eastern European countries sank to the lowest level since they joined the EU in 2004. Britain's looming exit from the EU is deterring some migrants.  Bosch employee Mate Muskat talks with Reuters in Budapest, Hungary, June 8, 2017. Picture taken June 8, 2017.Laszlo BaloghImre Molnar and his fiancee returned to Hungary after two years spent in Switzerland as they could not feel settled abroad. They have opened a wine bar in Budapest that serves only local wines and food. We realized that Switzerland is a very different country, Molnar said. It is very beautiful, but society is quite closed, people are not very open and in reality we did not feel at home as we do here in Budapest. Like Hot Cakes Judit Kovacs, a branch manager at the Hungarian unit of Dutch staffing agency Randstad, said blue-collar workers were more likely to return as they usually cannot afford to take their entire family abroad. There is demand for returning workers, especially those who have learned a new technology, she said, citing auto sector suppliers as an example. Slideshow (2 Images)Machine operators, for example, who have learned to run machinery that is not yet in use in Hungary but the investment is already in the pipeline, Kovacs said. Workers with such experience are being snapped up like hot cakes. Technological advances, such as the advent of self-driving cars, or the entry of service sector companies like BlackRock Inc into the Hungarian market, are also creating opportunities for white-collar workers. German technology supplier Robert Bosch hired 2,000 workers in Hungary last year alone and plans to add hundreds more engineering jobs to keep up with buoyant demand. BlackRock, which announced plans in January to open a service hub in Budapest, said it had received a large number of applications from prospective returnees after a scouting event hosted by the Hungarian embassy in London. About a third of applicants ... were Hungarians working in London who are planning to return to Hungary, corporate communications director Marc Bubeck said. Economists are generally upbeat about prospects for the eastern European region, which is expected to outpace its richer western peers in economic growth in the years ahead despite concerns over its continued reliance on EU development funds. But money isn't everything. In purely financial terms, it is definitely worth working abroad, Kiss said. But if you look at the other side of the equation, that I have yet to ride a sled with my son even though he is already eight, the two are not necessarily in balance. For now, I am full of hopes and dreams, he said. Additional reporting by Tsvetelia Tsolova in SOFIA and Marcin Goettig in WARSAW; Editing by Gareth Jones"

The latest financial troubles of the conglomerate, which has interests ranging from smart cars to online content, have surfaced days after founder and CEO Jia Yueting said its cash problems were far worse than expected and that billions of dollars in funds raised in recent months were not enough to help it ride out the crunch. China Merchants Bank Co Ltd said in a statement on Tuesday it had applied to have some of LeEco's assets frozen because a subsidiary, Leview Mobile HK Limited, had been late making interest payments on a loan. CMB's Shanghai branch repeatedly urged repayment without success and so sought to use legal means, the bank said, adding it now had risks related to the loan under control and did not rule out using friendly talks to resolve the issue. LeEco, which controls smartphone maker Coolpad and its core listed smart TV unit Leshi Internet Information and Technology Corp, has been battling huge financial pressure since Jia admitted last year the company had expanded too fast and was facing big company disease. Shenzhen-listed Leshi Internet Information and Technology Corp issued a statement late Tuesday, saying the Shanghai court had frozen a 26.03 percent stake in LeEco held by Jia, and would do so for three years.  As of Tuesday, Jia, the controlling shareholder, held 26.27 percent of shares in LeEco, the statement added.  According to a court document dated June 26, the Shanghai High People's Court approved a freeze order on 1.237 billion yuan ($182 million) of assets of Leview Mobile HK Limited, two other LeEco-linked firms as well as CEO Jia and his wife. The court document, seen by Reuters, said it had found CMB's application to be in accordance with the law and so the freeze order ruling would come into immediate effect. Local media outlets earlier reported the asset freeze. A LeEco spokesman said the case concerned financing loans related to LeEco's smartphone business, but added LeEco had enough collateral to cover the loan. Our senior executives are currently in close communication with various financing units of CMB, and we hope to resolve the related debt issue very soon, he said. LeEco also hopes to raise further cash to help it get back to normal, he added. In late 2015, CMB agreed a 10 billion yuan loan to LeEco, part of which was used to acquire a stake in Coolpad and was the biggest bank loan to LeEco at the time, financial magazine Caixin said on Monday, citing public information. Suppliers, Partners Some other partners and suppliers are re-examining their exposure to the troubled group. This week, local media reported an affiliated company of electronics manufacturing giant Foxconn divested its 20 percent stake in LeEco's TV and video unit Leshi Zhixin, a blow to the company's core business and one of its most profitable units. Foxconn did not reply to Reuters' request for comment.  LeEco is also facing pressure from China Mobile over late payments of around 14 million yuan, a person with knowledge of the matter said. The carrier declined to comment. In June, Taiwan's Compal Electronics Inc reduced shipments to LeEco, and temporarily suspended its plans to buy shares of Leshi Zhixin, according to local media. At Compal's first quarter investor conference, it said it was monitoring Leshi's repayment abilities and would develop a new strategy to collect its debt, which could involve legal action. Compal did not provide immediate comment when contacted by Reuters. LeEco did not reply to Reuters' requests for comments on its business partners' actions.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-corruption-amnesty-idUSKBN16O29A","Brazilian corruption probe sends politicians running for cover","","March 17, 2017 /  5:28 PM / 4 months ago","","BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian politicians are scrambling to negotiate an amnesty for illicit funding as part of efforts to shield themselves from a widening graft probe that has engulfed President Michel Temer's government and the Congress. Lawmakers have for months sought a legislative slight-of-hand to evade the rapidly expanding Car Wash investigation that has exposed systematic corruption on contracts at state enterprises, particularly oil firm Petrobras. Panic in Brasilia hit fever pitch this week after Prosecutor General Rodrigo Janot, the country's top prosecutor, called for investigations into bribery and political kickbacks that reportedly target six cabinet ministers and over 100 lawmakers. The scandal has reached into Temer's inner circle and, though he is not a target of investigation, threatens his survival and the fate of proposed reforms to curb an untenable budget deficit and pull Brazil out of its worst recession. The corridors of Congress emptied on Wednesday - the day after Janot's request to the Supreme Court was made public - as the political class was convulsed by speculation over who would be on the secret list and how to avoid joining more than 80 businessmen and politicians already in jail. Prosecutors say they are well aware of the efforts to confound their investigation, but remain confident that rising public indignation and the weight of evidence of various crimes will ensure those responsible are brought to justice. There are easily more than 100 politicians we have asked the Supreme Court to be investigated, a senior member of the prosecution team said. When secrecy is lifted and the details made public, we'll have some turbulent days. Lawmakers told Reuters the thrust of behind-the-scenes negotiations is aimed at an amnesty for the widespread practice of obtaining undeclared campaign funds under the table from private companies. That would entail a new law to make the practice, known as caixa dois, a crime but which would prevent retroactive punishment, effectively pardoning anyone guilty of the practice to date. They are trying to put this to the vote, but I don't think they will have the courage to pull this off, said Green Party Deputy Antonio Carlos Thame, an anti-corruption campaigner. Anyone supporting the bill, which has no official sponsor, would face the wrath of an enraged Brazilian electorate in next year's elections. Two attempts to discretely push the measure through the lower house failed last year. It's an insult to public opinion. The intention is clearly to obstruct the Car Wash investigation, said leftist Senator Randolfe Rodrigues, who has sponsored a bill to abolish court prerogatives for politicians.     Anti-Corruption Outcry A general view of Brazil's National Congress during sunrise in Brasilia, Brazil March 13, 2017.Ueslei MarcelinoJanot's request for investigations - the biggest to date in the three-year-old probe - stemmed from 950 depositions given in December by 77 executives from the Odebrecht construction conglomerate.  The company in December signed the world's largest leniency deal with Brazilian, U.S. and Swiss prosecutors and admitted bribing politicians across Latin America and in Africa. Carlos Lima, a federal prosecutor who has helped lead the probe, told Reuters he thinks upward of 350 new investigations could stem from the Odebrecht testimony.  Adding to the worries in Brasilia is mounting public pressure on Congress to abolish the special forum rules that almost guarantee impunity for politicians.  That law means politicians, members of the executive branch and thousands of other officials can only be investigated if the Supreme Court gives permission.  Any trial must then play out in the over-burdened top court, where cases drag on for years and less than 1 percent of politicians get convicted. Supreme Court justices are proposing the prerogative be curbed or eliminated, but lawmakers under investigation, including the government's leader in the Senate, Romero Jucá, are insisting only Congress can make that change.      Even if politicians can avoid conviction, many are conscious that the reputational damage inflicted by the scandal may thwart their hopes of reelection next year. That has put electoral reform back on the agenda. The favored proposal is to move to a system of closed lists in which voters would cast ballots for parties and not individual candidates. That would allow politicians implicated in the investigation to escape the direct wrath of voters. Despite that, Senator Rodrigues expects voters to expel tainted lawmakers in 2018, resulting in a renewal of Congress from where a more honest generation of leaders will arise.      Lima, the prosecutor based in southern Brazil, was also phlegmatic about lawmakers efforts to create an amnesty for 'caixa dois': even if they pull it off, many of those facing investigation would have to answer for other crimes, he said. They would likely face a trial regardless, Lima said, adding that the Odebrecht testimony - once it is made public - will make it clear that bribery was endemic in public life.  The political class needs to understand how this amnesty of corruption would be viewed by the population, Lima said. It would be a crime against the Brazilian people.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/safrica-rand-rigging-idUSL8N1G61MR","South Africa grants Barclays Africa immunity in FX rigging probe","","February 21, 2017 /  8:27 AM / in 5 months","","CAPE TOWN (Reuters) - South Africa's Competition Commission has granted Barclays Africa (BGAJ.J) conditional immunity from prosecution in return for its continuing cooperation in the rand currency trading probe, the head of the Commission said on Tuesday. The Commission said last week it had found more than a dozen local and foreign banks colluded to coordinate trading in the rand and the U.S dollar using an instant chat room called ZAR Domination.  It recommended fines amounting to 10 percent of the banks' South African revenues in a scandal that has piled political pressure on the country's big four banks and raised questions about their dominance in Africa's most industrialised economy.  The local lenders have around a 90 percent market share of the South African banking market.    We did, through the investigation, receive a leniency application from Barclays/ABSA which cooperated and gave us more information, The head of the Commission Tembinkosi Bonakele told a parliamentary committee on Tuesday. We have a conditional agreement with them on immunity but this is subject to confirmation depending on the extent of their cooperation. Barclays Africa, whose branches a branded ABSA and is a regional subsidiary of Barclays Plc (BARC.L), did not immediately respond to a request for comment.   On Monday the Commission said that the local arm of Citigroup (C.N) had agreed to pay a reduced $5 million penalty in settlement for its role in the alleged currency trading cartel after it undertook to cooperate. I would say that the settlement was low, but as a prosecutor you sometimes have to make these calls because we have a bigger case to run, Bonakele said on Tuesday, referring to Citi. The scandal has rattled the share prices of the South African-listed banks, with the sector index .JBANK having dropped by nearly 4 percent over the last four sessions.  Anglo-South African investment bank and asset manager Investec (INVP.L) (INLJ.J) has said again following a statement made earlier this week that it would seek further information from the regulator in order to continue to cooperate, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters. The Competition Commission's case against Investec Limited is confined to the alleged conduct of a single trader who is employed by the bank. This particular trader dealt with interbank clients, Investec said in the memo.  Revenue from Investec's foreign exchange division averaged below 1 percent of its South African bank's total revenue over the last 10 years, according to the memo. Investec's local banking unit reported 10.4 billion rand in total operating income in the year ended March, 2015.   Global Scandal   The Commission began its investigation in April 2015,  joining an international probe into the manipulation of foreign exhange rates that has led to big banks paying more that $10 billion in settlements. Former Citigroup foreign exchange dealer Christopher Cummins and Jason Katz, who worked at Barclays and later BNP Paribas SA, pleaded guilty in the United States to conspiring to fix currency prices last month. Both, along with several others, are named in the South African regulator's report on its investigation that has been referred to the Competition Tribunal, which holds hearings on antitrust matters before giving a ruling. Bonakele said the Commission was seeking a maximum penalty against other banks whose traders are alleged to have been  involved in the scandal but the door was not closed for those seeking to apply for leniency in exchange for information that would help lead to a successful prosecution. President Jacob Zuma said last week that the government would clamp down hard on financial market abuse. Other banks and brokerages named in the case were Nomura (8604.T), Standard Bank (SBKJ.J), Investec (INLJ.J), JP Morgan (JPM.N), BNP Paribas (BNPP.PA), Credit Suisse Group (CSGN.S), Commerzbank AG (CBKG.DE), Standard New York Securities Inc, Macquarie Bank (MQG.AX), Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAML) (BAC.N), ANZ Banking Group Ltd (ANZ.AX) and Standard Chartered Plc (STAN.L) Officials at Standard Bank, BAML, Commerzbank, BNP Paribas, Nomura, Credit Suisse, ANZ, Macquarie and Standard Chartered have so far declined to comment. The other banks have not responded to requests for comment.  ($1 = 13.1161 rand) Additional reporting by Tiisetso Motsoeneng; Editing by James Macharia, Greg Mahlich"

In at least the past four elections, the affluent city famous for its towering thirteenth century gothic cathedral has voted in close alignment with the final national result.  Lying in the Beauce plain 90 km (56 miles) southwest of Paris, Chartres counts perfume makers including Guerlain (LVMH.PA) and Danish pharmaceutical firm Novo Nordisk (NOVOb.CO) as local companies. It should be a fertile ground for center-right challenger Francois Fillon.  The 62-year-old former prime minister's clean-cut, clean-living image had held appeal in Chartres, run for over 15 years by a conservative mayor.  But embarrassing revelations that his family for years benefited from large parliamentary salaries have hurt that image.  In a Reuters poll of 100 people in Chartres city center, more than half said their vote was undecided. The survey intends to provide a snapshot of views in a single location and is not intended to reflect nationwide opinions.  For many in Chartres, the Fillon debacle was a factor behind their indecision.  We are living at a time when the word integrity is becoming meaningless for our politicians. We've had some blatant examples in the past week, 86-year-old Maurice Beauzac told a Reuters multimedia team.  Fillon looked a shoo-in for the Elysee palace before the scandal surfaced two weeks ago, campaigning on a free-market platform to reduce regulation and haul down the stubbornly high unemployment rate.  Related CoverageJobs, integrity top voter concerns in French bellwether city in Reuters pollNow opinion polls suggest he will crash out in the first round. So too will the candidate of the ruling Socialist Party, Benoit Hamon, the surveys indicate, as mainstream parties battle against a rising tide of populism across Europe.  The favorites to reach the runoff vote on May 7 are the far-right National Front's leader, Marine Le Pen, and independent challenger Emmanuel Macron who has yet to release a full manifesto.  Among those polled by Reuters in Chartres, 25 percent said unemployment was their number one concern, while 19 percent named a lack of integrity, or honesty, as their main worry.    Infographic ID: '2kras5j'     A combination picture shows people holding up blackboards showing the most important election issues for them, including health, education, and unity, as they pose for Reuters in Chartres, France February 1, 2017.Stephane MaheFed Up  The high level of uncertainty in Chartres underlines how wide open the presidential race remains. It also points to the disaffection many voters feel towards the political elite.  People are becoming less and less interested in politics, said Sebastien Renault, a 35-year-old florist. It's a world of sharks out there, one eating the other.  It is a sentiment that will worry the main political parties, especially in a place where unemployment runs almost two points below the national average of nearly 10 percent, and a median annual salary of 30,000 euros places it in the top 10 for cities of its small size.  Like France, Chartres is fed up with the traditional political system but it's not only linked with the recent affairs, said Mayor Jean-Pierre Gorges.  Slideshow (14 Images)It's just that the situation in this country has been deteriorating for the past 40 years. Almost everybody has somebody in his family who is out of work.  France's outgoing president, Francois Hollande, was elected in 2012 on a promise to create jobs, winning the hearts of socialists by declaring banks to be his main enemy and pledging extra taxes for millionaires.  But he later launched reforms -- including cutting corporate taxes and legislation to make it easier for companies to hire and fire -- that traditional socialists viewed as a betrayal of left-wing values.  Now it is the anti-European Union Le Pen who rails against free-trade who is pitching herself as the true defender of French workers' interests.  For a photo essay: reut.rs/2k3TE0J Against this backdrop, some in the National Front are optimistic the party will get a boost from the Fillon scandal.  I think all of this clearly plays in Marine's favor, said Aleksandar Nikolic, the youthful head of the National Front's regional branch.  Nikolic expressed surprise that immigration and security ranked low among the concerns of those polled by Reuters.  When we ask the people here what their main concerns are, security and immigration clearly come first, he said.

A spokesman for medical charity Edhi said the attacker appeared to have targeted the women's wing of the shrine, and around 30 children accompanying their mothers were dead. Islamic State, the Middle East-based militant group which has a small but increasingly prominent presence in Pakistan, claimed responsibility for the attack, the group's affiliated news agency AMAQ reported. Senior police officer Shabbir Sethar told Reuters from a local hospital that the death toll was likely to rise. At least 72 are dead and over 150 have been injured, Sethar said by telephone. Television footage from the famous Lal Shahbaz Qalandar shrine in the town of Sehwan Sharif showed army and paramilitary medical teams reaching the site and injured people being taken to nearby hospitals in ambulances and a military helicopter. We were there for the love of our saint, for the worship of Allah, a wailing woman told the Dawn News television channel outside the shrine, her headscarf streaked in blood. Who would hurt us when we were there for devotion? The attack comes as the Pakistani Taliban and rival Islamist militant groups carry out their threats of a new offensive. The violence has shattered a period of improving security, underscoring how militants still undermine stability in the nuclear-armed country of 190 million people. The high death toll at the shrine makes it one of the worst attacks in Pakistan in recent years. Related CoverageIslamic State claims suicide attack on shrine in Pakistan: AMAQIn August last year, at least 74 people, mostly lawyers, were killed in a suicide bombing of a hospital in the southwestern city of Quetta. In November, an explosion claimed by Islamic State ripped through a Muslim shrine in southwestern Pakistan, killing at least 52 people and wounding scores. Sindh Sufis At a crossroads of historic trade routes, religions and cultures, the southern province of Sindh where the shrine is located has always been a poor but religiously tolerant region, helping to shield it from much of the Islamist violence more common in other parts of Pakistan. The country's powerful military, which has cracked down on insurgent groups in recent years leading to a sharp drop in militant violence, vowed a swift, decisive response.

No more restraint for anyone, Army Chief Qamar Bajwa said in a statement. Shortly after the blast, the army announced it was closing the border with Afghanistan with immediate effect for security reasons. Insurgents operate on either side of the neighbors' long and porous frontier. Different militant groups, often trying to outdo each other, say they are responsible for the bombings. In the case of the Quetta hospital blast, both a faction of the Pakistani Taliban - Jamaat-ur-Ahrar - and Islamic State claimed responsibility. Jamaat also said it was responsible for a bombing in the eastern city of Lahore earlier this week that killed 13 people. FILE PHOTO: Devotees pay homage at the tomb of Sufi saint Syed Usman Marwandi, also known as Lal Shahbaz Qalandar, in Sehwan Sharif, in Pakistan's southern Sindh province, September 5, 2013.Akhtar Soomro/File PhotoIn a separate incident late on Thursday, gunmen on a motorbike killed three policemen and one civilian in the city of Dera Ismail Khan. Stand United The bomber entered the shrine as crowds massed on Thursday, a statement from the Sindh police spokesman said. Rescue officials said dozens of wounded people were being ferried in private cars to hospitals. The nearest major hospital was nearly an hour's drive away in Dadu district.  Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif quickly condemned the bombing, decrying the assault on the Sufi religious minority. He vowed to fight Islamist militants, who target the government, judiciary and anyone who does not adhere to their strict interpretation of Sunni Islam. The past few days have been hard, and my heart is with the victims, Sharif said. But we can't let these events divide us, or scare us. We must stand united in this struggle for the Pakistani identity, and universal humanity. An ancient mystic branch of Islam, Sufism has been practiced in Pakistan for centuries. Lal Shahbaz Qalander is Pakistan's most revered Sufi shrine, dedicated to a 13th-century saint whose spirit is invoked by devotees in ecstatic daily dancing and singing rituals in Sehwan Sharif. Thursdays are an especially important day for local Sufis, meaning that the shrine was packed at the time of the blast.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-film-baahubali-india-idUSKBN17F04U","India's biggest film franchise hot on Hollywood's heels","","April 13, 2017 /  1:19 AM / 3 months ago","","HYDERABAD, India (Reuters) - Dozens of animators work into the night in India's southern city of Hyderabad, fueled by caffeine and huddled over computer screens in a darkened studio to put the finishing touches on India's biggest and most ambitious film. The makers of Baahubali 2 hope its top-notch visual effects will wean Indian audiences from Hollywood blockbusters, enticing them with the magical kingdoms, rampaging armies and towering palaces of a homegrown fantasy epic. If art was easy, everybody would do it, said Pete Draper, co-founder of Makuta VFX, which is stitching the film's live-action scenes together with computer-generated imagery. Every single shot has its own challenges. Working hours right now are crazy. We are finishing daily at 4 a.m. Agencies that closely track the box office say Baahubali 2 is the most highly awaited Indian film of the decade. But the competition for Spider-Man and other movie franchises from overseas isn't coming from Bollywood. When it opened in cinemas in 2015, dubbed versions of Baahubali: The Beginning, made in the Telugu language widely spoken in India's southern states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, resonated with audiences nationwide. It used computer-generated imagery to depict ancient kingdoms and bloody wars in a quintessentially Indian battle of good versus evil. Film-maker S.S. Rajamouli aims to do even better when the next installment is released on April 28. Inspired by Hollywood epics such as Ben Hur and The Ten Commandments when growing up, Rajamouli wanted to create a tentpole franchise that delivered a memorable movie experience. But younger audiences were looking to Hollywood franchises such as The Fast and the Furious, and the superheroes of the Marvel and DC Comics universe for the big-screen thrills Indian cinema was unable to provide. They have heavy budgets, they have huge star casts and huge studios backing them, Rajamouli, 43, said in an interview in Hyderabad, his home city. People walk past a poster of an Indian movie Baahubali: The Beginning outside a movie theater in New Delhi, India, April 12, 2017. Picture taken April 12, 2017.Adnan AbidiBut if we make 10 percent of it in an Indian context, with our stories, our heroes and heroines ... we can easily compete. Visual effects head Draper was at the sprawling movie set every day of filming to make sure location shots and actors' movements synchronized with CGI-enhanced rendering on screen. By day, the half-built palace, an arena, the torso of a statue and a stone temple flanked by blue screens don't look sufficiently formidable, so the team of nearly 80 animators has been given the task of fleshing out the heft and detail. People walk past a poster of an Indian movie Baahubali: The Beginning outside a movie theater in New Delhi, India, April 12, 2017. Picture taken April 12, 2017.Adnan AbidiTo keep down production costs on a budget of $67 million, work on the CGI-heavy movie was distributed among 35 studios across continents. We didn't have any studio backing us. Raising capital was a challenge, said Prasad Devineni, one of the producers. If all goes well, a record-breaking run for Baahubali 2 would be a wake-up call for Bollywood, where cinema attendance has halved from a decade ago. In 2016, Indian box-office collections fell to 99 billion rupees ($1.5 billion), down from 101 billion a year earlier. Bollywood, reliant on a tried-and-tested formula of romances and masala thrillers, has failed to develop its own big-ticket franchises, piggy-backing instead on Baahubali, with top producer Karan Johar marketing the movie in Hindi this month. With a spinoff TV series, an animated offering for Amazon videostreaming, a comic book and a possible third film in the works, Baahubali could lure back Indian audiences. It has shown us the way - how to market, build euphoria around it, said Rajkumar Akella, India managing director at global box-office tracker comScore. The makers always envisaged the film as a franchise, with many narratives branching off its storyline, to hook the maximum number of viewers later.Our audiences might be watching English films, or Hollywood films, and getting used to them, but the blood doesn't change, the DNA doesn't change, said Rajamouli.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-politics-security-idUSKBN17M27G","As Venezuela's unrest grows, security forces struggle to boost ranks","","April 20, 2017 /  5:14 PM / 3 months ago","","CARACAS/SAN CRISTOBAL, Venezuela (Reuters) - Venezuela's security forces are finding that low salaries, fear of violent clashes, and opposition to President Nicolas Maduro are hurting their recruiting and retention efforts, sources in or close to the armed forces and police told Reuters. Maduro, a leftist who is facing the fiercest protests against him in three years, has promised to boost the armed forces, police, and civilian defense groups to guard against what he says is an attempt to overthrow 21st century Socialism.  To help meet the needs, Venezuela's National Guard, a branch of the armed forces and the main group in charge of maintaining public order during demonstrations, has reduced training time, increased service time, and waived certain hiring requirements, the sources said.  Police, meanwhile, are struggling with resignations and lack of equipment, they added. The difficulties highlight a risk for Maduro amid a surge of street demonstrations in recent weeks and a devastating economic crisis that has wiped out salaries and left many Venezuelans struggling to eat properly - including low-level soldiers and their relatives.      To be sure, there is no outward sign of dissent in the armed forces, which frequently pledge their loyalty to Maduro.  Maduro's predecessor, the late leader Hugo Chavez, an army lieutenant colonel, turned the military into a bastion of Chavismo after a short-lived coup against him in 2002. The military brass stands to lose should the opposition, which accuses top officers of trafficking drugs and engaging in corrupt business deals with the government, come to power. Authorities deny systemic wrongdoing and say they are cracking down on a few bad eggs.  But behind the impassive faces of ordinary National Guards troops blocking protesters who chant No to dictatorship! during rowdy marches, similar anger sometime lurks. As soon as I finish my 15 years of service next year, I'm out, said a National Guard serviceman, asking to remain anonymous because he is not authorized to speak to media, complaining of a lack of professionalism and salaries that amount to a few dozen dollars a month on the black market. Given a lack of public information about the armed forces, which number about 140,000, it is not possible to get a sense of the extent of the discontent or statistics for resignations or hires.  The Information and Defense Ministries did not respond to requests for comment, although in the past authorities have described criticism of the armed forces as smear attempts.  'Quantity Not Quality'  FILE PHOTO: Riot police take position while clashing with demonstrators during the so-called mother of all marches against Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro in Caracas, Venezuela April 19, 2017.Marco Bello/File PhotoAmid Venezuela's deepening crisis, green uniformed-National Guard troops have also been sent to control food lines at supermarkets, man checkpoints, and guard against theft in hospitals and isolated oil fields. Maduro said in January he wanted to train 10,000 more police officers and 10,000 more members of the National Guard by July, citing the need to combat crime in violent Venezuela.  On Monday he also said he wanted to boost the militia - similar to civilian reserves - to 500,000 this year and arm them all with rifles to held fend off what he says is a U.S.-backed opposition attempt to foment a coup.  A rifle for each militia man, a rifle for each militia woman! said Maduro, sporting a green military hat as he addressed the armed forces.  Slideshow (5 Images)The big aim... is to organize and form one million militia men and woman, trained and armed to defend the peace, sovereignty and independence of our fatherland, he said, pointing to a deepening militarization in a country of around 30 million inhabitants.  Washington has expressed concern over the situation in Venezuela. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Wednesday  the United States is worried Maduro is silencing the opposition.      Training times for National Guard service members dropped from around a year and a half to just six months two years ago after the last wave of major protests, according to three National Guard members, military analyst Rocio San Miguel, and a former general who has turned against the government.  The National Guard has also responded to lack of applicants by extending enrollment periods and ignoring certain hiring stipulations, for example that new recruits cannot have tattoos. The aim is quantity, not quality, Cliver Alcala, the former Chavista general who is now an outspoken critic of Maduro. And shorter training is proportional to the number of resignations. Problems are deepening.  A decade ago, many poor, rural young men saw joining the National Guard or becoming a police officer as a good career path that led to solid salaries and benefits. Now, some sell clothes, shoes, or import goods from neighboring Colombia to help make ends meet, one high-ranking National Guard officer said.  The country's various police forces are also struggling with resignations, according to five internal sources, as officers are exposed to Venezuela's violent streets and often lack adequate protective gear. Of a police force that numbered around 5,000 officers until a few years ago in the northwestern state of Falcon, for instance, around 2,000 have resigned, most of them last year, a source in the police told Reuters. Some of the officers have to buy their own bullets as these are no longer supplied, the source added. The Falcon state government did not respond to a request for comment.

The 39-year-old centrist's victory over far-right nationalist Marine Le Pen in Sunday's election came as a huge relief to European Union allies who had feared another populist upheaval to follow Britain's vote last year to leave the EU and Donald Trump's election as U.S. president. He carries the hopes of millions of French people, and of many people in Germany and the whole of Europe, German Chancellor Angela Merkel told a news conference in Berlin. He ran a courageous pro-European campaign, stands for openness to the world and is committed decisively to a social market economy, the EU's most powerful leader added, congratulating Macron on his spectacular election success. But even while pledging to help France tackle unemployment, Merkel rejected suggestions Germany should do more to support Europe's economy by importing more from its partners to bring down its big trade surplus. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker put it bluntly: With France, we have a particular problem ... The French spend too much money and they spend too much in the wrong places. This will not work over time. The euro fell from six-month highs against the dollar on confirmation of Macron's widely expected victory by a margin of 66 percent to 34 percent. Investors took profit on a roughly 3 percent gain for the currency since he won the first round two on April 23. France's economic malaise, especially high unemployment, had undermined the popularity of outgoing Socialist President Francois Hollande to the point where he decided not even to run again as a candidate. Related CoverageTrump, France's Macron agree to meet May 25 in Brussels: White HouseTurkey's Erdogan calls France's Macron, agrees to meet: Turkish presidential sourcesMany French voters yet to be convinced by MacronThis year, I wanted Emmanuel Macron to be here with me so that a torch could be passed on, said Hollande, appearing with Macron at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at the Arc de Triomphe in Paris to commemorate Victory in Europe Day and the surrender of Nazi forces on May 8, 1945 at the end of World War Two. Elsewhere in Paris, more than 1,500 people, led by the powerful CGT labor federation, marched in protest against Macron's planned liberalization of labor laws. If he continues with the idea of executive orders in July, that means he will sweep away consultation and dialogue, so there will be a problem one way or another. We shall see, Jean-Claude Mailly, secretary general of the hardline leftist Force Ouvriere union told France Info radio.   Parliamentary Majority Outgoing French President Francois Hollande (R) and President-elect Emmanuel Macron attend a ceremony to mark the end of World War II at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, France, May 8, 2017.Benoit TessierOn assuming office next Sunday as France's youngest leader since Napoleon, Macron faces the immediate challenge of securing a majority in the June parliamentary election to have a realistic chance of implementing his plans for lower state spending, higher investment and reform of the tax, labor and pension systems. With the two mainstream parties - the conservative Republicans and the left-wing Socialists - both failing to reach the presidential runoff vote, his chances of winning a majority that supports his election pledges will depend on him widening his centrist base.  The Socialists are torn between the radical left of their defeated candidate Benoit Hamon and the more centrist, pro-business branch led by Manuel Valls, who was prime minister under Hollande. On Monday, key members of the centrist arm of The Republicans appeared ready to work with Macron despite the party hierarchy calling for unity to oppose the new president and calling those that were wavering traitors. Slideshow (22 Images)I can work in a government majority, said Bruno Le Maire, a senior Republicans official, who had been an aide of presidential candidate Francois Fillon, and is tipped by some to become the new foreign minister. The situation is too serious for sectarianism and to be partisan, he said, later adding that Macron's victory was  positive for France. However, a senior Republican, Christian Estrosi, who had backed Macron and been rumored to rally behind him, said on Monday he had turned down a ministerial post in order to focus on his home city of Nice. I will say things clearly: my only ambition is to serve my city and my region and not to enter the government, Estrosi later told reporters. Macron's party chief, Richard Ferrand, told a news conference his En Marche! movement will now change its name to En Marche la République or Republic on the Move, so as to structure itself more like a traditional party. He also said the names of Macron's 577 candidates in the legislative elections would be announced this Thursday. Macron stepped down from the chairmanship of the movement on Thursday and 68-year-old former Socialist government adviser Catherine Barbaroux was named as interim president.  Le Pen, 48, defiantly claimed the mantle of France's main opposition in calling on all patriots to constitute a new political force. Her tally was almost double the score that her father Jean-Marie, the last far-right candidate to make the presidential runoff, achieved in 2002, when he was trounced by the conservative Jacques Chirac.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-australia-economy-debt-idUSKBN1AA2W9","Mortgage brokers feel the heat in Australia's housing fire fight","","July 25, 2017 /  11:27 PM / 2 days ago","","SYDNEY (Reuters) - The cozy relationship between Australia's big banks and mortgage brokers is under threat as authorities worry about risks to the financial system and lenders baulk at the growing costs of incentives for brokers.  Australian banks offer generous inducements to brokers to sign up new borrowers and negotiate larger loans, a system dismantled in the United Kingdom following the global financial crisis.     The Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC) criticized the model in a report earlier this year, saying it encouraged risky behavior and mis-selling, and created conflicts of interests.  Now, with record low interest rates fuelling a surge in home prices and household debt, the government is working on a review that could lead to an overhaul of the country's A$1.7 trillion  ($1.35 trillion) mortgage market. Big banks, reliant on mortgage brokers for more than half of new loans written in recent years, are quietly pushing for changes that would reduce the influence of brokers, sources said.         We are still working on the report, it's a hard one, said a senior official at Treasury, which is running the review. Banks are hoping for a big shake-up. The mortgage broking industry is not with the banks. There is a lot of tension, said the official, who asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to talk to the media.  The Treasury will release its findings in due course, a spokeswoman for the minister of revenue and financial services told Reuters.   Heavy Debt As property prices in Sydney and Melbourne have surged by 70 percent or more in five years, Australia's household debt has jumped to 190 percent of disposable income. That has raised alarm bells among regulators about customers' ability to pay off loans in a downturn and its domino effect on the broader economy. Mortgage brokers have contributed to the surge as loans made by them are typically larger, riskier and are paid off more slowly, according to ASIC. The inherent conflict of interest between banks and brokers means that in a downturn there is an increased possibility of higher bad debt than if the banks had sold all the loans through their own branches, said Omkar Joshi, portfolio manager at Regal Funds Management which has A$1.7 billion in assets. Mortgage brokers do not take on the credit risk but are remunerated based on loan size and duration.     A pair of shoes sits outside a tent that has been erected by homeless people outside the main entrance to the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) building located in central Sydney, Australia, July 18, 2017.David GrayAustralia's banking sector is dominated by four major lenders - Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Westpac Banking Corp, ANZ Banking Group, National Australia Bank.  Banks pay brokers more than A$2 billion annually in payments, including trailing commissions that can continue over the lifetime of the loan. Some banks also offer brokers 'soft dollar' benefits such as loyalty programmes and overseas travel to exotic locations.  In contrast to Australia, all forms of commission to brokers are banned in the Netherlands, and trailing commissions are rare in the United Kingdom and New Zealand. These payments are an illustration of excesses built into the financial system following a 26 year economic boom in Australia, said UBS banking analyst Jonathan Mott. We expect the banks to negotiate materially lower fee-for-service mortgage commissions in coming months.      Others expect banks to continue paying commissions to brokers, although some forms of fee such as overseas junkets and volume-based incentives are likely to be abandoned. Better Rates, Better Service Brokers, most of whom derive their entire income from commissions, argue the big banks want commissions slashed because their earnings growth is under pressure and they are losing market share to smaller lenders and non-bank players. Quite often you're getting a better rate going through a broker than from a bank, said Thomas Patrk, senior finance adviser at Sydney-based mortgage broker Orium Finance. So the whole thing about commissions being a problem is really being driven by the banks. They are losing market share to smaller players who are more nimble, offering better service, better rates. The market share of Australia's big banks shrunk to under 65 percent in home loans this year from 77 percent in 2013.      A review of retail banking remuneration commissioned by the Australian Bankers' Association (ABA) in April recommended doing away with volume-based incentives, soft-dollar payments and higher pay to brokers who engage in sales campaigns. The review asked banks to implement the recommendations as quickly as possible and no later than 2020 but progress has been slow.     CBA, Australia's No.1 mortgage lender, is running behind its own July 1 deadline to implement many of the recommendations on sales commissions, including to third-parties. We haven't made any decisions about changes or how they will be implemented at this stage, a spokeswoman for CBA told Reuters.    NAB said it was committed to moving to a new structure, while others noted the challenges around measures involving brokers. We recognize some initiatives particularly those where third parties carry the primary responsibility for progressing matters... may ultimately require regulatory or legislative intervention, Westpac said in a statement.  ANZ said it was working closely with the mortgage broker industry and the ABA to make sure the changes were implemented. Editing by Lincoln Feast"

Guzman, 59, once one of the world's most wanted drug lords, was accompanied by two court-appointed lawyers during the appearance in federal court in Brooklyn. Best known by the nickname El Chapo, or Shorty in Spanish, the diminutive Guzman was extradited on the eve of Donald Trump's inauguration, raising speculation about the timing. Some officials said it was an olive branch to the incoming U.S. president, who had said he would kick Guzman's ass after taking office. But some Mexican officials pointed out that Guzman's extradition came hours before Barack Obama's term ended in a nod to the outgoing president. Either way current and former law enforcement officials on both sides of the border said the move would likely boost security cooperation and smooth the path for improved relations between the neighbors. The Mexican attorney general's office rejected claims the move was related to Trump's swearing-in, noting that Guzman faces 10 pending cases in Mexico following his U.S. sentence. Guzman, who was once known to carry a gold-plated AK-47 rifle, wore a blue jail uniform. Standing just 5 foot 6 inches (167.6 cm), El Chapo was clean-shaven, without his signature mustache, and his hair was close-cropped.

After U.S. Magistrate Judge James Orenstein asked Guzman if he understood the accusations against him, he responded through a Spanish interpreter, Well, I didn't know until now. Later, when asked again, Guzman said he understood.  An additional hearing was scheduled for Feb. 3. Guzman's lawyers promised a zealous defense to ensure he receives a fair trial, and they said they would examine whether Guzman was extradited appropriately. Mexico's top drug lord Joaquin El Chapo Guzman is escorted as he arrives at Long Island MacArthur airport in New York, U.S., January 19, 2017, after his extradition from Mexico. U.S. officials/Handout via REUTERSI haven't seen any evidence that indicates to me that Mr. Guzman's done anything wrong. Most of you probably haven't seen any evidence like that either, federal public defender Michael Schneider told reporters outside the courthouse. The indictment in Brooklyn against Guzman, with 17 criminal counts, carries a mandatory minimum sentence of life in prison, Robert Capers, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York, said at a news conference earlier in the day. U.S. prosecutors have more than 40 witnesses ready to testify against Guzman, Capers told reporters, adding that the eventual trial will likely last many weeks. Slideshow (10 Images)Who is Chapo Guzman? In short, he's a man known for no other life but a life of crime, violence, death and destruction, and now he'll have to answer to that, Capers said. As leader of the notorious Sinaloa cartel, Guzman oversaw perhaps the world's largest transnational cocaine, heroin and methamphetamine smuggling operation, playing a key role in Mexico's decade-long drug war that has killed over 100,000 people. El Chapo was captured a year ago after he had fled a high-security penitentiary in central Mexico through a mile-long tunnel, his second dramatic prison escape. After court on Friday, he was being sent to a federal jail in New York City that holds prisoners who have pending cases. U.S. authorities, citing security concerns, declined to say where he would be held for the months before trial, but they vowed to prevent any further escapes. I assure you, no tunnel will be built leading to his bathroom, Special Agent In Charge Angel Melendez of U.S. Homeland Security Investigations said at the news conference. Guzman arrived in a small jet at Long Island's MacArthur Airport after nightfall on Thursday from a prison in Juarez in the northern state of Chihuahua, where his cartel rules. A few hours earlier, Guzman was bundled out of the Mexican cell block with his hands cuffed above his bowed head, Mexican television footage showed. U.S. prosecutors gave assurances to Mexican officials that they would not seek the death penalty in order to secure his extradition, Capers said. Mexico opposes capital punishment.
