U.S. companies announced 31,105 planned job cuts in June, a 6.0 percent decline from 33,092 in May, according to outplacement consultancy firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc. The previous month's figure was downwardly revised from 51,692 after Ford Motor Co (F.N) reported it would cut 1,400 workers, not 20,000, as initially reported.  Overall, June's job cuts were down 19.3 percent from a year earlier, when 38,536 layoffs were announced in June 2016. Some companies are not making their layoffs this year, which they might have done if the labor pool wasn't so stretched, especially for skilled labor, John Challenger, chief executive officer of Challenger, Gray and Christmas, told Reuters. With the unemployment rate at 4.3 percent, its lowest since May 2001, employers are having a harder time finding the talent they need so they keep existing workers, Challenger said. The slowdown in layoff activity in June is reflected in the year-to-date totals as well, with the number of planned workforce reductions falling by 28 percent to 227,000 in the first six months of 2017 from more than 313,000 in the first half of 2016. The technology sector, for instance, reported 23,813 job cuts for the first six months of the year, down 52.5 percent from 50,161 announced in the first half of 2016.  One notable exception is in the retail sector, where announced layoffs in the first half of 2016 are the highest since the recession as big chains such as Macy's Inc (M.N) close stores and companies restructure to focus on online sales.  The sector had announced 60,127 job cuts through June, a 42 percent increase from the 42,095 cuts reported through the first half of 2016. This represents the highest number of layoffs in the first half since 2009, according to Challenger. Though the retail sector reported over 5,000 store closings this year, the worst of the layoffs may be behind. Challenger said retailers typically trim their staff in the first quarter after the holiday season before they start to expand again. Reporting by Kimberly Chin; Editing by Dan Burns"

The four-times World Cup overall champion, and 2010 Olympic downhill champion, was fastest at every intermediate stage on the Kandahar course as she finished 0.15 seconds ahead of Switzerland's Lara Gut. Germany's Viktoria Rebensburg was third. The 32-year-old American made her comeback at Altenmark-Zauchensee last Sunday when she finished 13th in the downhill. “I’m so happy that it only took me two races to get back on the top step,” said Vonn, who was 17th on the start list.      “Honestly, I wasn’t sure after Zauchensee how long it would take me. I proved to myself today that all the work that I put in is really coming through.” It was Vonn's 77th win in a World Cup race, leaving her nine short of the record set by Sweden's Ingemar Stenmark. “I’ve worked really hard to come back and I feel like sometimes I come back so quickly that everyone forgets how much time and energy, blood, sweat and tears it takes to come back without any training and just jump in there, said Vonn. I just had to trust myself, my team and my technician. Vonn suffered a knee injury in Andorra late last February and then broke her arm in training in Colorado in November, requiring an intensive program of rehabilitation. She also suffered lingering nerve damage. Gut, last year's overall World Cup winner, is second this year and trimmed American Mikaela Shiffrin's lead to 235 points.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-quidsi-idUSKBN1702TJ","Amazon plans layoffs at Quidsi unit after losses","","March 29, 2017 /  6:58 PM / 4 months ago","","(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) plans to cut 263 jobs at its money-losing parenting products unit Quidsi this summer as part of a business restructuring, it said in a notice filed with New Jersey on Wednesday. The New Jersey-based subsidiary operates Diapers.com, Soap.com and other websites. We have worked extremely hard for the past seven years to get Quidsi to be profitable and unfortunately we have not been able to do so, an Amazon spokeswoman said in a statement. Quidsi's software development team will focus on building technology for the grocery delivery service AmazonFresh, the statement said. The move underscores a shift in Amazon's focus to groceries and other areas since it closed its $500 million cash acquisition of Quidsi in 2011. Fresh food represents a large and fledgling market for online retailers, in contrast to goods such diapers that have been the subject of price wars in recent years. Consumables like soap and pet food are often priced very competitively by retailers in order to drive price perception and ultimately drive online and in-store traffic, said Guru Hariharan, chief executive of retail technology company Boomerang Commerce. While unfortunate, the shutting down of the Quidsi sites isn't completely surprising. The market appeared to welcome Amazon's attention to losses at the subsidiary, unusual for a company that has prioritized long-term investments over profit. Amazon's stock briefly hit a record high of $876.44 before closing at $874.32. Its chief executive and largest shareholder, Jeff Bezos, gained nearly $1.5 billion from the 2.1 percent stock rise. Shot at Rival? Quidsi was co-founded by Marc Lore, who sold the company during heated competition from Amazon Mom subscriptions that offered free shipping and perks on baby items. Amazon has been keen to attract subscribers, who order more goods more often, and now is estimated to have more than 50 million U.S. members in its fast-shipping club Prime. Lore went on to found e-commerce startup Jet.com, which was acquired by Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) last year in an attempt to rival Amazon online. Lore now is CEO of Wal-Mart's U.S. e-commerce division. It is likely that Prime has grown to the point where members no longer separately shop on Diapers.com or Soap.com so maintenance of separate product-specific sites makes less sense, Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter said. It is possible that they are taking a shot at Mark Lore for competition at Wal-Mart. Amazon on Tuesday announced a test phase of AmazonFresh Pickup, similar to a program offered by Wal-Mart and other grocers. Customers order online and schedule a pickup at stores.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tennis-federer-idUSKBN14C114","Federer expects injury layoff to prolong playing career","","December 23, 2016 /  10:48 AM / 7 months ago","","MUMBAI (Reuters) - Roger Federer believes his six-month absence due to a knee injury could help prolong his playing career, with the 17-times grand slam winner saying he has enjoyed the break. The 35-year-old Swiss had surgery on his left knee in February and, after missing the French Open with a back injury, announced in July that he needed extensive rehabilitation and would be sidelined for the rest of the season. Federer returns to action at the Hopman Cup, starting on Jan. 1, which he will play in for the first time since he teamed up with his now wife Mirka in 2002. He will partner compatriot Belinda Bencic, 19, at the international team tournament in Perth. Federer said it was a tough call to take a six-month break and he looked at the bigger picture before deciding. I do believe that it could be very beneficial for the future of my tennis career, he told reporters on a conference call.  To have had this six-month layoff, rejuvenated, refreshed... maybe mentally I needed this rest more than I thought I would. Maybe my body needed a rest more than I thought it would. I tried to look at the big picture, I hope it's going to pay off. At least one thing I know now is I have no regrets. I did everything this year to get my body back in shape. It didn't feel too grueling, too long, too hard to go through this process. I have actually enjoyed it. Unique Year For much of his career, the former world number one had been blessed with a body that seemed bullet-proof against the aches, pains and injuries suffered by most top athletes. Until May this year, Federer had appeared in 65 successive grand slam tournaments and the last time he was absent from one of the four majors was at the 1999 U.S. Open. But his semi-final defeat by Canadian Milos Raonic at Wimbledon, which saw him drop to 16 in the world rankings, was his last professional match this year. Federer said his goal was to get fully fit and he was looking forward to a few matches in Perth before the year's first grand slam starts later in the month in Melbourne. This year is unique because maybe this is the year more than any time before where I do need matches at the beginning of the season, Federer said, adding that he was doing everything possible to add more majors to his trophy cabinet. Matches have a different intensity about it and your body reacts according to it. Federer said he had expected Andy Murray to be world number one at some point but was surprised the Briton finished the year at the top of the rankings ahead of Serb Novak Djokovic. That just gives even more credit to Andy for not becoming world number one but finishing world number one, he said. Those are two separate things.  Becoming world number one for a week or finishing a year as world number one, it's a different animal. Editing by Ken Ferris"

CNPC, China's top oil and gas group, said on Tuesday on its social media blog it planned to cut staff at its headquarters by 20 percent, first among the state energy giants to announce a reduction plan amid a 2-1/2-year oil price rout. CNPC did not specify in the blog how many jobs will be affected. Approximately 3,000 people work at the group's Beijing headquarters, according to estimate by a senior CNPC official. But rather than real job cuts like ones implemented by global energy peers to bring down costs, the Chinese state group will move jobs from its headquarters to specialized business operations, including a financial firm and an oil services company, company officials said. CNPC has not made any job cuts at worse times when oil prices were much lower. Why should they cut now with oil price recovering? said Lin Boqiang, an independent board director at PetroChina, CNPC's flagship listed vehicle. Barely anyone will lose jobs. Our headquarters staff are well-trained professionals who can easily fit in jobs at business units, a company spokesman said. China's state energy sector has in the past few years undergone major restructuring to become more efficient and competitive, selling stakes at pipeline and fuel retail businesses and listing non-core units. Companies like PetroChina and Sinopec have also carried out widespread pay cuts to reduce costs as earnings sank, but none of them has made any major job cuts due to management worries about social stability.

GM said last week it planned to lay off 1,100 workers in May at its Lansing Delta Township assembly plant in Michigan. The company is moving production of the GMC Acadia mid-size SUV to Spring Hill, Tennessee, from the factory, which will build just two models, the Chevrolet Traverse and Buick Enclave SUVs.  The company said that when it begins full production of the new versions of the two models in 2018, it would bring back approximately 500 jobs to give the company flexibility to meet market demand. Last year, pickups and SUVs accounted for 59.5 percent of  U.S. auto sales, up from 55.8 percent in 2015. GM also said it would add 220 jobs at a plant in Romulus, Michigan, that is building 10-speed automatic transmissions, and it would retain 180 jobs by shifting Lansing workers to a Flint assembly plant to support pickup truck production. The announcement came as U.S. President Donald Trump visited Michigan to announce his administration will review fuel efficiency standards, a move that could help automakers sell more larger models.         Trump praised recent job announcements by Ford Motor Co, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV and GM.  That's just the beginning, he said in a speech to autoworkers in Ypsilanti, Michigan, on Wednesday. I told (the auto executives) that's peanuts, that's peanuts. We're going to have a lot more. They're going to be building new plants, expanding their plants. Trump has discouraged the industry from investing in Mexico and urged foreign automakers on Wednesday to add U.S. production at a roundtable that included executives from Toyota Motor Corp, Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) and others.    GM did not credit Trump with the decision to add jobs. We haven’t fundamentally changed any of our plans, but we continue to look for ways to improve our operations and find ways to help the country, grow jobs and support economic growth, GM spokesman Pat Morrissey said. With analysts forecasting U.S. auto sales are at or near their peak, no automaker has announced plans to build a new plant despite pressure from Trump. The Detroit automaker in recent months has announced other U.S. job cuts and new investments. GM said in January it would invest another $1 billion in its U.S. factories. GM said in November it would cut about 2,000 jobs when it ended the third shift at its Lordstown, Ohio, and Lansing Grand River, Michigan, plants in January. In December, it said it planned to cancel the second shift and cut nearly 1,300 jobs from its Detroit-Hamtramck assembly plant in March.

Gildan won the rights to American Apparel's brand with an $88 million bid in a bankruptcy auction last week. It had previously indicated it would assume some of its manufacturing operations, which had made the brand synonymous with Made in the U.S.A. American Apparel spokeswoman Arielle Patrick said the company was laying off about 2,400 workers in Southern California. The company had 2,166 employees at its headquarters in Los Angeles, and 959 employees at the nearby South Gate manufacturing facility. Francisco Morales, 56, who made clothes for seven years at the Los Angeles plant, was one of the American Apparel workers to be handed his employment termination notice and his last paycheck on Monday. It's really bad what happened here, really bad, Morales said in Spanish, according to a co-worker who translated into English. He said he had three children and was worried about finding another job with the same benefits, because of his age. The company issued a WARN Act notice several months ago, letting employees know that depending on the buyer of the business, a sale could result in eventual shrinkage of some business areas, American Apparel said in an emailed statement. Last week, American Apparel reached a preliminary deal to sell its Garden Grove manufacturing site to textile manufacturer Broncs Inc, re-launching it as a knitting and dyeing facility.  The company is pleased that it was able to secure a second agreement with Broncs, which plans to save over 300 jobs when they take over the Garden Grove facility, the statement added. Gildan had already indicated it would not take on any of American Apparel's 110 stores. Without another buyer for these stores, American Apparel has started to shut them down. American Apparel filed for a second time for bankruptcy protection, known as a Chapter 11 filing, in November with about $177 million in debt after the failure of a turnaround plan. It had filed for its first Chapter 11 in October 2015 and emerged from bankruptcy early last year. Close to 90 percent of Gildan's 42,000 employees are in Caribbean and Central American countries where costs are lower, and the company does not manufacture clothes other than socks in the United States. Gildan had previously said it would take into account that American Apparel's U.S. manufacturing heritage is a component of the brand but had noted that its manufacturing plan would also consider factors like transportation and energy costs. Gildan is in the process of developing its go-forward plans for the brand, including decisions regarding manufacturing, distribution and go-to-market strategies, company spokesman Garry Bell said in an email.

Boeing's machinists union, the touch labor that builds airplanes near Seattle, said about 1,575 workers had taken voluntary layoffs by the deadline in February.  Boeing's white-collar union said Boeing accepted 305 members for voluntary layoffs in January. Last year, Boeing cut about 1,200 white-collar union jobs - 850 through voluntary layoffs and 350 through involuntary reductions, said Bill Dugovich, spokesman for the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace.  Boeing has told us to expect about the same number of total layoffs in 2017 as 2016, he said.      The job reductions had been announced last year and workers had until Feb. 1 to apply.  These are all voluntary, where people planned to retire or had other plans, said Connie Kelliher, a spokeswoman for the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District 751.

Boeing's machinists union, the touch labor that builds airplanes near Seattle, said about 1,575 workers had taken voluntary layoffs by the deadline in February.  Boeing's white-collar union said Boeing accepted 305 members for voluntary layoffs in January. Last year, Boeing cut about 1,200 white-collar union jobs - 850 through voluntary layoffs and 350 through involuntary reductions, said Bill Dugovich, spokesman for the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace.  Boeing has told us to expect about the same number of total layoffs in 2017 as 2016, he said.      The job reductions had been announced last year and workers had until Feb. 1 to apply.  These are all voluntary, where people planned to retire or had other plans, said Connie Kelliher, a spokeswoman for the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District 751.  Cost-Cutting Drive Boeing said it did not have a specific target number for its job reductions at the commercial airplane unit but was sticking with the broad plan of reducing jobs it outlined in December. We are reducing costs and aligning employment levels to business and market requirements, spokesman Paul Bergman  said. Employment reductions will come through a combination of attrition, leaving open positions unfilled, voluntary layoff program and in some cases, involuntary layoffs. Boeing offered the buyouts to workers last year as part of an 8 percent workforce reduction at its commercial airplane business. The unit had about 74,600 workers at the end of February. Boeing said in December it would cut an as-yet-undetermined number of jobs in 2017. No machinists have had involuntary layoffs for several years, Kelliher said.

Staff at Rasgas were told earlier this year that they would be laid off in June, with the job cuts following last year's decision to merge RasGas with Qatargas, the two liquefied natural gas divisions of Qatar Petroleum [QATPE.UL]. But in a company email last month staff were informed that the job cuts had been delayed, two Rasgas employees said. It was not immediately clear whether the delay meant the  entire merger had been postponed. The move comes as Qatar works to cope with sanctions imposed by Saudi Arabia and other Arab states, striking trade deals and cancelling the leave of foreign expatriate workers in essential government sectors to help cope with the crisis.        The layoffs were postponed. No reason was given, said one of the employees, who declined to be named. A Rasgas spokeswoman was not available to comment. Qatar Petroleum's chief executive said at the end of last year the merger of RasGas and Qatargas would help to cut operating costs by hundreds of millions of dollars at the world's largest LNG producer, and another group official familiar with the plan said hundreds of people would be laid off. An official working at a Gulf energy company said Doha was apparently postponing the layoffs because it needed to focus the attention of leaders and managers on the diplomatic crisis, which has disrupted some imports into the country. I still think the job cuts will happen in the long run, as the Rasgas-Qatargas merger will go ahead and many of the jobs are duplicated across both organizations, said the official.  This seems to be a case of 'we currently have bigger fish to fry than a fast merger'. Last month Qatar announced plans to expand its LNG production capacity by 30 percent and build infrastructure to bolster its role as a major global supplier amid rising LNG output from Australia and the United States. With the political crisis and this output expansion, it is all hands on deck, said a Qatar Petroleum official.

The Berlin-based start-up is different from rivals Apple , Spotify and Amazon in that it relies more on amateur musicians, for whom it provides a rare platform, and less on major commercial artists. But like them, it has yet to turn a profit. The big music labels on which most of the services depend - themselves under pressure from the shift to digital music - strike hard bargains. And SoundCloud - which said three years ago it had an audience of 175 million, a figure it has not updated - lacks either Spotify's large base of paying subscribers or the deep pockets of Apple and Amazon that can subsidise their music services. Last week, SoundCloud said it was firing 173 staffers and closing its London and San Francisco offices to focus on Berlin and New York. We're on our path to profitability and in control of SoundCloud's independent future, co-founder Alex Ljung wrote in a blog post. Technology website TechCrunch reported, however, that staff were told at a meeting this week that the layoffs only saved the company enough cash to hold out until the fourth quarter - a comment a company spokesman has now confirmed. He declined to comment on funding beyond the end of the year. The news has reignited speculation that SoundCloud will be acquired by a rival. It was targeted by Spotify last year in a bid that was later aborted. Spotify, recently valued at $13 billion, is now planning a direct listing on the New York Stock Exchange later this year or in early 2018, sources told Reuters in May. The biggest problem I see is that the financial problems will absorb much of management's time in trying to raise more money, meaning that the real problems of the business go unaddressed, independent technology analyst Richard Windsor wrote in a note. Of all the potential suitors, I think Google makes the most sense, he said, noting SoundCloud's similarity to Google's YouTube in its focus on user-generated content. Google will probably be most able to monetise what SoundCloud cannot. SoundCloud, which was launched in 2008 and has never said how many paying subscribers it has, last month launched a budget subscription package in the hope of persuading more listeners to convert from the free service. SoundCloud raised $100 million last June from a group of investors including Twitter, valuing the company at roughly $700 million, according to Re/code. In March, it raised a further $70 million in debt from Ares Capital, Kreos Capital and Davidson Technology to meet its expected 2.5 times year-on-year revenue growth in 2017, a company spokeswoman said. Co-founder Alex Ljung said in a public interview at the Tech Open Air conference in Berlin this week that the company was fundraising, although he declined to comment on a rumour it was trying to raise $250 million.

The case was brought to the European Court of Justice after Greek cement maker AGET Iraklis, whose main shareholder is LafargeHolcim, was prevented in 2013 from making collective redundancies by the then-government because of the economic crisis and the high levels of unemployment in the country.  The court ruled that the Greek law goes against EU rules on companies' freedom to set up businesses in EU states. The Greek legislation is liable to constitute a serious obstacle to the exercise of freedom of establishment in Greece, a note from the court said. The judges recognized the principle that a government is entitled to block mass layoffs in certain circumstances in the interests of the protection of workers and of employment, but said the Greek law was too vague and gave the authorities excessive discretion beyond what is necessary.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-economy-idUSL2N1GL1V8","U.S. weekly jobless claims rise; layoffs fall in February","","March 9, 2017 /  1:33 PM / 5 months ago","","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits last week rebounded from a near 44-year low, but the labor market continues to tighten amid a sharp drop in job cuts in February. Initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 20,000 to a seasonally adjusted 243,000 for the week ended March 4, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Claims for the prior week were unrevised at 223,000, the lowest level since March 1973. There is no evidence of a pickup in involuntary employment separations. We view this as evidence of a tight labor market, said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.Jobless claims have now been below the 300,000 threshold associated with a healthy labor market for 105 straight weeks. That is the longest stretch since 1970, when the labor market was much smaller. The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose 2,250 to 236,500 last week. A separate report from global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas showed U.S.-based employers announced 36,957 job cuts in February, down 19 percent from January. Layoffs tumbled 40 percent compared to February last year.   The labor market is at or close to full employment, with employers increasingly reporting difficulties finding qualified workers for open job positions.  The sustained strength in the jobs market is likely to be corroborated on Friday with the release of the government's closely watched employment report for February. Strong Payrolls Expected According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls probably gained 190,000 jobs last month after surging 227,000 in January. But payrolls could surprise on the upside after a report on Wednesday showed private sector employers hired 298,000 workers in February, the largest amount in a year. The unemployment rate is forecast falling one-tenth of a percentage point to 4.7 percent. Labor market tightness together with firming inflation could allow the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates as early as next week. Fed Chair Janet Yellen signaled last week that the U.S. central bank would likely raise rates at its March 14-15 policy meeting. The Fed raised its benchmark overnight rate in December and has forecast three rate increases for 2017. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi suggested there was less need for the ECB to prop up growth and inflation in the euro zone. Prices for U.S. Treasuries fell, while rose marginally. The labor market strength comes despite the economy showing signs of fatigue early in the first quarter. Data on trade, consumer, business and construction spending were soft in January, leaving the Atlanta Fed forecasting GDP increasing at a 1.2 percent rate in the first quarter. The economy grew at a 1.9 percent annualized rate in the fourth quarter, slowing from the third quarter's brisk 3.5 percent pace. In another report on Thursday, the Labor Department said import prices rose 0.2 percent last month after advancing 0.6 percent in January. It was the third straight monthly increase.  In the 12 months through February, import prices accelerated 4.6 percent, the largest gain since February 2012, after rising 3.8 percent in January.  Import prices excluding fuels rose 0.3 percent, the first increase since July, suggesting the drag on prices from a stronger dollar was fading. That could result in a broader increase in imported inflation. Import prices excluding fuels slipped 0.1 percent in January. We expect import prices to firm further in the coming months. The recent pickup in import prices from industrialized trading partners provides further support to our view, said Blerina Uruci, an economist at Barclays in Washington.

A spokeswoman the SoundCloud declined to comment on the TechCrunch article in depth. She did say, SoundCloud is fully funded into the fourth quarter. We continue to be confident the changes made last week put us on our path to profitability and ensure SoundCloud’s long-term viability.  She declined to comment on funding beyond the end of the year.  The news has reignited speculation that SoundCloud will be acquired by a rival. It was targeted by Spotify last year in a bid that was later aborted. Spotify, recently valued at $13 billion, is now planning a direct listing on the New York Stock Exchange later this year or in early 2018, sources told Reuters in May. The biggest problem I see is that the financial problems will absorb much of management's time in trying to raise more money, meaning that the real problems of the business go unaddressed, independent technology analyst Richard Windsor wrote in a note. Of all the potential suitors, I think Google makes the most sense, he said, noting SoundCloud's similarity to Google's YouTube in its focus on user-generated content. Google will probably be most able to monetize what SoundCloud cannot. SoundCloud, which was launched in 2008 and has never said how many paying subscribers it has, last month launched a budget subscription package in the hope of persuading more listeners to convert from the free service. SoundCloud raised $100 million last June from a group of investors including Twitter, valuing the company at roughly $700 million, according to Re/code. In March, it raised a further $70 million in debt from Ares Capital, Kreos Capital and Davidson Technology to meet its expected 2.5 times year-on-year revenue growth in 2017, a company spokeswoman said. Co-founder Alex Ljung said in a public interview at the Tech Open Air conference in Berlin this week that the company was fundraising, although he declined to comment on a rumor it was trying to raise $250 million.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/amazoncom-quidsi-idUSL2N1H61MI","Amazon plans layoffs at Quidsi unit after losses","","March 29, 2017 /  6:58 PM / 4 months ago","","(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) plans to cut 263 jobs at its money-losing parenting products unit Quidsi this summer as part of a business restructuring, it said in a notice filed with New Jersey on Wednesday. The New Jersey-based subsidiary operates Diapers.com, Soap.com and other websites. We have worked extremely hard for the past seven years to get Quidsi to be profitable and unfortunately we have not been able to do so, an Amazon spokeswoman said in a statement. Quidsi's software development team will focus on building technology for the grocery delivery service AmazonFresh, the statement said. The move underscores a shift in Amazon's focus to groceries and other areas since it closed its $500 million cash acquisition of Quidsi in 2011. Fresh food represents a large and fledgling market for online retailers, in contrast to goods such diapers that have been the subject of price wars in recent years. Consumables like soap and pet food are often priced very competitively by retailers in order to drive price perception and ultimately drive online and in-store traffic, said Guru Hariharan, chief executive of retail technology company Boomerang Commerce. While unfortunate, the shutting down of the Quidsi sites isn't completely surprising. The market appeared to welcome Amazon's attention to losses at the subsidiary, unusual for a company that has prioritized long-term investments over profit. Amazon's stock briefly hit a record high of $876.44 before closing at $874.32. Its chief executive and largest shareholder, Jeff Bezos, gained nearly $1.5 billion from the 2.1 percent stock rise. Shot at Rival? Quidsi was co-founded by Marc Lore, who sold the company during heated competition from Amazon Mom subscriptions that offered free shipping and perks on baby items. Amazon has been keen to attract subscribers, who order more goods more often, and now is estimated to have more than 50 million U.S. members in its fast-shipping club Prime. Lore went on to found e-commerce startup Jet.com, which was acquired by Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) last year in an attempt to rival Amazon online. Lore now is CEO of Wal-Mart's U.S. e-commerce division. It is likely that Prime has grown to the point where members no longer separately shop on Diapers.com or Soap.com so maintenance of separate product-specific sites makes less sense, Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter said. It is possible that they are taking a shot at Mark Lore for competition at Wal-Mart. Amazon on Tuesday announced a test phase of AmazonFresh Pickup, similar to a program offered by Wal-Mart and other grocers. Customers order online and schedule a pickup at stores. The news about Quidsi was reported earlier by Bloomberg. Reporting by Jeffrey Dastin in San Francisco; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe and Leslie Adler"
"https://www.reuters.com/article/americanapparel-layoffs-idUSL1N1F60RM","Bankrupt U.S. retailer American Apparel starts layoffs","","January 16, 2017 /  5:58 PM / 6 months ago","","(Reuters) - American Apparel LLC said it had started to lay off staff on Monday, after Canadian apparel maker Gildan Activewear Inc (GIL.TO) withdrew its initial plan to acquire some of the bankrupt U.S. fashion retailer's manufacturing operations. Gildan won the rights to American Apparel's brand with an $88 million bid in a bankruptcy auction last week. It had previously indicated it would assume some of its manufacturing operations, which had made the brand synonymous with Made in the U.S.A. American Apparel spokeswoman Arielle Patrick said the company was laying off about 2,400 workers in Southern California. The company had 2,166 employees at its headquarters in Los Angeles, and 959 employees at the nearby South Gate manufacturing facility. Francisco Morales, 56, who made clothes for seven years at the Los Angeles plant, was one of the American Apparel workers to be handed his employment termination notice and his last paycheck on Monday. It's really bad what happened here, really bad, Morales said in Spanish, according to a co-worker who translated into English. He said he had three children and was worried about finding another job with the same benefits, because of his age. The company issued a WARN Act notice several months ago, letting employees know that depending on the buyer of the business, a sale could result in eventual shrinkage of some business areas, American Apparel said in an emailed statement. Last week, American Apparel reached a preliminary deal to sell its Garden Grove manufacturing site to textile manufacturer Broncs Inc, re-launching it as a knitting and dyeing facility.  The company is pleased that it was able to secure a second agreement with Broncs, which plans to save over 300 jobs when they take over the Garden Grove facility, the statement added. Gildan had already indicated it would not take on any of American Apparel's 110 stores. Without another buyer for these stores, American Apparel has started to shut them down. American Apparel filed for a second time for bankruptcy protection, known as a Chapter 11 filing, in November with about $177 million in debt after the failure of a turnaround plan. It had filed for its first Chapter 11 in October 2015 and emerged from bankruptcy early last year. Close to 90 percent of Gildan's 42,000 employees are in Caribbean and Central American countries where costs are lower, and the company does not manufacture clothes other than socks in the United States. Gildan had previously said it would take into account that American Apparel's U.S. manufacturing heritage is a component of the brand but had noted that its manufacturing plan would also consider factors like transportation and energy costs. Gildan is in the process of developing its go-forward plans for the brand, including decisions regarding manufacturing, distribution and go-to-market strategies, company spokesman Garry Bell said in an email.  He said the company would provide more details on its plan in a Feb. 23 conference call.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy-idUSKBN16G1TN","U.S. weekly jobless claims rise; layoffs fall in February","","March 9, 2017 /  1:33 PM / 5 months ago","","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits last week rebounded from a near 44-year low, but the labor market continues to tighten amid a sharp drop in job cuts in February. Initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 20,000 to a seasonally adjusted 243,000 for the week ended March 4, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Claims for the prior week were unrevised at 223,000, the lowest level since March 1973. There is no evidence of a pickup in involuntary employment separations. We view this as evidence of a tight labor market, said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.Jobless claims have now been below the 300,000 threshold associated with a healthy labor market for 105 straight weeks. That is the longest stretch since 1970, when the labor market was much smaller. The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose 2,250 to 236,500 last week. A separate report from global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas showed U.S.-based employers announced 36,957 job cuts in February, down 19 percent from January. Layoffs tumbled 40 percent compared to February last year.   The labor market is at or close to full employment, with employers increasingly reporting difficulties finding qualified workers for open job positions.  The sustained strength in the jobs market is likely to be corroborated on Friday with the release of the government's closely watched employment report for February. Strong Payrolls Expected According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls probably gained 190,000 jobs last month after surging 227,000 in January. But payrolls could surprise on the upside after a report on Wednesday showed private sector employers hired 298,000 workers in February, the largest amount in a year. The unemployment rate is forecast falling one-tenth of a percentage point to 4.7 percent. Labor market tightness together with firming inflation could allow the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates as early as next week. Fed Chair Janet Yellen signaled last week that the U.S. central bank would likely raise rates at its March 14-15 policy meeting. The Fed raised its benchmark overnight rate in December and has forecast three rate increases for 2017. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi suggested there was less need for the ECB to prop up growth and inflation in the euro zone. Prices for U.S. Treasuries fell, while rose marginally. The labor market strength comes despite the economy showing signs of fatigue early in the first quarter. Data on trade, consumer, business and construction spending were soft in January, leaving the Atlanta Fed forecasting GDP increasing at a 1.2 percent rate in the first quarter. The economy grew at a 1.9 percent annualized rate in the fourth quarter, slowing from the third quarter's brisk 3.5 percent pace. In another report on Thursday, the Labor Department said import prices rose 0.2 percent last month after advancing 0.6 percent in January. It was the third straight monthly increase.  In the 12 months through February, import prices accelerated 4.6 percent, the largest gain since February 2012, after rising 3.8 percent in January.  Import prices excluding fuels rose 0.3 percent, the first increase since July, suggesting the drag on prices from a stronger dollar was fading. That could result in a broader increase in imported inflation. Import prices excluding fuels slipped 0.1 percent in January. We expect import prices to firm further in the coming months. The recent pickup in import prices from industrialized trading partners provides further support to our view, said Blerina Uruci, an economist at Barclays in Washington.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/gm-jobs-idUSL2N1GS0M4","GM will rehire 500 Michigan workers slated for layoffs","","March 15, 2017 /  12:58 PM / 4 months ago","","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - General Motors Co plans next year to rehire 500 Michigan assembly plant workers who are to be laid off in May, citing increased demand for larger vehicles, the company said on Wednesday. GM said last week it planned to lay off 1,100 workers in May at its Lansing Delta Township assembly plant in Michigan. The company is moving production of the GMC Acadia mid-size SUV to Spring Hill, Tennessee, from the factory, which will build just two models, the Chevrolet Traverse and Buick Enclave SUVs.  The company said that when it begins full production of the new versions of the two models in 2018, it would bring back approximately 500 jobs to give the company flexibility to meet market demand. Last year, pickups and SUVs accounted for 59.5 percent of  U.S. auto sales, up from 55.8 percent in 2015. GM also said it would add 220 jobs at a plant in Romulus, Michigan, that is building 10-speed automatic transmissions, and it would retain 180 jobs by shifting Lansing workers to a Flint assembly plant to support pickup truck production. The announcement came as U.S. President Donald Trump visited Michigan to announce his administration will review fuel efficiency standards, a move that could help automakers sell more larger models.         Trump praised recent job announcements by Ford Motor Co, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV and GM.  That's just the beginning, he said in a speech to autoworkers in Ypsilanti, Michigan, on Wednesday. I told (the auto executives) that's peanuts, that's peanuts. We're going to have a lot more. They're going to be building new plants, expanding their plants. Trump has discouraged the industry from investing in Mexico and urged foreign automakers on Wednesday to add U.S. production at a roundtable that included executives from Toyota Motor Corp, Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) and others.    GM did not credit Trump with the decision to add jobs. We haven’t fundamentally changed any of our plans, but we continue to look for ways to improve our operations and find ways to help the country, grow jobs and support economic growth, GM spokesman Pat Morrissey said. With analysts forecasting U.S. auto sales are at or near their peak, no automaker has announced plans to build a new plant despite pressure from Trump. The Detroit automaker in recent months has announced other U.S. job cuts and new investments. GM said in January it would invest another $1 billion in its U.S. factories. GM said in November it would cut about 2,000 jobs when it ended the third shift at its Lordstown, Ohio, and Lansing Grand River, Michigan, plants in January. In December, it said it planned to cancel the second shift and cut nearly 1,300 jobs from its Detroit-Hamtramck assembly plant in March.

JBS is among dozens of firms targeted in an investigation by the Brazilian federal police on alleged bribery of government health inspectors and politicians. The company suspended beef production at 33 of its 36 plants in Brazil last week after some of the country's biggest export markets banned imports of Brazilian meats. It will restart production this week at about two thirds of capacity. On Saturday, China, Egypt and Chile lifted the suspensions, bringing hope of an end to a crisis that wiped off about one-fifth of the value of Brazilian pork and poultry exports last week. Folha cited an unidentified JBS senior executive who said that the worst of the crisis has passed. JBS expects to resume exports to the three countries soon, though sales are likely to recover slowly. Press representatives for JBS were not immediately available to comment on the report. Common shares in JBS touched a 15-week low last Monday before recovering part of the scandal-driven losses, ending the week 2.1 percent higher. They are still down 8.7 percent since police unveiled the probe on March 17. According to the Folha report, JBS will decide in coming days whether to suspend plans to list the JBS Foods International overseas unit. A person involved in the deal told Reuters last week JBS had no intention to delay the $1 billion IPO of JBS Foods in New York, which it hopes to finalize in May or June.

The strike involves workers in southern Argentina's Vaca Muerta shale play, one of the largest unconventional reserves in the world and a region that has attracted investment from Chevron Corp and Exxon Mobil Corp but remains largely unexplored.  YPF's layoffs will mainly affect workers who have remained on the payroll although their units have been inactive for the bulk of the year, a company source said on Thursday.  We are demanding that those workers be re-hired, said Guillermo Pereyra, a national senator and secretary-general of a union representing oil and gas workers in Argentina's Neuquen, Rio Negro and La Pampa provinces.  Strikes and other labor protests are common in Argentina, where high inflation has prompted wage increase demands from many unions representing workers wary of losing purchasing power.  Pereyra said employment in the sector had been affected by an increase in fuel imports, given that the price of crude on world markets is well below the local price due to a government subsidy for domestic producers.

The layoffs include 19 IAPE-represented employees. The layoffs came just weeks after Dow Jones & Co, the News Corp unit that oversees the newspaper, announced a three-year plan to cut costs in response to a decline in print advertising.  As part of the cost cutting, the Journal offered all of its news employees the option to take a buyout.

The Berlin-based start-up is different from rivals Apple, Spotify and Amazon in that it relies more on amateur musicians, for whom it provides a rare platform, and less on major commercial artists. But like them, it has yet to turn a profit. The big music labels on which most of the services depend - themselves under pressure from the shift to digital music - strike hard bargains. And SoundCloud - which said three years ago it had an audience of 175 million, a figure it has not updated - lacks either Spotify's large base of paying subscribers or the deep pockets of Apple and Amazon that can subsidize their music services.   Last week, SoundCloud said it was firing 173 staffers and closing its London and San Francisco offices to focus on Berlin and New York. We're on our path to profitability and in control of SoundCloud's independent future, co-founder Alex Ljung wrote in a blog post. Technology website TechCrunch reported, however, that staff were told at a meeting this week that the layoffs only saved the company enough cash to hold out until the fourth quarter. A spokeswoman the SoundCloud declined to comment on the TechCrunch article in depth. She did say, SoundCloud is fully funded into the fourth quarter. We continue to be confident the changes made last week put us on our path to profitability and ensure SoundCloud’s long-term viability.  She declined to comment on funding beyond the end of the year.  The news has reignited speculation that SoundCloud will be acquired by a rival. It was targeted by Spotify last year in a bid that was later aborted. Spotify, recently valued at $13 billion, is now planning a direct listing on the New York Stock Exchange later this year or in early 2018, sources told Reuters in May. The biggest problem I see is that the financial problems will absorb much of management's time in trying to raise more money, meaning that the real problems of the business go unaddressed, independent technology analyst Richard Windsor wrote in a note. Of all the potential suitors, I think Google makes the most sense, he said, noting SoundCloud's similarity to Google's YouTube in its focus on user-generated content. Google will probably be most able to monetize what SoundCloud cannot. SoundCloud, which was launched in 2008 and has never said how many paying subscribers it has, last month launched a budget subscription package in the hope of persuading more listeners to convert from the free service. SoundCloud raised $100 million last June from a group of investors including Twitter, valuing the company at roughly $700 million, according to Re/code.

Earlier on Thursday, two of Israel's leading financial news websites carried separate reports that Teva, the world's biggest generic drug maker and Israel's largest company, planned to fire between 2,000 and 6,000 workers - or as much as 11 percent of the workforce. A Teva spokesperson had initially declined to comment on the report, but the company later put out a statement saying the figures the media gave were inaccurate. The efficiency program is an integral part of Teva's business reality. The program includes, among other things, ending unprofitable activities and consolidating functions, in addition to freezing recruitment and natural employee turnover, the company said. These processes are conducted through a continuous open dialogue with the employees. This will be the practice, including in Israel, as necessary. We would like to stress that the numbers which were published in the media are incorrect, it said. Teva (TEVA.N) employs around 57,000 people globally. It has had a rough year, though, with a series of costly acquisitions, along with delayed drug launches, sending its stock plummeting 72 percent to $32.61 the past 12 months. That forced former chief executive Erez Vigodman to step down in February, with Chairman Yitzhak Peterburg replacing him on a temporary basis. One of the websites, Calcalist, said Teva has already reduced its workforce in Israel by around 100 people as part of the efficiency plan.

In the second quarter we delivered lower than expected revenue, which is why we make these adjustments, said FLSmidth's head of communications Sofie Lindberg. Thursday's layoffs amount to approximately 10 percent of the company's Danish staff and the company expects to make worldwide cuts of about 10 percent in the near future, Lindberg said. In the second quarter the company informed 400 employees that they would be losing their jobs. FLSmidth had 12,700 employees globally at the end of the second quarter. In August, the company reported lower-than-expected second-quarter profits and narrowed its 2016 guidance to the lower end of its guidance.

The latest cutbacks could increase the total number of jobs shed by the Switzerland-based company to more than 500 since May, a trade union leader said. Richemont is aiming to trim between 200 and 250 additional positions from its Swiss manufacturing units under an agreement between the company and unions that runs to February 2017, the source told Reuters. The planned latest round of cuts would come on top of roughly 300 positions that Richemont eliminated in May, a move that included about 100 layoffs along with measures such as early retirements meant to keep the impact on active workers to a minimum, a spokesman for Swiss trade union Unia said. Lucas DuBuis said the labour organisation would meet with workers at Richemont facilities throughout Switzerland on Tuesday in a bid to again keep actual layoffs to a minimum. Richemont is closing 50 shops by the end of the year and trimming its Swiss workforce after more than two years of declining sales, the company said earlier this month. The maker of Cartier branded jewellery and IWC watches has also been repurchasing stock from retailers, particularly in hard-hit cities such as Hong Kong, to eliminate an excess of inventory that has languished in display cases.

The cuts revive an uncomfortable question for the remaining refineries along the U.S. and Canadian Atlantic Coast: will they all survive the current market downturn? They remain the most vulnerable, said Sarah Emerson, a managing principal at ESAI Energy LLC. The real question is who closes first and why? The  bulk of the job cuts at the Canadian refinery, about 100, will come from union ranks, according to two sources familiar with the plant's operations. The losses represent about one-third of the plant's union labor. This decision was very difficult but necessary to secure the refinery's future, the company said in a statement. We understand the impact this will have on people and their families and we have put a number of resources in place to provide support during this time. The company blamed the layoffs on weak margins and high regulatory costs, the sources said. Philadelphia Energy Solutions (PES), the largest U.S. East Coast refiner, also blamed margins and regulatory costs for layoffs and benefit cuts in September. U.S. independent refiners such as Valero Energy Corp  and Phillips 66 are on track for their worst year since the U.S. shale boom began in 2011. Even in high times, refiners along the Atlantic typically operate under slimmer margins versus the industry. Since the beginning of the century, three refineries on the U.S. East Coast have shuttered, while others, including PES, went to the verge of closure. The region's refineries were among the biggest beneficiaries of the U.S. shale boom in North Dakota, which offered them discounted crude. But the discount has vanished, along with booming profits. The operators of the Come By Chance refinery are SilverPeak Financial Partners, a group of Wall Street veterans, including Neal Shear, who helped build Morgan Stanley's oil trading division; Kaushik Amin, former chief executive officer of RBS Sempra Commodities and global head of liquid markets for Lehman Brothers; and Harsh Rameshwar from Merrill Lynch Commodities. They purchased the plant in 2014 from South Korea's national oil company. The team of former Wall Street oil traders remain in a legal dispute with BP PLC, the refinery's crude supplier The legal fight stems from, among other things, what represents the best crude diet for the plant. The BP contract expires at the end of the year.   (Reporting By Jarrett Renshaw; Editing by Bill Trott)"

On Wednesday, the Journal laid off staff of its Greater New York section, according to a memo sent on Wednesday from the International Association of Publishers' Employees to members of the union at the paper. The layoffs include 19 IAPE-represented employees. The layoffs came just weeks after Dow Jones & Co, the News Corp unit that oversees the newspaper, announced a three-year plan to cut costs in response to a decline in print advertising.  As part of the cost cutting, the Journal offered all of its news employees the option to take a buyout. The deadline to express interest in a buyout was Monday, and 48-IAPE represented employees took the buyout, out of a total 450 who were offered it, according to IAPE.  A spokeswoman for Dow Jones declined to comment on how many employees requested buyouts or how many layoffs were expected. The new format for the newspaper will have a Business & Finance section that will combine its current Business & Tech and Money & Investing sections, according to a memo from Gerard Baker, the Journal's editor-in-chief. It will also include a new Life & Arts section that will combine its current Personal Journal  and Arena sections.  The current Greater New York coverage will be reduced and will move into the main section of paper, according to the memo.

Though prices have never been higher at 427 to 434 reais (US$132-$134) per bag for conilon, the variety of robusta grown in Brazil, producers expect another bad crop in 2017 as they tear up trees ruined by drought. At current prices, Brazil's 2016 robusta crop is worth $1.2 billion. Exports of conilon are down 90 percent over the past 12 months versus the previous year, the coffee exporters association Cecafe said. Despite a major recovery in arabica production in the surrounding regions due to the return of rains, the 2016 conilon crop in the main producer state, Espirito Santo, has fallen 40 percent to 5.95 million bags since peaking in 2014. Warehouses and segments of the coffee industry here are putting employees on leave and transferring some to other areas, said Luis Polese, president of coffee trade association Sindicafe. Unfortunately, less skilled workers are being let go. He could not say how many workers have been laid off. Conilon makes up about a quarter of Brazil's coffee crop but is the staple coffee consumed on the domestic market, second only in size to the United States. Brazil's exports of conilon pale in comparison to arabica shipments. However, after the robusta crop in top supplier Vietnam declined over the past year, Brazil's exports of conilon have become more important for global supply.  November robusta futures are at their highest in a year and a half. The drought was throwing all infrastructure linked to the coffee production into crisis, including transporters, exporters and roasters, officials said. We're having a hard time securing raw material to supply the local roasting industry, said Egidio Malanquini, president of the roasting industry association Sincafe. Brazil is in its worst economic recession since the 1930s. Last week, the Labor Ministry said the economy was contracting for the second straight year and had shed a net 33,953 jobs in August. Brazil's economy is expected to shrink more than 3 percent for a second straight year in 2016, with over 11 million workers officially considered unemployed. 2017 Prospects Dim Damage from the drought appears to be worsening.  Although Espirito Santo forced irrigated coffee farms to ration water early in 2016, the state capital of Vitoria began restricting water supplies in 58 neighborhoods last week for the first time in its history. Two main rivers, the Santa Maria and Jacu, are below critical levels and 20 other municipalities are in a state of emergency due to the water crisis, Eduardo Carvalhaes at trader Escritorio Carvalhaes in Santos said. Octaciano Neto, the farm secretary in Espirito Santo, said some regions have seen less than half their normal rainfall for the third year running. Polese said multinationals like Louis Dreyfus [LOUDR.UL], Olam and Volcafe are experiencing drastic declines in the flow of coffee through their warehouses versus recent years, little more than a couple of months after harvest was completed.  Olam's warehouse in Nova Venecia is running at a fraction of capacity. Volcafe, a leader in coffee, leased two warehouses in Colatina, which are moving coffee at 20 percent capacity, Polese said. Another trader in the state, who asked not to be named, said a Louis Dreyfus Company was holding 60,000 to 80,000 bags of coffee in its 250,000-bag warehouse in Nova Venecia. The company did not respond to a request for comment.  Volcafe said it continued to invest and hire in the region despite drought damage to the crop. An Olam executive in Brazil said its warehouse was running at 25 percent capacity.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tech-layoffs-idUSKCN10T02R","As technology shifts more layoffs loom at tech companies","","August 18, 2016 /  12:45 AM / a year ago","","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc's announcement on Wednesday that it plans to lay off 5,500 employees is unlikely to be the last round of Silicon Valley pink slips as hardware companies struggle to keep up with rapid technology shifts, analysts and recruiters said. Companies that traditionally have made most of their money selling computers, chips, servers, routers and other equipment are especially vulnerable, analysts say, as mobile applications and cloud computing become increasingly important. The Cisco layoffs come in the wake of Intel's announcement in April that it was laying off 12,000 workers. Dell Incsaid in January it had shed 10,000 jobs and is expected to make further cuts after it closes a $67 billion deal to acquire data storage company EMC Corp.  So far this year, technology companies in the United States  have shed about 63,000 jobs, according to outplacement consultancy Challenger, Gray & Christmas, Inc. The hi-tech industry is going through a serious deconstruction, said Trip Chowdhry, an analyst at Global Equities Research. There is more pain to come.  Chowdhry said he expects job cuts to rise drastically as  more companies subscribe to super cloud services from the likes of Amazon.com Inc and Microsoft Corp. These services manage hardware, software, networks and databases and eliminate the need for workers to manage various technology layers, Chowdhry said. In January, Chowdhry estimated that layoffs in the tech industry would hit 330,000 this year. On Wednesday, he said he had raised his estimate to 370,000. Some other analysts said that forecast was too bleak.  IBM Corp, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co, Oracle Corp and Dell Inc could be the next to shed workers, analysts said. The logo of Intel is seen during the annual Computex computer exhibition in Taipei, Taiwan June 1, 2016.Tyrone Siu/FilesHewlett Packard Enterprise, Dell and Oracle declined comment and IBM could not be immediately reached for comment. 'Tremors of Change' Tech incumbents are all bracing for the tremors of change. said Glenn O'Donnell, an analyst at Forrester Research. We fully expect a lot of collateral damage as this plays out - not just with Cisco. Cisco and other old-guard technology companies have been pursuing a challenging shift to software-oriented services. Margins in software services are higher than hardware because they bring recurring revenue and there are fewer people involved on the cost side, said Roger Kay, an analyst at Endpoint Technologies Associates. That could mean more job cuts. Silicon Valley job recruiters offered mixed views about the fate of hardware engineers laid off at Cisco and other tech firms. “Nobody wants to be laid off but if job elimination is going to happen, 2016 is not a bad time for it to happen,” said John Reed, Senior Executive Director of the tech recruitment firm Robert Half Technologies.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/tech-layoffs-idUSL1N1AY1L8","As technology shifts more layoffs loom at tech companies","","August 18, 2016 /  12:45 AM / a year ago","","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc's announcement on Wednesday that it plans to lay off 5,500 employees is unlikely to be the last round of Silicon Valley pink slips as hardware companies struggle to keep up with rapid technology shifts, analysts and recruiters said. Companies that traditionally have made most of their money selling computers, chips, servers, routers and other equipment are especially vulnerable, analysts say, as mobile applications and cloud computing become increasingly important. The Cisco layoffs come in the wake of Intel's announcement in April that it was laying off 12,000 workers. Dell Incsaid in January it had shed 10,000 jobs and is expected to make further cuts after it closes a $67 billion deal to acquire data storage company EMC Corp.  So far this year, technology companies in the United States  have shed about 63,000 jobs, according to outplacement consultancy Challenger, Gray & Christmas, Inc. The hi-tech industry is going through a serious deconstruction, said Trip Chowdhry, an analyst at Global Equities Research. There is more pain to come.  Chowdhry said he expects job cuts to rise drastically as  more companies subscribe to super cloud services from the likes of Amazon.com Inc and Microsoft Corp. These services manage hardware, software, networks and databases and eliminate the need for workers to manage various technology layers, Chowdhry said. In January, Chowdhry estimated that layoffs in the tech industry would hit 330,000 this year. On Wednesday, he said he had raised his estimate to 370,000. Some other analysts said that forecast was too bleak.  IBM Corp, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co, Oracle Corp and Dell Inc could be the next to shed workers, analysts said. The logo of Intel is seen during the annual Computex computer exhibition in Taipei, Taiwan June 1, 2016.Tyrone Siu/FilesHewlett Packard Enterprise, Dell and Oracle declined comment and IBM could not be immediately reached for comment. 'Tremors of Change' Tech incumbents are all bracing for the tremors of change. said Glenn O'Donnell, an analyst at Forrester Research. We fully expect a lot of collateral damage as this plays out - not just with Cisco. Cisco and other old-guard technology companies have been pursuing a challenging shift to software-oriented services. Margins in software services are higher than hardware because they bring recurring revenue and there are fewer people involved on the cost side, said Roger Kay, an analyst at Endpoint Technologies Associates. That could mean more job cuts. Silicon Valley job recruiters offered mixed views about the fate of hardware engineers laid off at Cisco and other tech firms. “Nobody wants to be laid off but if job elimination is going to happen, 2016 is not a bad time for it to happen,” said John Reed, Senior Executive Director of the tech recruitment firm Robert Half Technologies.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-economy-idUSL1N1BD0JE","U.S. factory activity contracts in August; layoffs remain low","","September 1, 2016 /  12:40 PM / a year ago","","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. factory activity contracted in August for the first time in six months as new orders and production tumbled, but a low level of layoffs continued to point to a pickup in economic growth in the third quarter. While manufacturing remains constrained by the lingering effects of a strong dollar and lower oil prices, sustained labor market strength could push the Federal Reserve closer to raising interest rates later this year. Today's disappointing (manufacturing) number further weakens the case for a rate hike later this month, but we currently see no reason to change our Fed call and continue to anticipate a rate hike at the December meeting, said Harm Bandholz, chief U.S. economist at UniCredit in New York. The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its index of national factory activity fell 3.2 percentage points to a reading of 49.4 last month. That was the first contraction since February. The index remains above the 43.2 threshold that is associated with a recession. A reading below 50 indicates a contraction in manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy. The dollar's surge between June 2014 and December 2015 as well as weak global demand have crimped export growth.  A collapse in oil drilling activity following a plunge in oil prices has also squeezed manufacturing by undermining business spending, leading to weak demand for heavy machinery. In addition, a U.S. inventory correction has resulted in factories receiving fewer orders. While sentiment surveys including the ISM and several regional reports have pointed to manufacturing weakness, so-called hard data on oil drilling rigs, durable goods orders and industrial production have offered tentative signs of stability in the sector.  Manufacturing is lagging data on consumer spending and housing that have suggested the economy has regained speed after growing only 1.0 percent in first half of the year.  Last month, the ISM's new orders subindex plunged 7.8 points to a reading of 49.1. Production also slipped into contractionary territory and factory employment shrunk further. But the manufacturing employment downturn has yet to spread to other sectors of the economy.  In a separate report, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 2,000 to a seasonally adjusted 263,000 for the week ended Aug. 27.    It was the 78th consecutive week that claims remained below the 300,000 threshold, which is associated with a robust labor market. That is the longest stretch since 1970, when the labor market was much smaller.  The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 1,000 to 263,000 last week. Despite some seeming trouble in the manufacturing sector, the overall outlook for employment is positive, said Michael Gapen, chief economist at Barclays in New York.  The downbeat factory data pushed the dollar .DXY lower against a basket of currencies. U.S. stocks were generally weaker, while prices for U.S. Treasuries rose. August Payrolls The data came ahead of the release on Friday of the government's closely watched employment report for August, which economists say could determine whether the Fed raises interest rates again later this month or in December. According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 180,000 jobs in August after rising by 255,000 in July. The unemployment rate is seen falling one-tenth of a percentage point to 4.8 percent.  August's anticipated step-down in job gains would follow two straight months of payroll increases above 250,000. The U.S. central bank increased its benchmark overnight interest rate last December for the first time in nearly a decade. In a third report on Thursday, global outplacement consultancy Challenger, Gray & Christmas said employers in the United States announced plans to shed 32,188 workers from their payrolls in August, down from 45,346 in July. The computer sector dominated the job cuts last month, with  Cisco Systems (CSCO.O) announcing plans to reduce its workforce by 5,500 jobs. There were also layoffs in the energy, industrial goods and entertainment and leisure sectors. In a fourth report, the Labor Department said unit labor costs, the price of labor per single unit of output, increased at a sharper 4.3 percent rate in the second quarter as opposed to the 2.0 percent pace reported last month.  The spike was due to a change in how the data is calculated and probably will not be sustained. Unit labor costs rose 2.6 percent from a year ago.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-fireeye-results-idUSKCN10F2HD","FireEye plans layoffs, cuts forecasts; shares plunge","","August 4, 2016 /  8:20 PM / a year ago","","(Reuters) - Cyber security firm FireEye Inc said on Thursday it planned to lay off 300 to 400 of its 3,400 workers as it announced quarterly sales below its own forecast, due to a slowdown in demand for its services helping businesses respond to hacking attacks. FireEye's shares were down 16.2 percent at $14.02 in extended trading. The Milpitas, California-based company also cut its full-year sales outlook.  Chief Financial Officer Michael Berry told Reuters that the job cuts were part of a restructuring effort that will reduce annual costs by about $80 million. Chief Executive Kevin Mandia said the company is now responding more frequently to financially driven cyber criminals, who engage in crimes such as ransomware, which are relatively simple to clean up.  The size and scope have changed. The whole remediation was more complex when the company was responding to large numbers of state-sponsored hacks from China, he said.  FireEye cut its full-year revenue forecast to $716 million-$728 million from $780 million-$810 million.  The company is still targeting non-GAAP profitability by the end of 2017 and expect to generate positive free-cash flow in 2017, Berry said on a conference call.  It reported second-quarter revenue of $175 million, missing its own projection of $178 million to $185 million.  Executives blamed much of the trouble on a slowdown in its services business, including its high-profile Mandiant forensics unit that helps organizations respond to cyber attacks.  That division's revenue rose just 2 percent in the second quarter, compared to a 40 percent increase in the first quarter. Its total number of engagements rose, but average revenue from each one fell dramatically because work performed was less extensive.  Mandia said that was due to a shift away from previous years where there were large numbers of state-sponsored espionage hackers from China attacking customers in the United States.  FireEye and other cyber security firms said in June that cyber espionage attacks from China appeared to have dropped this year as the Chinese government made good on a pledge with the United States to stop supporting the digital theft of U.S. trade secrets.  The company reported lower-than-expected billings, a closely watched indicator of future business.  FireEye posted second-quarter billings of 196.4 million, below its forecast of $200 million to $215 million. It also cut its full-year billings forecast to a range of $835 million to $855 million, from its previous range of $975 million to $1.055 billion. In contrast, peer Symantec Corp reported second-quarter revenue and adjusted profit above the average analyst estimates, helped by strong enterprise demand for its security products. Up to Thursday's close, FireEye shares had fallen more than 62 percent in the last 12 months. Reporting by Alan John Koshy in Bengaluru; Editing by Bill Rigby"

The Labor Department's monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) report also suggested a growing skill shortage, which has been highlighted by independent surveys. This report continues to point to a tight labor market. It is clear that demand for labor is not the problem and there is nothing monetary policy can do to address a mismatch between the needs of employers and the skills of job seekers, said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York. Job openings, a measure of labor demand, rose 110,000 to a seasonally adjusted 5.6 million, the JOLTS report showed. That raised the jobs openings rate one-tenth of a percentage point to 3.8 percent. The JOLTS report is one of the job market metrics on Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen's so-called dashboard. Fed officials view the labor market as being at or near full employment. Concerns about persistently low inflation and an uncertain global economic outlook have left the U.S. central bank cautious about raising interest rates in the near term. The economy created 547,000 jobs in June and July. The pace of job growth is, however, expected to slow as the economy's recovery from the 2007-2009 recession shows signs of aging. Layoffs fell to 1.6 million in June, the lowest level since September 2014, from 1.7 million in May, the JOLTS report showed. The decline pushed the layoffs rate to 1.1 percent, the lowest since November 2013. Hiring increased after three straight months of declines, suggesting employers are probably not finding qualified workers for the open positions. Hiring rose to 5.1 million from 5.0 million in May. The hiring rate climbed to 3.6 percent in June from 3.5 percent the prior month. Job openings rose across nearly all sectors of the economy, with strong gains in manufacturing and construction, pointing to some stabilization in labor demand.  The industrial sector has been hurt by the combination of a strong dollar and lower oil prices, which have weighed on manufacturing and mining activities.  Other details of the JOLTS report showed Americans content to stay in their current jobs, with the quits rate, which the Fed looks at as a measure of confidence in the jobs market, holding at 2.0 percent for a third straight month in June.

That division's revenue rose just 2 percent in the second quarter, compared to a 40 percent increase in the first quarter. Its total number of engagements rose, but average revenue from each one fell dramatically because work performed was less extensive.  Mandia said that was due to a shift away from previous years where there were large numbers of state-sponsored espionage hackers from China attacking customers in the United States.  FireEye and other cyber security firms said in June that cyber espionage attacks from China appeared to have dropped this year as the Chinese government made good on a pledge with the United States to stop supporting the digital theft of U.S. trade secrets.  The company reported lower-than-expected billings, a closely watched indicator of future business.  FireEye posted second-quarter billings of 196.4 million, below its forecast of $200 million to $215 million. It also cut its full-year billings forecast to a range of $835 million to $855 million, from its previous range of $975 million to $1.055 billion. In contrast, peer Symantec Corp reported second-quarter revenue and adjusted profit above the average analyst estimates, helped by strong enterprise demand for its security products. Up to Thursday's close, FireEye shares had fallen more than 62 percent in the last 12 months. Reporting by Alan John Koshy in Bengaluru; Editing by Bill Rigby"

Although another report on Thursday showed factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region contracted this month, a surge in new orders and shipments suggested the setback was likely temporary.  The economy is doing well and is weathering the global turbulence. With housing and consumers powering ahead, some of the clouds are dissipating and summer looks good from a data point of view, said Thomas Costerg, a U.S. economist at Standard Chartered Bank in New York. The National Association of Realtors said existing home sales increased 1.1 percent to an annual rate of 5.57 million units last month, the highest level since February 2007.  It was the fourth straight month of increases and left sales 3 percent higher than a year ago. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast sales slipping to a 5.48 million-unit pace in June. Sales were boosted by first-time buyers, whose share of transactions rose to 33 percent in June, the highest since July 2012. That compared to 30 percent in May and a year ago.  The increase in first-time buyers, whose participation is considered crucial for a strong housing market, came as U.S. mortgage rates hit their lowest levels since 2013 on bets the Federal Reserve would be cautious about raising interest rates. Britain's vote on June 23 to leave the European Union has also put downward pressure on borrowing costs for home buyers as investors pile into safe-haven U.S. government debt. The housing market is being supported by a strengthening labor market, but sales remain constrained by a persistent shortage of properties available for sale, which is keeping home prices elevated. There were 2.12 million previously owned homes on the market last month, down 0.9 percent from June.   The median price for a previously owned house rose 4.8 percent from a year ago to a record $247,700 in June. We expect this buoyant performance to continue during the second half of this year, underpinned by strong employment growth, low mortgage rates and continued confidence in the economic recovery, said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York. The broader PHLX housing index .HGX, including builders, building products and mortgage companies, was down 0.14 percent, tracking a slightly weak U.S. stocks market. Buoyant Labor Market  The dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies, after the European Central Bank gave no hint that it was set on easing policy further in September to support growth. Prices for U.S. government bonds fell. In a separate report, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits slipped 1,000 to a seasonally adjusted 253,000 for the week ended July 16, the lowest reading since April. Claims are near the 43-year low of 248,000 touched in mid-April.  Economists had forecast initial claims rising to 265,000 in the latest week. Claims have now been below 300,000, a threshold associated with a healthy labor market, for 72 straight weeks, the longest stretch since 1973.    The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 1,250 to 257,750 last week. The claims data covered the survey week for July's nonfarm payrolls. The four-week average of claims fell 9,000 between the June and July periods, suggesting another month of strong job gains. The economy added a whopping 287,000 jobs in June, the largest this year. The claims data continue to signal very low layoffs and that the employment report for July will be solid, said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York. These data point to a further tightening of the labor market in terms of readily employable underutilized labor. Labor market strength is boosting consumer spending and the housing market, which in turn are providing a lift to economic growth.  According to a Reuters survey of economists, the government is expected to report next week that the economy grew at a 2.6 percent annualized rate in the second quarter, an acceleration from the 1.1 percent pace logged in the first three months of the year. In a third report, the Philadelphia Federal Reserve said its business index fell to a reading of -2.9 this month from 4.7 in June. But the new orders component rose to 11.8 from -3.0 in June and shipments rebounded to 6.3 from -2.1 in June. Manufacturing has been hurt by a strong dollar and sluggish global demand, which have undercut U.S. exports, as well as efforts by businesses to reduce an inventory overhang. Lower oil prices have also weighed on manufacturing as energy firms cut back on capital spending in response to reduced profits.

Opposition lawmakers, who have warned that up to 150,000 jobs could be lost this year, approved the bill on Thursday in the lower chamber of Congress, where they hold control. Today using my constitutional powers, I'm going to veto this bill which I believe is anti jobs, said Macri in a televised speech. The bill will likely be formally vetoed on Monday when the official gazette is published. Macri, who took power in December on a pro-business platform, has argued the bill would block the government's efforts to revive the economy after years of interventionist policies under his predecessor and would ultimately undermine job growth. His government has already lifted capital controls, spurred a devaluation of the peso and cut export taxes, whetting investor appetite to funnel money into Latin America's third largest economy. But Macri's policies have also swelled the ranks of the poor, souring public opinion and raising the risk of backlash against the economic overhaul that is winning over foreign investors.

Macri, who was inaugurated in December, has ordered thousands of jobs cut from state agencies and said the law would have hurt efforts at narrowing the fiscal deficit he inherited from previous leader Cristina Fernandez. The two champion opposite visions for Latin America's third-largest economy at tumultuous time for the region with Brazil and Venezuela embroiled in crises. Macri, 57, is a proponent of free-markets. Fernandez, 63, favors a heavy state hand in the economy. The bill would have doubled severance payments to laid off public and private sector workers and prohibited most job cuts for six months. Passage of the measure was a show of force by the opposition ahead of next year's legislative elections. It also put Macri in the politically awkward position of vetoing a pro-employment bill at a time when Argentines are being hammered by double-digit inflation, exacerbated by his decision to let the currency float in December. Low-income families are meanwhile getting squeezed by higher utility prices after Macri removed energy subsidies. In the government's official gazette, the president offered a 30-paragraph explanation of his veto. Dialogue among workers, the government, unions and business owners is the way to create jobs, it said.  Macri says fiscal discipline is needed to reduce imbalances in the economy caused by years of heavy trade and currency controls. He says this will ultimately boost investment, productivity and employment. But with 2017 mid-term elections approaching, the veto showed a president unable to frame the public agenda and block opposition proposals before they reach his desk. He needs inflation to fall faster and growth to come back sooner. If not, his governability will be materially affected come 2018, after the mid-term elections, said Alberto Bernal, chief market strategist at U.S.-based XP Securities.

Unfortunately, a close review of the company's operations makes it clear that the level of inefficiency throughout Sharp means that a turnaround ... can only take place if there is a reduction in costs, and that comes with a very regrettable need to reduce Sharp's workforce, Gou wrote in an open letter, seen by Reuters, to Sharp staff late on Thursday. Sharp earlier reported its annual losses trebled from a year earlier. Taiwan's Foxconn, the world's largest contract electronics manufacturer, has battled to seal a $3.5 billion deal to give it a two-thirds stake in Sharp as the Japanese display maker seeks a return to profit in the face of slowing smartphone sales. The letter said staff cuts would be carried out responsibly and sensitively, but didn't provide figures. A person familiar with the matter said cuts could total 3,000 in Japan, and more when Sharp's global operations are included. Foxconn confirmed the letter was a personal note to all Sharp employees from Gou and Tai Jeng-wu, Foxconn's vice chairman and the newly-appointed CEO at Sharp. Sharp named Tai on Thursday to succeed Kozo Takahashi, becoming the first outsider to lead a company that started out making belt buckles and mechanical pencils a century ago. Tai's 30-year Foxconn career includes running its vast operations at Shenzhen in China. He also played a key role in the Sharp stake negotiations, people at Foxconn told Reuters. Related CoverageTaiwan's Innolux, Japan's Sharp likely to cooperate in the future: Innolux chiefTai is No.2 at Hon Hai. He speaks Japanese. He was selected from a comprehensive perspective, Takahashi said at an earnings briefing, referring to Foxconn by its formal name, Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. Tai will be one of nine new board members at Sharp, Takahashi said, adding Sharp aims to finalize the stake sale to Foxconn by the end of June, earlier than an initial Oct. 5 deadline. Personal Guarantee Gou's letter underscores how last month's signing of the stake deal was just the start of a turnaround at Sharp, which has struggled even after two bank bail-outs. Journalists attend Sharp Corp's company's results news conference in Tokyo, Japan, May 12, 2016.Toru HanaiThe billionaire Foxconn founder will personally guarantee the buyback of 25 billion yen ($230 million) worth of preferred shares that Sharp issued to a corporate turnaround fund last year in exchange for a bail-out. Gou said his move was aimed to speed up a merit-based stock reward program for Sharp employees. Gou believes profit-sharing is key to retaining talent, said a person familiar with his thinking. I can also assure you that the wage cuts and reductions in year-end bonuses are a thing of the past, Gou wrote to Sharp staff, saying pay and annual bonuses would return to their original levels as of this month. Smartphone Slowdown Hon Hai's Vice President Tai Jeng-wu attends a news conference to announce the company's agreement to acquire Sharp Corp in Taipei, Taiwan March 30, 2016.Tyrone SiuSharp and Japanese peers such as Sony Corp, once synonymous with cutting-edge electronics, have in recent years been out-manoeuvred by upstart Asian rivals. A takeover by Foxconn should help Sharp expand sales channels for its displays. In return, Foxconn will gain control of Sharp's advanced display technology, and strengthen its pricing power with Apple Inc, a major client of both companies. Foxconn's display-making affiliate Innolux Corp will also benefit from cooperation with Sharp, Innolux Chairman H.C. Tuan said on Thursday. Tuan, who announced his resignation, will take on a role as technology adviser to both  Innolux and Sharp, Foxconn said. Even with Foxconn's support, Sharp will find it tough competing with Chinese display makers aggressively expanding capacity, analysts said. Sharp also lags South Korean rivals in organic light-emitting diode (OLED) technology, which Apple is widely expected to adopt in future iPhones. Gou, though, has expressed a preference for Sharp's strength in indium gallium zinc oxide (IGZO) technology. IGZO is Sharp's pride, said Tuan. I'm hopeful we can cooperate with Sharp in this area. For the year to end-March, Sharp reported an operating loss of 162 billion yen ($1.5 billion), more than triple the previous year's loss. Takahashi said an over-reliance on smartphones was partly to blame. We've failed to move fast enough to shift focus to larger panels, he said. Apple posted its first drop in iPhone sales in January-March, and, in figures issued on Thursday, Foxconn's quarterly net profit fell 9.2 percent from a year ago to T$27.58 billion  ($847 million). Its January-March revenue slipped 5.5 percent. Foxconn subsidiary FIH Mobile Ltd, whose clients include Sony and Xiaomi Inc [XTC.UL], has warned its first-half profit may fall as much as 92 percent as smartphone sales growth slows to a single digit this year.

Employers announced 32,556 job cuts last month, the second lowest monthly total of 2012 and down 43 percent from 57,081 in November, according to the report from consultants Challenger, Gray & Christmas, Inc. In 2012, the only month with a lower job-cuts tally was August, with 32,239. December's job cuts were also down 22 percent from the 41,785 seen a year ago. During 2012, employers announced 523,362 cuts, down 14 percent from the 606,082 job cuts announced in 2011 and the lowest level since 1997 when employers announced 434,350 cuts. We saw a few spikes in monthly job cuts in 2012 and there were some significant mass layoffs that definitely reminded us that not every industry is enjoying the fruits of recovery. However, the overall pace of downsizing was at its slowest since the end of the recession, said John A. Challenger, chief executive officer of Challenger, Gray & Christmas. In fact, we have not seen this level of job cutting since before the dot-com collapse and subsequent 2001 recession, Challenger said in a statement. One of the significant mass layoffs of last year was made in December by Citigroup Inc (C.N), which announced 11,000 job cuts early in the month. The bank accounted for the majority of the 11,355 job cuts announced last month in the financial sector, which was the top job-cutting sector in December. The leading job-cut sector of 2012 was the computer industry, which announced 46,164 layoffs last year, up 215 percent from 14,677 job cuts in the computer industry in 2011. The most dramatic decline in job cuts came in the government sector, which announced 19,128 layoffs in 2012, down 90 percent from 183,064 announced job cuts in 2011. However, the fall in job cuts in December may not carry over into early 2013. Historically, January is, on average, the biggest job-cut month of the year, and several sectors, including computer, financial services, consumer products, transportation and aerospace and defense are at risk due to a high potential for reduced spending by consumers, businesses and government in 2013, Challenger said. The report comes a day ahead of the key jobs report, which is forecast to show 150,000 new U.S. jobs were added in December, up slightly from 146,000 new jobs in November.

John Reseburg, a company spokesman, acknowledged that E.A. is reshuffling its 9,000-strong worldwide work force, but dismissed Internet reports of the layoffs. I don't think there is a factual basis for the reports, Reseburg said. He added the company is expecting its headcount to be higher at the end of 2012 compared with last year. We're growing and we're looking to hire hundreds of people for our digital, console, mobile and social games, Reseburg said. Like all game companies, we make occasional adjustments to resize our teams as projects are completed and new priorities are established. We expect that our headcount will be up at the end of the year. Citing multiple unnamed sources, the website StartupGrind reported on Sunday that the Redwood City, California-based game publisher will lay off 500 to 1,000 employees as early as this week as it struggles with poor reception for 'Star Wars: The Old Republic,' a major online title released in December.

China will focus on mergers and restructuring, not bankruptcies, Xiao Yaqing, the head of the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC), told a news conference. As it tries to rejuvenate its economy, China aims to reduce the number of central government-managed enterprises and launch pilot programs that will allow more private investment in state-dominated sectors. It is also trying to slash overcapacity in the labor-intensive coal and steel sectors. Reform plans have prompted fears that the country would face its fiercest unemployment pressures since the late 1990s, when about 28 million people were made redundant. The situation in the 1990s was completely different, Xiao told reporters. The foundations we have now are much stronger than before. Protecting the interests of workers is an important aspect of the next stage of reforms, and there will be more mergers and restructurings, and as few bankruptcies as possible. Sources have told Reuters that China is expecting to lay off 5 million to 6 million state workers over the next two to three years as part of efforts to curb industrial overcapacity and pollution. According to official estimates, layoffs from the coal and steel sectors alone are expected to reach 1.8 million as the country works to tackle price-sapping overcapacity and shut down so-called zombie enterprises - loss-making firms that cannot afford to continue operating but are propped up by local authorities. Xiao said 12 central government-run firms had been merged, bringing the total number of enterprises controlled by SASAC to 106. Profits at the firms fell 6.7 percent last year to 2.3 trillion yuan. Xiao said the main reason for the decline was the collapse in the prices of oil and steel.     China has about 150,000 state-owned enterprises that manage more than 100 trillion yuan ($15.40 trillion) in assets and employ more than 30 million people, according to the official Xinhua news agency.

The company has also let go about 40 workers, mostly engineering contractors, at its Anaheim, California headquarters, a spokesman said. The company has received $193 million of the federal loan so far, it said in a statement. Most of those funds have supported the rollout of its first vehicle, a $102,000 plug-in hybrid sportscar called the Karma that was plagued with production delays and a recent recall. Fisker's Wilmington, Delaware plant, a former General Motors Co (GM.N) factory, is expected to manufacture the company's second vehicle, a sedan known as the Nina. The $336 million balance of its DOE loan is intended to fund that car, Fisker said. Fisker spokesman Roger Ormisher would not elaborate on the reasons it was seeking revised terms for its government loan, but a DOE spokesman cited delays in getting the Karma to market. Our loan guarantees have strict conditions in place to protect taxpayers. The Department only allows the loan to be disbursed as the company meets certain milestones and demonstrates results, DOE spokesman Damien LaVera said. The Department is working with Fisker to review a revised business plan and determine the best path forward so the company can meet its benchmarks, produce cars and employ workers here in America. Energy Department loans and loan guarantees have been under heightened scrutiny from lawmakers since solar panel company Solyndra filed for bankruptcy in September after receiving a $535 million government loan in 2009. Last month, Fisker ratcheted down its sales projections for 2012, saying it expected to sell about 10,000 Karmas. It had originally hoped to sell 15,000 vehicles. Fisker is still aiming to begin production of the Nina in 2013, Ormisher said, though he said the company would give an exact timeline once it restarts work at the Delaware plant. In addition to the federal loan, Fisker has raised more than $850 million from private investors including Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Advanced Equities and Qatar Investment Authority. That includes $260 million raised late last year, Fisker said. The fledgling automaker was founded in 2007 by Henrik Fisker, a onetime Aston Martin designer. The company is one of a slew of automakers betting heavily on hybrids and pure electric vehicles. Major carmakers including GM and Nissan Motor Co Ltd (7201.T) already have electric cars on the road, though the push for greener cars has also ushered in a host of venture-backed startups like Fisker and Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA.O).

You ask every worker coming off a shift change if they've heard rumors of layoffs, and they'll tell you they have, said Herbert Claros, vice president of the Metalworkers Union of Sao Jose dos Campos, in a telephone interview. We just want Embraer to clear the air. Claros said concerns began a month ago with talk of a management shakeup to be followed by wider layoffs. Anticipation mounted last week when two top executives left the company. A human resources executive denied the rumors last week, Claros said, but the union has sent the company a letter asking for a public statement from management. An Embraer press officer told Reuters there is no substance to the talk of mass layoffs. Factory workers across Brazil are on edge as flagging industrial output has failed to keep pace with rising wages. While unemployment remains near record lows, some economists have expressed fears that layoffs may be around the corner if slipping productivity keeps eroding the foundations of Brazil's labor market. Embraer, the world's largest maker of regional jets, has also felt the drag of the global economic crisis. Cancelled orders for private jets and slower demand for regional jets eroded Embraer's order backlog to $14.7 billion in March, the lowest since 2006, representing less than three years of revenue. The slowing orders led some analysts to suggest Embraer could throttle back production. Chief Executive Frederico Curado said in an interview with Reuters last week that regional jet orders should rebound from a weak first quarter. He said the company is counting on a recovery in the United States to offset a declining market in Europe and keep Embraer's backlog stable this year.  	   Claros said union members have heard talk of layoffs on the scale of 1,000 to 1,300 workers, well short of the 4,273 workers cut in February 2009, at the height of the global credit crisis."

Still, July's job cuts were up 2.3 percent from the same time a year ago. For 2013 so far, employers have announced 296,633 job losses, down from the 319,946 that were seen in the first seven months of last year. At the current pace, layoffs for 2013 could be below 2012's total of 523,362, which was the lowest level since 1997. The healthcare sector saw the biggest layoffs, cutting 6,843 employees, the largest monthly amount for the sector since November 2009. The aerospace and defense sector came in second, letting 4,889 workers go.

The survey of members of the International Public Management Association for Human Resources and the National Association of State Personnel Executives, found public employees also worry about their image. Some 73 percent of those surveyed said the public perception of government workers is a top concern, more those who listed staff retention, healthcare costs and workload sizes. When revenue collapsed during the recession, state and local governments slashed spending, often laying off workers and freezing job openings. Even though the downturn officially ended in 2009, revenue is only now inching higher in some places. The pace of public job cuts is slowing, with 28 percent of those surveyed reporting layoffs this year compared to 40 percent last year. But more than a fifth - 22 percent - said employees had accelerated their retirements. Altogether, nearly 70 percent of those asked said their work forces are smaller than in 2008, and the leaner staffing could persist for a while, with 42 percent reporting hiring freezes."

The bankruptcy of Twinkies maker Hostess in November accounted for 18,500 of the jobs lost. The computer industry, which has led layoffs for the year, cut 3,313 jobs last month.

Employers announced 36,398 job cuts last month, down 4.5 percent from 38,121 in April, according to the report from consultants Challenger, Gray & Christmas, Inc. May's layoffs were also significantly lower than what was seen a year ago, down 41.2 percent from last May's 61,887. May typically sees the smallest number of layoffs of the year, the report said. For 2013 so far, employers have announced 219,560 cuts, compared to the 245,540 jobs that were cut in the first five months of 2012. So far, the threat of massive job cuts related to federal spending cuts has failed to materialize, John Challenger, chief executive officer of Challenger, Gray & Christmas, said in a statement. Although the job market is not out of the woods yet as far as the potential for government downsizing is concerned, improvements in the economy may delay or minimize the impact on the workforce, Challenger said. Across-the-board government spending cuts of $85 billion, known as the sequester, went into effect in March, and recent data has hinted the belt-tightening is starting to crimp overall growth. There were fewer than 1,500 job cuts directly attributed to federal cutbacks and the sequester, Challenger said. Still, the healthcare sector suffered the biggest job losses last month, with layoffs rising to 4,886.

General Dynamics issued notices to the workers under the federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining (WARN) Act, notifying them that the expected layoffs will kick in from March through April, said company spokesman Peter Keating. The company already laid off 98 people at the facility last year. The latest layoff notices will reduce the number of General Dynamics workers to around 260 from just over 400 now, Keating said. He said additional layoffs may be announced later, depending on the level of work to be done at the facility. Many of the workers are represented by the United Steelworkers of America union. General Dynamics says it could have staved off those layoffs if the Army had placed additional orders valued at around $170 million to retrofit existing Stryker vehicles with a tougher hull designed to survive roadside bombs, but those orders did not come through in time. The Army and other military services are unsure about future budget levels given mounting pressures on the overall defense budget, and the failure so far of lawmakers to avert $500 billion in additional spending reductions due to kick in on March 1. Over 300 workers at the General Dynamics plant wrote to Alabama lawmakers in December, urging them to continue their efforts to avoid what they called unnecessary layoffs, especially since Army officials have already said that more double V-hulled Strykers will likely be needed in the future. The Army has a total of 3,300 Strykers, including about 600 built with the double-V hulls, and nearly 50 that were retrofitted with the stronger hulls. General Dynamics says it can exchange the hulls on the wheeled military vehicles for about half the cost of building new ones. It says the new hulls protect soldiers about as well as Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles built specifically to reduce injuries and deaths caused by roadside bombs. It has urged the Army to place orders for additional upgrades now, arguing that interrupting production and restarting it later will be more expensive and will trigger layoffs at its own facility and those of key suppliers. Some of those workers could be rehired later, depending on when additional orders are placed. Senator Richard Shelby, an Alabama Republican and member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, warned the chief of staff of the Army, General Raymond Odierno, in a letter in December that delays in placing orders for a third brigade of Strykers with the double-v hull could jeopardize good jobs at the plant and would put U.S. soldiers' lives at risk. In the letter, Shelby said Army officials had told him they planned to buy a third brigade of the upgraded vehicles, which he said offered an exponential increase in soldier safety, but could not give him a timeline for signing a contract with General Dynamics and starting production. I ask that you personally engage on this issue to ensure our bureaucracy does not unnecessarily limit the rapid production and fielding of this needed capability, he wrote. No comment was immediately available from the Army. Of the 406 General Dynamics workers now at the plant, about 350 currently work on the Stryker program, a company spokesman said. If no contract is signed with the Army for additional hull exchanges the total number of workers is likely to be reduced to around 159, the spokesman said.

President Francois Hollande rode to power in a presidential runoff last month on a promise to tackle soaring unemployment, which has reached the highest level in nearly 13 years. With the economy stalling, Labor Minister Michel Sapin said urgent measures were needed against unemployment and that he aimed to put forward legislation after the summer break. The main idea is to make layoffs so expensive for companies that it's not worth it, Sapin said in an interview with France Info radio. It's not a question of sanctions, but workers have to have compensation at the right level, he said. The push to make firing more difficult in France, where making layoffs is already tightly regulated and often costly for employers, contrasts with moves under way in other euro zone countries such as Italy and Spain to make job cuts easier. Sapin, a former finance minister and long-time friend of Hollande, said the government could not stand by idly as some companies cut workers just to improve profitability and boost their dividends to shareholders. Industry Minister Arnaud Montebourg is also planning legislation that would force companies to sell plants they want to get rid off at market prices to avoid closures and job losses. The government and unions are bracing for a wave of layoffs after a June 10 and 17 legislative election, fearing companies have put off job cuts until after the election period. Data from the INSEE statistics institute showed on Thursday that France's jobless rate hit the psychologically important threshold of 10 percent in the first quarter of the year. Unemployment in France has now risen even higher than in the wake of the 2008-2009 financial crisis, rising from 9.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2011 to the highest level since the third quarter of 1999. The rate for mainland France rose to 9.6 percent from 9.3 percent in the final three months of 2011 also to hit its highest level since the third quarter of 1999.

Sackings are usually swift, with bankers escorted out, a few belongings thrown into boxes and Blackberries and phones disabled the minute they get their marching orders. But weeks of trawling through old emails and planning software lockdowns now precede and follow the job cuts that are happening in thousands, adding a new layer of indignity to the process. It used to be that you would take away any access to the building and maybe prevent someone from lifting their Rolodex, said Stephen Bonner, a former Barclays executive now a partner in the information protection business at consultancy KPMG. Now there is extensive compliance, with for example reviews of the last six months of email activity, for signs of a large amount of material being sent to personal accounts. Companies have to make sure they can block access to work systems that employees may be using on their own computers, while occasionally calling in lawyers to ask fired staff to destroy data they may have already downloaded. The crackdown has taken on new relevance after a series of banking scandals such as the rigging of Libor interest rates. Records of emails and voice mails underpinned a case by regulators against Barclays for manipulating Libor, which was settled in June. Layoffs in banking have long been a particularly brutal affair, justified by firms because of the sensitive information handled by deal advisers and traders. Anecdotes abound about the half-eaten sandwiches left behind by colleagues called to a meeting with their manager and human resources, never to return. Those allowed to collect their belongings often do so with a security escort. More bankers are likely to get a taste of the dismissal procedures in the coming months as economic woes hurt revenue. Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) and Nomura (8604.T) have been among those shrinking headcount again recently, with layoffs at major players adding up to well over 130,000 since 2011. Practice Run With hundreds of bankers sometimes leaving on the same day in big redundancy rounds, the huge IT operations take meticulous planning, sometimes with unnerving consequences for staff. One analyst laid off last year along with his team said their Blackberries stopped working for 15 minutes a week before they were unexpectedly laid off. In retrospect they believed it had been a practice run. That made us feel a bit sick, the former analyst said, speaking on condition of anonymity. But recurring incidents of data theft, and other breaches and scandals mean banks will likely only step up their checks. I've never yet run one investigation during a round of redundancies where we haven't found things that were concerning for the company, Bonner at KPMG said. A former Goldman Sachs (GS.N) computer programmer was recently charged with stealing a high-frequency trading code from the firm before leaving for a job at a start-up. Systems sweeps can extend to looking for signs of downloads onto memory sticks in the months before an employee's departure. Banks store valuable client data in relationship management systems for example, listing intimate details of their every transaction, which junior bankers could try to take with them. While preventing these breaches is not always possible, banks will notify each other if they believe former employees have taken data they were not entitled to and collaborate between firms, Bonner said. As in other industries, there is also the risk that a disgruntled, fired employee will return to his desk and send off angry company-wide emails -- but worse can happen too. A computer programmer at U.S. mortgage association Fannie Mae was convicted in 2010 for planting a computer virus designed to destroy all the data on its servers the day he was fired. Wedded to Gadgets Most bankers do leave on good terms, however -- usually a condition to getting a generous redundancy payout. But although many concede big packages are the trade-off for working in such a cut-throat world, the impersonal format of layoffs is still tough, and dependence on technology such as Blackberries has made things worse. Being suddenly cut off from the systems so many are wedded to can exacerbate the feelings of worthlessness and bereavement people experience during redundancy, psychologists say. People are handed these gadgets and tools...and it becomes entrenched in their way of being, said Michael Sinclair of the City Psychology Group. It's what they do at night times, and it's about 'who am I'. The lack of a human connection in banking redundancies can add to the problem, he said, as does the stigma attached to seeking counselling, which can be seen as a weakness. But the large scale of redundancies at banks and their frequency, correlated to cycles of rising and falling markets, make it unlikely they will be handled any differently, despite efforts to give employees and managers more training to cope since the 2008 financial crisis. The only other way in is the more personal way, and I don't know how one could do that, said Kirsty Tifft from The Career Psychologist, who previously worked in finance, including at Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch. Once you go down that route, you have to invest a lot of time. When hundreds of people leave on the same day, it's hard to see how that could be managed. (Editing by Anna Willard)"

Employers announced 39,372 planned job cuts last month, up 8.2 percent from 36,398 in May, according to the report from consultants Challenger, Gray & Christmas, Inc. June's layoffs were also up 4.8 percent from a year ago. Still, the number of job cuts in the first half of the year was down 8.5 percent from the first six months of 2012. With the third quarter typically a slow period for downsizing, that puts layoffs on track to see the second-lowest yearly total since 2000, said John Challenger, chief executive officer of Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Unless, there is a major shock to the economy in the second half of 2013, we could see layoff activity continue to decline toward pre-2000 levels, Challenger said in a statement. The report comes ahead of Friday's key U.S. jobs report, which is forecast to show the pace of hiring cooled slightly in June, while the unemployment rate is expected to dip to 7.5 percent. The computer industry led the increase in layoffs for June, with 10,133 workers losing their jobs. That was followed by the education sector, which cut 5,629 positions. The aerospace and defense sectors have been hardest hit by the across-the-board government spending cuts known as the sequester that went into effect in March, the report said. Since the beginning of the year, the sectors have lost 4,366 jobs related to the sequestrations, while the government has cut a further 1,976 employees for that reason.

Feb 5 (Reuters) - Pennsylvania Governor Tom Corbett asked the state's Republican-led legislature on Tuesday for pension reform, layoffs, transportation investments and a $90 million increase in basic education funding in his proposed budget for fiscal 2014. The Republican governor's $28.4 billion blueprint, if approved by lawmakers, is $679 million, or about 2.4 percent, higher than the current budget and includes no tax increases. Corbett said he will not expand Pennsylvania's Medicaid system under federal healthcare reform because it lacks flexibility and would be too expensive to implement. He also proposed 400 layoffs in part by consolidating state health centers and by closing New Castle Youth Development Center. Pennsylvania's constitution requires a balanced budget to be adopted by June 30. Without pension reform, employer contributions in the state's two pension programs - the State Employee Retirement System and the Public School Employees' Retirement System - would balloon from their current 11.5 percent and 12.36 percent, respectively, to around 30 percent in five years, Corbett said. His proposal would not affect any benefits already accrued by current employees, nor will retirees lose any benefits. But new employees would be automatically enrolled in a 401(a) plan that would require them to contribute at least 6.25 percent of their salary. Pension costs are on track to eat up most of the state's available revenue growth, Budget Secretary Charles Zogby said at a media briefing before Corbett's address. We would have to go into the general fund, without reform, and make deep cuts, Zogby said. His budget also seeks to boost transportation funding. He proposed gradually removing the cap on a state tax on wholesale oil distributors, which could generate $5.3 billion over five years if approved. The new revenue, the governor said, would help pay for road, bridge and other transportation infrastructure improvements. And in keeping with announcements in the weeks leading up to his budget presentation, Corbett said he wants to privatize the management of the Pennsylvania Lottery, sell the state's liquor stores, and provide nearly $15 million to train about 300 new state police troopers."

IBM is cutting jobs, as disclosed in its latest earnings report last week, but those reductions will affect several thousand employees, a small fraction of what Forbes reported, according to an emailed statement from IBM to Reuters. Forbes had said as many as 112,000 employees could be laid off. The technology giant has been steadily reshaping its 400,000-plus staff for several years, laying off workers in some areas and hiring in new growth businesses.  A report last Thursday on Forbes' website by pseudonymous Silicon Valley technology gossip columnist Robert Cringely said IBM planned to break with that gradual approach and suddenly lay off 26 percent of its global workforce.  IBM did not issue a categorical denial of the report, but strongly suggested it was inaccurate. IBM does not comment on rumors, even ridiculous or baseless ones, the company said in the email. If anyone had checked information readily available from our public earnings statements, or had simply asked us, they would know that IBM has already announced the company has just taken a $600 million charge for workforce rebalancing. This equates to several thousand people, a small fraction of what's been reported. Last week, Chief Financial Officer Martin Schroeter told investors on IBM's fourth-quarter earnings conference call that the company was taking restructuring charges of around $580 million, but he did not specify the number of jobs affected. “We are not going to replicate the same level of restructuring that we had last year, Schroeter said in response to a Wall Street analyst's question. It will be a lower amount.   IBM does not disclose the amount of layoffs it makes each year, but one Wall Street analyst estimated that this year's restructuring charge suggests about 8,000 people, in line with recent years. For each of the last seven years, IBM has taken annual restructuring charges of between about $450 million and $1.5 billion, which we estimated have resulted in workforce reductions of between 6,500 and 21,500 per year, Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi wrote in a note to clients on Monday. He said the Forbes report was puzzling. IBM said it had 431,212 employees at the end of 2013, slightly down from 434,246 employees in 2012. The company has not yet disclosed its overall employee headcount for the end of 2014. IBM's shares were up about 0.5 percent at $156.66 on the New York Stock Exchange after paring earlier gains.

The New York-based company is the latest to shrink as the equities trading business slows globally. Liquidnet, which employed 331 people worldwide as of early September, is also considering cutting staff at its London operations, where it employs about 45 people, spokeswoman Melissa Kanter said. Liquidnet has taken steps to reduce headcount in selected parts of our business, reflecting the results of a review of our operations and the slowdown in global equities trading, the company said in a statement. The layoffs highlight that even fully electronic businesses are vulnerable to the steep decline in trading volume that has afflicted the stock market since the second half of 2009. Liquidnet is best known for matching, or crossing, huge orders of stocks from buyers and sellers. The cuts affected senior and junior staffers across all departments, Kanter said.  At its peak around 2008, Liquidnet employed about 470 people. The layoffs follow the demise of several small traditional equities brokers this year and severe downsizing on the stock- trading desks of giants such as Nomura Securities and Bank of America Those firms have high overhead costs because of their need to produce research and other services from analysts, traders and salespeople. Nomura earlier this month said it would shift its labor-intensive cash equities operation to the all-electronic model of its Instinet affiliate. Commission charges also have plummeted over the last 10 years, although Liquidnet still charges a relatively high 2-cents-a-share core commission on trading orders. Its average order size is 50,000 shares, but because it does not service high-frequency traders it is vulnerable to prolonged declines in stock volume. Also this week, RBC Capital Markets reorganized its electronic trading operations. Brian Suth, co-head of the Canadian bank's global trading unit since January, has left the company. Co-head Thomas Gajer will continue as sole global head of electronic sales and trading. RBC Capital also appointed Gaurav Mundra to a new positions as U.S. head of electronic sales and trading. Both report to Bobby Grubert, head of U.S. equities. Suth, whose LinkedIn page said he ran RBC's electronic sales team from late 2009 to the beginning of this year, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. RBC remains fully committed to the equities business, spokesman Kevin Foster said. The Canadian bank and its New York-based capital markets unit do not broader layoff programs in the works.

The survey of members of the International Public Management Association for Human Resources and the National Association of State Personnel Executives, found public employees also worry about their image. Some 73 percent of those surveyed said the public perception of government workers is a top concern, more those who listed staff retention, healthcare costs and workload sizes. When revenue collapsed during the recession, state and local governments slashed spending, often laying off workers and freezing job openings. Even though the downturn officially ended in 2009, revenue is only now inching higher in some places. The pace of public job cuts is slowing, with 28 percent of those surveyed reporting layoffs this year compared to 40 percent last year. But more than a fifth - 22 percent - said employees had accelerated their retirements. Altogether, nearly 70 percent of those asked said their work forces are smaller than in 2008, and the leaner staffing could persist for a while, with 42 percent reporting hiring freezes.

It was the lowest level since last December. April's layoffs were also down 6 percent from a year ago. So far this year, employers have announced 183,162 cuts, just slightly below the 183,653 that were seen in the first four months of last year.

Frank Kendall, the Defense Department's acting undersecretary for acquisition, technology and logistics, said the cuts would force the Pentagon to break many hard-won contracts with industry, including a multibillion dollar deal with Boeing Co for development of a new refueling plane. The Navy's contracts with Lockheed Martin Corp and Australia's Austal Ltd for littoral combat ships would also be vulnerable if the mandatory cuts, known as sequestration, took effect as planned, Kendall told the Senate Armed Services Committee at a confirmation hearing to stay in the job. Kendall said the defense industry would face fairly deep cuts applied indiscriminately, rather than on a targeted basis, given the way the Budget Control Act was worded. The Pentagon last month unveiled a budget proposal for fiscal 2013 that would begin to implement $487 billion in spending cuts that the White House and Congress agreed to make, spanning the next decade. If lawmakers did not come up with $1.2 trillion in other deficit-reducing measures, the Pentagon would have to cut its proposed funding by another $500 billion. Kendall said there was a good chance that President Barack Obama would use a legal clause to exempt the personnel accounts from the cuts -- which would increase the burden that would fall on spending for new weapons, research and development programs and upgrades for older weapons. A lot of the work that we're done over the last couple of years to try to make more efficient acquisition decisions and get better contract structures would be broken, he said. Kendall said the cuts would ripple through all tiers of the defense industry, hitting small and medium-sized businesses particularly hard. He said some of the biggest companies in the sector had already approached him with concerns about having to provide advance notice of potential layoffs given the uncertainty caused by the current budget situation. Committee Chairman Carl Levin asked Kendall to provide a report by May 10 on the impact of the current budget cuts on small and medium-sized businesses. The Pentagon has been studying the defense industrial base on a sector by sector, tier by tier basis to better understand the impact of budget decisions on those companies. In written responses to questions from the committee, Kendall vowed to focus heavily on reining in cost overruns on many major weapons programs, and said he would do everything in his power to eliminate them.

The U.S. carrier expects fewer than 40 percent of those it sent notices to, or 4,400 people, will actually be laid off in November and December, spokesman Bruce Hicks said. The layoff notices were required under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, which requires employees to be informed 60 days before major layoffs or plant closures. The notices will look worse than the actual layoffs, said Jamie Horwitz, a spokesman for the Transport Workers Union, which represents workers that received WARN Act notices. Horwitz said about 800 employees had agreed to leave American voluntarily, a move that will further reduce the number of expected layoffs. According to a letter sent by American to the Transport Workers Union, notices of potential layoff were sent to more than 3,000 workers in Dallas and Fort Worth, Texas, where American is based; about 3,000 people in Tulsa, Oklahoma; just over 1,200 in Miami; nearly 1,000 in New York; about 900 in Chicago and lesser numbers in other U.S. cities. In February, American outlined plans to cut as many as 14,000 jobs as it looks to streamline in bankruptcy. American Airlines, the third-largest U.S. air carrier, filed for Chapter 11 protection in November, citing a need to decrease labor costs. The company has signed non-disclosure agreements with carriers including US Airways Group as it evaluates a potential merger. US Airways won the backing of unions that represent American ramp workers, pilots and flight attendants earlier this year by promising to preserve thousands of jobs should a merger with American occur. Rise in Cancellations American's flight cuts for September and October were set partly due to an increase in pilot sick days and greater maintenance reports by flight crews led to cancellations and delays, Hicks said. American operates about 1,700 flights a day. Last week, the unit of AMR Corp AAMRQ.PK began implementing cost cuts for its unionized pilots after gaining bankruptcy court approval to abandon its collective bargaining agreement with the Allied Pilots Association. According to data from tracking service FlightAware.com, American Airlines in recent days has cancelled more flights than other major U.S. airlines. On Monday, for example, American cancelled about 2.1 percent of its scheduled flights, or about 73, compared with an average of 0.4 percent for other major U.S. airlines that day, FlightAware said. Mark Duell, vice president of operations at FlightAware, said cancellations at American have been well above the rest of the U.S. airline industry for the past two weeks. Pilot union spokesman Gregg Overman said on Tuesday that sick rates for American pilots have not deviated from normal historical rates, based on the union's tracking. He said there have been more mechanical delays. The pilots are the only major work group at American that have not agreed on contract concessions since the airline filed for bankruptcy in November last year. In a message on Tuesday, union president Keith Wilson said pilots were angry since American began imposing new work terms that cut their compensation and benefits. The pilots union is conducting a strike vote through October 3, but has previously said it will not walk out unless it is legal to do so.

John Reseburg, a company spokesman, acknowledged that E.A. is reshuffling its 9,000-strong worldwide work force, but dismissed Internet reports of the layoffs. I don't think there is a factual basis for the reports,  Reseburg said. He added the company is expecting its headcount to be higher at the end of 2012 compared with last year. We're growing and we're looking to hire hundreds of people for our digital, console, mobile and social games, Reseburg said. Like all game companies, we make occasional adjustments to resize our teams as projects are completed and new priorities are established. We expect that our headcount will be up at the end of the year. Citing multiple unnamed sources, the website StartupGrind reported on Sunday that the Redwood City, California-based game publisher will lay off 500 to 1,000 employees as early as this week as it struggles with poor reception for 'Star Wars: The Old Republic,' a major online title released in December.

Employers announced 45,730 layoffs last month, up from 40,289 in September, according to the report from consultants Challenger, Gray & Christmas, Inc. But for the first time in five months, the October figure was lower than the year-ago tally, which came in at 47,724. For 2013 so far, employers have announced 433,114 cuts, close to the 433,725 seen in the first ten months of last year. The pharmaceutical sector saw the most layoffs, with plans to cut 10,585 employees. Those cuts came mostly from pharmaceutical giant Merck & Co Inc. Last quarter the company reported lower sales of its Januvia diabetes treatment - its biggest product. The financial sector saw the second-biggest cuts, with 8,717 layoffs announced. The sector has seen the deepest downsizing so far this year, with 57,591 cuts announced since January. The banking sector is cutting workforce levels as a direct result of an improving economy. Many banks, including Bank of America, which announced 4,200 job cuts in October, are slashing positions in their mortgage department as the number of troubled mortgages and foreclosures dwindles, said John A. Challenger, chief executive officer of Challenger, Gray & Christmas, in a statement. Furthermore, improvements in the economy are also pushing interest rates back up, which is curbing demand for refinancing. The figures come two days ahead of the key U.S. non-farm payrolls report, which is forecast to show the economy added 125,000 jobs in October with the unemployment rate edging to 7.3 percent from its current 7.2 percent."

The case has political reverberations in France, where hard-left presidential candidate Jean-Luc Melenchon and others have campaigned to ban so-called market layoffs by healthy firms that axe workers under shareholder pressure. Thursday's decision concerned software company Viveo's attempt to lay off 64 workers, which a Paris court of appeals had blocked last May after finding that the firm had failed to prove that it was undergoing economic difficulties. Viveo, which is merging with banking software concern Temenos, did not show signs of weakness or a need to improve its competitiveness, the lower court had ruled. However, the higher Court of Cassation found that a plan to lay off workers could be blocked only if the company failed to produce a suitable job-saving plan, and not on the motive that the firm was healthy enough to keep them on its staff. Only the absence or insufficiency of a job-saving plan, submitted to the staff representatives, can stop a procedure for economic redundancies, the court wrote in its ruling. In February, the French Senate voted down a draft law proposed by left-wing senators which defined market layoffs as any plan to fire workers by a company that has distributed dividends to shareholders in the preceding year. Socialist presidential candidate Francois Hollande, who polls show winning a runoff round against President Nicolas Sarkozy on Sunday, has not endorsed the idea. However, he has warned chief executives against waiting until after the election to announce layoffs. Our accession (to power) will not provoke layoffs, Hollande told the daily Le Parisien in April. We must tell these companies that we will not accept them without reacting. The Viveo case will be sent to a court in Versailles for another hearing that should be a formality to uphold the Court of Cassation's decision.

Sackings are usually swift, with bankers escorted out, a few belongings thrown into boxes and Blackberries and phones disabled the minute they get their marching orders. But weeks of trawling through old emails and planning software lockdowns now precede and follow the job cuts that are happening in thousands, adding a new layer of indignity to the process. It used to be that you would take away any access to the building and maybe prevent someone from lifting their Rolodex, said Stephen Bonner, a former Barclays executive now a partner in the information protection business at consultancy KPMG. Now there is extensive compliance, with for example reviews of the last six months of email activity, for signs of a large amount of material being sent to personal accounts. Companies have to make sure they can block access to work systems that employees may be using on their own computers,   while occasionally calling in lawyers to ask fired staff to destroy data they may have already downloaded. The crackdown has taken on new relevance after a series of banking scandals such as the rigging of Libor interest rates.  Records of emails and voice mails underpinned a case by regulators against Barclays for manipulating Libor, which was settled in June. Layoffs in banking have long been a particularly brutal affair, justified by firms because of the sensitive information handled by deal advisers and traders. Anecdotes abound about the half-eaten sandwiches left behind by colleagues called to a meeting with their manager and human resources, never to return. Those allowed to collect their belongings often do so with a security escort. More bankers are likely to get a taste of the dismissal procedures in the coming months as economic woes hurt revenue. Deutsche Bank and Nomura have been among those shrinking headcount again recently, with layoffs at major players adding up to well over 130,000 since 2011. Practice Run With hundreds of bankers sometimes leaving on the same day in big redundancy rounds, the huge IT operations take meticulous planning, sometimes with unnerving consequences for staff. One analyst laid off last year along with his team said their Blackberries stopped working for 15 minutes a week before they were unexpectedly laid off. In retrospect they believed it had been a practice run. That made us feel a bit sick, the former analyst said, speaking on condition of anonymity. But recurring incidents of data theft, and other breaches and scandals mean banks will likely only step up their checks. I've never yet run one investigation during a round of redundancies where we haven't found things that were concerning for the company, Bonner at KPMG said. A former Goldman Sachs computer programmer was recently charged with stealing a high-frequency trading code from the firm before leaving for a job at a start-up. Systems sweeps can extend to looking for signs of downloads onto memory sticks in the months before an employee's departure. Banks store valuable client data in relationship management systems for example, listing intimate details of their every transaction, which junior bankers could try to take with them. While preventing these breaches is not always possible, banks will notify each other if they believe former employees have taken data they were not entitled to and collaborate between firms, Bonner said. As in other industries, there is also the risk that a disgruntled, fired employee will return to his desk and send off angry company-wide emails -- but worse can happen too. A computer programmer at U.S. mortgage association Fannie Mae was convicted in 2010 for planting a computer virus designed to destroy all the data on its servers the day he was fired. Wedded to Gadgets Most bankers do leave on good terms, however -- usually a condition to getting a generous redundancy payout. But although many concede big packages are the trade-off for working in such a cut-throat world, the impersonal format of layoffs is still tough, and dependence on technology such as Blackberries has made things worse. Being suddenly cut off from the systems so many are wedded to can exacerbate the feelings of worthlessness and bereavement people experience during redundancy, psychologists say. People are handed these gadgets and tools...and it becomes entrenched in their way of being, said Michael Sinclair of the City Psychology Group. It's what they do at night times, and it's about 'who am I'. The lack of a human connection in banking redundancies can add to the problem, he said, as does the stigma attached to seeking counseling, which can be seen as a weakness. But the large scale of redundancies at banks and their frequency, correlated to cycles of rising and falling markets, make it unlikely they will be handled any differently, despite  efforts to give employees and managers more training to cope since the 2008 financial crisis. The only other way in is the more personal way, and I don't know how one could do that, said Kirsty Tifft from The Career Psychologist, who previously worked in finance, including at Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch. Once you go down that route, you have to invest a lot of time. When hundreds of people leave on the same day, it's hard to see how that could be managed."

Center Adam Henrique scored twice and left wing Patrik Elias had a goal and two assists as the Devils returned from the 16-day respite for the 2014 Sochi Olympics with a 5-2 victory against the Columbus Blue Jackets on Thursday night at Prudential Center. The Devils used three goals in a 2:45 span in the first period to blow the game open, then slammed the door on a Blue Jackets comeback when Henrique scored a shorthanded goal with 19 seconds remaining in the second period to make it 4-2. Elias added an empty-netter with 35.8 seconds remaining as his backhand pass for Henrique banked off a defender and into the net. A nearly three-week layoff can lead to rust, but the Devils looked like they made the most of their break. We did a good job during the break of staying fresh and sharp, said Devils left wing Ryane Clowe, whose fourth goal of the season opened the scoring. You worry a little bit about being rusty, but that wasn't the case. I thought tonight our first period set us up for the rest of the game. Related CoveragePreview: Blue Jackets at DevilsClowe scored at 6:09 of the first, beating Blue Jackets goaltender Sergei Bobrovsky after having an attempt seconds earlier stopped. Right wing Jaromir Jagr had a power-play goal at 7:31, his 18th tally of the season, and Henrique scored his first of the game, also on the power play, at 8:54 to make it 3-0. Blue Jackets coach Todd Richards called timeout to stem the tide, but it proved to be one goal too late. You can call it what you want to call it; our execution wasn't good enough, Blue Jackets center Brandon Dubinsky said when asked if the time off hurt the team. We talked about penalty kill and specialty teams in general. Our coaches spend a lot time pre-scouting. We spend a lot of time having meetings about it. So for us to give up two power-play goals like that in a row, that can't happen. To their credit, the Blue Jackets pushed back with goals from left wing Artem Anisimov in the first period and right wing Marian Gaborik in the second period to make it a 3-2 game. The Blue Jackets earned a power play late in the second period, but instead of using it to draw even, it led to the back-breaking goal from Henrique. Blue Jackets defenseman Jack Johnson fumbled the puck at the blue line, and it led to Elias flipping a sky-high pass that came to rest at the feet of Henrique behind the defense. Henrique made no mistake, burying the puck through Bobrovsky's legs to extend the lead to 4-2. Bobrovsky was the Russian goaltender at the Olympics who allowed four shootout goals to Team USA's T.J. Oshie, who scored three of them through Bobrovsky's legs. Henrique, a Canadian, said Oshie's five-hole dominance played no role in his goal. I was just trying to get a good shot through his five-hole, Henrique said. To hear that thud (of the puck hitting the padding in the back of the net) is probably my favorite sound in the world. It's a huge momentum boost for them, Dubinsky said. Any time you score a goal in the final minute of a period, that's momentum for that team. The win meant a great deal for the Devils in the standings. They are now tied with the Blue Jackets with 63 points and sit three points back of both third place in the Metropolitan Division and the final wild-card spot in the Eastern Conference. There are four teams tied with 63 points, but the Devils have played one more game than the other three. Devils coach Peter DeBoer said while it's tempting to check the scoreboard, his team must resist the temptation. As hard as it is to not scoreboard watch here, we have to take care of our own business, DeBoer said. We have to put our head down and win as many games as we possibly can. That's what we're concentrating on. NOTES: Blue Jackets RW Marian Gaborik returned to the lineup after breaking his collarbone Dec. 21.

Chief Executive Officer Steve Bennett told Reuters in an exclusive interview that Janice Chaffin, consumer business president, will leave the company as part of the restructuring, which will usher in 10 product-focused divisions including security, cloud and backup software. Bennett, brought onboard last year with a mandate to turn around the faltering security software specialist, also said the company will pay out its first-ever dividend starting next quarter, targeting a 2.5 percent yield based on its January 22 closing price of $20.86. We looked at five different scenarios and modeled them all and talked about them all, Bennett said in an exclusive interview. They included divesting specific units among Symantec's portfolio such as a highly profitable consumer anti-virus business and a sluggish storage management and backup software unit. We can create a lot more value by running the company, Bennett told Reuters in the interview ahead of a meeting with analysts on Wednesday afternoon. The former head of Intuit Inc and a General Electric veteran would not say how many managers would be laid off, but managers at his company on average have fewer than five people reporting to them among the comany's 20,000 employees. That is about half as many as managers at a typical company, he noted. Symantec expects $275 million in severance payments as a result of the layoffs, which will be conducted through June. Bennett replaced Enrique Salem as CEO in July and vowed to turn around Symantec, saying he would apply lessons he learned from the GE corporate playbook during the more than two decades he managed a variety of the industrial conglomerate's businesses. Details of the company's restructuring came the same day Symantec reported quarterly earnings that beat expectations and said it was splitting the chief executive and chairman jobs.

(Reuters) - DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc has begun a round of layoffs, a labor union said on Monday, while media reports indicated that up to 400 employees could be cut from the studio's workforce.  Months after talks to find a buyer sputtered and a few weeks after high-level management changes, the studio run by Jeffrey Katzenberg intends to significantly reduce the size of its workforce, the Los Angeles Times reported, citing two people familiar with the matter.  Variety said 150 to 400 employees could be affected at the Glendale and Redwood City, California campuses of the studio behind hit franchises like How to Train Your Dragon, Shrek and Kung Fu Panda. DreamWorks Animation employs around 2,200 people.  A spokesman for DreamWorks Animation declined to comment on the reports. Some DreamWorks employees told their union, the Animation Guild, last week that they had been let go. There are layoffs going on because I have had members call me who have been laid off, said Steve Hulett, business representative at the Animation Guild. He wrote an email to the company last week requesting more information, but had not yet received a reply. Layoffs at DreamWorks Animation are expected to include animators, story-board artists and other production personnel and support, the L.A. Times and Variety reported.  The news comes two weeks after the studio appointed new co-presidents of feature animation, Bonnie Arnold and Mireille Soria, while its Chief Creative Officer Bill Damaschke stepped down.  Katzenberg had been in talks about a potential sale of the studio, but early discussions with SoftBank Corp in September and with Hasbro Inc in November ended shortly after they were reported.  During what are generally considered robust years for animated features, the studio has suffered from big misses on films like Mr Peabody & Sherman, Turbo and Rise of the Guardians.

The four-week average of new claims for state jobless benefits dropped to 335,500, the Labor Department said on Thursday. The reading has not been that low since November 2007, just before the United States fell into a calamitous recession. Now it appears that a long cycle of aggressive layoffs, which had fueled a surge in unemployment and helped shape two presidential elections, is over. Still, employers have appeared reticent to hire, and Thursday's data still pointed to only modest economic growth. Last week, initial jobless claims edged 5,000 higher to 333,000, a little less than expected. The overall economy and the labor market are improving at a moderate pace, said Lindsey Piegza, chief economist at brokerage Sterne Agee & Leach in Chicago. The pull-back in layoffs since 2009 has helped bring about a substantial fall in the jobless rate, and the trend in jobless claims could make the Federal Reserve more comfortable in unwinding the nation's last giant economic stimulus program. Many economists expect the U.S. central bank to begin reducing its massive bond-buying stimulus program as soon as next month. The Fed currently buys $85 billion a month in bonds to push borrowing costs lower and help boost economic recovery. While layoffs are roughly half their level in early 2009, the recovery in job creation has been more lackluster. Employers added just 162,000 workers to payrolls in July. Economic growth has also trended lower in recent months, with national output growing at a mere 1.4 percent annual rate in the first half of the year, down from 2.5 percent in the same period of 2012. The potential for job creation to meaningfully accelerate is limited, said Jim Baird, an investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors in Kalamazoo, Michigan. Wall Street analysts polled by Reuters had expected first-time applications to rise to 336,000 last week, and investors did not appear to take any cues from the claims data. U.S. stock prices rose, while yields on U.S. government debt fell ahead of a $16 billion bond auction. New jobless claims were volatile in July due to regular summer auto plant shutdowns, which make it hard for the government to adjust the data for seasonal swings. But that volatility is now past, and Labor Department analysts said there was nothing unusual in the data and that no states had provided estimates. The claims report showed the number of people still receiving benefits under regular state programs after an initial week of aid rose 67,000 to 3.018 million in the week ended July 27.

Employers announced 32,239 planned job cuts last month, down 12.5 percent from 36,855 in July, according to the report from consultants Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc. It was the fewest number of planned cuts since December, 2010, but the consultancy said the August decline may be further evidence of an improving economy or it may simply be a summer lull in job-cut activity. The report came a day before the U.S. government is set to release the key August jobs report, for which economists expect payrolls to have dipped from July. The jobless rate was high at 8.3 percent in July, causing deep concern at the Federal Reserve, which aims for maximum U.S. employment. Challenger said the planned cuts in August were 37 percent lower than a year earlier. So far this year, employers have announced 352,185 cuts, down slightly from the 363,334 in the first eight months of last year. Job cuts slowed significantly over the summer, but it is too early to determine whether this is a trend, John Challenger, chief executive of the consultancy, said in a statement. If international job-cut activity is any indication, we may see a surge in downsizing in the final months of 2012 and into 2013. Historically, the heaviest job cuts are in the fourth quarter. In August, cuts were deepest in the telecommunications sector, where employers announced 4,584 layoffs, Challenger said. Most of these were the anticipated cuts resulting from Google Inc's (GOOG.O) acquisition of Motorola Mobility. Reporting by Jonathan Spicer; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama"

The layoffs, which will extend through August 6, follow the elimination of jobs of 109 people in New York earlier this year. The filing did not disclose the level of seniority nor the business areas in which the layoffs at its Credit Suisse Securities (USA) unit will occur.  A bank spokesman in New York declined to comment. The trimming is part of a plan announced last year by Switzerland's second largest bank company to cut about 3,500 jobs worldwide and eliminate $2.1 billion of annual costs by the end of 2013. The cuts are expected to cut across the bank's three major divisions of private banking, asset management and investment banking. Credit Suisse employed about 11,700 in the United States, Canada and other parts of the Americas as of year-end 2011. Like other investment banks, Credit Suisse has been trimming jobs and businesses in the face of higher regulatory capital requirements, depressed interest-related profits and reduced risk-taking. In its recently issued annual report, the company said it has completed the closing of its commercial mortgage-backed securities origination businesses, accelerated its plan to reduce assets that require heavy capital support and begun reallocating resources to fast-growing markets such as Brazil, Southeast Asia, China and Russia.

State police said about 7,000 workers from Volkswagen AG, Ford Motor Co and the Mercedes-Benz truck unit of Germany's Daimler AG occupied a lane of the highway linking Brazil's biggest city and biggest port. The union organizing the protest estimated that total participation was close to 30,000, based on the number of workers at three auto plants shut down for the march. Last week Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz confirmed more than 1,000 job cuts, accelerating a drop in auto industry payrolls that dwindled nearly 9 percent last year. VW and Mercedes workers have already responded with strikes and the participation of Ford employees bolstered labor leaders' assertion that the resistance to layoffs will be industrywide. Auto industry groups in Brazil are forecasting little or no recovery from a sharp downturn in 2014, as rising interest rates and expiring tax breaks contribute to weak consumer confidence. Carmakers have responded by cutting costs, ending an agreement with Brazil's government to avoid layoffs. The labor standoff is testing the mettle of President Dilma Rousseff's new economic team, which took charge this month promising to end the cheap credit and tax incentives that have propped up key industries but wrecked government accounts. The auto industry contributes a quarter of Brazil's industrial production and its powerful labor unions helped to found the ruling Worker's Party. A Mercedes-Benz representative confirmed its workers were involved in the demonstration, adding that the company recognized their right to protest. She said production at its local truck factory was stopped for the day. Volkswagen reiterated a recent statement that the company urgently needs to reduce costs at its local plant, known as Anchieta. Workers there have halted production since Tuesday. Ford representatives confirmed a one-day stoppage at the company's factory outside of Sao Paulo as workers participated in the demonstration in what they described as an act of solidarity.

Citigroup, already a major force in fixed-income trading, had been building its stock trading efforts in recent years just as volumes began to shrink. The latest round of layoffs affected about 6 percent of the 800 people who work in the cash equities unit - with most of the cuts occurring in the United States. In equities, Citigroup had been staffed as a top-tier firm globally but consistently put up second-tier revenues, Nomura Securities analyst Glenn Schorr wrote in a research note on Friday. Those let go included Brennan Warble, a managing director who was head of sales and trading in the Americas, according to two people familiar with the layoffs. Warble, who did not return a call for comment, had also been also co-head of the cash equities execution business in the Americas since former trading head Armando Diaz left for hedge fund Millennium Management about a year ago. Citigroup has been making targeted headcount reductions throughout the year in certain businesses and functions across Citi as part of our efforts to control expenses during the current environment, a bank spokeswoman wrote in an e-mail. The cash equities, or stock-trading, business has become a target for cuts across Wall Street because of record-low volumes attributed to a lack of confidence in markets by both individual and institutional investors still reeling from memories of the 2008 crash. The layoffs follow the demise of several equities brokers this year and severe downsizing earlier at bigger firms such as Nomura Securities and Bank of America Corp The equities business is expensive for banks because they need to produce research and other services from analysts, traders and salespeople in order to attract orders and commissions. In addition to slashing employees, some companies are rethinking their business models. Nomura in September shifted its cash equities emphasis to the all-electronic model of its Instinet affiliate. Institutional stock trading revenue has fallen about 40 percent over the past four years, according to Bernstein Research, as mutual funds and other big investors have cut back on trading and relied more on low-cost transactions with stock indexes. Revenue from commissions has also shrunk as charges have been cut over the last 10 years. Institution firms are now paying less than one cent a share for many of their orders."

The program will cost 4.4 billion reais and is open to all employees, according to a statement from Petrobras, which has been hard hit by low oil prices, refinery project problems and a massive price-fixing, bribery and political kickback scandal. The company said the planned redundancies would help adjust the size of its workforce to a smaller investment plan and boost productivity. Investors have long criticized Petrobras for over hiring and struggling to cut some of the 57,000 people it directly employs when things get tough. Many of its workers enjoy job security that is close to that of civil servants, a legacy of the company’s heritage as a full state company. Under the plan, employees will be offered between around 212,000 reais and 706,000 reais to take redundancy, Deyvid Bacelar, the Petrobras board member representing workers, told Reuters, citing an internal memo. The move comes on the back of a plan announced in January to cut the number of managers at the firm, and a previous redundancy scheme announced in 2014.   Petrobras is set to slash its five-year investment plan by about 20 percent to about $80 billion in the 2016-2020 period, sources said a month ago. Petrobras reported a fourth-quarter loss of 36.9 billion reais ($10.2 billion), its biggest quarterly loss ever, after booking large writedowns for oil fields and other assets as oil prices slumped and refinery projects faltered. A year earlier, writedowns also caused hefty losses, although they were largely related to the corruption scandal that has roiled the company and fueled calls for the impeachment of Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff.

The bank has been focused on improving profitability within fixed income and has been scaling back businesses that miss those metrics, the sources said.  Related CoverageMorgan Stanley commodities executive Sandhu departs bank: sourcesMorgan Stanley exiting solar business with fixed income cuts: sources Morgan Stanley's short-term credit desk, including its commercial paper business, has seen extensive cutbacks, they  said.  Morgan Stanley has also significantly reduced the number of bond sales people who cover smaller, regional broker-dealers, they added, although the bank will continue to cover these types of clients.  A Morgan Stanley spokesman declined to comment on the layoffs. Traders and fund managers interviewed by Reuters said Morgan Stanley's move is hardly a surprise as tougher capital rules, domestic and abroad, have made it less profitable to trade Treasuries, agency debt, corporate bonds and mortgage-backed securities. These rules, intended to curb excessive risk-taking, have also raised the cost for Morgan Stanley and other top Wall Street firms to borrow in the short-term, wholesale funding markets including the repurchase agreement (repo) market. With the Fed widely expected to hike rates next week, the daily cost for trading will likely go up further. In addition, the proliferation of electronic systems and high-frequency trading firms has eroded Morgan Stanley and other Wall Street dealers' dominance in market-making the bond market. This year, electronic trading platforms are on track to capture 20 percent of U.S. investment-grade bond trading volume, a 25 percent rise from year earlier, according to research firm Greenwich Associates.

The layoffs are the latest impact of the state's declaration of revenue failure late last year amid a collapse in the price of oil and gas, which it relies on for tax revenues.  Eliminating the teaching positions will save the state's largest school district roughly $8 million, Superintendent Rob Neu said in a memo to teachers. The layoffs are expected to increase class sizes when they are implemented during the 2016-2017 school year, but the district will not exceed state mandated classroom sizes, he said.  Most of the cuts will be absorbed through attrition and retirement, he said.  Oil-related revenue accounted for 10 percent of Oklahoma's budget at the peak of the shale boom in 2014. But in December the state slashed its oil production tax revenue forecast for this year to $2 million from $102 million planned for in June. This is the first in a series of tough decisions ahead as we traverse through this very difficult financial time, Neu said in a memo to Oklahoma City Public School staff seen by Reuters. He said the budget outlook for the district is abysmal and officials are exploring an additional $22 million in adjustments, which will impact every school in the district.   The announcement comes on the same day that Governor Mary Fallin signed two measures to tap nearly $80 million from the state's rainy day fund, including $51 million for the state Department of Education to pay the full cost of health insurance for its employees.  Neu said that while the drawdown is appreciated, it is not enough to avoid the layoffs in the district, which currently employs about 2,700 teachers.  Gene Perry, policy director for independent think tank the Oklahoma Policy Institute, said the new cuts are especially damaging because Oklahoma has been slashing education spending for years, even when oil prices were booming.   After years of these cuts, Oklahoma schools have no good options to keep fulfilling their mission unless state leaders come up with new revenues for education, he said.

President Francois Hollande rode to power in a presidential runoff last month on a promise to tackle soaring unemployment, which has reached the highest level since 1999. Polls regularly show unemployment ranking among the French's top concerns, adding pressure on Hollande as his Socialist Party seeks a majority in parliament in a two-round legislative election on June 10 and 17. The push to make firing more difficult in France, where making layoffs is already tightly regulated and often costly for employers, contrasts with moves under way in other euro zone countries such as Italy and Spain to make job cuts easier. With the economy stalling, Labor Minister Michel Sapin said urgent measures were needed against unemployment and that he aimed to put forward legislation after the summer break. The main idea is to make layoffs so expensive for companies that it's not worth it, Sapin said in an interview with France Info radio. It's not a question of sanctions, but workers have to have compensation at the right level, he said. The 10-Percent Threshold Sapin, a former finance minister and long-time friend of Hollande, said the government could not stand by idly as some companies cut workers just to improve profitability and boost their dividends to shareholders. Industry Minister Arnaud Montebourg is also planning legislation that would force companies to sell plants they want to get rid of at market prices to avoid closures and job losses. The government and unions are bracing for a wave of layoffs after the legislative election, fearing companies have put off job cuts until after the election period. Data from the INSEE statistics institute showed on Thursday that France's jobless rate hit the psychologically important threshold of 10 percent in the first quarter of the year. Unemployment in France has now risen even higher than in the wake of the 2008-2009 financial crisis, rising from 9.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2011 to the highest level since the third quarter of 1999. The rate for mainland France rose to 9.6 percent from 9.3 percent in the final three months of 2011 also to hit its highest level since the third quarter of 1999. Sapin said in an interview with Les Echos business daily that the budget for state-aided jobs needed to be raised, or else 112,000 jobs on such contracts could be put at risk in the second half of the year. That would be extremely harmful at a time when all resources need to be mobilized against unemployment, he said, adding that the state-run jobs agency also needed more funds. However, Hollande's government is facing growing pressure from the European Commission and ratings agencies to cut spending in order to meet public deficit targets as promised. With the legislative election looming, the government is being careful not to spell out how it will keep its deficit-reduction plans on track until an independent audit of the public finances is handed in after the race.

The decision, following tense talks and heated reminders by Brazil's government that current tax cuts enjoyed by the carmaker go hand in hand with a pledge to preserve jobs, gives GM an additional three months to decide about layoffs on an assembly line it says it no longer needs. After nine hours of talks with the union on Saturday, Luiz Moan, GM's head of institutional relations in Brazil, said the carmaker would proceed with negotiations on the workers' labor agreement in the coming  months. Union members, meanwhile, will vote on the agreement at an assembly on Tuesday. The accord relieves mounting political pressure in recent weeks as the carmaker considered shuttering the assembly line, one of eight at the complex in São José dos Campos. The government has warned GM against cutting jobs, especially because sales, which had slowed due to a sluggish Brazilian economy, in recent months have rebounded with government tax breaks. We give fiscal incentives and we want something in return: stable employment, President Dilma Rousseff said last week. Tax breaks for carmakers are among a host of incentives for industry the government has unveiled as Brazil's once-booming economy stagnated over the past year. Of the workers at risk of losing their jobs, GM will keep 900 on the assembly line, the company said. The rest will continue receiving their salaries as they undergo training for other jobs. The decision to maintain some production on the line, Moan said, is a sacrifice by GM for the community. Since 2008, GM has directed its investments in new models to other factories in Brazil, citing high salaries and rigid labor agreements at the São Jose complex. The high costs, GM says, make it the least competitive plant in Brazil. After GM halted production of the decade-old models made on the line in recent weeks, workers began protesting anticipated layoffs. Antonio Ferreira, president of the metalworkers union representing the workers, told reporters the pressure of the federal and state government was key to maintaining the workforce at the plant. He said the union would keep negotiating with GM to bring new investments to the factory. Moan said GM currently has no models that could be competitively produced at the complex, but the company committed to 60 days of talks with the union to achieve a more flexible labor agreement. The automaker will also open a voluntary buyout program to the roughly 7,500 workers throughout the complex."

Sackings are usually swift, with bankers escorted out, a few belongings thrown into boxes and Blackberries and phones disabled the minute they get their marching orders. But weeks of trawling through old emails and planning software lockdowns now precede and follow the job cuts that are happening in thousands, adding a new layer of indignity to the process. It used to be that you would take away any access to the building and maybe prevent someone from lifting their Rolodex, said Stephen Bonner, a former Barclays executive now a partner in the information protection business at consultancy KPMG. Now there is extensive compliance, with for example reviews of the last six months of email activity, for signs of a large amount of material being sent to personal accounts. Companies have to make sure they can block access to work systems that employees may be using on their own computers, while occasionally calling in lawyers to ask fired staff to destroy data they may have already downloaded. The crackdown has taken on new relevance after a series of banking scandals such as the rigging of Libor interest rates. Records of emails and voice mails underpinned a case by regulators against Barclays for manipulating Libor, which was settled in June. Layoffs in banking have long been a particularly brutal affair, justified by firms because of the sensitive information handled by deal advisers and traders. Anecdotes abound about the half-eaten sandwiches left behind by colleagues called to a meeting with their manager and human resources, never to return. Those allowed to collect their belongings often do so with a security escort. More bankers are likely to get a taste of the dismissal procedures in the coming months as economic woes hurt revenue. Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) and Nomura (8604.T) have been among those shrinking headcount again recently, with layoffs at major players adding up to well over 130,000 since 2011. Practice Run With hundreds of bankers sometimes leaving on the same day in big redundancy rounds, the huge IT operations take meticulous planning, sometimes with unnerving consequences for staff. One analyst laid off last year along with his team said their Blackberries stopped working for 15 minutes a week before they were unexpectedly laid off. In retrospect they believed it had been a practice run. That made us feel a bit sick, the former analyst said, speaking on condition of anonymity. But recurring incidents of data theft, and other breaches and scandals mean banks will likely only step up their checks.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-investment-banks-redundancies-idUSBRE89M0MH20121023","Gadgets add complexity to brutal bank layoffs","","October 23, 2012 /  12:05 PM / in 5 years","","LONDON (Reuters) - In the high-tech, gadget-addicted world of investment banking, layoffs are becoming more complex and brutal as firms try to stop sensitive data leaving with employees. Sackings are usually swift, with bankers escorted out, a few belongings thrown into boxes and Blackberries and phones disabled the minute they get their marching orders. But weeks of trawling through old emails and planning software lockdowns now precede and follow the job cuts that are happening in thousands, adding a new layer of indignity to the process. It used to be that you would take away any access to the building and maybe prevent someone from lifting their Rolodex, said Stephen Bonner, a former Barclays executive now a partner in the information protection business at consultancy KPMG. Now there is extensive compliance, with for example reviews of the last six months of email activity, for signs of a large amount of material being sent to personal accounts. Companies have to make sure they can block access to work systems that employees may be using on their own computers, while occasionally calling in lawyers to ask fired staff to destroy data they may have already downloaded. The crackdown has taken on new relevance after a series of banking scandals such as the rigging of Libor interest rates. Records of emails and voice mails underpinned a case by regulators against Barclays for manipulating Libor, which was settled in June. Layoffs in banking have long been a particularly brutal affair, justified by firms because of the sensitive information handled by deal advisers and traders. Anecdotes abound about the half-eaten sandwiches left behind by colleagues called to a meeting with their manager and human resources, never to return. Those allowed to collect their belongings often do so with a security escort. More bankers are likely to get a taste of the dismissal procedures in the coming months as economic woes hurt revenue. Deutsche Bank and Nomura have been among those shrinking headcount again recently, with layoffs at major players adding up to well over 130,000 since 2011. Practice Run With hundreds of bankers sometimes leaving on the same day in big redundancy rounds, the huge IT operations take meticulous planning, sometimes with unnerving consequences for staff. One analyst laid off last year along with his team said their Blackberries stopped working for 15 minutes a week before they were unexpectedly laid off. In retrospect they believed it had been a practice run. That made us feel a bit sick, the former analyst said, speaking on condition of anonymity. But recurring incidents of data theft, and other breaches and scandals mean banks will likely only step up their checks.

The moves could be announced as soon as the end of the month and would represent the first major changes under CEO Scott Thompson, the former PayPal president who took the top job at Yahoo in January. The changes at the struggling Web pioneer, which recently hired the Boston Consulting Group, will focus on its products group, as well as on research, marketing and public relations and businesses that are not core to the company, according to the report on Monday in the blog AllThingsDigital.com, which cited anonymous sources. As we have indicated, our leadership is engaged in a process that will generate significant strategic change at Yahoo, but final decisions have not yet been made at this point.  Beyond that, we will not comment, Yahoo said in an emailed statement. Yahoo, whose revenue slid by more than a fifth last year, had 14,100 employees at the end of 2011. The company fired CEO Carol Bartz in September and has been undergoing a strategic review since then that could include spinning of some of its Asian assets and accepting a minority investment in the company.

Prime Minister Antonis Samaras's government is expected to scrape through the vote, despite a much-slimmer majority of only five seats in parliament after losing an ally over the decision to yank the state broadcaster off air and fire its 2,600 staff. The multi-pronged bill - whose passage is a condition for Greece to unlock further aid - includes plans for a public sector transfer and layoff scheme mainly affecting teachers and municipal police. About 5,000 Greeks flooded the street outside parliament, some chanting: We will not succumb, the only option is to resist and waving orange flags - though turnout was much smaller than in protests last year. After 12 years on the job, they fire us in one night, Patra Hatziharalampous, a 52-year-old school guard in uniform said between sobs. If they have any guts, they should say no to the bailout and take some of the bill's articles back. Hours before the vote, Samaras announced Greece's first tax cut since its crisis began nearly four years ago, in a bid to placate protests and an increasingly restive public mood. Despite the difficulties, important and significant things are taking place in our country, Samaras said in a surprise television address, announcing that value-added tax (VAT) in restaurants, which was raised to 23 percent in 2011, would be cut to 13 percent from August 1. We will not relax. We will continue climbing up the hill, we will reach the top, which is not far, and better days will come for our people, he said. The government had made a show of arguing for the restaurant VAT cut during its latest talks with lenders, and analysts said the move was a symbolic attempt to show austerity-hit Greeks that there was light at the end of the tunnel. Demonstrators stand during a protest in front of the parliament in Athens July 17, 2013.Yannis BehrakisSamaras said the cut would help curb tax evasion, a major problem in the country and one of the reasons it slid into a debt crisis in 2009, but warned that if tax evasion persisted the VAT would revert to 23 percent. The crucial thing is that it was announced now and not after the summer, said Thomas Gerakis, head of Marc Pollsters. How it will benefit consumers remains to be seen. Drawing Blood Slideshow (9 Images)Athens has been limping along on two bailouts worth over 240 billion euros ($315 billion) since 2010, which it has secured at the price of wage cuts and tax rises that have triggered a six-year recession and sent unemployment to 27 percent. The latest bill agreed with European Union and International Monetary Fund lenders as a condition for nearly 7 billion euros ($9.20 billion) in aid also includes a luxury tax on houses with swimming pools and owners of high performance cars. But the move that has drawn the most anger is the plan to place 25,000 workers into the layoff scheme by the end of 2013, giving them eight months to find another position or get laid off. Jobs in the public sector are widely seen as oversized, inefficient and filled with patronage hires, but many Greeks believe society can no longer go tolerate cuts or tax hikes. Uniformed municipal police, garbage collectors in orange vests and hundreds of other public sector workers have taken to the streets of Athens almost daily on motorbikes in over a week of rallies, blowing whistles, honking horns and blaring sirens. You are drawing blood from an organism suffering from anemia, George Varemenos, a lawmaker from the radical leftist opposition Syriza party told a parliamentary session.

The latest round of layoffs, announced on Wednesday, is at least the fourth workforce reduction in about as many years for a company once synonymous with the Internet boom and could spark a shakeup in management, analysts said.  Shares in Cisco, still the world's largest networking equipment maker, were down 2.7 percent at $24.52 on the Nasdaq. Cisco has failed to sustain growth in its high-end switches and routers business and is grappling with competition from so-called software-defined networks (SDN) which offer software that can run on cheap hardware.  The company will recognize $250 million to $350 million of the charges in the first quarter, it said in a regulatory filing. John Chambers, Cisco's veteran chief executive, blamed the cuts on global uncertainty and said he will use the savings to reinvest in profitable sectors like cloud computing and security. While the company has cut over 17,000 in the past four years, acquisitions have helped its headcount grow to around 74,000 from 71,000 in 2011, according to Cisco's regulatory  filings.  He is right-sizing Cisco and trying to get some strategic changes put in place. In the interim he has got to maintain his margins, said Ken Dulaney, analyst at Gartner.  The cuts could put pressure on 64-year-old Chambers to retire. The CEO has led the company for nearly 20 years and in 2012 said he would look to retire in two to four years. But Chambers is unlikely to leave before he is ready. According to Dulaney, Cisco's board is loyal to Chambers, who joined the company as senior vice president in 1991 and helped it grow into a $128 billion operation, one of the most valuable tech companies in the world. Still the announcement, which made Cisco the biggest decliner on the S&P; 500 on Thursday, could cause a shake up at the company.  A lot of his software investments have not panned out. He has got to get back to his core business and do greater things. That will happen if he gets new management under him, said Dulaney.  Cisco is also battling sluggish sales and increased competition in emerging markets. The company's rivals include Juniper Networks Inc and China's Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL]. Cisco said on Wednesday that sales fell 23 percent in China and 13 percent in Brazil in the fourth quarter ended July 26. The company also reported flat profit for the fourth quarter and forecast tepid first-quarter profit and revenue. Editing by Simon Jennings and Andrew Hay"

Shares of the world's No. 1 personal computer maker were up 6 percent at $22.26 in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday. While we certainly don't believe HP has resolved all their issues, we do see the company moving in the right direction, RBC Capital Markets LLC analyst Amit Daryanani wrote in a note to clients. The accelerating popularity of mobile computing devices such as Apple Inc's iPad has been eroding PC sales for years and a downturn in the European markets has just added to the pressure. Rival Dell gave a disappointing revenue forecast Earlier this week that spurred fears that global tech spending is weakening faster than anticipated. HP said the layoff of 27,000 workers, or 8 percent of its workforce, would be made mainly through early retirement and would generate annual savings of $3 billion to $3.5 billion as it exits fiscal year 2014. The company employs more than 300,000 people globally. Hewlett Packard, which also posted a second-quarter profit above market estimates, said it expects to use the cost savings from job cuts to drive organic growth. HP logo is seen outside Hewlett-Packard Belgian headquarters in Diegem in this January 2010 file photo.Thierry RogeThe market will likely want to see that the savings are real and tangible in the bottom line before they are diverted to other things, Nomura Equity Research analyst Richard Windsor said in a research report. When one has little faith in a management team, there will be little hope that these savings will ever be properly realized as they will never be properly visible, Windsor said. HEWLETT-PACKARD/ - Company profile of Hewlett Packard Co which plans to lay off roughly 27,000 employees over the next couple of years.At least three brokerages raised their price targets on the stock on Thursday. Analysts said it may be too early to predict a sustainable turn, given the deterioration of demand in Europe and secular pressures in many of HP's businesses into the second half of the year. We believe many of HPQ's further risks stem from inconsistent operational execution and recent large acquisitions, which combined with aggressive buy-backs have weakened its balance sheet, said Evercore analyst Rob Cihra. Rival Dell has been diversifying its revenue base in the face of weakened consumer demand, giving up low-margin sales to consumers and moving into higher-margin areas, such as catering to the technology needs of small and medium businesses in the public sector and the healthcare industry. Analysts, however, prefer HP over Dell saying the PC maker's revenue and margins growth will take too long to play out, whereas HP's restructuring will likely help the stock over the next few quarters, despite weak revenue.

President Francois Hollande rode to power in a presidential runoff last month on a promise to tackle soaring unemployment, which has reached the highest level in nearly 13 years. With the economy stalling, Labour Minister Michel Sapin said urgent measures were needed against unemployment and that he aimed to put forward legislation after the summer break. The main idea is to make layoffs so expensive for companies that it's not worth it, Sapin said in an interview with France Info radio. It's not a question of sanctions, but workers have to have compensation at the right level, he said. The push to make firing more difficult in France, where making layoffs is already tightly regulated and often costly for employers, contrasts with moves under way in other euro zone countries such as Italy and Spain to make job cuts easier. Sapin, a former finance minister and long-time friend of Hollande, said the government could not stand by idly as some companies cut workers just to improve profitability and boost their dividends to shareholders. Industry Minister Arnaud Montebourg is also planning legislation that would force companies to sell plants they want to get rid off at market prices to avoid closures and job losses. The government and unions are bracing for a wave of layoffs after a June 10 and 17 legislative election, fearing companies have put off job cuts until after the election period. Data from the INSEE statistics institute showed on Thursday that France's jobless rate hit the psychologically important threshold of 10 percent in the first quarter of the year. Unemployment in France has now risen even higher than in the wake of the 2008-2009 financial crisis, rising from 9.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2011 to the highest level since the third quarter of 1999. The rate for mainland France rose to 9.6 percent from 9.3 percent in the final three months of 2011 also to hit its highest level since the third quarter of 1999. For a table of the figures:"

The New York-based company is the latest to shrink as the equities trading business slows globally. Liquidnet, which employed 331 people worldwide as of early September, is also considering cutting staff at its London operations, where it employs about 45 people, spokeswoman Melissa Kanter said. Liquidnet has taken steps to reduce headcount in selected parts of our business, reflecting the results of a review of our operations and the slowdown in global equities trading, the company said in a statement. The layoffs highlight that even fully electronic businesses are vulnerable to the steep decline in trading volume that has afflicted the stock market since the second half of 2009. Liquidnet is best known for matching, or crossing, huge orders of stocks from buyers and sellers. The cuts affected senior and junior staffers across all departments, Kanter said. At its peak around 2008, Liquidnet employed about 470 people. The layoffs follow the demise of several small traditional equities brokers this year and severe downsizing on the stock- trading desks of giants such as Nomura Securities (8604.T) and Bank of America (BAC.N). Those firms have high overhead costs because of their need to produce research and other services from analysts, traders and salespeople. Nomura earlier this month said it would shift its labor-intensive cash equities operation to the all-electronic model of its Instinet affiliate. Commission charges also have plummeted over the last 10 years, although Liquidnet still charges a relatively high 2-cents-a-share core commission on trading orders. Its average order size is 50,000 shares, but because it does not service high-frequency traders it is vulnerable to prolonged declines in stock volume. Also this week, RBC Capital Markets reorganized its electronic trading operations. Brian Suth, co-head of the Canadian bank's global trading unit since January, has left the company. Co-head Thomas Gajer will continue as sole global head of electronic sales and trading. RBC Capital also appointed Gaurav Mundra to a new positions as U.S. head of electronic sales and trading. Both report to Bobby Grubert, head of U.S. equities. Suth, whose LinkedIn page said he ran RBC's electronic sales team from late 2009 to the beginning of this year, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. RBC remains fully committed to the equities business, spokesman Kevin Foster said. The Canadian bank and its New York-based capital markets unit do not broader layoff programs in the works.

The decision, following tense talks and heated reminders by Brazil's government that current tax cuts enjoyed by the carmaker go hand in hand with a pledge to preserve jobs, gives GM an additional three months to decide about layoffs on an assembly line it says it no longer needs. After nine hours of talks with the union on Saturday, Luiz Moan, GM's head of institutional relations in Brazil, said the carmaker would proceed with negotiations on the workers' labor agreement in the coming months. Union members, meanwhile, will vote on the agreement at an assembly on Tuesday. The accord relieves mounting political pressure in recent weeks as the carmaker considered shuttering the assembly line, one of eight at the complex in São José dos Campos. The government has warned GM against cutting jobs, especially because sales, which had slowed due to a sluggish Brazilian economy, in recent months have rebounded with government tax breaks. We give fiscal incentives and we want something in return: stable employment, President Dilma Rousseff said last week. Tax breaks for carmakers are among a host of incentives for industry the government has unveiled as Brazil's once-booming economy stagnated over the past year. Of the workers at risk of losing their jobs, GM will keep 900 on the assembly line, the company said. The rest will continue receiving their salaries as they undergo training for other jobs. The decision to maintain some production on the line, Moan said, is a sacrifice by GM for the community. Since 2008, GM has directed its investments in new models to other factories in Brazil, citing high salaries and rigid labor agreements at the São Jose complex. The high costs, GM says, make it the least competitive plant in Brazil. After GM halted production of the decade-old models made on the line in recent weeks, workers began protesting anticipated layoffs. Antonio Ferreira, president of the metalworkers union representing the workers, told reporters the pressure of the federal and state government was key to maintaining the workforce at the plant. He said the union would keep negotiating with GM to bring new investments to the factory. Moan said GM currently has no models that could be competitively produced at the complex, but the company committed to 60 days of talks with the union to achieve a more flexible labor agreement. The automaker will also open a voluntary buyout program to the roughly 7,500 workers throughout the complex. Editing by Dale Hudson"

(Reuters) - Pennsylvania Governor Tom Corbett asked the state's Republican-led legislature on Tuesday for pension reform, layoffs, transportation investments and a $90 million increase in basic education funding in his proposed budget for fiscal 2014. The Republican governor's $28.4 billion blueprint, if approved by lawmakers, is $679 million, or about 2.4 percent, higher than the current budget and includes no tax increases. Corbett said he will not expand Pennsylvania's Medicaid system under federal healthcare reform because it lacks flexibility and would be too expensive to implement. He also proposed 400 layoffs in part by consolidating state health centers and by closing New Castle Youth Development Center. Pennsylvania's constitution requires a balanced budget to be adopted by June 30. Without pension reform, employer contributions in the state's two pension programs - the State Employee Retirement System and the Public School Employees' Retirement System - would balloon from their current 11.5 percent and 12.36 percent, respectively, to around 30 percent in five years, Corbett said. His proposal would not affect any benefits already accrued by current employees, nor will retirees lose any benefits. But new employees would be automatically enrolled in a 401(a) plan that would require them to contribute at least 6.25 percent of their salary. Pension costs are on track to eat up most of the state's available revenue growth, Budget Secretary Charles Zogby said at a media briefing before Corbett's address. We would have to go into the general fund, without reform, and make deep cuts, Zogby said. His budget also seeks to boost transportation funding. He proposed gradually removing the cap on a state tax on wholesale oil distributors, which could generate $5.3 billion over five years if approved. The new revenue, the governor said, would help pay for road, bridge and other transportation infrastructure improvements. And in keeping with announcements in the weeks leading up to his budget presentation, Corbett said he wants to privatize the management of the Pennsylvania Lottery, sell the state's liquor stores, and provide nearly $15 million to train about 300 new state police troopers.

The source, who asked not to be identified, told Reuters the company's second round of big layoffs in a year would be close to a range of 10 percent to 20 percent. Technology blogs including CNET and All Things D reported earlier that AMD could cut between 20 percent and 30 percent of its workforce. As of February, AMD had 11,705 employees worldwide. Citing sources, All Things D reported that AMD could announce the cuts next week, that they could include employees from engineering and sales, and could be deep enough to require AMD to scale back some products. AMD declined to comment. Like its larger rival Intel, AMD was caught flat-footed in recent years with the emergence and fast growth of mobile devices like Apple's (AAPL.O) iPad. Tablets and smartphones, once considered a niche market by Intel (INTC.O) and others, are fast gaining consumer acceptance and eating into the sales of laptops and desktop computers, while a slowing global economy is dampening spending in general. On Thursday, AMD warned that its third-quarter revenue likely fell about 10 percent from the previous quarter. AMD is due to report its financial results on October 18. AMD and Intel have been slow to adapt their PC chip designs to mobile. But while Intel has poured its massive resources into efforts to catch up to smartphone chipmakers like Qualcomm, AMD has yet to define a clear mobile strategy. The chipmaker has also been plagued by execution setbacks that have led to a loss of market share to Intel and to graphic chip rival Nvidia (NVDA.O). Last year, the company appointed a new Chief Executive Office, Rory Read, and one of his first major moves was to announce a plan in November to slash 10 percent of its workforce to save about $200 million in operating costs. Shares of AMD were up 0.72 percent in after hours trade. They closed down 14.37 percent at $2.74 earlier on Friday, hammered by the company's revenue warning the day before.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hewlettpackard-research-idUSBRE84N0QW20120524","Analysts back Hewlett Packard's layoff plans","","May 24, 2012 /  12:05 PM / 5 years ago","","(Reuters) - Analysts said Hewlett Packard Co's plan to cut jobs was a step in the right direction but the PC maker will have to do more to regain investors' confidence. Shares of the world's No. 1 personal computer maker were up 6 percent at $22.26 in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday. While we certainly don't believe HP has resolved all their issues, we do see the company moving in the right direction, RBC Capital Markets LLC analyst Amit Daryanani wrote in a note to clients. The accelerating popularity of mobile computing devices such as Apple Inc's iPad has been eroding PC sales for years and a downturn in the European markets has just added to the pressure. Rival Dell gave a disappointing revenue forecast Earlier this week that spurred fears that global tech spending is weakening faster than anticipated. HP said the layoff of 27,000 workers, or 8 percent of its workforce, would be made mainly through early retirement and would generate annual savings of $3 billion to $3.5 billion as it exits fiscal year 2014. The company employs more than 300,000 people globally. Hewlett Packard, which also posted a second-quarter profit above market estimates, said it expects to use the cost savings from job cuts to drive organic growth. The market will likely want to see that the savings are real and tangible in the bottom line before they are diverted to other things, Nomura Equity Research analyst Richard Windsor said in a research report. When one has little faith in a management team, there will be little hope that these savings will ever be properly realized as they will never be properly visible, Windsor said. At least three brokerages raised their price targets on the stock on Thursday. Analysts said it may be too early to predict a sustainable turn, given the deterioration of demand in Europe and secular pressures in many of HP's businesses into the second half of the year. We believe many of HPQ's further risks stem from inconsistent operational execution and recent large acquisitions, which combined with aggressive buy-backs have weakened its balance sheet, said Evercore analyst Rob Cihra. Rival Dell has been diversifying its revenue base in the face of weakened consumer demand, giving up low-margin sales to consumers and moving into higher-margin areas, such as catering to the technology needs of small and medium businesses in the public sector and the healthcare industry. Analysts, however, prefer HP over Dell saying the PC maker's revenue and margins growth will take too long to play out, whereas HP's restructuring will likely help the stock over the next few quarters, despite weak revenue.

The world number three skipped the U.S. Open in September with a leg strain and aborted a comeback bid in Wuhan at the end of last month in the hope of being fit for the elite eight-woman event. Her patience paid off with a typical gritty win. Shaking off rust took a little time in her opening Red Group encounter against Agnieszka Radwanska and despite dropping the first set, Sharapova raised her intensity levels enough to grind out a gutsy 4-6 6-3 6-4 triumph. Well, I haven't completed a match since July, so I think it's always challenging to come back from not one injury, but a few, Sharapova told reporters after surviving a two hour, 48 minute marathon against the tenacious Pole. I've had a lot of starts and stops and I was just really thrilled that despite not playing these last few months and not playing my best tennis, I was facing an opponent that obviously deserved a spot in tournament. I just felt like I was able to take myself to another level physically, which I didn't exactly expect that I would be able to. So I think that was the emotion that I felt out of it. Maria Sharapova of Russia hits a return to Agnieszka Radwanska of Poland during their women's singles tennis match of the WTA Finals at the Singapore Indoor Stadium October 25, 2015.Facing off against a player renowned for her incredible retrieving skills was always likely to be a stamina-sapping test, so Sharapova was impressed by her ability to stay consistent as the clock ticked towards the three hour mark. I thought it was a very physical match. I think this court requires all the matches to be. I think it's on the slower side... points are longer, the 28-year-old said of the Singapore Indoor Stadium surface.

The ball stays low and she can take it quite early and change direction, she added. We had quite a bit of long rallies. There was a lot of running. Right now I feel good. Toes are a little frozen but other than that I'm fine.  One facet of her game that Sharapova needs to work on is cutting down unforced errors when the finishing line is in sight after Radwanska fought back from 5-2 down in the decider to almost level the scores as the Russian wobbled. I felt like my feet were glued on the ground and I wasn't making the small steps to the ball, she admitted.  I wanted to get a free point, go for a big first serve, a big first ball and that's just not... obviously I had to learn from the whole match that was just not very possible. Editing by Toby Davis"
"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-layoffs-preparation-idUSBRE8B614U20121207","Layoff rumors? Gird yourself before the axe falls","","December 7, 2012 /  7:36 PM / 5 years ago","","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Never mind coal. There may be pink slips in some holiday stockings this year. The end of the year can be a dangerous season for employees. As companies make last-minute attempts to adjust payrolls or to meet earnings goals, layoffs tend to pick up. Indeed, as many as 150,000 jobs could disappear in the fourth quarter, up 46 percent from the previous quarter, according to consulting firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc. Citigroup Inc employees know this all too well. The third-largest U.S. bank announced 11,000 job cuts worldwide, affecting 4 percent of its work force, Wednesday. It's easy to panic as rumors of layoffs fly at the office. Anger, fear and confusion can cloud final days that would be better spent preserving your professional reputation and contacting possible future employers. So, cancel the bridge-burning email and don't waste time stocking up on pens and paper clips from the supply cabinet. Instead, take these two steps immediately: Network like crazy, and start working on the most favorable exit package possible. That's what David Berman wishes he had done when he lost his senior financial adviser post at Morgan Stanley Smith Barney in mid-2011. I still believed that I had people fighting for me on the inside, says Berman, who is based in St. Petersburg, Florida. I was wrong. In hindsight, I was not aggressive enough. Among other things, Berman regrets not having used LinkedIn.com, the online networking site, to find connections and advice. And he's still looking for a full-time job. Here's how you can gird yourself for the best possible outcome if the axe falls. Be Prepared Knowing weeks ahead of a job loss can have its benefits. Use this time to prepare for your severance meeting with your boss or human resources specialist. It can bring months more of paid health insurance or a longer severance pay period. Go in with a list of questions, says Brooklyn, New York, executive coach Elaine Weinstein, who runs her own firm. Weinstein recommends these: -Is there a severance and how long does it last? -When does it begin? -Is it a lump sum and who pays taxes? -What are your health benefits? -Do they last as long as severance pay? -When they end, who will notify you about beginning Cobra? -What happens to your 401(k) retirement plan? Make the firm explain in its own words why you're being let go. You can use this terminology when you apply for a new job, if it is favorable. And, depending on your relationship with your employer and your company's rules, you may be able to walk out with a letter of recommendation, too. You will probably receive papers to sign. Don't sign them immediately, but ask how long you have to review them. Threatening to call a lawyer may not be prudent, but it doesn't hurt to suggest - obliquely - that you might consult one, says Weinstein. You can say something like, I'm very disappointed in this package. I have to think about this and think about my next actions, suggests Weinstein. Always ask for more: A longer severance, longer paid health insurance, or a paid career counseling service. Fight for it, says Weinstein. All they can do is say 'no.' Contacts, and Contact Details If you don't have a personal cell phone or computer, get one, and transfer your contacts to your new equipment, says Weinstein. Once you leave the company, it won't be possible to access those systems or documents again. Consider adding your personal email address to your email signature, as appropriate. Most companies will allow employees a health care coverage grace period, so you may not need to schedule all your doctors appointments immediately. Still, if it takes time to see a medical specialist, make those appointments now. Immediately activate your business network, Weinstein says. Reach out to professional and personal contacts, even if you have not spoken to them in years. Admit that you may have been sloppy about staying in touch, but say you would like to reestablish communication. Break the ice by offering to help them. Weinstein suggests a humorous approach, such as: 'Other than babysitting, let me know if I can help you in any way.' Seek Employment (While Employed) In September, New Jersey insurance consultant, Lori Sternthal, learned how valuable a network can be. When the senior business analyst learned that her contract would end within weeks, she reached out to recruiters, friends and business contacts, using LinkedIn.com, phone calls and emails - using her personal phone and computer and not those of her client's. A recruiter located a full-time staff position and Sternthal was at a new desk within nine weeks. Recruiters prefer to find someone who is currently employed, says Cobb. Otherwise they can't justify their fee, he says. That makes these precious few weeks remaining at your job vital for reaching recruiters. No matter how angry, upset or worried you might be, remain positive, says Sternthal. She suggests job seekers say something like, I had a great experience at the company, but I'm in transition and open to new opportunities. You could say you're open to both staff or contract work. You'll be surprised how many people will offer help when they learn you're about to lose your job, says Weinstein. It's survivor guilt.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-goldman-earnings-idUSBRE90F0RJ20130116","Goldman boosts returns to shareholders through layoffs","","January 16, 2013 /  12:58 PM / 5 years ago","","(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) paid a smaller portion of its revenue to employees in 2012, signaling that management at the top Wall Street bank may be listening to shareholders calling for cost controls and higher returns. The investment bank and asset manager said fourth-quarter earnings nearly tripled as it set aside less of its revenue for pay and earned more from trading. For the full year, employees were paid just 37.9 percent of the bank's revenue, the second-lowest proportion since Goldman went public in 1999. We don't look to overpay anybody, said Harvey Schwartz, a Goldman Sachs trading executive who will become the bank's chief financial officer at the end of this month. Even if a smaller share of revenue went to employees, Goldman Sachs managed to increase average employee pay last year because it laid off staff and took in more revenue. In other words, the bank's remaining employees were more productive, but much of the benefit went to shareholders. Analysts said other banks are likely to feel pressure to keep their compensation expenses in check after Goldman's results. But for Morgan Stanley (MS.N), the second-biggest stand-alone U.S. investment bank, paying out a lower percentage of its revenue to employees could be tough because analysts believe its revenue fell last year. Goldman missed the worst pitfalls of the financial crisis but has suffered public relations embarrassments from trades it executed during the crisis and from executives' comments afterward. The bank is struggling to figure out how to navigate the post-crisis world, in which clients trade less and regulations and capital rules crimp profits in many businesses. Layoffs, Pay Cuts With many banks facing the same problems, analysts expect layoffs across Wall Street. Morgan Stanley plans 1,600 job cuts in 2013, while Goldman cut 900 jobs in 2012, equal to about 3 percent of its work force. But laying staff off will not be enough, and employee pay will likely fall too, analysts said. Brad Hintz, a former Morgan Stanley treasurer who is now an analyst at Bernstein Research, estimates that across Wall Street average pay in trading businesses could fall 20 percent. There's only one way to get returns up on Wall Street, and that's to cut the compensation of the employees, Hintz said. Investors have been pressuring banks to pay less of their revenue to employees. In 2011, investors pressed Morgan Stanley executives to pay somewhere closer to 30 percent of the bank's revenue to employees, instead of around 50 percent, according to one person at those meetings. Goldman posted fourth-quarter earnings of $2.8 billion, or $5.60 per share, up from $978 million, or $1.84 per share, in the same period a year ago. Analysts' average earnings forecast was $3.78 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange near the Goldman Sachs stall July 16, 2010.Brendan McDermidReturn on Equity Rises Setting aside less money for pay helped Goldman post a return on equity of 16.5 percent for the fourth quarter on an annualized basis, the highest level in almost three years. The figure is closely watched by investors as a measure of how well the company is wringing profit from shareholders' equity. In the fourth quarter of 2011, the annualized return on equity was 5.8 percent, but before the crisis that figure often topped 30 percent. On a conference call, Goldman's Schwartz said that what put the bank in a position to boost its return on equity were the steps we took over the last two years in terms of managing expenses and being quite disciplined. Goldman shares rose $5.50 or 4 percent to $141.09. A significant part of Goldman's earnings boom came from improvements in market values in the stock and bond markets, as well as increased activity from clients. The bank said it took in significantly higher revenues from credit products and mortgages in its bond-trading business. Its investing and lending division, which earns money mostly from higher values on Goldman's stock and bond investments, reported nearly $2 billion worth of revenue in the fourth quarter, compared with $872 million a year earlier. But gains were broad, with revenue up across each of Goldman's business lines, from investment banking to investment management. Overall, revenue jumped 53 percent to $9.2 billion. The bank said compensation expense, typically the biggest cost for Wall Street firms, fell 11 percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier. The expense was just 21 percent of net revenue, roughly half of what the firm usually pays out to employees. For the full year, the bank paid employees just 37.9 percent of revenue, the lowest percentage since 2009's 35.8 percent. That year was a record for earnings, but for the last five years the figure has averaged closer to 42 percent. In 2011, the figure was 42.4 percent. On average, Goldman employees earned $399,506 apiece in 2012, up from $367,057 in 2011. Separately, the bank agreed to pay $330 million in cash and other assistance to troubled mortgage borrowers to end a case-by-case review of foreclosures required by regulators. The settlement stems from the Litton Loan Servicing business that Goldman bought in 2007 and sold in 2011. Other big banks reporting results on Wednesday were JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) and BNY Mellon Corp (BK.N). Both firms reported an increase in earnings.

As of today, the staffing issues remain and, in some divisions, also the issues of labor costs, the company said in a statement, confirming what trade union sources had said. Telecom Italia has 66,000 employees, of which 53,000 are in Italy, where its business has long been struggling. The group has delayed investments in an effort to cut its 27-billion euro ($30 billion) debt, exacerbating the impact of Italy's three-year economic recession on its domestic operations. Telecom Italia met trade union representatives on Thursday at the industry ministry as the government tries to broker an agreement. A new meeting is scheduled on July 29. But the job cuts and a decision to move employees in charge of customer services to the newly created Telecom Caring unit have angered unions. As long as the plan to turn the customer services division into a (separate) company remains on the table, the SLC CGIL (union) will not start a negotiation, Massimo Cestaro, secretary general of the left-wing union, said in a statement. The Uilcom union also opposes the plan, which affects around 9,000 people working at Telecom Italia's call centers, Secretary General Salvo Ugliarolo said.

In a television interview, Hollande said a government rescue plan for the ailing car sector due to be announced on July 25 would include public incentives to encourage consumers to purchase French-made, environmentally friendly cars. He ruled out, however, a return to the scrappage subsidies introduced in the 2009 financial crisis by former conservative President Nicolas Sarkozy, which he said had cost the taxpayer dearly and had often been spent on foreign-made vehicles. However, he admitted he could not halt Peugeot's plant to stop production at the Aulnay assembly plant near Paris in 2014. Hollande, who won power in May with a promise to tackle high unemployment and halt France's steady industrial decline, acknowledged Peugeot (PEUP.PA) had economic reasons for making the cuts. The company said last week its manufacturing arm is losing 200 million euros ($244.88 million) a month. However, the plan in its current condition is not acceptable. It must be renegotiated, Hollande said, adding he wanted to make sure voluntary redundancy packages or new jobs were found for all workers. We want to open discussions so that there are no straight firings at Peugeot. Peugeot has so far said it will find jobs within the group for 1,500 of the workers concerned, with a further 3,600 workers offered voluntary redundancy until 2013. Related CoverageFrance considering raising CSG social charge: HollandeThe Peugeot announcement came as Hollande faces scrutiny over billions of euros in tax rises to hit a deficit target this year - with the prospect of worse to come in 2013 - and struggles to fulfill a campaign pledge to bring down France's highest unemployment rate in 12 years. The shock announcement from Europe's second-largest carmaker last week revived memories of former Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin's failure to halt Renault's (RENA.PA) closure of its Vilvoorde plant in Belgium after winning power in 1997. Jospin's admission the state cannot do everything is credited with helping to sink his 2002 presidential bid. The state will not stand idly by, Hollande said, asked if his government would follow Jospin's route.

The Geneva Motor Show will take place form March 8 to 18, 2012.Denis BalibouseExerting Pressure Hollande said the government had means of exerting pressure and could provide credit to ensure Peugeot stuck to its commitment to see Aulnay remains an industrial site. He dismissed a call from Peugeot Chief Executive Philippe Varin for the state to cut the heavy social charges weighing on labor costs, which the executive said made manufacturing uncompetitive. It's too easy to blame labor costs. There were bad strategic choices, Hollande said. There were delays in taking difficult decisions and shareholders who were too hungry for dividends when investment should have been the priority. Hollande's government has said it will consider steps such as lowering social charges on labor as part of a competitiveness review headed by former EADS EAD.PA Chief Executive Louis Gallois due to be completed in October. That will come too late, however, to defuse the current crisis in the car sector. The president accused Peugeot of misleading public opinion by concealing its plans until after presidential and legislative elections in May and June. A company spokesman declined comment. There was both a lie - this plan was not announced although it was already on the agenda - and a deliberate delay until after the elections, Hollande said. Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault will announce incentives on July 25 for buying French vehicles as part of a package to support the sector, Hollande said. In France, we have an industry which has taken the lead in making clean vehicles and hybrid vehicles. We should make sure these type of vehicles have the advantage, he said. State and regional governments would buy these vehicles to give them a boost, Hollande said, while credit would be made available for research to boost industrial innovation. We will create a plan which costs as little as possible to the taxpayer and is as effective as possible, said Hollande.

We will spend less in virtually every area except schools in fiscal 2013, he said in a televised address that stressed the urgency of cutting soaring pension costs. The bottom line, I think, is that it's a responsible budget, he said, insisting that he was working to keep the city safe, to keep the city attractive and growing, and to continue to make the kinds of long-term investments that will keep this city growing. Bloomberg, a political independent now in his third and final term, has regularly demanded that city agencies do more with less. The new budget plan is partly balanced with the $1 billion in cuts he ordered in November. He defended the 11 rounds of spending cuts he has made over the last few years, saying the quality of city services has not been impaired. It would be pretty hard to find many agencies that are not doing a heck of a lot of a better job than they did in 2002, he said. A small number of non-uniformed workers will be laid off under the plan, he said. The city has cut its work force by 20,500 positions since 2002, largely via attrition. Bloomberg last year had proposed laying off 4,000 teachers. Although New York's tax revenue has staged a slow recovery from recession lows, Bloomberg remained cautious. The city likely will only get an extra $111 million in the current fiscal year, he said, while revenue should rise $278 million the following year. We expect the recovery of all the jobs lost in 2008 by the end of 2012, Bloomberg added. The city-funded $50.7 billion part of the budget plan is down 1.9 percent on a year-over year basis. The rest of the budget, funded by the state and federal governments, will rise by $2 billion. Spending on capital projects over the next five years would increase nearly $700 million to $39.4 billion under the plan. New York City, along with many states, cities and towns, is struggling to afford workers' pension and health-care benefits. Bloomberg said the city's pension contribution will have soared nearly 500 percent to $8 billion from fiscal 2002 to fiscal 2013. We are already paying out more in pension and health benefits than we do in salaries and it is going to get worse, he said. The rest of the budget gap is being closed with $1 billion from the sale of new taxi medallions. Bloomberg's proposed budget plan is benefiting from a change in estimated pension costs. The city actuary's proposals for the cost of the $110 billion pension fund came in at $850 million less than the $2 billion that was expected for this year and the following year. The actuary's proposals include cutting the assumed investment rate of return to 7 percent from 8 percent, which raises the city's contribution. But the actuary's other recommendations will save the city $850 million this year and the next year, instead of costing it $2 billion. Bloomberg said the estimated investment rate should be even lower. The fund over the past decade has only earned an average annual return of 5.6 percent, he said. An even smaller return rate would force the city to contribute more, sparing future taxpayers. Several years ago, credit analysts applauded Bloomberg for being the first politician to set aside money for retiree health-care costs, which are expected to cost the city more than $50 billion. But after taking $1 billion out of the fund last year, he is withdrawing the remaining $1 billion this year. Comptroller John Liu, a Democrat, said the plan relies too much on one-shots -- steps that only raise money for one year. Also under the plan, the city would lose 20 fire companies, a measure that drew fire from both the City Council speaker, Christine Quinn, and Public Advocate Bill de Blasio, both Democrats. De Blasio also faulted the mayor -- whose signature issue is education -- for refusing to invest the necessary resources in Head Start, universal pre-kindergarten and child care. And Quinn said she was concerned about major cuts planned for after-school programs, libraries and museums, and a reduction in the chief medical examiner's resources.

Unfortunately, a close review of the company's operations makes it clear that the level of inefficiency throughout Sharp means that a turnaround ... can only take place if there is a reduction in costs, and that comes with a very regrettable need to reduce Sharp's workforce, Gou wrote in an open letter, seen by Reuters, to Sharp staff late on Thursday. Sharp earlier reported its annual losses trebled from a year earlier. Taiwan's Foxconn, the world's largest contract electronics manufacturer, has battled to seal a $3.5 billion deal to give it a two-thirds stake in Sharp as the Japanese display maker seeks a return to profit in the face of slowing smartphone sales. The letter said staff cuts would be carried out responsibly and sensitively, but didn't provide figures. A person familiar with the matter said cuts could total 3,000 in Japan, and more when Sharp's global operations are included. Foxconn confirmed the letter was a personal note to all Sharp employees from Gou and Tai Jeng-wu, Foxconn's vice chairman and the newly-appointed CEO at Sharp. Sharp named Tai on Thursday to succeed Kozo Takahashi, becoming the first outsider to lead a company that started out making belt buckles and mechanical pencils a century ago.

A takeover by Foxconn should help Sharp expand sales channels for its displays. In return, Foxconn will gain control of Sharp's advanced display technology, and strengthen its pricing power with Apple Inc, a major client of both companies. Foxconn's display-making affiliate Innolux Corp will also benefit from cooperation with Sharp, Innolux Chairman H.C. Tuan said on Thursday. Tuan, who announced his resignation, will take on a role as technology adviser to both  Innolux and Sharp, Foxconn said. Even with Foxconn's support, Sharp will find it tough competing with Chinese display makers aggressively expanding capacity, analysts said. Sharp also lags South Korean rivals in organic light-emitting diode (OLED) technology, which Apple is widely expected to adopt in future iPhones. Gou, though, has expressed a preference for Sharp's strength in indium gallium zinc oxide (IGZO) technology. IGZO is Sharp's pride, said Tuan. I'm hopeful we can cooperate with Sharp in this area. For the year to end-March, Sharp reported an operating loss of 162 billion yen ($1.5 billion), more than triple the previous year's loss. Takahashi said an over-reliance on smartphones was partly to blame. We've failed to move fast enough to shift focus to larger panels, he said. Apple posted its first drop in iPhone sales in January-March, and, in figures issued on Thursday, Foxconn's quarterly net profit fell 9.2 percent from a year ago to T$27.58 billion  ($847 million). Its January-March revenue slipped 5.5 percent. Foxconn subsidiary FIH Mobile Ltd, whose clients include Sony and Xiaomi Inc [XTC.UL], has warned its first-half profit may fall as much as 92 percent as smartphone sales growth slows to a single digit this year.

Athens has designated thousands of public sector workers for possible dismissal to qualify for further bailout funding as an inspection by European Union, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund officials begins on Sunday. The so-called mobility scheme, where workers will be evaluated and either transferred to other jobs or dismissed, has met fierce resistance from unions, that fear firings will worsen the plight of families hurt by a six-year recession. Teachers will stay away from work on Monday and Tuesday, and their union said it would meet on Wednesday to decide if it needs to take further action. Civil servants will strike on Tuesday and Wednesday. Both sets of workers also held strikes this week. A total of 25,000 workers must be placed in the scheme by year-end under the terms of Greece's EU/IMF bailout, and the government must also meet a target of 15,000 mandatory exits in 2013-2014 to shrink its bloated public sector. Firing workers is an acutely sensitive issue in Greece, where unemployment has climbed to nearly 28 percent and poverty levels have soared after six years of recession. High school teachers have repeatedly walked off the job to protest against the government's plans. The conservative-led coalition invoked emergency powers in May to prevent a strike that would have disrupted university entrance exams. Officials from the EU/IMF/ECB troika of lenders will meet Greek finance minister Hyannis Stournaras on Sunday to assess progress made on promised reforms, the finance ministry said.

Although we continue to pursue various avenues, it is possible that adverse developments could ultimately result in the closure of the firm, which would result in the termination of your employment, the firm said in a letter to employees that was obtained by Reuters. Angelo Kakolyris, a spokesman for the firm, declined to comment. The firm issued the notification under a federal law known as the WARN Act and similar state laws that require employers to notify workers of mass layoffs in advance. The federal WARN Act requires employers with 100-plus employees to give them 60 days' notice, while New York's WARN Act requires employers with 50 or more workers to give at least 90 days' notice. Although we continue to pursue various avenues, it is possible that adverse developments could ultimately result in the closure of the firm, the letter said. Dewey & LeBoeuf, once one of the biggest law firms in the United States, has been struggling this year with growing debt, declining revenue and partner defections, which continued unabated on Friday. Related CoverageU.S. law firm Dewey warns of impending layoffsSince January, the firm has lost at least 120 of its 300 partners amid a mounting debt crisis. It has tried and failed to find a merger partner. Employees leaving Dewey's offices in midtown New York on Friday declined to talk to a reporter. Workers from a local moving company called Moishe's loaded about two dozen boxes labeled Dewey & LeBoeuf early on Friday evening before driving away. A Facebook site set up to help Dewey attorneys and staff find jobs grew to 220 members on Friday afternoon. Earlier on Friday, another source close to the situation said that Dewey & LeBoeuf had dismissed Executive Director Stephen DiCarmine within the last week. DiCarmine has retained a prominent criminal defense lawyer, the source said. Last week, the firm informed its partners that the New York District Attorney launched an investigation into allegations of wrongdoing by former Chairman Steven Davis. No allegations of wrongdoing have been brought against DiCarmine. The reasons for his termination couldn't be determined. Davis has denied any wrongdoing and DiCarmine did not return phone calls seeking comment. DiCarmine has hired Edward Little, a former federal prosecutor in Manhattan, according to the source, who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter. Little, a partner at law firm Hughes Hubbard & Reed, declined to comment on whether he had been hired in connection with the DA probe. Defections from the firm decimated its overseas offices on Friday, with a wave of departures in Britain, Germany, Kazakhstan, UAE and Russia. Dewey's options could include an out-of-court wind-down or a bankruptcy, whether voluntary or forced by its creditors, bankruptcy experts said. Earlier this week, Dewey denied any plans to file for bankruptcy. Industry experts say a filing would be expensive and unlikely to salvage the firm, but could provide an efficient legal framework for Dewey to collect receivables from departed partners. People who are owed money by Dewey have already begun seeking to sell their claims to third parties on a secondary market at a heavy discount, said Kevin Starke, a bankruptcy analyst with CRT Capital Group, a brokerage that specializes in distressed securities. When businesses are insolvent or close to it, their stakeholders, fearing they will not be paid fully or on time, commonly sell their claims at a discount to institutional buyers in an effort to recover some money. In Dewey's case, sellers will likely include trade vendors, suppliers and other service providers who may have receivables against the firm, Starke said. A market for receivables is shaping up around 10-to-15 cents on the dollar, he said.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-peugeot-layoffs-insight-idUSBRE9B30BP20131204","France vs U.S. in a tale of two layoffs","","December 4, 2013 /  10:37 AM / 4 years ago","","(This accompanies a Special Report on PSA Peugeot Citroen: link.reuters.com/ref25v) By Nicholas Vinocur and Bernie Woodall PARIS/DETROIT (Reuters) - Five years after Jeffrey Hand took a $100,000 buyout to leave Ford Motors, the U.S. auto industry has surged back to profit and is once again hiring. Hand, who has spent the years living on his payout, has now applied to work at an auto parts supplier a few hours away from his old factory near Dearborn, Michigan. Across the Atlantic, father-of-three Hassan Chnaiti took a buyout from French carmaker Peugeot earlier this year, as it prepared to close his plant near Paris. But having pocketed his severance pay, he will soon start work as a public bus driver, thanks to a job placement scheme funded by his former employer. Peugeot gave me a chance, said Chnaiti, a 34-year-old immigrant from Morocco with French nationality, who had worked his way up to the rank of supervisor. But I don't see much of a future in this business for me. Though separated by 6,000 km (3,700 miles), Hand and Chnaiti have much in common. Both spent more than a decade building cars and were squeezed as their respective firms, saddled with high labor costs in ever more competitive markets, fought to regain an edge. Both their employers resisted a bailout from the state. And both men accepted buyouts to leave a company they referred to as their family. But the differences between their stories - some of them unexpected - highlight fundamental contrasts between running a business in the United States and France. Hand, a talkative midwesterner, received almost double the lump sum that Chnaiti collected in Paris; indeed, the average severance paid by Ford in 2008 for its departing staff was markedly higher than the sum Peugeot has budgeted per worker this past year, a Reuters analysis has found. Despite, or perhaps because of this, Ford in the United States had a much easier time laying people off than Peugeot. Ford announced its major restructuring in 2006. Two years on, it had closed eight plants and laid off nearly 40,000 workers. Over the 17 months since Peugeot began its restructuring in July 2012, the French firm is set to close just one plant and is struggling to reduce headcount by just over 11,000, though it says more cuts may be necessary. That makes it harder for the firm to reinvent itself. One key difference has been in the companies' dealings with trade unions. Ford, where manufacturing personnel are represented by the United Auto Workers union, positioned itself for a rebound. The union agreed to a two-tier pay system which has since allowed Ford to pay new hires a lower hourly wage, with reduced health benefits and less advantageous pensions. Ford is hiring again. Peugeot has been hit by strikes. Public opinion, including the government, was immediately hostile to what will be the first closure of a large French car plant since 1992. Eventually, unions agreed a wage freeze for a company pledge to close no more plants for three years. That deal helps existing workers, but it leaves Peugeot saddled with unused capacity in a shrinking European market - the very problem the restructuring was meant to address. The French firm says it is using just 61 percent of its domestic manufacturing capacity, but Ford says its North America plants are running at 135 percent, because it has added shifts to the standard working day. Some lines now operate around the clock, while others are working six days a week. In 2005, the company said it was using about 88 percent of its North American capacity. Of course, there are many other differences between the two companies, and direct comparisons don't take into account such important factors as the size of the market, costs and standards of living, plus other benefits that are available. But where Hand in Detroit aims to return to the auto business, Chnaiti is moving on. I've turned the page, he says. End of the Line Hand, 47, who had worked for Ford for 14 years when he took his buyout, said that when he and thousands of colleagues received the offer, it was an easy choice. Assembly line work is very, very boring, he said. And you can't leave the line to take a break just when you want to. If you have to go to the bathroom, it doesn't matter. You have to wait until the next break. He was offered a range of severance packages, including full-time university or vocational school retraining of $15,000 for tuition a year, for up to four years, and an annual stipend worth half pay. Some Ford workers went to Oxford and Harvard, but Hand took the most popular option: a cash payment. Because he was not eligible to retire, he got $100,000 plus continuing health care for six months in return for a vow to give up post-retirement benefits other than the pension he had accrued. He was helped by the fact he has no dependants and has been living rent-free in his parents' former home. He likes to work on house improvements. In France, Chnaiti left Peugeot with 13 years under his belt and 40,000 euros - $54,000 - including overtime, holiday pay and a statutory legal payout. On top of that, he decided to re-train as a bus driver, which Peugeot funded at an average cost of 10,000 euros. His healthcare and pension allowance are covered by France's existing state systems. The two cases are, roughly, representative of the programs at each firm. Ford says its average cost per worker was $100,000 which does not include healthcare or pensions. Peugeot declined to provide an average per worker, but a spokeswoman said total restructuring costs were due to reach 600 million euros by the end of 2013. That sum divided by the 11,200 workers who are due to go is 53,571 euros, or about $72,000 each. The Peugeot spokeswoman said the budgeted 600 million euros includes other costs linked to the shutdown. That implies Peugeot's actual severance cost per worker is probably lower. Consensus The most crucial difference lies not in the workers' experience, but in the companies'. Ford's layoffs over two years affected nearly one in two of its factory workers across the United States. Peugeot's overhaul is much smaller: Cuts it has announced so far show the company wants to reduce its French headcount by about 17 percent, or about 2 percent of all those employed in the auto industry in France. Even though Ford's cuts were much bigger, and painful for all involved, there were no strikes. Marty Mulloy, vice president for labor relations at Ford, said it was helped by the fact the UAW understood its perilous financial situation in 2006: Without a sweeping reorganization, unveiled that year under the name Way Forward, the company would have gone bankrupt. The UAW talked with Ford throughout the restructuring process. They were very cooperative in what we had to do at the end of the day, Mulloy said of the UAW. The union did not respond to requests for comment. Ford promised that no one would be forced out, though some workers did have to move homes for work. It also used the talks to press the UAW into accepting plans for a new wage scale. This helped the firm hire new people for nearly half the rate they had been paying veteran line workers. It takes about a year for the company to recoup the expense of a buyout, Mulloy said. Fight To the End Like Ford, Peugeot pledged no worker would be forced out. But after its plans were announced, Chnaiti described the atmosphere at his Aulnay-sous-Bois plant as explosive. The leaders of the CGT and FO unions vowed to fight to the end to force Peugeot to keep the plant running. French Industry Minister Arnaud Montebourg criticized Peugeot's plans in parliament, although he said later job cuts were inevitable. After a series of protests gathering all unions, hard-line leaders staged an occupation of a factory facility in early 2013 that lasted five months. At the heart of the dispute was the strikers' contention that Peugeot did not really need to close the factory. Philippe Julien, a leader of the CGT union at the plant, argued that the company still had plenty of money to keep operating it. It was management and not workers who should pay for strategic errors, he said. If the Peugeot brothers (key shareholders) had been less obsessed with spending on dividends, they would have made better decisions, Julien said. As it stands, they are the ones who should lose their jobs, not the workers. The Peugeot family declined to comment, but the company said it had no choice: The firm was burning 200 million euros a month. Peugeot sources at Aulnay argued that workers were merely seeking to raise the stakes for when it came to negotiate their severance pay. Management and the strikers even filed criminal charges against each other. It was only when a long-serving Human Resources director, Philippe Dorge, was called in from another plant that the deadlock was broken. For the 200 or so strikers, the compensation was a one-time payment from Peugeot of 19,700 euros, on top of normal severance pay, although strikers forfeited the right to vocational training. Peugeot declined to say how much the dispute had cost. The strikes cost Peugeot money - but even then, it was more a question of image for the company, said Fabien Berruyer, head of a human resources consultancy specializing in the auto sector. For a Franco-French brand like Peugeot, the perception that workers are being fired to please shareholders can actually hurt sales. Win-Win When Peugeot's strike ended in May, the company spent 10 million euros turning Aulnay into a giant job placement centre, complete with motivational posters, classrooms and interviews with potential recruiters. It's win-win, said Chnaiti, as he received his certification as a bus driver. But I'm one of the lucky ones here - a lot of other people didn't get the job they wanted. In July this year, Peugeot took steps to ease the tension. As a condition of a state guarantee for a major loan, it planned more frequent talks with unions and opened up two board seats for union members on its supervisory board - a first for Peugeot, but a measure Renault has already used to seek consensus. The result was a deal announced in October: Unions accepted a one-year wage freeze in exchange for company promises to keep three factories open in France. Yet with sales continuing to fall in Peugeot's main European markets, Peugeot's outgoing Chief Executive Philippe Varin is considering idling more production lines. In Detroit, Hand's payout and savings are running low. Eight years from now, he expects between $800 and $900 in monthly pension payouts from Ford. But he says he's not counting on that much - pension plans like his, which give an idea what payments retirees can expect, are coming under increasing pressure across the United States.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-jobs-reentry-idUSBRE8B60VF20121207","Rebooting your career after a long layoff","","December 7, 2012 /  4:26 PM / 5 years ago","","NEW YORK (Reuters) - As any astronaut will tell you, re-entry is the trickiest and most dangerous part of space flight. The same might be said about returning jobseekers. Despite the challenges of increased competition and gap-filled resumes, more people who left the workforce, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, are coming back into it, according to the U.S. Labor Department. And they have not always found it easy to reboot careers that may have stalled in the last recession. In October, there were 3.3 million Americans who had re-entered the workforce, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Some of those people had been laid off and discouraged; others may have taken breaks to care for kids or elderly parents, or even retired and then thought better of it. Whatever their reasons, they may find the going tough. Just ask Dixie Morse. The Cambridge, Massachusetts, mother of two spent 17 years raising her sons and being the trailing spouse as her husband worked in financial services in London and Brussels. When her kids reached high school, she was able to land a job as a trainer at financial giant Sun Life - but not before 10 months of what she calls banging my head against the wall. I was surprised at how hard it was to come back, says Morse, 54. As soon as people saw my resume with a big hole in it, I got weeded out. To recruiters, all that time didn't seem to count as real. People re-entering the workforce, like Morse, have shown up in some recent jobs reports. In October, the U.S. unemployment rate ticked up 0.1 percentage points to 7.9 percent, even as employers added 171,000 jobs for the month, because the number of people joining or re-entering the workforce was growing faster than the jobs listings. In November, the jobless rate dropped to 7.7 percent as there were fewer people entering the labor force than the 146,000 jobs created, the Labor Department reported on Friday. In fact, in economic recoveries the unemployment rate usually rises a bit, because people are looking for work again, says Philippa Dunne of The Liscio Report, an economic research firm. People who were discouraged and had essentially dropped out of the labor force see their friends getting jobs and start trying again themselves. The number of discouraged workers - those who have given up looking for work because they do not think they can find a job and thus are not counted in the workforce - has fallen, though not in a straight line, to 979,000 in November from roughly 1.2 million in 2010, the Labor Department said. When people do return to the workforce, they are finding plenty of competition, even from retirees. A survey by brokerage firm Charles Schwab & Co found that 9.5 million retired people were considering re-entering the labor force. That is what Hank Smith did. The 57-year-old from Wiggins, Colorado, retired in 2010 after 26 years as a postmaster, plotting what he wanted to do with the years ahead. The answer: He wanted to go back to work. Smith got certified as a nursing assistant, and after a year out of the workforce, is now a transportation coordinator who helps older people get to their doctor's appointments. I didn't want to just sit around for the rest of my life, he says. By choosing a profession that is in increasing demand, Smith was able to manage his re-entry successfully. Here are some other key strategies: - Rebuild your network. The biggest challenge is that you become professionally disconnected and lose track of your network, says Carol Fishman Cohen, founder of career re-entry firm iRelaunch. Re-establish casual contact through social media like Facebook or LinkedIn, and ask your former colleagues for informational meetings rather than pleading for a gig. - Refresh your skills with targeted coursework. Especially in fields like information technology or engineering, it is easy for your skills to become outdated within a few years. Even if you are not going back to school for a full-fledged degree, certifications in key areas - like cutting-edge programming languages, say - will let hiring managers know you can hit the ground running. - Volunteer at relevant organizations. You are helping the world, sure. But you are also assembling a portfolio of work that will help bridge lengthy time gaps on your resume. If you're looking to manage construction projects, do a weekend build for Habitat for Humanity, suggests Cohen. If you're a journalist, run a charity's online newsletter. - Get the resume right. A gaping hole is enough to give any hiring manager pause, so fill in that gap for him or her since you presumably were not just sitting on the couch the whole time. As any member of the Sandwich Generation will tell you, raising a child or caring for an infirm parent is perhaps one of the most challenging jobs in America, and those achievements should be celebrated instead of minimized. - Be open to short-term roles. Despite the economic recovery, companies are still reluctant to take on full-timers. Assuage their concerns by suggesting less binding arrangements, like special projects or contract work. That's a very effective strategy for those who feel they retired too early and want to get back in, says Cohen. Suggest it to employers who are hesitant because you've been out of the game, and it gives you an opportunity to show your value and produce a work sample. As for Dixie Morse, she feels fortunate that she was able to re-enter the job market during such difficult economic times. I figured I'd better re-start my career sooner rather than later, Morse says, because with each year, it gets even harder. (The writer is a Reuters contributor. The opinions expressed are his own.)

Peugeot gave me a chance, said Chnaiti, a 34-year-old immigrant from Morocco with French nationality, who had worked his way up to the rank of supervisor. But I don't see much of a future in this business for me. Though separated by 6,000 km (3,700 miles), Hand and Chnaiti have much in common. Both spent more than a decade building cars and were squeezed as their respective firms, saddled with high labour costs in ever more competitive markets, fought to regain an edge. Both their employers resisted a bailout from the state. And both men accepted buyouts to leave a company they referred to as their family. But the differences between their stories - some of them unexpected - highlight fundamental contrasts between running a business in the United States and France. Hand, a talkative midwesterner, received almost double the lump sum that Chnaiti collected in Paris; indeed, the average severance paid by Ford in 2008 for its departing staff was markedly higher than the sum Peugeot has budgeted per worker this past year, a Reuters analysis has found. Despite, or perhaps because of this, Ford in the United States had a much easier time laying people off than Peugeot. Ford announced its major restructuring in 2006. Two years on, it had closed eight plants and laid off nearly 40,000 workers. Over the 17 months since Peugeot began its restructuring in July 2012, the French firm is set to close just one plant and is struggling to reduce headcount by just over 11,000, though it says more cuts may be necessary. That makes it harder for the firm to reinvent itself. One key difference has been in the companies' dealings with trade unions. Ford, where manufacturing personnel are represented by the United Auto Workers union, positioned itself for a rebound. The union agreed to a two-tier pay system which has since allowed Ford to pay new hires a lower hourly wage, with reduced health benefits and less advantageous pensions. Ford is hiring again. Peugeot has been hit by strikes. Public opinion, including the government, was immediately hostile to what will be the first closure of a large French car plant since 1992. Eventually, unions agreed a wage freeze for a company pledge to close no more plants for three years. That deal helps existing workers, but it leaves Peugeot saddled with unused capacity in a shrinking European market - the very problem the restructuring was meant to address. The French firm says it is using just 61 percent of its domestic manufacturing capacity, but Ford says its North America plants are running at 135 percent, because it has added shifts to the standard working day. Some lines now operate around the clock, while others are working six days a week. In 2005, the company said it was using about 88 percent of its North American capacity. Of course, there are many other differences between the two companies, and direct comparisons don't take into account such important factors as the size of the market, costs and standards of living, plus other benefits that are available. But where Hand in Detroit aims to return to the auto business, Chnaiti is moving on. I've turned the page, he says. End of the Line Hand, 47, who had worked for Ford for 14 years when he took his buyout, said that when he and thousands of colleagues received the offer, it was an easy choice. Assembly line work is very, very boring, he said. And you can't leave the line to take a break just when you want to. If you have to go to the bathroom, it doesn't matter. You have to wait until the next break. He was offered a range of severance packages, including full-time university or vocational school retraining of $15,000 for tuition a year, for up to four years, and an annual stipend worth half pay. Some Ford workers went to Oxford and Harvard, but Hand took the most popular option: a cash payment. Because he was not eligible to retire, he got $100,000 plus continuing health care for six months in return for a vow to give up post-retirement benefits other than the pension he had accrued. He was helped by the fact he has no dependants and has been living rent-free in his parents' former home. He likes to work on house improvements. In France, Chnaiti left Peugeot with 13 years under his belt and 40,000 euros - $54,000 - including overtime, holiday pay and a statutory legal payout. On top of that, he decided to re-train as a bus driver, which Peugeot funded at an average cost of 10,000 euros. His healthcare and pension allowance are covered by France's existing state systems. The two cases are, roughly, representative of the programmes at each firm. Ford says its average cost per worker was $100,000 which does not include healthcare or pensions. Peugeot declined to provide an average per worker, but a spokeswoman said total restructuring costs were due to reach 600 million euros by the end of 2013. That sum divided by the 11,200 workers who are due to go is 53,571 euros, or about $72,000 each. The Peugeot spokeswoman said the budgeted 600 million euros includes other costs linked to the shutdown. That implies Peugeot's actual severance cost per worker is probably lower. Consensus The most crucial difference lies not in the workers' experience, but in the companies'. Ford's layoffs over two years affected nearly one in two of its factory workers across the United States. Peugeot's overhaul is much smaller: Cuts it has announced so far show the company wants to reduce its French headcount by about 17 percent, or about 2 percent of all those employed in the auto industry in France. Even though Ford's cuts were much bigger, and painful for all involved, there were no strikes. Marty Mulloy, vice president for labour relations at Ford, said it was helped by the fact the UAW understood its perilous financial situation in 2006: Without a sweeping reorganisation, unveiled that year under the name Way Forward, the company would have gone bankrupt. The UAW talked with Ford throughout the restructuring process. They were very cooperative in what we had to do at the end of the day, Mulloy said of the UAW. The union did not respond to requests for comment. Ford promised that no one would be forced out, though some workers did have to move homes for work. It also used the talks to press the UAW into accepting plans for a new wage scale. This helped the firm hire new people for nearly half the rate they had been paying veteran line workers. It takes about a year for the company to recoup the expense of a buyout, Mulloy said. Fight To the End Like Ford, Peugeot pledged no worker would be forced out. But after its plans were announced, Chnaiti described the atmosphere at his Aulnay-sous-Bois plant as explosive. The leaders of the CGT and FO unions vowed to fight to the end to force Peugeot to keep the plant running. French Industry Minister Arnaud Montebourg criticised Peugeot's plans in parliament, although he said later job cuts were inevitable. After a series of protests gathering all unions, hard-line leaders staged an occupation of a factory facility in early 2013 that lasted five months. At the heart of the dispute was the strikers' contention that Peugeot did not really need to close the factory. Philippe Julien, a leader of the CGT union at the plant, argued that the company still had plenty of money to keep operating it. It was management and not workers who should pay for strategic errors, he said. If the Peugeot brothers (key shareholders) had been less obsessed with spending on dividends, they would have made better decisions, Julien said. As it stands, they are the ones who should lose their jobs, not the workers. The Peugeot family declined to comment, but the company said it had no choice: The firm was burning 200 million euros a month. Peugeot sources at Aulnay argued that workers were merely seeking to raise the stakes for when it came to negotiate their severance pay. Management and the strikers even filed criminal charges against each other. It was only when a long-serving Human Resources director, Philippe Dorge, was called in from another plant that the deadlock was broken. For the 200 or so strikers, the compensation was a one-time payment from Peugeot of 19,700 euros, on top of normal severance pay, although strikers forfeited the right to vocational training. Peugeot declined to say how much the dispute had cost. The strikes cost Peugeot money - but even then, it was more a question of image for the company, said Fabien Berruyer, head of a human resources consultancy specialising in the auto sector. For a Franco-French brand like Peugeot, the perception that workers are being fired to please shareholders can actually hurt sales. Win-Win When Peugeot's strike ended in May, the company spent 10 million euros turning Aulnay into a giant job placement centre, complete with motivational posters, classrooms and interviews with potential recruiters. It's win-win, said Chnaiti, as he received his certification as a bus driver. But I'm one of the lucky ones here - a lot of other people didn't get the job they wanted. In July this year, Peugeot took steps to ease the tension. As a condition of a state guarantee for a major loan, it planned more frequent talks with unions and opened up two board seats for union members on its supervisory board - a first for Peugeot, but a measure Renault has already used to seek consensus. The result was a deal announced in October: Unions accepted a one-year wage freeze in exchange for company promises to keep three factories open in France. Yet with sales continuing to fall in Peugeot's main European markets, Peugeot's outgoing Chief Executive Philippe Varin is considering idling more production lines. In Detroit, Hand's payout and savings are running low. Eight years from now, he expects between $800 and $900 in monthly pension payouts from Ford. But he says he's not counting on that much - pension plans like his, which give an idea what payments retirees can expect, are coming under increasing pressure across the United States. "

TF1 also said it had filed an appeal to the country's highest administrative court to overturn the ruling made by the CSA broadcast regulator.  LCI, which launched 20 years ago as France's first 24-hour news channel, is trailing behind its free-to-air rivals iTele, owned by Canal+, and BFM TV from NextRadioTV. TF1 had hoped for permission to stop charging for the channel so as to attract more viewers and advertisers.  TF1 considers that the future of LCI in its current format can only be envisaged on free television and that it has strong grounds for an appeal, said the company in a statement on Tuesday. But TF1 has so far stopped short of shutting the channel completely, something CEO Nonce Paolini has warned was a possibility. Instead it presented a plan to LCI unions that would shift LCI from a 24-hour news channel to a paid online portal, stocked with video clips and programming. This marks the end of LCI as a real-time news channel to be replaced by a product that for the moment has no certain distribution, Emmanuel Raoul, a union representative at the channel, said. According to the unions, Paolini also said LCI was not for sale.  The owners of French daily Le Monde had earlier expressed interest in buying the channel or some of its assets. In a statement on Tuesday, the owners - industrialist Pierre Berge, telecoms billionaire Xavier Niel and investment banker Matthieu Pigasse - said they remained interested in buying LCI and regretted no discussions had taken place with TF1.  The proposal we made to TF1 called for us to keep onboard all the journalists at LCI, the trio said. We remain at the disposal of TF1, the staff of LCI and the CSA to discuss and finalize such a deal. Writing by Leila Abboud; Editing by Michael Urquhart and David Holmes"

As an Olympic sprinter, it is an occupational hazard she has learned to live with. But surgery has put a halt on her athletic ambitions, at least for now. The 28-year-old took a break after last year's London Olympics to repair a problem in her big toe that had plagued her for years. By her own standards, the American has had to take things slow. Her recovery from an operation, where surgeons shaved two bones on her troublesome big toe, took longer than expected. She only began training three weeks ago, on a special treadmill which reduces the body weight placed on her foot. Richards-Ross was not able to put her spikes on until this week but makes her competitive return at Saturday's Adidas Grand Prix, the New York leg of the Diamond League. The race has attracted a stellar field, featuring the last two Olympic champions and the last three world champions. Right into the fire, just the way I like it, Richards-Ross told a news conference in Manhattan on Thursday. I feel that in order for me to be ready for the world championships I just need to get back on the horse. I just want to see where I'm at so I may as well race the best and hopefully they'll pull me to a great time. For Richards-Ross, Saturday's race is a way for her to gauge her fitness. Her goals are still further down the track. Her first ambition is to make the U.S. team for this year's world championships and build towards the 2016 Rio Olympics. Richards-Ross already has four Olympic gold medals, tying the all-time record for any female in track and field. She was a member of the American relay team that won the 4x400 meters gold at Athens, Beijing and London, and also won the individual 400m title in London last year. I'm not too concerned about my condition here. I just want to get going and get ready for nationals in June and world championships in August. I'm having fun, I have my Olympic gold medals, so I will not get stressed out. While she may have been taking it easy on the track, Sanya has been living the rest of her life in the fast lane. She owns a hair salon in Texas and has been starring in a reality television show, called Glam & Gold, with her husband, a National Football League cornerback who won two Super Bowls with the New York Giants. With four Olympic gold medals already in her possession, she might have been tempted to call it quits after London but said her success has only reinforced her determination to continue. I definitely want to compete for four more years, she said. I'm going through to Rio then I'm going to start having babies. I wasn't sure if I wanted to go past 2008 and go to '12 but now I know for sure. Editing by Frank Pingue"

Eliot's brief career at Lloyds Bank of London, the connections between banking and literature have remained tenuous at best - especially when you narrow the focus to the genre of banking-related fantasy novel parodies. But that did not stop Paul Erickson, a laid-off trainer of tellers and personal bankers for Washington Mutual, from taking an inspired crack at hilarity with The Wobbit: A Parody. With the novel, the 52-year-old from Oak Park, Illinois, twists J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit in a financial funhouse mirror: the dwarves come courtesy of characters he met while training at a variety of financial institutions, including WaMu. The bank's collapse in 2008 constitutes such an epic tale that people still talk about it four years later. Washington Mutual was the poster child for the banking crisis, said Richard Barrington, a senior finance analyst for MoneyRates.com. It was the one that got everybody's attention - the public and the bank regulators. Erickson did not base his Tolkien retake on a blow-by-blow account of the WaMu debacle, but ‘The Hobbit' is an allegory, and it's kind of fitting someone would (find inspiration) in Washington Mutual, Barrington said. It was a cautionary tale, and not in abstract way. With more than 6,000 e-books in circulation, The Wobbit currently ranks 43rd in Amazon.com's ranking of parodies. But that could soon change with Peter Jackson's film The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey due out in December; Erickson hopes to exploit the fortuitous tie-in to the fullest. (Jackson is filming two Hobbit movies back-to-back, the second to be released in 2013; Erickson is working on another Tolkien parody: Superfriends of the Ring.) Soon after The Wobbit went on Amazon, it caught the attention of Carsten Polzin, an editorial director at Piper Verlag in Munich, Germany. His company now plans to release a German-language edition, and has more ambitious plans for The Wobbit as the release of Jackson's film draws near, including the possible sale of English-language rights in North America and elsewhere. I instantly liked Erickson's style and prose; very funny and yet respectful for Tolkien's masterpiece, said Polzin. Nor did the use of bankers as Hobbits throw him. It's most impressive how well they fit in to the story. One wonders how Tolkien could've done without them. Typical Tolkien parodies are a whole lot of jokes about Scottish accents and Oscar Wilde, said Erickson, who first read The Hobbit as an adolescent. I kind of went in an entirely different direction. It was largely 'write what you know.' There's also the sense of history involved, obscure as it is; Erickson's Wobbit is the first parody of a Tolkien book to use bankers as the main protagonists and antagonists, coming courtesy of a laid-off banker. In his five years at WaMu, he was surrounded by numerous creepy creatures. The Bilbo Baggins character (Bulbo Bunkins) is recast as a laid-off bank teller who journeys across a recession-plagued Little Earth. Bunkins' mission: to steal a resentful dragon's treasure and restore the economy. Dwarves, as Tolkien portrays them, are cranky, cheap and hierarchical guys - and everybody's related to somebody else, Erickson said. And I thought, 'Well you know, that kind of sounds like banking.' So it was really easy to write that way. The question is, can a profession so devoid of humor actually generate enough funny material for a parody novel? Kevin J. Williams, an MBA and former investment banker who now works in the comedy world, thinks so. He has written about the comedy-banking connection for no less than the Harvard Business Review, and likes what he has read of Erickson's book. A parody of hobbits that are bankers is a great thing, said Williams, 36. First of all, I actually worked with some bankers that physically looked like hobbits. And using parody as a tool to disarm or make sense of an industry or profession is definitely a healthy thing. If we lose our ability to do that, we lose our capacity to reflect.

China will focus on mergers and restructuring, not bankruptcies, Xiao Yaqing, the head of the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC), told a news conference. As it tries to rejuvenate its economy, China aims to reduce the number of central government-managed enterprises and launch pilot programmes that will allow more private investment in state-dominated sectors. It is also trying to slash overcapacity in the labour-intensive coal and steel sectors. Reform plans have prompted fears that the country would face its fiercest unemployment pressures since the late 1990s, when about 28 million people were made redundant. The situation in the 1990s was completely different, Xiao told reporters. The foundations we have now are much stronger than before. Protecting the interests of workers is an important aspect of the next stage of reforms, and there will be more mergers and restructurings, and as few bankruptcies as possible. Sources have told Reuters that China is expecting to lay off 5 million to 6 million state workers over the next two to three years as part of efforts to curb industrial overcapacity and pollution. According to official estimates, layoffs from the coal and steel sectors alone are expected to reach 1.8 million as the country works to tackle price-sapping overcapacity and shut down so-called zombie enterprises - loss-making firms that cannot afford to continue operating but are propped up by local authorities. Xiao said 12 central government-run firms had been merged, bringing the total number of enterprises controlled by SASAC to 106. Profits at the firms fell 6.7 percent last year to 2.3 trillion yuan. Xiao said the main reason for the decline was the collapse in the prices of oil and steel. China has about 150,000 state-owned enterprises that manage more than 100 trillion yuan ($15.40 trillion) in assets and employ more than 30 million people, according to the official Xinhua news agency.

The official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 49.0 in February from January's reading of 49.4 and below the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction. Economists polled by Reuters had expected only a slight dip to 49.3. It was the lowest reading since November 2011. The PMI came in much weaker than markets expected, hinting that recent easing measures have had limited impact in turning around the weakening manufacturing sector, wrote senior emerging markets economist Zhou Hao at Commerzbank in Singapore. We think PBoC will cut policy rates by 25 basis points in the first quarter and lower RRR (banks' reserve requirement ratio) by another 100-150 basis points this year.  The private Caixin/Markit China Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), which focuses more on small to medium- sized, private firms, showed activity contracted for a 12th straight month. It fell to 48.0, below market expectations of 48.3 and January's reading of 48.4. Both surveys showed conditions in China's job market were continuing to deteriorate, challenging policymakers who are finalising Beijing's next five-year development plan ahead of the annual parliament meeting starting on March 5. The Caixin report showed companies shed jobs at the fastest pace since January 2009, when China and other trade-reliant economies were reeling from a near-collapse in global trade following the financial crisis. Related CoverageChina Feb factory PMI falls to 48.0, contracts 12th month, layoffs rise: Caixin PMIChina state planner says will keep prices stable in 2016China's home price gains quicken in February: surveysFirms that reported lower headcounts cited company downsizing and cost-cutting, and said more workers who were leaving voluntarily were not being replaced. The employment sub-component of the index fell to 46.0 from January's 47.0. The official PMI survey, which tends to focus on larger, state firms, has shown persistent declines in employment for the last 3-1/2 years.     To be sure, although Markit adjusts figures for seasonal effects, the timing of the long Lunar New Year holiday can make Chinese data in January and February difficult to interpret. Economic activity slows dramatically around the holiday, which falls on a different date in late winter every year. Still, the findings in the latest surveys have dashed hopes that a year-long blitz of stimulus measures would start to produce signs of economic stabilization early in 2016.     China's factory sector has been under pressure from weak demand at home and abroad and massive overcapacity in key industries such as steel and coal, diluting the impact of six central bank interest rate cuts and a spate of other support measures since November 2014. Industrial profits fell 2.3 percent in 2015 after rising 3.3 percent in 2014. Both surveys on Tuesday showed further contractions in domestic and export orders, suggesting industrial output will remain sluggish in coming months.     In addition, some manufacturers in capital-intensive sectors are struggling with heavy debt loads, which are becoming increasingly difficult to repay as they have to constantly cut  prices to win sales. Last year witnessed a rash of bond defaults by steel, cement and chemical firms. Chinese factory gate prices fell for the 47th straight month in January. The government has made cutting overcapacity in steel and other old economy sectors a priority this year, though previous efforts have run into strong resistance locally as big  firms are often a key source of tax revenue and employment. China said on Monday it expects to lay off 1.8 million workers in the coal and steel industries, or about 15 percent of the workforce, but no timeframe was given. Recent tax changes have also raised concerns that China hopes to export more of its excess industrial capacity abroad, further worsening global gluts of chemical and steel products and effectively exporting deflation abroad. China's economic growth cooled to 6.9 percent in 2015, the slowest pace in 25 years, and economists see it slowing further to around 6.5 percent this year. Some market watchers believe it is already much weaker than official data suggests. Services Softening? A growth slowdown in China's services sector last month was also singled out by analysts as a cause for concern. The official non-manufacturing PMI fell from 53.5 in January to 52.7 in February, still in expansion territory but the weakest reading since late 2008. The services sector has been taking up an increasing amount of economic slack as manufacturing cools, but analysts have wondered how long it can remain resilient in the face of the prolonged factory slump and increasing unemployment. With manufacturing in both a cyclical and structural funk, Beijing has been keen to grow the services sector and make consumption a stronger driver of the economy.  Today’s data suggest that policy makers will take further measures in the upcoming National People’s Congress in order to achieve a GDP growth target of 6.5 to 7 percent in 2016, ANZ economists said in a note. A proactive fiscal policy will be needed to support investments and we expect the fiscal deficit could be increased to a range of 3-4 percent in 2016, from 2.3 percent in 2015 in order to boost government spending.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-economy-idUSL2N15J19H","Rising U.S. layoffs hint at ebbing labor market momentum  ","","February 4, 2016 /  1:41 PM / a year ago","","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits rose more than expected last week, suggesting some loss of momentum in the labor market amid a sharp economic slowdown and stock market selloff.  Signs of creeping employment weakness were also flagged by another report on Thursday showing a 218 percent jump in announced job cuts by U.S.-based employers in January. The planned layoffs were concentrated in the energy and retail sectors. The future is somewhat darker ... the labor market may be past its peak for this cycle. It looks like the labor market has scaled back its rapid advance last month, said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York. Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 8,000 to a seasonally adjusted 285,000 for the week ended Jan. 30, the Labor Department said. Claims remained below 300,000, a level associated with strong labor market conditions, for a 48th straight week - that is the longest run since the early 1970s. The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose 2,000 to 284,750 last week. Economists had forecast claims rising to 280,000 in the latest week. The rise in layoffs came amid a slowdown in economic growth. The economy grew at only a 0.7 percent annual pace in the fourth quarter, held back by the headwinds of a strong dollar and faltering global demand. A downturn in capital spending by energy companies, reeling from a collapse in oil prices, and inventory destocking by businesses are also constraining growth. At the same time, a stock market rout sparked by fears of a global economic slump has caused financial market conditions to tighten. In a separate report, global outplacement consultancy Challenger, Gray & Christmas said employers reported 75,114 planned job cuts last month, up from December's 15-year low of 23,622. January's planned layoffs were the largest since July. Retailers announced plans to eliminate 22,246 jobs from their payrolls, the most since January 2009. The retail cuts were dominated by Walmart (WMT.N), which announced plans to close 269 stores worldwide. Firms in the downtrodden energy sector plan to slash headcount by 20,246, up from 1,682 in December. Some economists downplayed the increase in layoffs, citing the ongoing job losses in the energy industry and the impact of a blizzard that buried the northeastern United States in late January. They also tied the rise to the dismissal of seasonal and temporary workers after the holiday shopping season. To date, even taking the recent rise as given, the increase (in claims) is not sufficient to change our view that the expansion remains intact and that the economy is far from recession. Claims are very volatile, said Rob Martin, an economist at Barclays in New York.  In a third report, the Commerce Department said new orders for manufactured goods tumbled 2.9 percent in December, the largest drop in a year, after falling 0.7 percent in November.  The reports came on the heels of weak data on export growth and consumer spending that suggest the Federal Reserve will probably not raise interest rates in March. The U.S. central bank raised its short-term interest rate in December for the first time in nearly a decade. The dollar fell to a more than 3-1/2-month low against a basket of currencies as investors further dialed back their rate hike expectations. Prices for U.S. government debt rose, while U.S. stocks were mixed in volatile trading. Productivity Weak While the claims data has no bearing on January's employment report, which is scheduled to be released on Friday, as it falls outside the survey period, it fits in with perceptions of a deceleration in the pace of job growth.  According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls are expected to have increased 190,000 last month after surging by 292,000 in December. The unemployment rate is forecast holding steady at a 7-1/2-year low of 5 percent. In another report on Thursday, the Labor Department said nonfarm productivity, which measures hourly output per worker, fell at a 3.0 percent rate in the fourth quarter, the biggest drop in more than a year, after rising at a 2.1 percent rate in the third quarter. The weak productivity data reflected the sharp slowdown in GDP growth during the fourth quarter and robust hiring. Nonfarm payrolls rose by an average 284,000 jobs per month during the last three months of 2015. Productivity grew 0.6 percent in 2015, the smallest gain since 2013, and has increased at an annual rate of less than 1.0 percent in each of the last five years. Economists blame softer productivity on a lack of investment, which they say has led to an unprecedented decline in capital intensity. In the fourth quarter, unit labor costs, the price of labor per single unit of output, advanced at a 4.5 percent pace, the fastest rate in a year. They rose 2.4 percent in 2015, the largest gain since 2007. Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Paul Simao"

Moody's Investors Service said the 1,700 jobs being cut in Delaware by DuPont represents a significant 24 percent of all company employees in the state. The layoffs focused on scientists at the Experimental Station in the greater Wilmington, DE area. This event is credit negative for New Castle County (Aaa stable), the City of Wilmington (Aa2 stable) and the State of Delaware (Aaa stable), Moody's said in a research note. DuPont, which has made its home in Delaware since 1802, became the U.S. government's top supplier of gunpowder, its mainstay business at the time, by the beginning of the War of 1812. The company employees approximately 7,000 people in Delaware out of a global workforce of 53,000. DuPont is referred to as Uncle DuPie or Uncle DuPont, given it has been a major employer in the state for two centuries and the family are significant donors to the civic and cultural life of the state. Wilmington, the state's largest city, could see its finances impacted because it is dependent on employment and income taxes, Moody's said, adding: the city levies a 1.25 percent wage tax, a net profits tax and a per-employee head tax, totally 45 percent of total budget. By the firm's count there are 440 Wilmington residents who work for DuPont, and if 24 percent are laid off that means a potential loss of $156,000 in wage tax revenue. If all 440 were laid off, that figure rises to $650,000 Although the cuts are credit negative for the city, we expect management to maintain healthy finances, Moody's said of Wilmington. The announced DuPont layoffs also create a credit negative for the state, Moody's said. However the effects will be more muted due to the state's more diverse finances and tax base. The merged Dow and DuPont, which had an estimated combined market capitalization of roughly $130 billion when the deal was announced on Dec. 11, plans to then break up into three separate standalone businesses. It is expected to be duel headquartered in Wilmington as well as Dow's current home town of Midland, Michigan. Reporting By Daniel Bases; Editing by Meredith Mazzilli"

General Dynamics issued notices to the workers under the federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining (WARN) Act, notifying them that the expected layoffs will kick in from March through April, said company spokesman Peter Keating. The company already laid off 98 people at the facility last year. The latest layoff notices will reduce the number of General Dynamics workers to around 260 from just over 400 now, Keating said. He said additional layoffs may be announced later, depending on the level of work to be done at the facility. Many of the workers are represented by the United Steelworkers of America union. General Dynamics says it could have staved off those layoffs if the Army had placed additional orders valued at around $170 million to retrofit existing Stryker vehicles with a tougher hull designed to survive roadside bombs, but those orders did not come through in time. The Army and other military services are unsure about future budget levels given mounting pressures on the overall defense budget, and the failure so far of lawmakers to avert $500 billion in additional spending reductions due to kick in on March 1. Over 300 workers at the General Dynamics plant wrote to Alabama lawmakers in December, urging them to continue their efforts to avoid what they called unnecessary layoffs, especially since Army officials have already said that more double V-hulled Strykers will likely be needed in the future. The Army has a total of 3,300 Strykers, including about 600 built with the double-V hulls, and nearly 50 that were retrofitted with the stronger hulls. General Dynamics says it can exchange the hulls on the wheeled military vehicles for about half the cost of building new ones. It says the new hulls protect soldiers about as well as Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles built specifically to reduce injuries and deaths caused by roadside bombs. It has urged the Army to place orders for additional upgrades now, arguing that interrupting production and restarting it later will be more expensive and will trigger layoffs at its own facility and those of key suppliers. Some of those workers could be rehired later, depending on when additional orders are placed. Senator Richard Shelby, an Alabama Republican and member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, warned the chief of staff of the Army, General Raymond Odierno, in a letter in December that delays in placing orders for a third brigade of Strykers with the double-v hull could jeopardize good jobs at the plant and would put U.S. soldiers' lives at risk. In the letter, Shelby said Army officials had told him they planned to buy a third brigade of the upgraded vehicles, which he said offered an exponential increase in soldier safety, but could not give him a timeline for signing a contract with General Dynamics and starting production. I ask that you personally engage on this issue to ensure our bureaucracy does not unnecessarily limit the rapid production and fielding of this needed capability, he wrote. No comment was immediately available from the Army. Of the 406 General Dynamics workers now at the plant, about 350 currently work on the Stryker program, a company spokesman said. If no contract is signed with the Army for additional hull exchanges the total number of workers is likely to be reduced to around 159, the spokesman said."

The move is a temporary extension of operations at the Penobsquis mine, where production was previously expected to cease by the second quarter of 2014, the company said in a release. Potash Corp also said that initial production at its new Picadilly, New Brunswick mine is expected during the fourth quarter. The layoffs were part of cuts to 18 percent of Potash Corp's workforce, representing more than 1,000 jobs, announced in December, as it struggled with slumping demand and weak prices for the crop nutrient. The news is positive for Potash Corp, along with data that last week showed North American potash supplies had dipped in May to their lowest level since September, 2012, said Barclay's analyst Matthew Korn, in a note. Granular potash is a form of the crop nutrient that mixes easily with nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers and is favored in the United States and Brazil.

The row at one of the biggest foreign investment projects in Madagascar comes amid a political crisis after parliament voted last month to sack President Hery Rajaonarimampianina, who has challenged that move. Rajaonarimampianina's peaceful election victory in late 2013, the first vote since a 2009 coup, had started the nation on a fragile recovery that analysts say may now be threatened. Workers at Ambatovy mine, 80 km (50 miles) east of the capital, went on strike earlier this year. But Sherritt still achieved its target production rate ahead of schedule and in April reported an 11 percent rise in quarterly revenue. The firm said on June 3 that about 1,100 Ambatovy employees and contractors had their employment contracts suspended or had been demobilised, reducing overall project headcount by about 12 percent as part of an effort to deal with low metal prices. For now, we prefer dialogue. We are not undertaking the strike route yet. We are trying to calm people, said Richard Rakotovao, head of the legal and litigation department at the Svs Union, one of the main unions at the Ambatovy mine. An official from the other major union, FISEMA, also said the union was not backing a strike. A total of four unions represent workers at the mine. Rakotovao said the union had spoken to community leaders and the local authorities about the layoffs, and many were angered by the company's action. We fear a social explosion, he said. In a statement published in a Madagascar newspaper on Thursday, the firm said the layoffs were so it could continue operating within a difficult financial situation. That statement put the number of employees and contractors laid off at 900 but said the project still employed more than 8,000. It was not immediately clear why the number of layoffs published in the paper differed from the June 3 announcement. Mining is a vital for aid-reliant Madagascar, which boasts deposits of nickel, titanium, cobalt, iron, coal and uranium. But foreigners have been deterred by years of instability. A new mining law has been bogged down in parliament and it is not clear when it will be passed.

The U.S. carrier, which filed for Chapter 11 protection last year, expects fewer than 40 percent of those it sent notices to, or 4,400 people, will actually be laid off in November and December, spokesman Bruce Hicks said. The layoff notices were required under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, which requires employees to be informed 60 days before major layoffs or plant closures. The notices will look worse than the actual layoffs, said Jamie Horwitz, a spokesman for the Transport Workers Union, which represents workers that received WARN Act notices. Horwitz said about 800 employees had agreed to leave American voluntarily, a move that will further reduce the number of expected layoffs. In February, American had outlined plans to cut as many as 14,000 jobs as it looks to streamline in bankruptcy. The flight schedule cuts for September and October were set partly because an increase in pilot sick days and greater maintenance reports by flight crews led to flight cancellations and delays, Hicks said. American operates about 1,700 flights a day. Last week, the unit of AMR Corp AAMRQ.PK began implementing cost cuts for its unionized pilots after gaining bankruptcy court approval to abandon its collective bargaining agreement with the Allied Pilots Association. According to data from tracking service FlightAware.com, American Airlines in recent days has canceled more flights than other major U.S. airlines. On Monday, for example, American canceled about 2.1 percent of its scheduled flights, or about 73, compared with an average of 0.4 percent for other major U.S. airlines that day, FlightAware said. Mark Duell, vice president of operations at FlightAware, said cancellations at American have been well above the rest of the U.S. airline industry for the past two weeks. Pilot union spokesman Gregg Overman said on Tuesday that sick rates for American pilots have not deviated from normal historical rates, based on the union's tracking. He said there have been more mechanical delays. The pilots are the only major work group at American that has not agreed on contract concessions since the airline filed for bankruptcy in November last year. In a message on Tuesday, union President Keith Wilson said pilots were angry since American began imposing new work terms that cut their compensation and benefits. The pilots union is conducting a strike vote through October 3, but has previously said it will not walk out unless it is legal to do so. Reporting by Karen Jacobs; Editing by Tim Dobbyn"

President Mauricio Macri has dismissed thousands of state employees in his drive to tame a ballooning fiscal deficit, but the job losses are unpopular with many in a country used to generous state jobs and benefits. The Association of State Workers (ATE), the country's largest union of public employees, said hospital nurses and technicians, school caretakers, grains inspectors and government ministry employees were set to take part in the walkout. So too are unionized members of the National Civil Aviation Administration, raising the prospect of disruptions to flights. The strike seeks to confront the brutal wave of layoffs which have left more than 20,000 households in the street, the ATE union said in a statement on Wednesday. The union also called for the swift opening of wage hike negotiations, another thorn in the side of Macri's government after it devalued the peso currency in December while already battling an inflation rate running at around 30 percent. Macri's government has expressed its intent for salary hikes to be capped at 26 percent, but many of the country's muscular unions are demanding more than 30 percent, setting the stage for tough negotiations.   Macri has come under fire from supporters of the Peronism movement, which had dominated Argentine politics during the past 70 years but lost its grip on power in November's presidential election, for cutting state jobs. His ministers say many of the workers sacked so far were gnocchis or no-show workers, a claim strongly denied by union leaders. The government plans to review thousands of other contracts. The planned Feb. 24 strike underscores the challenges he will face as he seeks to lower public spending. Argentina's fiscal deficit swelled to 7.1 percent of gross domestic product under former President Cristina Fernandez. Public sector employment leapt by an estimated 50 percent during her eight years in power, private economists estimate.

Months after talks to find a buyer sputtered and a few weeks after high-level management changes, the studio run by Jeffrey Katzenberg intends to significantly reduce the size of its workforce, the Los Angeles Times reported, citing two people familiar with the matter. Variety said 150 to 400 employees could be affected at the Glendale and Redwood City, California campuses of the studio behind hit franchises like How to Train Your Dragon, Shrek and Kung Fu Panda. DreamWorks Animation employs around 2,200 people. A spokesman for DreamWorks Animation declined to comment on the reports. Some DreamWorks employees told their union, the Animation Guild, last week that they had been let go. There are layoffs going on because I have had members call me who have been laid off, said Steve Hulett, business representative at the Animation Guild.

Katzenberg had been in talks about a potential sale of the studio, but early discussions with SoftBank Corp in September and with Hasbro Inc in November ended shortly after they were reported.

The four-week average of new claims for state jobless benefits dropped to 335,500, the Labor Department said on Thursday. The reading has not been that low since November 2007, just before the United States fell into a calamitous recession. Now it appears that a long cycle of aggressive layoffs, which had fueled a surge in unemployment and helped shape two presidential elections, is over. Still, employers have appeared reticent to hire, and Thursday's data still pointed to only modest economic growth. Last week, initial jobless claims edged 5,000 higher to 333,000, a little less than expected. The overall economy and the labor market are improving at a moderate pace, said Lindsey Piegza, chief economist at brokerage Sterne Agee & Leach in Chicago. The pull-back in layoffs since 2009 has helped bring about a substantial fall in the jobless rate, and the trend in jobless claims could make the Federal Reserve more comfortable in unwinding the nation's last giant economic stimulus program. Many economists expect the U.S. central bank to begin reducing its massive bond-buying stimulus program as soon as next month. The Fed currently buys $85 billion a month in bonds to push borrowing costs lower and help boost economic recovery. While layoffs are roughly half their level in early 2009, the recovery in job creation has been more lackluster. Employers added just 162,000 workers to payrolls in July. Economic growth has also trended lower in recent months, with national output growing at a mere 1.4 percent annual rate in the first half of the year, down from 2.5 percent in the same period of 2012. The potential for job creation to meaningfully accelerate is limited, said Jim Baird, an investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors in Kalamazoo, Michigan. Wall Street analysts polled by Reuters had expected first-time applications to rise to 336,000 last week, and investors did not appear to take any cues from the claims data. U.S. stock prices rose, while yields on U.S. government debt fell ahead of a $16 billion bond auction. New jobless claims were volatile in July due to regular summer auto plant shutdowns, which make it hard for the government to adjust the data for seasonal swings. But that volatility is now past, and Labor Department analysts said there was nothing unusual in the data and that no states had provided estimates. The claims report showed the number of people still receiving benefits under regular state programs after an initial week of aid rose 67,000 to 3.018 million in the week ended July 27."

Also at risk are companies where the government is a major customer, such as technology, construction and transportation firms, Challenger said. The report comes a day ahead of the key U.S. jobs report, which is forecast to show the economy added 160,000 jobs in February, while the unemployment rate held at 7.9 percent.

Unions said the company's figure underestimated the number of job cuts as Sanofi reshuffles its laboratories into regional research hubs at the expense of smaller centres. There are thousands of employees that will be hit by layoffs and a high number of internal transfers, Pascal Vially, a representative for the CFDT trade union, told Reuters. Sanofi has scaled back planned layoffs under pressure from the French government, which has been struggling to contain a rising unemployment rate, and said it could shed around 900 jobs in France in the next three years - fewer than the 2,500 predicted by trade unions. But the 900 cuts - to be achieved through voluntary redundancies, internal transfers and early retirements - do not include the 640 jobs at a cancer research centre in Toulouse, which Sanofi wants to exit. The unions will discuss Sanofi's plan with Industry Minister Arnaud Montebourg at a meeting on Oct. 12, a day after the company is due to provide details of the cuts. Montebourg sided with the unions in a TV interview last week, saying the scaled-back plan is still too much. Neither Montebourg's office nor Sanofi were immediately available for comment.

Sprint has been reshuffling executives and laying off workers as it struggles to reverse a subscriber exodus brought about by a messy network overhaul that has caused gaps in coverage. In March, the company cut 330 jobs and closed 55 stores around the country, as part of an ongoing plan to shrink its workforce in 2014. The new round of layoffs, expected to end by October, will cost the company $160 million in the second fiscal quarter for severance and related costs and will include cuts to management and non-management positions.  Sprint warned in the filing that additional charges associated with future job cuts may be coming, but provided no further details. In August, the company appointed Bolivian entrepreneur Marcelo Claure as its new chief executive after dropping a long-sought bid for rival T-Mobile US TMUS.N due to regulatory resistance.  Claure has pledged to turn around the struggling company by slashing prices and cutting costs.  The company, which is 80 percent owned by Japan's SoftBank Corp (9984.T), has since launched some of the industry's most aggressive promotions, but is facing intense competition from its rivals.   No.4 carrier T-Mobile has vowed to overtake Sprint as the third-largest carrier by the end of the year and Verizon (VZ.N) and AT&T; (T.N) have launched fierce promotions of their own.

The studio job cuts will center on the marketing and home video units and include a small number from the animation wing, said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the plans had not been made public. It is unknown how many jobs will be lost at either division. Staff reductions at the consumer products unit will largely result from attrition, another person said.

A Disney spokeswoman had no comment. Disney, headquartered in Burbank, California, started an internal cost-cutting review late last year to identify cutbacks in jobs it no longer needs because of improvements in technology, one of the people said. It is also looking at redundant operations that could be eliminated following a string of major acquisitions over the past few years, said the person.

Heavy job cuts in the industrial goods sector are never a good thing, as they can be indicative of widening cracks in the economy's foundation, said John A.

The Labor Department advisory said the circumstances surrounding the planned cuts were too uncertain to require defense and other federal contractors to comply with provisions of a law requiring employees to be notified 60 days before major layoffs or plant closures. Under current law, the U.S. Defense Department is facing across-the-board budget cuts beginning January 2 aimed at cutting $500 billion in projected national security spending over the next decade. Under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining and Notification ACT, companies have to send out notices 60 days ahead of time advising their employees of impending mass layoffs or plant closures. If notices were sent out ahead of the impending budget cuts, the workers would be receiving them just before the November 6 presidential election. Apart from the January reductions, the Pentagon is working to trim spending by $487 billion as ordered by the Budget Control Act last year. Lawmakers from both parties say they oppose the across-the-board cuts that will hit in January under a process known as sequestration, but they have not been able to agree on alternative ways to reduce spending. Representative Gerry Connolly, a Democrat from Virginia, said on Monday Congress should cancel its annual August recess to focus instead on stopping the $500 billion in automatic spending cuts. Congress has only 11 more legislative days, he said, to broker a deal halting the cuts before the November election. If the two parties are unable to agree on a deal before the end of the term, the issue may be taken up in a post-election lame-duck session of Congress. We got to stay in session and solve this problem, Connolly told reporters after speaking at a rally to protest sequestration. It is not rocket science. Call for Compromise The rally, held by Northrop Grumman Corp, brought together defense industry leaders and members of the Virginia Congressional delegation, as well as Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell, who urged Congress and the White House to find a solution to stop the expansive budget cuts, citing the more than 200,000 Virginia jobs at risk if a deal is not reached. More than 2.14 million jobs nationally could be lost because of sequestration, a George Mason University analysis for the Aerospace Industries Association said. McDonnell, a Republican, called for a compromise between Republicans and Democrats in Congress, saying a practical solution that includes cuts and revenue increases must be agreed on. We know we got to get our fiscal house in order, but it's got to be in a way that is systematic, that is practical, that looks out for the American war fighter and the men and women of the private sector that support them, McDonnell said. That's not the way this was done. The Labor Department decision drew swift condemnation from Republican Representative Buck McKeon, head of the Armed Services committee, who called it politically motivated. McKeon said instead of trying to find a way to avert the cuts, the president is focused on preventing advance notice to American workers that their jobs are at risk and on perpetuating uncertainty. People will still get laid off because of the president's irresponsibility, but they won't have the notice to protect themselves and their families, McKeon said. The president is doing nothing to look out for the American worker and is using our troops as leverage to push his failed political agenda. The Labor Department said that the law did not apply in the current circumstances because while sequestration may occur, efforts are being made to avoid it. So even the occurrence of sequestration is not necessarily foreseeable, the guidance said. It said relevant case law would not require employers to provide notices under the current conditions.

pending American Airlines layoffs on the Dallas-Fort Worth region as a whole,
but anticipates limited negative effects to individual cities given the breadth
of the employment base.	
	
American Airlines' parent company AMR has proposed reducing its
overall workforce by 13,000 employees as part of a cost-cutting plan to allow it
to emerge from bankruptcy. This action could result in the loss of several
thousand jobs in the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area. American Airlines and
its regional affiliate, American Eagle, are, by far, the major carriers at the
Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. In 2011 they accounted for
approximately 85% of Dallas-Fort Worth's enplanements. American Airlines is also
one of the largest employers in the region with roughly 25,000.	
	
Over the past decade, the area has weathered the ebb and flow of the airline
industry's fortunes. Fort Worth's unemployment rate climbed above 8% in 2003 due
in part to layoffs at AMR. At the same time, the regional economy has continued
to grow and diversify, with a labor force now exceeding three million. The
Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington MSA is the largest in the South and recorded a 7.1%
unemployment rate in December of 2011, well below the U.S. average.	
	
We believe that two of the proposed cuts have the potential to directly impact
employment in the city of Fort Worth. The company's plan includes the closure of
the Alliance Airport maintenance facility in Fort Worth that has approximately
1,200 employees. The company has also proposed reducing 1,400 management
positions nationwide, and it is possible a majority of these layoffs could occur
at corporate headquarters in Fort Worth. We expect the impact of other proposed
cuts, such as those to Dallas-Fort Worth airport-based maintenance staff, to be
spread around a number of communities in the metropolitan area.

Weil Gotshal & Manges, one of the world's most prominent firms, said on Monday it would lay off 60 associate lawyers and 110 support staff. Meanwhile, Patton Boggs, a Washington, D.C.-based firm known best for its lobbying practice, confirmed that 17 of its partners announced last week they would be departing. The moves come as many law firms have reduced staff levels in the wake of the financial crisis, with demand softening and corporate clients pushing for lower fees. The 1,200-lawyer Weil Gotshal, based in New York, announced the layoffs in a memo to its staff on Monday, saying that the new normal for the legal services market had forced its hand. In addition to the layoffs, the firm said it would cut compensation for some of its partners. It appears that the market for premium legal services is continuing to shrink, Weil's executive partner, Barry Wolf, wrote in the email, which the firm provided to Reuters. The firm did not comment beyond the memo. Weil had been largely insulated from such pressures thanks in part to its robust bankruptcy practice. Most notably, the firm guided Lehman Brothers through its 3-1/2-year restructuring, yielding hundreds of millions of dollars in fees. In the memo on Monday, Wolf emphasized that Weil has no outstanding debt, a fully funded partner pension plan and virtually no compensation guarantees. Those were some of the factors that led to the demise of Dewey & LeBoeuf, another large firm that filed for bankruptcy in 2012 after cutting partner pay in an effort to escape a crushing debt load. The Patton Boggs' move comes three months after the firm laid off more than 60 staff members, including 30 attorneys. The firm said in a statement, Movements of this kind are a regular occurrence in an industry where the competitive environment has changed, and many leading firms are transitioning their work forces to compete more effectively. Peter Zeughauser, a law firm consultant, said firms are likely to keep cutting costs, as corporate clients continue to turn to less-expensive options for basic legal services like in-house attorneys and outside consultants. The client pressure is unrelenting, and it's going to bring about further change, he said. Last year, Weil generated more than $1.2 billion in gross revenue and about $2.2 million in profits per partner, according to The American Lawyer magazine. The smaller Patton Boggs, which has about 500 lawyers, recorded $317.5 million in revenues and $735,000 in profits per partner in 2012. Reporting by Joseph Ax; Editing by Ted Botha, Bernard Orr"

The layoffs affect salaried support and management employees and are a strategic step to make the aerospace supplier more cost-competitive, Spirit said in a statement. The company, based in Wichita, Kansas, makes airplane body sections for the best-selling Boeing 737 and Airbus A320  jets, as well as wing pieces and other components for other aircraft makers, including Bombardier, Gulfstream and Mitsubishi. The layoffs come amid talk that UK car and aerospace supplier GKN might bid for part or all of the company. Spirit's shares rose 7.4 percent on Thursday after a British newspaper reported on a potential GKN offer. Shares were up $1.78 to $25.85 in mid-day trading in New York. Earlier, the shares traded above their 52-week high of $25.86. The Daily Mail said speculation about a bid rose on Wednesday, with dealers hearing GKN could launch a $5 billion cash and shares bid, worth around $35 a share, for Spirit. The newspaper said Bank of America/Merrill Lynch was reported to be advising GKN. Other sources said a deal might be in the works for the wings business. Ken Evans, a spokesman for Kansas-based Spirit, said the company declined to comment. In March, Spirit named former Lockheed Martin  executive Larry Lawson as president and chief executive, and is undergoing a strategic and financial review of its operations at four locations, including Kansas and Oklahoma. It suffered losses last year from cost overruns on some aircraft parts. Spirit was spun off from Boeing in 2005. If this report turns out to be true, then we think that it offers an excellent deal for Spirit's shareholders, RBC Capital Markets analyst Robert Stallard said in a note to clients on Thursday. Given the lack of profitability on its development programs, and a lack of cash generation, a bid at the reported level would seem extremely generous given the current situation, Stallard added. Jefferies analyst Sandy Morris expressed doubts about a GKN acquisition of Spirit. My personal view is that perhaps one division of Spirit may be for sale, and that would be the wing systems division. I think that that's much more likely, Morris added."

The Portuguese government set the condition after talks with the unions who last month threatened a crippling strike over Christmas, forcing it to invoke special labour requisition powers to prevent the stoppage. The government plans to sell its 66 percent controlling stake in TAP, but will retain a 34 percent stake that can be sold off two years after the privatisation. The agreement (with the unions) guarantees that there will be no collective layoffs for a certain period of time -  for 30 months or as long as the state has a stake in the company after this privatisation, whatever is the longest, said the state secretary for transport, Sergio Monteiro. At a cabinet meeting on Thursday, the government approved a prospectus with conditions for TAP privatisation, which also include preserving TAP's status as the Portuguese flag carrier and keeping the headquarters and main hub in Lisbon. The airline has debts of some 1 billion euros and the cash-strapped state is banned from injecting fresh capital into the company under European Union rules. Prime Minister Pedro Passos Coelho has said TAP will not survive if it remains in state hands. The privatisation is part of a programme of state-property sell-offs agreed between Lisbon and its European and International Monetary Fund creditors under its 2011 bailout, which the country exited last year. Most other privatisations have been successfully completed, exceeding Lisbon's revenue target. TAP's sell-off is unlikely to bring much cash to the government, but would rid it of the airline's sizeable debt. We are not looking to raise cash with this privatisation, but for conditions for the company to continue to grow in the future, Monteiro said. The TAP privatisation was relaunched in November after being  suspended in 2012 when the only bidder failed to present financial guarantees in time. The government hopes it can sell TAP this time after being approached by at least three potential bidders. Media reports cite Brazilian airline companies Gol  and Azul among potential bidders.

State police said about 7,000 workers from Volkswagen AG , Ford Motor Co and the Mercedes-Benz truck unit of Germany's Daimler AG occupied a lane of the highway linking Brazil's biggest city and biggest port. The union organizing the protest estimated that total participation was close to 30,000, based on the number of workers at three auto plants shut down for the march. Last week Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz confirmed more than 1,000 job cuts, accelerating a drop in auto industry payrolls that dwindled nearly 9 percent last year. VW and Mercedes workers have already responded with strikes and the participation of Ford employees bolstered labor leaders' assertion that the resistance to layoffs will be industrywide. Auto industry groups in Brazil are forecasting little or no recovery from a sharp downturn in 2014, as rising interest rates and expiring tax breaks contribute to weak consumer confidence. Carmakers have responded by cutting costs, ending an agreement with Brazil's government to avoid layoffs. The labor standoff is testing the mettle of President Dilma Rousseff's new economic team, which took charge this month promising to end the cheap credit and tax incentives that have propped up key industries but wrecked government accounts. The auto industry contributes a quarter of Brazil's industrial production and its powerful labor unions helped to found the ruling Worker's Party. A Mercedes-Benz representative confirmed its workers were involved in the demonstration, adding that the company recognized their right to protest. She said production at its local truck factory was stopped for the day. Volkswagen reiterated a recent statement that the company urgently needs to reduce costs at its local plant, known as Anchieta. Workers there have halted production since Tuesday. Ford representatives confirmed a one-day stoppage at the company's factory outside of Sao Paulo as workers participated in the demonstration in what they described as an act of solidarity. Unlike many major automakers in Brazil, Ford has not announced substantial layoffs in response to the downturn.

The healthcare sector saw the biggest layoffs, with plans to cut 8,128 employees as health companies faced lower government payments, up from 3,163 in August. The healthcare sector is adjusting workforce levels due to cutbacks in Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements initiated under the Affordable Care Act as well as overall reductions in federal spending due to sequestration, said John A. Challenger, chief executive of Challenger, Gray. The financial sector saw the next largest number of planned job cuts, with 6,932 in September compared with 3,096 a month earlier. The Challenger report took on added significance this week after the U.S. federal government shutdown limited other labor market data. The U.S. Labor Department said it will not issue its key monthly U.S. non-farm payrolls report on Friday if the government is still shut down, though weekly jobless claims were scheduled to be released as normal on Thursday. While the shutdown is an added challenge for the U.S. outlook, it has had no immediate impact on the economy, the Challenger report said, pointing to strength in recently announced retail holiday hiring numbers.

Employers announced 47,724 planned job cuts last month, up from September's 33,816, according to the report from consultants Challenger, Gray & Christmas, Inc. It was the highest level since May. U.S. automotive companies said they will let go of 11,615 workers, though that includes 10,900 Ford layoffs that will affect workers in Belgium and the United Kingdom. The planned layoffs were modestly higher than the 42,759 announced in October last year. The total for the year so far stands at 433,725, down from 521,823 for the same period in 2011. While the Ford job cuts are not impacting American workers, they indicate just how vulnerable companies in the U.S. are to the situation in Europe, John Challenger, chief executive officer of Challenger, Gray & Christmas, said in a statement. The last three months of the year tend to see heavier lay-off activity and the weak third-quarter earnings season does not bode well, Challenger said. The consumer products industry announced 5,250 cuts, while electronics companies laid off 4,491 workers as the sectors were hurt by a slowdown in consumer and business spending. The report comes a day ahead of the key U.S. labor market report, which is expected to show job growth picked up modestly last month to 125,000 jobs.

Automatic budget cuts are scheduled to take effect on Friday unless a deal can be reached in Congress. During an interview with Reuters TV, Vilsack said furloughs of meat inspectors, and the cascading impact on the meat  industry, were unavoidable although shortages were unlikely to occur immediately. At some point, you're going to have shortages, said Vilsack. The reality is there are going to be disruptions. The White House says USDA's meat safety agency would have to furlough its 8,400 inspectors for the equivalent of 15 days to compile the savings required under the automatic cuts. But those days off could be structured in various ways. Vilsack says USDA would try to minimize the impact on consumers and the meat industry. It will depend, he said, on how many days we have to furlough and how we stagger those days. It was the first time Vilsack mentioned staggering the furloughs, although officials have said the furloughs might occur on non-consecutive days. A mass layoff of inspectors would shut down nearly 6,300 meat packing and processing plants because companies cannot ship meat that lacks the USDA inspection seal. The White House estimates the industry would lose $10 billion in production with a two-week shutdown. Meat processors say the government is required by law to provide meat inspection and USDA should find other ways to save money and keep inspectors on the job. Vilsack did not specify how furloughs at other USDA agencies might be structured. For example, the Agricultural Marketing Service generates prices used as benchmarks for livestock futures at CME Group Inc. USDA personnel also perform key roles in inspecting exports of U.S. grains and cotton."

Employers announced 36,398 job cuts last month, down 4.5 percent from 38,121 in April, according to the report from consultants Challenger, Gray & Christmas, Inc. May's layoffs were also significantly lower than what was seen a year ago, down 41.2 percent from last May's 61,887. May typically sees the smallest number of layoffs of the year, the report said. For 2013 so far, employers have announced 219,560 cuts, compared to the 245,540 jobs that were cut in the first five months of 2012. So far, the threat of massive job cuts related to federal spending cuts has failed to materialize, John Challenger, chief executive officer of Challenger, Gray & Christmas, said in a statement. Although the job market is not out of the woods yet as far as the potential for government downsizing is concerned, improvements in the economy may delay or minimize the impact on the workforce, Challenger said. Across-the-board government spending cuts of $85 billion, known as the sequester, went into effect in March, and recent data has hinted the belt-tightening is starting to crimp overall growth. There were fewer than 1,500 job cuts directly attributed to federal cutbacks and the sequester, Challenger said. Still, the healthcare sector suffered the biggest job losses last month, with layoffs rising to 4,886. The report comes a day ahead of the key U.S. jobs report, which is forecast to show job gains picked up only modestly to 170,000 in May, while the unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 7.5 percent."

Employers announced 37,551 planned job cuts last month, down 39.3 percent from 61,887 in May, according to the report from consultants Challenger, Gray & Christmas, Inc. Job cuts were also down 9.4 percent from June last year when 41,432 reductions were announced. Layoffs were at their lowest level since May 2011. Despite recent signs that the economic recovery is losing steam, employers appear reluctant to shed too many workers, John Challenger, chief executive officer of Challenger, Gray & Christmas, said in a statement. While it does not take long to shrink payrolls, it can take a significant amount of time to rebuild them, particularly as reports of a growing skills gap become more widespread, he said. For 2012 so far, employers have announced 283,091 cuts, up 15.2 percent from the first six months of 2011. Even with the increase, the number of job cuts in the first half of the year was still relatively low. In 2008 and 2009 during the height of the financial crisis, first-half job cuts stood at 475,948 and 896,675, respectively. A contraction in manufacturing activity in June did not lead to increased layoffs, with job cuts decreasing in the four major manufacturing industries tracked by Challenger. June's heaviest job cuts were in the education sector with 6,569 layoffs, well up from the 3,536 announced in May.

Euro zone finance ministers were due to decide on Monday how to keep Greece afloat and had threatened to delay the latest 8.1 billion euro payment to Athens to put more pressure on it to enact unpopular reforms. More than 6,000 local administration workers, among them guards and uniformed municipal police on motorbikes, marched to the Administrative Reform Ministry in central Athens, waving black flags, honking horns and sounding sirens. Take your memorandum and get out of here! the workers chanted, in the first protest since the lenders completed their latest review of Greece's cost cutting efforts on Sunday, a sign of the resistance the government may face. They won't succeed - we will fight it, said POE-OTA, the federation of local government unions, which held a 24-hour nationwide strike. The largest public sector union ADEDY also staged a work stoppage in Athens. Greece has struggled to convince the troika of lenders from the European Union, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund that it can deliver on its pledges and shrink its spendthrift public sector, widely blamed by many Greeks for the debt crisis. Public sector layoffs are a taboo in Greece, where a sixth year of recession has made one in four jobless and eroded living standards. After missing a June deadline, Athens agreed to put 12,500 state workers into a mobility scheme by September, meaning they will be transferred or fired within a year. Around 3,500 of those will be municipal workers and another 2,000 will be teachers, government officials have said. A second wave of 12,500 staff will be placed in the scheme by the end of the year.

Dart sales are down 33 percent so far this year for the first jointly designed vehicle in the Fiat-Chrysler marriage, built on the same architecture of the Alfa Romeo Giulietta. In 2014 results through February, Dart fell to ninth place among compact cars in the U.S. market, from eighth place last year, overtaken by the Forte from Kia Motors Corp (000270.KS). Toyota Motor Corp's (7203.T) Corolla, the most popular compact car, has sold nearly five times as well as the 10,000 Dart sedans through February, according to Autodata Corp. The Chrysler spokeswoman would not give production cut figures at Belvidere, saying only that the temporary layoffs were meant to balance vehicle supply with current sales demand. The plant, located about 70 miles northwest of Chicago, has about 4,500 employees. Dennis Virag, president of the Automotive Consulting Group in Michigan, said Chrysler is struggling to sell the Dart because it lags competitors despite improvements over the previous model, the Caliber. It's a good-looking car, but it's under-powered. Dodge is just not a brand that's in the minds of the customers when they go out looking for a small car, Virag said. That was a perception Chrysler hoped to change with the Dart. Gary Brown, a Long Island, New York store owner who heads the Chrysler Dealer Council, said a relatively late model year change has left an inordinate amount of 2013 Dart models on dealer lots. Auto sales website AutoTrader.com shows there are twice as many 2013 models of Dart on dealer lots as 2014 models. Alec Gutierrez, an analyst with industry research firm Kelley Blue Book, said Dodge in February increased the average incentives discount by $400 from a year earlier, to $2,200 per vehicle.

Protesters held banners and shouted slogans against Microsoft's hostile takeover and violent layoffs for five hours until they had sore throats, said the employee who participated in the demonstration and so declined to be identified. The protesters would convene on Friday afternoon to discuss demands they would present to the company, the employee said. Microsoft announced on July 17 the deepest job cuts in its 39-year history, amounting to 18,000 positions. Microsoft said up to 12,500 of those jobs would come from Nokia, the Finnish handset maker it bought in April in a $7.2 billion friendly takeover. The protests took place at a Beijing research centre and factory employing 2,400 people, according to a statement from organisers, and amounted to the latest in a string of troubles for the U.S. software giant in China. Microsoft offices in four cities were raided this week by Chinese authorities as part of an ongoing anti-monopoly investigation announced on Tuesday. More broadly, labour disputes have risen across China over the past year in tandem with a slowdown in growth in the world's No. 2 economy. Since taking the helm of Microsoft in February, Chief Executive Satya Nadella has pledged to slim down his company to compete with nimbler internet-based rivals. Microsoft earlier this year said it would make changes company-wide within 18 months of closing the Nokia acquisition that would lead to costs-savings of up to $600 million per year. The latest cuts, which will be completed by June 30, 2015, represent about 14 percent of Microsoft's worldwide workforce.

The U.S. carrier, which filed for Chapter 11 protection last year, expects fewer than 40 percent of those it sent notices to, or 4,400 people, will actually be laid off in November and December, spokesman Bruce Hicks said. The layoff notices were required under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, which requires employees to be informed 60 days before major layoffs or plant closures. The notices will look worse than the actual layoffs, said Jamie Horwitz, a spokesman for the Transport Workers Union, which represents workers that received WARN Act notices. Horwitz said about 800 employees had agreed to leave American voluntarily, a move that will further reduce the number of expected layoffs. In February, American had outlined plans to cut as many as 14,000 jobs as it looks to streamline in bankruptcy. The flight schedule cuts for September and October were set partly because an increase in pilot sick days and greater maintenance reports by flight crews led to flight cancellations and delays, Hicks said. American operates about 1,700 flights a day. Last week, the unit of AMR Corp began implementing cost cuts for its unionized pilots after gaining bankruptcy court approval to abandon its collective bargaining agreement with the Allied Pilots Association. According to data from tracking service FlightAware.com, American Airlines in recent days has cancelled more flights than other major U.S. airlines. On Monday, for example, American cancelled about 2.1 percent of its scheduled flights, or about 73, compared with an average of 0.4 percent for other major U.S. airlines that day, FlightAware said. Mark Duell, vice president of operations at FlightAware, said cancellations at American have been well above the rest of the U.S. airline industry for the past two weeks. Pilot union spokesman Gregg Overman said on Tuesday that sick rates for American pilots have not deviated from normal historical rates, based on the union's tracking. He said there have been more mechanical delays. The pilots are the only major work group at American that has not agreed on contract concessions since the airline filed for bankruptcy in November last year.

David Hess, president of aircraft engine maker Pratt & Whitney, told Reuters the company was still examining its legal obligations regarding notification of employees who could be put out of jobs in January. At issue are some $55 billion in automatic spending cuts for fiscal 2013 that are due to hit on January 2 and which could cost the defense industry thousands of jobs. Hess and other aerospace industry executives are mounting a campaign to persuade Congress to stop them. In a controversial move last week, the U.S. Labor Department said the circumstances surrounding the planned cuts were too uncertain to require defense and other federal contractors to comply with the provisions the so-called WARN Act, which requires employees to be notified 60 days before major layoffs or plant closures. Republican lawmakers immediately accused the Obama administration of trying to suppress potentially damaging notices of layoffs just before the election. Right now the WARN Act is the law, and we always comply with the law, so we're not quite sure we understand the direction from the Department of Labor, Hess told Reuters at a rally for employees at Pratt & Whitney's jet engine test facility and rocket engine plant near West Palm Beach, Florida. The cuts in January stem from an August 2011 congressional budget deal to avoid a historic default on U.S. Treasury debt. Congress pledged to find $1.2 trillion in additional spending cuts by the end of 2012, or they would happen automatically, with half coming from defense spending. Although defense firms have warned that $500 billion in cuts over 10 years will ultimately cause the loss of more than two million jobs countrywide, they have little clarity on how the Defense Department will parse out the pain starting in January. Pay and benefits for military personnel are exempt from the cuts, but executives are waiting to hear which weapons programs will be hit hardest. Details Due Within 30 Days On Tuesday, President Barack Obama signed legislation requiring his administration to detail within 30 days how it will administer the cuts, which may help contractors decide where to cut. We'll make a decision in the future as to whether or not we'll issue WARN notices. Some of it may depend on what clarity we get in 30 days, Hess said. Job cuts at Pratt & Whitney's Florida facility, which does development work on engines for the stealthy F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, could reach into the hundreds, he said, should production be reduced. Tom Burbage, program integration manager for the F-35 at the plane's prime contractor, Lockheed Martin, said his firm appreciates and will analyze the Labor Department guidance, but management must first answer to shareholders and employees. The Labor Department is not a major shareholder in corporations like Lockheed Martin or (Pratt & Whitney parent)United Technologies, Burbage said. Generally speaking, if we know there's a potential to have a major reduction in the future, we have to take appropriate action, he said. All we are trying to do is be transparent with our employees so that nobody is caught by surprise. Lawmakers from both parties say they oppose the across-the-board cuts that will hit in January as a result of a budget deal made a year ago, but they have not been able to agree on alternative ways to reduce spending. Congress is on a five-week recess and when it returns in September, it will have only 11 legislative days to try to broker a deal before the November election. With both parties dug into partisan positions on budget and spending issues, a resolution is not likely until a post-election lame duck session of Congress that will be crowded with other fiscal deadlines.

IBM is cutting jobs, as disclosed in its latest earnings report last week, but those reductions will affect several thousand employees, a small fraction of what Forbes reported, according to an emailed statement from IBM to Reuters. Forbes had said as many as 112,000 employees could be laid off. The technology giant has been steadily reshaping its 400,000-plus staff for several years, laying off workers in some areas and hiring in new growth businesses. A report last Thursday on Forbes' website by pseudonymous Silicon Valley technology gossip columnist Robert Cringely said IBM planned to break with that gradual approach and suddenly lay off 26 percent of its global workforce. IBM did not issue a categorical denial of the report, but strongly suggested it was inaccurate. IBM does not comment on rumors, even ridiculous or baseless ones, the company said in the email. If anyone had checked information readily available from our public earnings statements, or had simply asked us, they would know that IBM has already announced the company has just taken a $600 million charge for workforce rebalancing. This equates to several thousand people, a small fraction of what's been reported. Last week, Chief Financial Officer Martin Schroeter told investors on IBM's fourth-quarter earnings conference call that the company was taking restructuring charges of around $580 million, but he did not specify the number of jobs affected. We are not going to replicate the same level of restructuring that we had last year, Schroeter said in response to a Wall Street analyst's question. It will be a lower amount. IBM does not disclose the amount of layoffs it makes each year, but one Wall Street analyst estimated that this year's restructuring charge suggests about 8,000 people, in line with recent years. For each of the last seven years, IBM has taken annual restructuring charges of between about $450 million and $1.5 billion, which we estimated have resulted in workforce reductions of between 6,500 and 21,500 per year, Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi wrote in a note to clients on Monday. He said the Forbes report was puzzling. IBM said it had 431,212 employees at the end of 2013, slightly down from 434,246 employees in 2012. The company has not yet disclosed its overall employee headcount for the end of 2014. IBM's shares were up about 0.5 percent at $156.66 on the New York Stock Exchange after paring earlier gains.

In February, American outlined plans to cut as many as 14,000 jobs as it looks to streamline in bankruptcy.

US Airways won the backing of unions that represent American ramp workers, pilots and flight attendants earlier this year by promising to preserve thousands of jobs should a merger with American occur.

The school year begins on Wednesday, and the government must designate thousands of public sector workers for possible dismissal to convince its borrowers arriving for an inspection visit on September 22 it deserves further bailout funding. But efforts to put state workers in a so-called mobility scheme to reform the public sector have met fierce resistance from labor unions, which say any firings or transfers will further hurt austerity-hit families. High school teachers' labor union OLME announced on Monday plans for five-day rolling strikes from September 16. Education is under attack, OLME said in a statement calling students and their parents to join the protests against school mergers, job cuts and transfers. We can and we will topple these policies. High-school teachers have repeatedly walked off the job to protest the government's plans. The conservative-led coalition invoked emergency powers in May to mobilize teachers and prevent a strike that would have disrupted university entry exams. OLME is expected to join a 48-hour strike on Sept 18-19 called by Greece's largest public sector union ADEDY. Athens must put a total 25,000 workers in the mobility scheme by the end of the year, and they will be evaluated and transferred to other jobs or dismissed. It must also meet a target of 15,000 mandatory exits in 2013-2014. Firing workers is a taboo in the crisis-hit country where unemployment has jumped over 27 percent and poverty levels have soared amid a six-year recession. But foreign lenders have warned that the billions of euros in aid payments that Greece needs to stay afloat cannot continue unless it pushes forward with reforming a corruption-prone state apparatus where hiring is often made for political patronage.

The gain was one of the most surprising findings in the annual revisions to New York City's unemployment data, according to James Brown, a market analyst with the Department of Labor. Officials had feared Wall St. would lose jobs after profit-hit banks and brokerages announced thousands of layoffs. The data did not indicate whether those layoffs never happened or whether banks simply hired more staff than they fired. In January, Wall Street hired 600 workers, bringing its  total workforce to 171,300 employees, according to the Labor Department. This sector galvanizes the economies of New York City and New York state as it drives a host of other service companies to hire workers, from accounting firms to restaurants. Nor was that the only unexpected finding. The benchmark revisions also increased the 2011 annual average employment in the city's private sector by 43,800 positions, a 1.4 percent increase. It's a significantly stronger upward revision; all indications are that we are doing a lot better than we thought, said Labor Department Market Analyst James Brown by telephone. Still, he noted the city's pre-recession unemployment rate hovered around 4 percent to 4.5 percent -- about half the latest rate -- which suggests the recovery is far from complete. The overall financial sector, which includes banks and insurance, hired 7,800 people from January 2011 to January 2012, bringing its payroll to a total of 440,600. New York City added private sector jobs at a rate almost 60 percent greater than the country as a whole in 2011, and over the last two years, New York City created more jobs than the next 10 largest cities combined, Mayor Michael Bloomberg said in a statement. New York state's economy also performed better than first reported, according to the benchmark revisions. As of December 2011, the state had recouped 76 percent of the private sector jobs lost in the 2008-2009 recession, the Labor Department said in a statement. Still, the state's unemployment rate rose a tenth of a percentage point to 8.3 percent in January from a year earlier. New York City's jobless rate rose fourth-tenths of a percentage point to 9.3 percent over the same time. "

Severance packages, rebranding expenses and other costs following the takeover of rival Vivo contributed to a 15 percent drop in first-quarter profit, Telefônica reported on Thursday. We cannot affirm that we are 100 percent done with the process, because it takes a while to implement changes in some areas, senior executive Cristiane Barretto Sales told analysts on a conference call, responding to a question about the cost of recent layoffs. We may analyze other changes in personnel. The Brazilian unit of Spain's Telefonica reported net income of 957 million reais ($489 million), according to a Thursday securities filing, down 15 percent from a year earlier and missing an average forecast of 1.13 billion reais among analysts polled by Reuters. Telefônica shares fell 1.8 percent in midday trading to 53.73 reais, while the benchmark Bovespa stock index  gained 0.8 percent. Slipping revenue from the company's fixed-line unit was offset by its surging mobile business, lifting net revenue 4 percent from a year earlier as Brazilians swapped their landlines for cell phones in record numbers. But the booming growth of Brazil's wireless market has also brought fierce competition for Telefônica's leading mobile market share, weighing on some measures of profitability. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, a gauge of operating profit known as EBITDA, was little changed from a year earlier at 2.847 billion reais, in line with forecasts. EBITDA as a share of net revenue, a measure of profitability known as the EBITDA margin, slipped 1.2 percentage points to 34.2 percent. Average revenue per user, an industry gauge known as ARPU, fell 5.9 percent from a year earlier to 22.4 reais per month. The measure would have fallen even more if stronger data revenue per user had not helped to offset a drop in voice ARPU. Even data ARPU slipped slightly from the prior quarter, but executives said they had no plant to compete on price.	   ($1 = 1.96 reais)"

Spirit, based in Wichita, Kansas, declined to comment. We have no announcement to make at this time, said spokesman Ken Evans. Airbus and Boeing are increasing production of jets to fill record orders for new planes. But the job cuts were considered unlikely to affect production at Spirit, which supplies full fuselages for Boeing 737s, the center fuselage section for Airbus A350s, wing sections for the Airbus A320 and other parts. Spirit managers are telling us informally that the company is about to engage in mass layoffs, said Goforth. He said some specialties, such as stress and structure engineers, were exempted from the layoffs. Boeing declined to comment. Airbus could not immediately be reached for comment. In March, Spirit named Larry Lawson as its new CEO, succeeding Jeff Turner. Spirit had cost overruns last year that led to a $134 million loss in the third quarter. The charges related to Boeing's 787 jet and to Gulfstream business jets. The company has been performing a strategic and financial review of its development programs in Wichita; Tulsa, Oklahoma; Kinston, North Carolina; and St. Nazaire, France.

Credit Agricole is seen as the weakest of France's listed banks in terms of capital strength and made deep cuts to investment bank staff and costs earlier this year. Staff representatives say they have met with management twice this week over future strategy. There will be no new layoffs plan, the focus is on finding other cost savings over the next three years, a source who attended a meeting on Thursday said. There will be a focus on savings to back-office and IT costs, on finding cheaper real estate and on non-replacement of retirees, the source said. A union representative told Reuters that management said there was no layoffs plan in the works but management had been vague in a meeting earlier this week. They were vague and said the bank was concentrating on broad cost reductions, he said. The effort to cut costs through attrition will not be confined to the investment bank, a separate union source said, adding that not all departing staff at the lender's regional savings banks would be replaced either. Staff at the regional banks could be cut by about 1,400 in 2013, the source said, citing documents provided by management, showing that only 2,707 people would be hired to replace departing staff estimated at 4,125.

Unions said the company's figure underestimated the number of job cuts as Sanofi reshuffles its laboratories into regional research hubs at the expense of smaller centers. There are thousands of employees that will be hit by layoffs and a high number of internal transfers, Pascal Vially, a representative for the CFDT trade union, told Reuters. Sanofi has scaled back planned layoffs under pressure from the French government, which has been struggling to contain a rising unemployment rate, and said it could shed around 900 jobs in France in the next three years - fewer than the 2,500 predicted by trade unions. But the 900 cuts - to be achieved through voluntary redundancies, internal transfers and early retirements - do not include the 640 jobs at a cancer research centre in Toulouse, which Sanofi wants to exit. The unions will discuss Sanofi's plan with Industry Minister Arnaud Montebourg at a meeting on October 12, a day after the company is due to provide details of the cuts.

Chief Executive Officer Steve Bennett told Reuters in an exclusive interview that Janice Chaffin, consumer business president, will leave the company as part of the restructuring, which will usher in 10 product-focused divisions including security, cloud and backup software. Bennett, brought onboard last year with a mandate to turn around the faltering security software specialist, also said the company will pay out its first-ever dividend starting next quarter, targeting a 2.5 percent yield based on its Jan. 22 closing price of $20.86. We looked at five different scenarios and modeled them all and talked about them all, Bennett said in an exclusive interview. They included divesting specific units among Symantec's portfolio such as a highly profitable consumer anti-virus business and a sluggish storage management and backup software unit. We can create a lot more value by running the company, Bennett told Reuters in the interview ahead of a meeting with analysts on Wednesday afternoon. The former head of Intuit Inc and a General Electric veteran would not say how many managers would be laid off, but managers at his company on average have fewer than five people reporting to them among the comany's 20,000 employees. That is about half as many as managers at a typical company, he noted. Symantec expects $275 million in severance payments as a result of the layoffs, which will be conducted through June. Bennett replaced Enrique Salem as CEO in July and vowed to turn around Symantec, saying he would apply lessons he learned from the GE corporate playbook during the more than two decades he managed a variety of the industrial conglomerate's  businesses. Details of the company's restructuring came the same day Symantec reported quarterly earnings that beat expectations and said it was splitting the chief executive and chairman jobs.

Protesters held banners and shouted slogans against Microsoft's hostile takeover and violent layoffs for five hours until they had sore throats, said the employee who participated in the demonstration and so declined to be identified. The protesters would convene on Friday afternoon to discuss demands they would present to the company, the employee said. Microsoft announced on July 17 the deepest job cuts in its 39-year history, amounting to 18,000 positions. Microsoft said up to 12,500 of those jobs would come from Nokia, the Finnish handset maker it bought in April in a $7.2 billion friendly takeover. The protests took place at a Beijing research center and factory employing 2,400 people, according to a statement from organizers, and amounted to the latest in a string of troubles for the U.S. software giant in China. Microsoft offices in four cities were raided this week by Chinese authorities as part of an ongoing anti-monopoly investigation announced on Tuesday.

Dart sales are down 33 percent so far this year for the first jointly designed vehicle in the Fiat-Chrysler marriage, built on the same architecture of the Alfa Romeo Giulietta. In 2014 results through February, Dart fell to ninth place among compact cars in the U.S. market, from eighth place last year, overtaken by the Forte from Kia Motors Corp. Toyota Motor Corp's Corolla, the most popular compact car, has sold nearly five times as well as the 10,000 Dart sedans through February, according to Autodata Corp. The Chrysler spokeswoman would not give production cut figures at Belvidere, saying only that the temporary layoffs were meant to balance vehicle supply with current sales demand. The plant, located about 70 miles northwest of Chicago, has about 4,500 employees. Dennis Virag, president of the Automotive Consulting Group in Michigan, said Chrysler is struggling to sell the Dart because it lags competitors despite improvements over the previous model, the Caliber. It's a good-looking car, but it's under-powered. Dodge is just not a brand that's in the minds of the customers when they go out looking for a small car, Virag said. That was a perception Chrysler hoped to change with the Dart. Gary Brown, a Long Island, New York store owner who heads the Chrysler Dealer Council, said a relatively late model year change has left an inordinate amount of 2013 Dart models on dealer lots. Auto sales website AutoTrader.com shows there are twice as many 2013 models of Dart on dealer lots as 2014 models. Alec Gutierrez, an analyst with industry research firm Kelley Blue Book, said Dodge in February increased the average incentives discount by $400 from a year earlier, to $2,200 per vehicle.

The U.S. carrier expects fewer than 40 percent of those it sent notices to, or 4,400 people, will actually be laid off in November and December, spokesman Bruce Hicks said. The layoff notices were required under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, which requires employees to be informed 60 days before major layoffs or plant closures. The notices will look worse than the actual layoffs, said Jamie Horwitz, a spokesman for the Transport Workers Union, which represents workers that received WARN Act notices. Horwitz said about 800 employees had agreed to leave American voluntarily, a move that will further reduce the number of expected layoffs. According to a letter sent by American to the Transport Workers Union, notices of potential layoff were sent to more than 3,000 workers in Dallas and Fort Worth, Texas, where American is based; about 3,000 people in Tulsa, Oklahoma; just over 1,200 in Miami; nearly 1,000 in New York; about 900 in Chicago and lesser numbers in other U.S. cities. In February, American outlined plans to cut as many as 14,000 jobs as it looks to streamline in bankruptcy. American Airlines, the third-largest U.S. air carrier, filed for Chapter 11 protection in November, citing a need to decrease labor costs. The company has signed non-disclosure agreements with carriers including US Airways Group as it evaluates a potential merger. US Airways won the backing of unions that represent American ramp workers, pilots and flight attendants earlier this year by promising to preserve thousands of jobs should a merger with American occur. Rise in Cancellations American's flight cuts for September and October were set partly due to an increase in pilot sick days and greater maintenance reports by flight crews led to cancellations and delays, Hicks said. American operates about 1,700 flights a day. Last week, the unit of AMR Corp AAMRQ.PK began implementing cost cuts for its unionized pilots after gaining bankruptcy court approval to abandon its collective bargaining agreement with the Allied Pilots Association. According to data from tracking service FlightAware.com, American Airlines in recent days has cancelled more flights than other major U.S. airlines. On Monday, for example, American cancelled about 2.1 percent of its scheduled flights, or about 73, compared with an average of 0.4 percent for other major U.S. airlines that day, FlightAware said. Mark Duell, vice president of operations at FlightAware, said cancellations at American have been well above the rest of the U.S. airline industry for the past two weeks. Pilot union spokesman Gregg Overman said on Tuesday that sick rates for American pilots have not deviated from normal historical rates, based on the union's tracking. He said there have been more mechanical delays. The pilots are the only major work group at American that have not agreed on contract concessions since the airline filed for bankruptcy in November last year. In a message on Tuesday, union president Keith Wilson said pilots were angry since American began imposing new work terms that cut their compensation and benefits. The pilots union is conducting a strike vote through October 3, but has previously said it will not walk out unless it is legal to do so.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/pennsylvania-budget-idUSL1N0B5EDN20130206","UPDATE 1-Pension reform, layoffs in proposed Pennsylvania budget","","February 6, 2013 /  1:46 AM / 4 years ago","","By Mark Shade HARRISBURG, Penn., Feb 5 (Reuters) - The commonwealth of Pennsylvania, a latecomer to major public pension reform, would enroll new hires in a defined contribution plan but limit increases in the state's own contributions, under a proposal unveiled on Tuesday by Governor Tom Corbett. By mid-2012, most states had proposed new changes to their pension systems amid ballooning costs and stagnant revenues. But Pennsylvania had not made changes since 2010, when it increased the retirement age to 65 for most employees. Corbett, a Republican, said in July that he intended to propose reforms, but he didn't reveal details until he presented his fiscal 2014 budget on Tuesday. The state's two public pension funds, one for public school employees and another for state employees, have total unfunded liabilities of $41 billion and are, combined, funded at about 68 percent. An 80 percent funding level is considered healthy. Without changes, pension costs are projected to eat up about 60 percent of all new revenues in the fiscal 2014 budget, or more than $500 million that could be spent on critical services, according to budget documents. The entire system of state pensions has become a mountain of debt, and the avalanche could bury our economic growth, swallow up benefits for our elderly, education for our children, and transportation for our economy, Corbett said in his budget address. Layoffs, No Medicaid Expansion Corbett also asked state lawmakers on Tuesday for layoffs, transportation investments and a $90 million increase in basic education funding in his proposed budget. The Republican governor's $28.4 billion blueprint, if approved by lawmakers, is $679 million, or about 2.4 percent, higher than the current budget and includes no tax increases. Corbett said he will not expand Pennsylvania's Medicaid system under federal healthcare reform because it lacks flexibility and would cost the state $1 billion through fiscal 2106 to implement. He also proposed 400 layoffs, in part by consolidating state health centers and by closing New Castle Youth Development Center. Pennsylvania's constitution requires a balanced budget to be adopted by June 30. His budget also seeks to boost transportation funding. He proposed gradually removing the cap on a state tax on wholesale oil distributors, which could generate $5.3 billion over five years if approved. The new revenue, the governor said, would help pay for road, bridge and other transportation infrastructure improvements. And in keeping with announcements in the weeks leading up to his budget presentation, Corbett said he wants to privatize the management of the Pennsylvania Lottery, sell the state's liquor stores, and provide nearly $15 million to train about 300 new state police troopers. State, Local Contributions Capped Corbett's pension proposal would not affect benefits already accrued by current employees, nor will retirees lose any benefits. The plan would, however, reduce future pension benefits for current employees by changing a factor in the equation used to determine benefits. An employee's future benefits are usually calculated by multiplying years of service, annual salary and a fixed number, in this case 2.5 percent. Corbett's proposal would reduce that number to 2 percent and require current employees to pay more if they wanted to make up the difference. And new employees would be automatically enrolled in a 401(a) plan that would require them to contribute at least 6.25 percent of their salary. Rick Bloomingdale, president of the Pennsylvania AFL-CIO,  said Corbett is looking to cure the pension crisis on the backs of current employees. (They are) short-changing the commitment they've made to the workers that work for the state of Pennsylvania and the school district employees. They have an obligation. They made a promise to these people, Bloomingdale said. The AFL-CIO is the largest U.S. federation of trade unions. While it pushes some of the state's pension problem onto current and future employees, Corbett's plan also eases the burden, temporarily, for the state and local governments, some of which have faced serious fiscal challenges during the U.S. recovery. The 2010 state law put a so-called collar on how much public employers would have to increase pension contributions each year, with annual increases that would not rise by more than 4.5 percent after fiscal 2013. Corbett's new plan would push off that target rate increase to ease pressure on state and local budgets. For fiscal 2014, the increase would be limited to just 2.25 percent, rising 0.5 percentage point annually until reaching 4.5 percent or until the rate is equal to the employer's annual required contribution. Asked whether capping contribution increases would perpetuate the state's unfunded liability, Corbett spokeswoman Christine Cronkright said people have to look at the whole package. We have looked at this very holistically in terms of what we need now, and what we need down the road to be able to help solve this problem in the long term, she said. You can't just look at this portion of the plan ... without looking at the rest of it."
"https://www.reuters.com/article/spirit-aerosystm-discriminationcase-idUSL1N0MN0U020140326","Ex-Spirit Aero staff claim their high health costs led to layoffs","","March 26, 2014 /  5:10 PM / 3 years ago","","NEW YORK, March 26 (Reuters) - Former employees of Spirit Aerosystems Holdings Inc, a major supplier to plane makers Boeing and Airbus, filed charges with federal agencies on Wednesday alleging that Spirit illegally used health care information to target those who were costing the company most for layoffs. Ten former employees claim they were selected when the company cut 360 positions last summer because they or covered family members had costly disabilities or medical conditions. Spirit's health care administrators shared information with high-level managers so that Spirit - in its role as employer - could identify the employees associated with the most expensive medical claims and target them for termination, according to one of the charges filed on Wednesday and reviewed by Reuters. The charges, filed with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the Office of Civil Rights, request class status and also allege age discrimination, disability discrimination and violations of privacy rights, said Diane King, a lawyer with King and Greisen, a Denver law firm that assisted the employees. Ken Evans, a spokesman for Spirit, said the allegations are filled with distortions and misstatements. Personal health information is certainly not used to make layoff decisions. All of the charges relate to the July 2013 layoffs, when Spirit cut the positions at its facilities in Wichita, Kansas, including 221 members of the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace (SPEEA), a Seattle-based union that also represents workers at Boeing. Evans said SPEEA had made unfounded allegations before, including several charges filed with the National Labor Relations Board last year related to the job cuts that were either withdrawn or dismissed by the board. While terminations are always difficult, all such decisions are based on job-related, non-discriminatory criteria, and Spirit has made every effort to carry them out with respect for our employees, Evans said in a statement. The job cuts were necessary in a competitive, cost-sensitive industry, Evans said, and Spirit provided the laid-off employees with severance and help finding new jobs. Pressure to Cut Costs King said circumstantial evidence supports the employees belief that top Spirit managers misused individual employees' health care information, but she declined to provide details. She did not immediately provide any statistical analysis showing that a higher proportion of those with expensive medical costs were among those laid off. Spirit has been under pressure to cut costs and since 2012 has set aside more than $2.2 billion in provisions for future losses on unprofitable contracts. The company was formed in 2005 when Boeing Co spun off some of its facilities. It makes parts for all major Boeing jets, including about 40 fuselages a month for Boeing's top-selling 737 jetliner. Spirit also makes parts for Airbus, Bombardier Inc , Gulfstream, a unit of General Dynamics Corp  and Mitsubishi Aircraft Corp, owned by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Toyota Motor Corp. The losses at Spirit prompted it to undertake a strategic review last year and consider sale of facilities in Oklahoma. If the employee charges are substantiated, penalties could include back pay, out-of-pocket health care costs, job reinstatement or forward pay through retirement in lieu of employment, plus attorneys fees, according to lawyers with knowledge of these kinds of claims. The case raises questions about possible misuse of health information gathered by companies through self insurance or wellness programs. In interviews, two former Spirit employees said they were singled out by upper management and that their own supervisors didn't know their performance ratings were being cut until just before it happened. They tried to make it look like it was performance issues, said Debra, 54, a former quality analyst, whose husband is in need of two organ transplants. She and other employees and family members who spoke with Reuters declined to have their full names used out of concern for the privacy of their medical and employment information. She said she received a B retention rating on Spirit's A-C rating scale during a previous review. On July 1, her rating was lowered to a C, and she was told she was not eligible for recall rights if she was laid off. Her direct supervisor wanted to give her an A, she said. On July 25, she and the other employees were let go. Scott, 51, a planner, said his rating also was downgraded to C from B at the same time and he was also laid off. He said his daughter requires expensive medical treatment for two conditions.    (Reporting by Alwyn Scott; Editing by Martin Howell)"

(Reuters) - Halliburton, Statoil ASA, Hess Corp and other North Dakota energy companies have decided, for now, not to lay off staff in the No. 2 U.S. oil producing state, hoping to be prepared for any prolonged rebound in crude prices. Many oil producers and their contractors are trying to strike a balance between cutting costs and maintaining workforce reserves after a more-than 50 percent drop in oil prices since last June.  The drop has made some oil patch investors anxious that North Dakota could experience a third oil bust after slumps in the 1950s and 1980s. Local business leaders, though, say they're confident the state's economy can abide the slowdown.  Indeed, oil prices are nothing if not volatile, up about 19 percent in the past four trading days after plunging for months. Whiting Petroleum Corp, the largest North Dakota oil producer, has no plans to lay off any of its 507 employees in the state, spokesman Eric Hagen said.  Oilfield service provider Halliburton has told its roughly 1,500 North Dakota employees that job cuts are not coming, for now. The update came in a letter to staff from Brent Eslinger, senior district manager for Halliburton in Williston, considered capital of North Dakota's oil patch. Halliburton spokeswoman Susie McMichael added that the company will continue to monitor the business environment and cut costs as needed. Hess Corp, the state's third-largest oil producer and one that uses Halliburton to hydraulically fracture wells, has no plans to cut North Dakota staff. We're all about lean efficiencies, but there are no plans for layoffs, Hess spokesman John Roper said. Other large North Dakota producers, including Oasis Petroleum Inc and Statoil, have said they have no plans to reduce their workforce. EOG Resources Inc hasn't announced any layoffs, spokeswoman K Leonard said. To be sure, all energy-related companies in North Dakota's oil patch are hunkering down. Many of the state's oil producers, including Hess and Oasis, have cut 2015 capital budgets. Whiting and EOG release spending plans later this month. While there are nearly 800 wells needing to be fracked in North Dakota, oil producers can wait up to a year to do so. Hess, for instance, plans to bring fewer wells online in 2015. Halliburton's announcement last month that it will lay off 1,000 in the eastern hemisphere - as well as similar plans by peers Schlumberger NV and Baker Hughes Inc, which Halliburton is buying for roughly $35 billion - sparked concern that the companies would cull large portions of their North Dakota staffs, steps that would have a negative economic ripple effect. Such fears, for now, appear unwarranted.     Continental Resources Inc, North Dakota's second-largest oil producer, did not return a call seeking comment on staffing levels. Chief Executive Harold Hamm, though, bragged in a Tuesday press release that Continental's North Dakota acreage continues to provide exceptional results.

The layoffs, primarily in the company's engineering and product functions, come a week after Dorsey took over as permanent CEO. (1.usa.gov/1Gbb31A) Shares of Twitter, which had about 4,100 employees globally as of June 30, rose as much as 6.7 percent to $30.68 on Tuesday.  We feel strongly that engineering will move much faster with a smaller and nimbler team, while remaining the biggest percentage of our workforce, Dorsey said in a letter to employees. And the rest of the organization will be streamlined in parallel. FBN Securities analyst Shebly Seyrafi, however, said the company needed to focus also on rationalizing sales along with engineering to achieve its margin targets.          Dorsey, who was appointed Twitter's interim CEO in July after Dick Costolo resigned, has been candid about the company's problems.  Twitter's second-quarter growth in average monthly users was the slowest since the company went public on Nov. 7, 2013. Its stock nearly tripled to a record high of $74.73 in December 2013, but has fallen about 60 percent since.  The Twitter logo is shown on smartphone in front of a displayed stock graph in central Bosnian town of Zenica, Bosnia and Herzegovina, in this April 29, 2015 photo illustration.Dado RuvicThe general thinking is that Twitter has a product problem, which is why they picked Jack to come in. You would normally not be cutting in engineering if you have a product problem. So I scratched my head a little bit on that, Seyrafi told Reuters. Since Dorsey took over as interim CEO, Twitter has rolled out a buy now button that allows users to make purchases and a feature that highlights the best tweets and content. Cuts in the engineering department could hurt the company's ability to continue growing at a robust pace, RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney wrote in a note. Twitter said it expected about $10 million-$20 million in severance costs and $5 million-$15 million in restructuring charges. Twitter expects to record most of these pretax restructuring charges in the fourth quarter. Technology news website Re/code first reported the planned layoffs on Oct. 9. Twitter said it expected its third-quarter revenue and adjusted EBITDA to meet or top the higher end of its forecasts. The company, which will report its third-quarter results on Oct. 27, has forecast revenue of $545 million-$560 million and adjusted EBITDA of $110 million-$115 million.

The Labor Department advisory said the circumstances surrounding the planned cuts were too uncertain to require defense and other federal contractors to comply with provisions of a law requiring employees to be notified 60 days before major layoffs or plant closures. Under current law, the U.S. Defense Department is facing across-the-board budget cuts beginning January 2 aimed at cutting $500 billion in projected national security spending over the next decade. Under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining and Notification ACT, companies have to send out notices 60 days ahead of time advising their employees of impending mass layoffs or plant closures. If notices were sent out ahead of the impending budget cuts, the workers would be receiving them just before the November 6 presidential election. Apart from the January reductions, the Pentagon is working to trim spending by $487 billion as ordered by the Budget Control Act last year. Lawmakers from both parties say they oppose the across-the-board cuts that will hit in January under a process known as sequestration, but they have not been able to agree on alternative ways to reduce spending. Representative Gerry Connolly, a Democrat from Virginia, said on Monday Congress should cancel its annual August recess to focus instead on stopping the $500 billion in automatic spending cuts. Congress has only 11 more legislative days, he said, to broker a deal halting the cuts before the November election. If the two parties are unable to agree on a deal before the end of the term, the issue may be taken up in a post-election lame-duck session of Congress. We got to stay in session and solve this problem, Connolly told reporters after speaking at a rally to protest sequestration. It is not rocket science. Call for Compromise The rally, held by Northrop Grumman Corp, brought together defense industry leaders and members of the Virginia Congressional delegation, as well as Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell, who urged Congress and the White House to find a solution to stop the expansive budget cuts, citing the more than 200,000 Virginia jobs at risk if a deal is not reached. More than 2.14 million jobs nationally could be lost because of sequestration, a George Mason University analysis for the Aerospace Industries Association said. McDonnell, a Republican, called for a compromise between Republicans and Democrats in Congress, saying a practical solution that includes cuts and revenue increases must be agreed on. We know we got to get our fiscal house in order, but it's got to be in a way that is systematic, that is practical, that looks out for the American war fighter and the men and women of the private sector that support them, McDonnell said. That's not the way this was done. The Labor Department decision drew swift condemnation from Republican Representative Buck McKeon, head of the Armed Services committee, who called it politically motivated. McKeon said instead of trying to find a way to avert the cuts, the president is focused on preventing advance notice to American workers that their jobs are at risk and on perpetuating uncertainty. People will still get laid off because of the president's irresponsibility, but they won't have the notice to protect themselves and their families, McKeon said. The president is doing nothing to look out for the American worker and is using our troops as leverage to push his failed political agenda. The Labor Department said that the law did not apply in the current circumstances because while sequestration may occur, efforts are being made to avoid it. So even the occurrence of sequestration is not necessarily foreseeable, the guidance said. It said relevant case law would not require employers to provide notices under the current conditions.

President Francois Hollande rode to power in a presidential runoff last month on a promise to tackle soaring unemployment, which has reached the highest level since 1999. Polls regularly show unemployment ranking among the French's top concerns, adding pressure on Hollande as his Socialist Party seeks a majority in parliament in a two-round legislative election on June 10 and 17. The push to make firing more difficult in France, where making layoffs is already tightly regulated and often costly for employers, contrasts with moves under way in other euro zone countries such as Italy and Spain to make job cuts easier. With the economy stalling, Labour Minister Michel Sapin said urgent measures were needed against unemployment and that he aimed to put forward legislation after the summer break. The main idea is to make layoffs so expensive for companies that it's not worth it, Sapin said in an interview with France Info radio. It's not a question of sanctions, but workers have to have compensation at the right level, he said. The 10-Percent Threshold Sapin, a former finance minister and long-time friend of Hollande, said the government could not stand by idly as some companies cut workers just to improve profitability and boost their dividends to shareholders. Industry Minister Arnaud Montebourg is also planning legislation that would force companies to sell plants they want to get rid of at market prices to avoid closures and job losses. The government and unions are bracing for a wave of layoffs after the legislative election, fearing companies have put off job cuts until after the election period. Data from the INSEE statistics institute showed on Thursday that France's jobless rate hit the psychologically important threshold of 10 percent in the first quarter of the year. Unemployment in France has now risen even higher than in the wake of the 2008-2009 financial crisis, rising from 9.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2011 to the highest level since the third quarter of 1999. The rate for mainland France rose to 9.6 percent from 9.3 percent in the final three months of 2011 also to hit its highest level since the third quarter of 1999. For a table of the figures: Sapin said in an interview with Les Echos business daily that the budget for state-aided jobs needed to be raised, or else 112,000 jobs on such contracts could be put at risk in the second half of the year. That would be extremely harmful at a time when all resources need to be mobilised against unemployment, he said, adding that the state-run jobs agency also needed more funds. However, Hollande's government is facing growing pressure from the European Commission and ratings agencies to cut spending in order to meet public deficit targets as promised. With the legislative election looming, the government is being careful not to spell out how it will keep its deficit-reduction plans on track until an independent audit of the public finances is handed in after the race."

The New York-based company is the latest to shrink as the equities trading business slows globally. Liquidnet, which employed 331 people worldwide as of early September, is also considering cutting staff at its London operations, where it employs about 45 people, spokeswoman Melissa Kanter said. Liquidnet has taken steps to reduce headcount in selected parts of our business, reflecting the results of a review of our operations and the slowdown in global equities trading, the company said in a statement. The layoffs highlight that even fully electronic businesses are vulnerable to the steep decline in trading volume that has afflicted the stock market since the second half of 2009. Liquidnet is best known for matching, or crossing, huge orders of stocks from buyers and sellers. The cuts affected senior and junior staffers across all departments, Kanter said.  At its peak around 2008, Liquidnet employed about 470 people. The layoffs follow the demise of several small traditional equities brokers this year and severe downsizing on the stock- trading desks of giants such as Nomura Securities and Bank of America Those firms have high overhead costs because of their need to produce research and other services from analysts, traders and salespeople. Nomura earlier this month said it would shift its labor-intensive cash equities operation to the all-electronic model of its Instinet affiliate. Commission charges also have plummeted over the last 10 years, although Liquidnet still charges a relatively high 2-cents-a-share core commission on trading orders. Its average order size is 50,000 shares, but because it does not service high-frequency traders it is vulnerable to prolonged declines in stock volume. Liquidnet, which was founded in 2000, filed for an initial public offering in 2008 but dropped those plans because of the financial crisis. Also this week, RBC Capital Markets reorganized its electronic trading operations. Brian Suth, co-head of the Canadian bank's global trading unit since January, has left the company. Co-head Thomas Gajer will continue as sole global head of electronic sales and trading. RBC Capital also appointed Gaurav Mundra to a new position as U.S. head of electronic sales and trading. Both report to Bobby Grubert, head of U.S. equities. Suth, whose LinkedIn page said he ran RBC's electronic sales team from late 2009 to the beginning of this year, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. RBC remains fully committed to the electronic equities business, spokesman Kevin Foster said. Some of the layoffs at Liquidnet were reported earlier by Bloomberg News."

Such a move would mean the vast majority of the 900 jobs become redundant. The plant directly employs 500 staff at the site, and there are around 400 contractors. The administrators today met with staff and announced that approximately 180 staff will be made redundant next week, PwC said on Monday. Conversations will take place over the following days with affected individuals. Workers were told about the layoffs at a meeting at which it was also announced there would be further redundancies in July, a union source told Reuters. We get paid on (June) 22nd, and the first wave will be after that, with the second wave at the end of July.

Igor Yusufov is still interested in buying the plant, a source familiar with the matter said, adding that the former Russian energy minister would want a technical audit of the refinery before a deal could close, which would take until July."

The investment bank and asset manager said fourth-quarter earnings nearly tripled as it set aside less of its revenue for pay and earned more from trading. For the full year, employees were paid just 37.9 percent of the bank's revenue, the second-lowest proportion since Goldman went public in 1999. We don't look to overpay anybody, said Harvey Schwartz, a Goldman Sachs trading executive who will become the bank's chief financial officer at the end of this month. Even if a smaller share of revenue went to employees, Goldman Sachs managed to increase average employee pay last year  because it laid off staff and took in more revenue. In other words, the bank's remaining employees were more productive, but much of the benefit went to shareholders. Analysts said other banks are likely to feel pressure to keep their compensation expenses in check after Goldman's results. But for Morgan Stanley, the second-biggest stand-alone U.S. investment bank, paying out a lower percentage of its revenue to employees could be tough because analysts believe its revenue fell last year. Goldman missed the worst pitfalls of the financial crisis but has suffered public relations embarrassments from trades it executed during the crisis and from executives' comments afterward. The bank is struggling to figure out how to navigate the post-crisis world, in which clients trade less and regulations and capital rules crimp profits in many businesses. Layoffs, Pay Cuts With many banks facing the same problems, analysts expect layoffs across Wall Street. Morgan Stanley plans 1,600 job cuts in 2013, while Goldman cut 900 jobs in 2012, equal to about 3 percent of its work force. But laying staff off will not be enough, and employee pay will likely fall too, analysts said. Brad Hintz, a former Morgan Stanley treasurer who is now an analyst at Bernstein Research, estimates that across Wall Street average pay in trading businesses could fall 20 percent. There's only one way to get returns up on Wall Street, and that's to cut the compensation of the employees, Hintz said. Investors have been pressuring banks to pay less of their revenue to employees. In 2011, investors pressed Morgan Stanley executives to pay somewhere closer to 30 percent of the bank's revenue to employees, instead of around 50 percent, according to one person at those meetings. Goldman posted fourth-quarter earnings of $2.8 billion, or $5.60 per share, up from $978 million, or $1.84 per share, in the same period a year ago. Analysts' average earnings forecast was $3.78 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Return on Equity Rises Setting aside less money for pay helped Goldman post a return on equity of 16.5 percent for the fourth quarter on an annualized basis, the highest level in almost three years. The figure is closely watched by investors as a measure of how well the company is wringing profit from shareholders' equity. In the fourth quarter of 2011, the annualized return on equity was 5.8 percent, but before the crisis that figure often topped 30 percent. On a conference call, Goldman's Schwartz said that what put the bank in a position to boost its return on equity were the steps we took over the last two years in terms of managing expenses and being quite disciplined. Goldman shares rose $5.50 or 4 percent to $141.09. A significant part of Goldman's earnings boom came from improvements in market values in the stock and bond markets, as well as increased activity from clients. The bank said it took in significantly higher revenues from credit products and mortgages in its bond-trading business. Its investing and lending division, which earns money mostly from higher values on Goldman's stock and bond investments, reported nearly $2 billion worth of revenue in the fourth quarter, compared with $872 million a year earlier. But gains were broad, with revenue up across each of Goldman's business lines, from investment banking to investment management. Overall, revenue jumped 53 percent to $9.2 billion. The bank said compensation expense, typically the biggest cost for Wall Street firms, fell 11 percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier. The expense was just 21 percent of net revenue, roughly half of what the firm usually pays out to employees. For the full year, the bank paid employees just 37.9 percent of revenue, the lowest percentage since 2009's 35.8 percent. That year was a record for earnings, but for the last five years the figure has averaged closer to 42 percent. In 2011, the figure was 42.4 percent. On average, Goldman employees earned $399,506 apiece in 2012, up from $367,057 in 2011. Separately, the bank agreed to pay $330 million in cash and other assistance to troubled mortgage borrowers to end a case-by-case review of foreclosures required by regulators. The settlement stems from the Litton Loan Servicing business that Goldman bought in 2007 and sold in 2011. Other big banks reporting results on Wednesday were JPMorgan Chase & Co and BNY Mellon Corp. Both firms reported an increase in earnings.   (Reporting by Lauren Tara LaCapra; Editing by Gerald E. McCormick, Chizu Nomiyama, John Wallace and Phil Berlowitz)"

Switzerland's biggest bank, which announced the layoffs last week along with a plan to virtually eliminate its bond trading business, has a massive trading floor in Stamford, Conn., comprised primarily people who trade and sell bonds. Several fixed-income employees in Stamford and New York City were fired by phone this week because the devastating storm Sandy that hit the region on Monday prevented them from traveling to their offices, a UBS spokeswoman said on Thursday. Still, UBS and Connecticut officials said that the Swiss bank will carefully work to ensure that a sizeable staff remains working in that state east of New York. At stake is a $20 million interest-free development loan that UBS got from the state in May. The bank signed a contract committing to keeping at least 2,000 people employed in the state, and has agreed to forgive the loan after five years if all terms of their contract are met. I have been assured that the layoffs will be structured in such a way that UBS will be able to meet the obligations it has under the agreement, Catherine Smith, commissioner of Connecticut's Department of Economic and Community Development told Reuters. We feel relatively comfortable about it. UBS spokeswoman Katrina Byrne declined to discuss the nature of the jobs that will remain in Connecticut but said more than 3,500 bank employees now work in the state. We are honoring our commitment, she said. Smith said she checked with UBS this week after reading press reports that some 3,000 employees around Stamford would lose their jobs. In announcing the bank's plan to ax 10,000 employees over three years as it seeks to build a new business model, UBS Chief Executive Sergio Ermotti did not spell out details of the cuts. But he said last week that about 30 percent of the total investment banking layoffs will occur in the United States. Smith and two UBS officials said the exact number of layoffs in the United States, and the areas that will be affected, are still being determined. The state's concerns show how cash-strapped local economies have been affected by the global bloodbath in a financial services sector that has announced more than 100,000 job reductions this year.  Many municipalities and other local government bodies are increasingly doling out sweetheart deals such as the loan to UBS in a bid to attract and keep businesses in their tax base. UBS got the state handout earlier this year as it threatened to transfer many jobs to Manhattan. That negotiating leverage also meant the state had to agree to a looser contract than it would have liked. Some bankers said UBS can easily keep its employment commitment and still replace high-paid banking jobs with lower-paying ones, yielding less tax revenue for the state. Smith, who was chief executive of U.S. retirement services for Dutch bank ING Group before taking the state job last year, conceded the UBS contract was looser than many others it has negotiated by not including growth or job-level targets. We were faced with the concept they would actually pick up and leave, which was not a pretty picture, Smith said, referring to the bank's threats to move its traders to Manhattan. We still value them as a partner in the Stamford community in terms of all they do for job creation and community-mindedness. When UBS opened its Stamford trading floor in 2002, it boasted that the space, about the size of about two U.S. football fields, was the world's largest. UBS has been slammed by trading and other investment banking losses since the financial crisis of 2008, punctuating other crises in which it has been accused of abetting tax-avoidance schemes for wealthy Americans and participating with other banks in fraudulent fixing of the London Interbank Offered Rate, a key determinant of interest rates. Through the first half of 2012 its investment banking revenue was down another 55 percent from the same period in 2011. The contract with Connecticut was negotiated under a prior regime of UBS executives who were committed to the fixed-income business but lost their jobs following a summer trading scandal. Connecticut Governor Dannel Malloy, who presided over the ceremony where the job commitment was made, is a former mayor of Stamford."

Kudrin resigned from the government in 2011 to protest against soaring military spending, but is believed to still have the respect of and access to President Vladimir Putin.  The rouble has lost half of its value against the dollar since the start of last year as a result of plunging oil prices and Western sanctions tied to the Ukraine crisis, making it very difficult for Russia to borrow from Western capital markets. I was predicting tough times, but I had not expected them to be so tough, Kudrin told Reuters on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos.  Consumer prices have risen sharply. Large layoffs have begun. The Moscow construction sector has seen 100,000 people being laid off. We see signs of crisis in the auto industry. There will be also a serious slowdown in modernization and deployment of Western technology, he said. He said the economy would shrink by over 4 percent this year if oil prices remain low. Russia has a relatively small unemployment rate of over five percent. Under Kudrin, Russia accumulated more than $500 billion in reserves, including around $160 billion in two reserve funds which can be used in difficult times to protect the rouble and the economy. Earlier this week, Russia's central bank said its gold and foreign exchange reserves had dropped below $380 billion as it continued to protect the currency and authorities spent money on bailing out banks and companies. With social spending representing a third of the overall budget and military expenditure at 35 percent, Russia is poised to exhaust its two reserve funds in 18 months if oil prices stay at around current levels of $50 a barrel. Kudrin said Russia needed to urgently cut outlays to make sure it had enough funds to protect the economy for longer. If oil stays at $50, our reserve fund shall be spread over three years, while we switch to lower spendings and conduct reforms, he said. A huge military modernization program should be carried out over 15 years rather 10, which would also save money, he added. Some European politicians and businessmen have in recent weeks called for a re-engagement with Russia and the easing of sanctions. But Kudrin said the majority of Western business people and public opinion were still against this idea, making the removal of sanctions an unlikely prospect.  Editing by Crispian Balmer"

The gain was one of the most surprising findings in the annual revisions to New York City's unemployment data, according to James Brown, a market analyst with the Department of Labor. Officials had feared Wall St. would lose jobs after profit-hit banks and brokerages announced thousands of layoffs. The data did not indicate whether those layoffs never happened or whether banks simply hired more staff than they fired. In January, Wall Street hired 600 workers, bringing its total workforce to 171,300 employees, according to the Labor Department. This sector galvanizes the economies of New York City and New York state as it drives a host of other service companies to hire workers, from accounting firms to restaurants. Nor was that the only unexpected finding. The benchmark revisions also increased the 2011 annual average employment in the city's private sector by 43,800 positions, a 1.4 percent increase. It's a significantly stronger upward revision; all indications are that we are doing a lot better than we thought, said Labor Department Market Analyst James Brown by telephone. Still, he noted the city's pre-recession unemployment rate hovered around 4 percent to 4.5 percent -- about half the latest rate -- which suggests the recovery is far from complete. The overall financial sector, which includes banks and insurance, hired 7,800 people from January 2011 to January 2012, bringing its payroll to a total of 440,600. New York City added private sector jobs at a rate almost 60 percent greater than the country as a whole in 2011, and over the last two years, New York City created more jobs than the next 10 largest cities combined, Mayor Michael Bloomberg said in a statement. New York state's economy also performed better than first reported, according to the benchmark revisions. As of December 2011, the state had recouped 76 percent of the private sector jobs lost in the 2008-2009 recession, the Labor Department said in a statement. Still, the state's unemployment rate rose a tenth of a percentage point to 8.3 percent in January from a year earlier. New York City's jobless rate rose fourth-tenths of a percentage point to 9.3 percent over the same time. Reporting By Joan Gralla; Editing by Andrew Hay"

The agencies affected are the Central Intelligence Agency, the Office of Director of National Intelligence and 15 others, the officials said. The CIA expects to furlough about 12,500 civilians working for the agency, according to the sources. But specific numbers for other agencies were not immediately clear, the officials told Reuters. The CIA and White House declined to comment. No uniformed military personnel will be affected, officials said. Some large spy agencies under control of the Pentagon employ as many, or more, military personnel than civilian workers. These agencies include the Defense Intelligence Agency and the National Security Agency, whose secretive electronic eavesdropping methods recently become the focus of controversy following leaks by former contractor Edward Snowden. The U.S. government partially shut down for the first time in 17 years on Tuesday as a standoff between President Barack Obama and congressional Republicans over healthcare reforms closed museums and national parks and slowed everything from trade negotiations to medical research. Federal agencies cut back services and up to 1 million workers were put on unpaid leave. Shawn Turner, chief spokesman for the Director of National Intelligence, declined to discuss specifics of the layoffs but acknowledged that the performance of spy agencies could be affected if the shutdown continues. The Intelligence Community's ability to identify threats and provide information for a broad set of national security decisions will be diminished for the duration, Turner said. The immediate and significant reduction in employees on the job means that we will assume greater risk and our ability to support emerging intelligence requirements will be curtailed, he said. The fraction of Intelligence Community employees who remain on the job will be stretched to the limit and forced to focus only on the most critical security needs. Some officials said that while spy agencies play critical roles in gathering information on foreign governments and potential militant threats, they are subject to the same budget laws as other government units. Under current circumstances, they must temporarily lay off large numbers of staff to comply with the law, the officials said. Precisely how intelligence operations will be affected by the shutdown, and precise numbers of individuals affected, remain classified, officials said. However, among the types of activities likely to be cut back as a result of the furloughs are strategic planning and analyses and some foreign liaison activities. In many parts of the world, U.S. agencies rely heavily on their partnerships with local spy outfits, such as Britain's MI5 and MI6 and Israel's Mossad."

President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono rushed through a last-minute regulation on Saturday giving copper miners Freeport and Newmont Mining Corp a reprieve from a controversial mineral export ban, but imposed an escalating tax to limit the amount of mineral concentrate exports over the next few years. Freeport has halted copper concentrate exports from its port in Papua and is seeking more clarity on the new policy. It also needs a new export permit to resume shipments. Under the regulation, the tax for copper concentrate exports has been raised to 25 percent from 20 percent, and will gradually go up to a maximum 60 percent by the end of 2016. With the export tax at 25 percent, layoffs are inevitable, Papua-based Freeport union official Virgo Solossa told Reuters on Tuesday. Freeport Indonesia will certainly minimise operation costs with lay offs. We still don't know how many workers will be laid off by Freeport. When asked to confirm the possible layoffs, Freeport Indonesia CEO Rozik Soetjipto told Reuters that so far we have no such plan. The company employs about 24,000 workers, including contractors and staff, in Indonesia. The country's second-largest copper producer, Newmont, was continuing to run mining operations at its Batu Hijau mine as usual, while the firm waited for official notification from the government, a spokesman said on Sunday. Newmont did not comment on its copper exports. Indonesia introduced the controversial ban on Sunday on a range of raw mineral ores in order to force companies to build processing plants on its soil. The higher export taxes diminished the president's last-minute relief to the major miners. Although the government has yet to publish all the regulations clarifying the export rule changes, mining and finance ministry officials said concentrate with a minimum of 15 percent copper content will be allowed to be exported despite the ban. The Freeport website says that concentrates produced in Indonesia generally contain 27-30 percent copper. Rating agencies Moody's and S&P; said state-controlled nickel miner PT Aneka Tambang (Antam) was under review for a possible downgrade due to the ban. The export halt is expected to cost Antam an estimated $300 million in revenue this year, as unprocessed nickel ore shipments represent around 30 percent of its revenue."

Hagel, speaking to civilian aircraft maintenance workers at Naval Air Station Jacksonville, said he and the Pentagon's top military chiefs had decided to implement a 20 percent across-the-top cut in our offices. He said later the 20 percent cut would also affect the headquarters of the combatant commanders and would be implemented over the 2015-2019 time frame. Pentagon spokesman George Little said the spending cuts would save about $1.5 billion to $2 billion a year. Personnel reductions associated with these savings will be determined during the development of detailed execution plans, Little said in a statement. He said the decision was given in fiscal guidance to department leaders earlier this month as a result of an internal review ordered by the secretary. Some critics have charged that the bureaucracy that supports the secretary of defense and some combatant commanders has become bloated over a decade of war. Hagel's comments came as he was on a three-day listening tour of military bases in the U.S. South to get a look at how an across-the-board $37 billion budget cut this year is affecting Defense Department personnel, including civilians who began taking a day a week of unpaid leave last week. Some 6,900 civilians at the Jacksonville base had their first day of unpaid leave last week, including 2,700 at the aircraft maintenance facility, officials said. That amounts to an effective 20 percent pay cut through the end of the fiscal year. Hagel defended the decision to put civilian workers on unpaid leave, saying further cuts in other areas would have jeopardized military training and readiness, which had to be the Pentagon's top priority. In the end, I had to make all my final decisions on readiness, supporting our war-fighters and preserving as much combat power as I could, Hagel told the group. I could not take our readiness down any further, any deeper than where we are. I just couldn't do it. Sobering Picture The defense secretary painted a sobering picture of the uncertainty hanging over the department because of automatic budget cuts known as sequestration. The cuts, ordered by the White House and the Congress, reduced Pentagon spending by $37 billion this fiscal year, prompting the unpaid leave and other cuts. The reductions are likely to cut $52 billion from defense spending in fiscal 2014 and could continue at that level for a further eight years. The Pentagon is in the process of reducing spending by $487 billion over a decade as required by the 2011 Budget Control Act, which aimed to reduce massive U.S. deficits. The act also required an additional $500 billion in across-the-board cuts unless Congress and the White House could find an alternative. So far, the president and lawmakers have been unable to reach a deal to avert the cuts. The first round of automatic cuts began earlier this year after being reduced to $37 billion, and the Pentagon's proposed $526.6 billion budget did not take into account the cuts required by the law. Responding to questions from the workers, Hagel said an additional $52 billion in cuts in the 2014 fiscal year would inevitably require a reduction in the Defense Department's workforce. There will be further cuts in personnel, make no mistake about it, he said. I won't have any choice. We took a $37 billion cut this year and you see the consequences of that. And then if you take a $52 billion cut, there'll be continuing significant and serious reductions. The secretary said cuts in the future could eventually affect not only jobs but compensation packages, such as retirement benefits, healthcare and pay, which combined represent about half of the Defense Department's budget. That's not going to go untouched, he said. You don't get the money in the overhead of the office of the secretary of the Defense Department. You need billions and billions of dollars. Speaking later at a luncheon with members of the Jacksonville Chamber of Commerce, Hagel said he was not optimistic about Congress and the White House reaching an agreement to avert the next round of budget cuts. I don't see a lot of hopeful signs that this is going to be resolved, he said. Editing by Peter Cooney"

Conaway asked for a detailed explanation of how the USDA would carry out overall budget cuts of about $2 billion and how it would keep the meat supply moving. Ranchers and farmers need you to manage these cuts in a way that protects them from as much harm as possible, he said Vilsack was expected to testify on Tuesday, three days before the cuts would take effect, at a House Agriculture Committee hearing on rural economic conditions. It would be the first opportunity for lawmakers to ask him directly about the USDA's plans. Meat packers and processors say food inspectors should be counted as essential personnel who need to stay on the job during a government shutdown, which was their status in the past. Vilsack said in a February 12 letter that, although furloughs are the least desirable option, there was no other way to satisfy the impending cuts. Unlike other budget scenarios, such as a short-term government shutdown, the exemption provisions of the sequestration statutes do not include exceptions that would be applicable to FSIS inspection activities, wrote Vilsack. If the budget cuts take effect, up to one-third of USDA's 100,000 employees might be furloughed, the USDA says.

The source, who asked not to be identified, told Reuters the company's second round of big layoffs in a year would be close to a range of 10 percent to 20 percent. Technology blogs including CNET and All Things D reported earlier that AMD could cut between 20 percent and 30 percent of its workforce. As of February, AMD had 11,705 employees worldwide. Citing sources, All Things D reported that AMD could announce the cuts next week, that they could include employees from engineering and sales, and could be deep enough to require AMD to scale back some products. AMD declined to comment. Like its larger rival Intel, AMD was caught flat-footed in recent years with the emergence and fast growth of mobile devices like Apple's iPad. Tablets and smartphones, once considered a niche market by Intel and others, are fast gaining consumer acceptance and eating into the sales of laptops and desktop computers, while a slowing global economy is dampening spending in general. On Thursday, AMD warned that its third-quarter revenue likely fell about 10 percent from the previous quarter. AMD is due to report its financial results on October 18 . AMD and Intel have been slow to adapt their PC chip designs to mobile. But while Intel has poured its massive resources into efforts to catch up to smartphone chipmakers like Qualcomm, AMD has yet to define a clear mobile strategy. The chipmaker has also been plagued by execution setbacks that have led to a loss of market share to Intel and to graphic chip rival Nvidia. Last year, the company appointed a new Chief Executive Office, Rory Read, and one of his first major moves was to announce a plan in November to slash 10 percent of its workforce to save about $200 in operating costs. Shares of AMD were up 0.72 percent in after hours trade. They closed down 14.37 percent at $2.74 earlier on Friday, hammered by the company's revenue warning the day before."

The latest round of layoffs, announced on Wednesday, is at least the fourth workforce reduction in about as many years for a company once synonymous with the Internet boom and could spark a shakeup in management, analysts said. Shares in Cisco, still the world's largest networking equipment maker, were down 2.7 percent at $24.52 on the Nasdaq. Cisco has failed to sustain growth in its high-end switches and routers business and is grappling with competition from so-called software-defined networks (SDN) which offer software that can run on cheap hardware. The company will recognize $250 million to $350 million of the charges in the first quarter, it said in a regulatory filing. John Chambers, Cisco's veteran chief executive, blamed the cuts on global uncertainty and said he will use the savings to reinvest in profitable sectors like cloud computing and security. While the company has cut over 17,000 in the past four years, acquisitions have helped its headcount grow to around 74,000 from 71,000 in 2011, according to Cisco's regulatory  filings. He is right-sizing Cisco and trying to get some strategic changes put in place. In the interim he has got to maintain his margins, said Ken Dulaney, analyst at Gartner. The cuts could put pressure on 64-year-old Chambers to retire. The CEO has led the company for nearly 20 years and in 2012 said he would look to retire in two to four years. But Chambers is unlikely to leave before he is ready. According to Dulaney, Cisco's board is loyal to Chambers, who joined the company as senior vice president in 1991 and helped it grow into a $128 billion operation, one of the most valuable tech companies in the world. Still the announcement, which made Cisco the biggest decliner on the S&P; 500 on Thursday, could cause a shake up at the company. A lot of his software investments have not panned out. He has got to get back to his core business and do greater things. That will happen if he gets new management under him, said Dulaney. Cisco is also battling sluggish sales and increased competition in emerging markets. The company's rivals include Juniper Networks Inc and China's Huawei Technologies Co Ltd. Cisco said on Wednesday that sales fell 23 percent in China and 13 percent in Brazil in the fourth quarter ended July 26. The company also reported flat profit for the fourth quarter and forecast tepid first-quarter profit and revenue.   (Editing by Simon Jennings and Andrew Hay)"

Public sector layoffs are a taboo in Greece, where a sixth year of recession has made one in four jobless and eroded living standards. After missing a June deadline, Athens agreed to put 12,500 state workers into a mobility scheme by September, meaning they will be transferred or fired within a year. Around 3,500 of those will be municipal workers and another 2,000 will be teachers, government officials have said. A second wave of 12,500 staff will be placed in the scheme by the end of the year.

The government hiked the base wage to 105 rand ($11.86) a day on Monday but farm owners, most of whom are from the white minority, said they could not afford to pay their mostly black workers the increase and lay-offs would ensue. Some of our farmers have already given notice to some of their workers because if they don't it now, they will have to pay the remuneration according to the new wages, meaning an extra cost, Louis Meintjes, president of commercial farmers group Tau SA, told Reuters. We can already talk of thousands of workers given notices that they will be let go. The new minimum wage comes into effect on March 1. The job losses could spark a repeat of the violence in which police had to use rubber bullets and stun grenades to disperse protesting farm workers blocking highways and torching vineyards and warehouses in the agricultural belt east of Cape Town. Trade union federation COSATU said the job losses were expected but blamed them on commercial greed. This is just the backlash we expect from the reactionary farmers, regional COSATU leader Tony Ehrenreich said. That is why we are saying government must pay them out and take the land to give it to farmers that are serious about farming. The Food and Allied Workers Union said it was on the lookout for any unfair dismissals but had not received any notice of layoffs from its members. Most farm workers in Africa's biggest economy do not belong to unions, making it difficult to know the full extent of the planned layoffs.

The layoffs, primarily in the company's engineering and product functions, come a week after Dorsey took over as permanent CEO. (1.usa.gov/1Gbb31A) Shares of Twitter, which had about 4,100 employees globally as of June 30, rose as much as 6.7 percent to $30.68 on Tuesday. We feel strongly that engineering will move much faster with a smaller and nimbler team, while remaining the biggest percentage of our workforce, Dorsey said in a letter to employees. And the rest of the organization will be streamlined in parallel. FBN Securities analyst Shebly Seyrafi, however, said the company needed to focus also on rationalizing sales along with engineering to achieve its margin targets. Dorsey, who was appointed Twitter's interim CEO in July after Dick Costolo resigned, has been candid about the company's problems. Twitter's second-quarter growth in average monthly users was the slowest since the company went public on Nov. 7, 2013. Its stock nearly tripled to a record high of $74.73 in December 2013, but has fallen about 60 percent since. The general thinking is that Twitter has a product problem, which is why they picked Jack to come in. You would normally not be cutting in engineering if you have a product problem. So I scratched my head a little bit on that, Seyrafi told Reuters. Since Dorsey took over as interim CEO, Twitter has rolled out a buy now button that allows users to make purchases and a feature that highlights the best tweets and content. Cuts in the engineering department could hurt the company's ability to continue growing at a robust pace, RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney wrote in a note. Twitter said it expected about $10 million-$20 million in severance costs and $5 million-$15 million in restructuring charges. Twitter expects to record most of these pretax restructuring charges in the fourth quarter. Technology news website Re/code first reported the planned layoffs on Oct. 9. Twitter said it expected its third-quarter revenue and adjusted EBITDA to meet or top the higher end of its forecasts. The company, which will report its third-quarter results on Oct. 27, has forecast revenue of $545 million-$560 million and adjusted EBITDA of $110 million-$115 million.

We are leaving no stone unturned and looking at all areas, company spokesman Dave Tovar said in an interview. He declined to predict how many employees would be laid off, saying it was too early in the budgeting process. The estimated cost savings for Sprint, which has 31,000 employees, would be equivalent to about 10 percent of its current annual operating costs of $26 billion. The ratio of the company's capital expenditures to its sales is more than 20 percent, which Tovar said is higher than for other wireless carriers. We are trying to get more in line with the industry average, he said. He said Sprint on Tuesday will provide more details about the job cuts and the company's plans to bolster the quality, speed and capacity of its wireless network, when it reports fiscal second-quarter results. Savings are also expected to come from cutting severance for laid off employees and temporarily eliminating raises. In its first quarter ended June 30, the company posted a $20 million loss as revenue fell 8.7 percent to $8.03 billion, missing analysts' estimates of $8.43 billion.

The program will cost 4.4 billion reais and is open to all employees, according to a statement from Petrobras, which has been hard hit by low oil prices, refinery project problems and a massive price-fixing, bribery and political kickback scandal. The company said the planned redundancies would help adjust the size of its workforce to a smaller investment plan and boost productivity. Investors have long criticized Petrobras for over hiring and struggling to cut some of the 57,000 people it directly employs when things get tough. Many of its workers enjoy job security that is close to that of civil servants, a legacy of the company’s heritage as a full state company. Under the plan, employees will be offered between around 212,000 reais and 706,000 reais to take redundancy, Deyvid Bacelar, the Petrobras board member representing workers, told Reuters, citing an internal memo. The move comes on the back of a plan announced in January to cut the number of managers at the firm, and a previous redundancy scheme announced in 2014.   Petrobras is set to slash its five-year investment plan by about 20 percent to about $80 billion in the 2016-2020 period, sources said a month ago. Petrobras reported a fourth-quarter loss of 36.9 billion reais ($10.2 billion), its biggest quarterly loss ever, after booking large writedowns for oil fields and other assets as oil prices slumped and refinery projects faltered. A year earlier, writedowns also caused hefty losses, although they were largely related to the corruption scandal that has roiled the company and fueled calls for the impeachment of Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff.

David Hess, president of aircraft engine maker Pratt & Whitney, told Reuters on Wednesday the company was still examining its legal obligations regarding notification of employees who could be put out of jobs in January. At issue are some $55 billion in automatic spending cuts for fiscal 2013 that are due to hit on January 2 and which could cost the defense industry thousands of jobs. Hess and other aerospace industry executives are mounting a campaign to persuade Congress to stop them. In a controversial move last week, the U.S. Labor Department said the circumstances surrounding the planned cuts were too uncertain to require defense and other federal contractors to comply with the provisions the so-called WARN Act, which requires employees to be notified 60 days before major layoffs or plant closures. Republican lawmakers immediately accused the Obama administration of trying to suppress potentially damaging notices of layoffs just before the election. Right now the WARN Act is the law, and we always comply with the law, so we're not quite sure we understand the direction from the Department of Labor, Hess told Reuters at a rally for employees at Pratt & Whitney's jet engine test facility and rocket engine plant near West Palm Beach, Florida. The cuts in January stem from an August 2011 congressional budget deal to avoid a historic default on U.S. Treasury debt. Congress pledged to find $1.2 trillion in additional spending cuts by the end of 2012, or they would happen automatically, with half coming from defense spending. Although defense firms have warned that some $500 billion in cuts over 10 years will ultimately cause the loss of more than two million jobs countrywide, they have little clarity on how the Defense Department will parse out the pain starting in January. Pay and benefits for military personnel are exempt from the cuts, but executives are waiting to hear which weapons programs will be hit hardest. Details Due Within 30 Days On Tuesday, President Barack Obama signed legislation requiring his administration to detail within 30 days how it will administer the cuts, which may help contractors decide where to cut. We'll make a decision in the future as to whether or not we'll issue WARN notices. Some of it may depend on what clarity we get in 30 days, Hess said. Job cuts at Pratt & Whitney's U.S. operations could reach into the hundreds, Hess said. The Florida plant does development work on engines for the stealthy F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and builds rocket engines and has been under consideration for new investment to produce engines for exported F-35s. Should the cuts cause a reduction in the fighter jet's production rate, the company would have to re-evaluate its expansion plans, Hess added. Tom Burbage, program integration manager for the F-35 at the plane's prime contractor, Lockheed Martin, said his firm appreciates and will analyze the Labor Department guidance, but management must first answer to shareholders and employees. The Labor Department is not a major shareholder in corporations like Lockheed Martin or (Pratt & Whitney parent)United Technologies, Burbage said. Generally speaking, if we know there's a potential to have a major reduction in the future, we have to take appropriate action, he said. All we are trying to do is be transparent with our employees so that nobody is caught by surprise. Lawmakers from both parties say they oppose the across-the-board cuts that will hit in January as a result of a budget deal made a year ago, but they have not been able to agree on alternative ways to reduce spending. Congress is on a five-week recess and when it returns in September, it will have only 11 legislative days to try to broker a deal before the November election.

The review, set to resume on Wednesday, has been interrupted twice since September due to the reluctance of Greece's fragile, austerity-weary coalition government to adopt any more unpopular measures to satisfy lenders. Chief inspectors from the European Union, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund troika visit Athens periodically to check on progress on its bailout commitments before releasing further loan installments. Structural reforms remain the main friction points with the troika - foreclosures, massive layoffs and cuts in employer contributions to the social security fund, one of the officials told Reuters, declining to be named. Negotiations on these issues remain quite difficult. Greece, which nearly went bankrupt last year as it struggled to meet its bailout pledges, has no immediate funding needs, easing pressure for a deal between the two sides, which senior EU officials say is not expected until January. Its next bond payment falls on January 11, when 1.85 billion euros of Greek bonds mature, according to Thomson Reuters data. The following big bond maturities, worth about 9.3 billion euros, fall in May. Athens is due to receive up to 5.9 billion euros ($8.1 billion) of loans by the end of the year, according to the latest schedule published by its creditors. But it is likely to receive only 1 billion by the end of the year, providing it can strike a deal with the lenders over state-owned Hellenic Defense Systems, which inspectors want Athens to shut down or downsize. The government has resisted a complete shutdown of the firm. It is likely that there could be an agreement (on EAS), possibly by the end of this week, and we could get the 1 billion tranche which is due from the summer, the official said. A second official said an agreement on the other sticking points - mass firings and foreclosures - to unlock the remaining 4.9 billion euros in funds was unlikely to be reached before January. The troika wants Athens to lift a moratorium on foreclosures on primary homes, but the government wants to extend the protection for crisis-hit households which is due to expire at the end of the year. It wants to lift the ban only for borrowers who are found to have sufficient funds but are unwilling to pay off their loans, knowing their homes cannot be seized. The troika is also pressing Greece to ease restrictions on large-scale corporate firings, which Athens has resisted, saying labor laws have already been relaxed enough. Athens could always opt to issue T-bills to pay maturing bonds if the 4.9 billion euro tranche is not released, the first official said. I don't think that we'll have to resort to it but technically we are ready to do it if needed, the official said.

As we ramp up capabilities in China, including additional 737-related work, the actions that we'll take are actions that will also allow us to grow jobs here in the U.S., Muilenburg said at an aerospace conference in Seattle organized by SAE International. In a memo to employees on Tuesday, Boeing Commercial Airplanes Chief Executive Ray Conner said the company was negotiating a strategic partnership and sales with China.  Related CoverageBoeing machinists in U.S. fear job loss from China factory These discussions are at a sensitive stage, Conner said in an internal memo seen by Reuters. I hope (it) will be a win for Boeing, a win for the Puget Sound, and a win for our stakeholders. I want to assure you that agreements we may reach with our Chinese partners will not result in layoffs or reduce employment for the 737 program in Washington state. Conner and Muilenburg did not discuss specifics of Boeing's proposed 737 finishing facility in China, a step expected to be announced during Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to Seattle this week. Boeing's plan to set up a facility in China that would paint, finish and deliver 737 jetliners built at its factory near Seattle has provoked its largest union, representing about 35,000 Boeing employees. The International Association of Machinists said Boeing has discussed its desire to expand collaboration with China but shared no details. Any shift of aerospace jobs from our bargaining unit or Washington State causes grave concern, the union has said.  Muilenburg, who became CEO on July 1, said Boeing has had operations in China for 42 years and is continuing to invest to expand its capabilities there. Boeing is investing in a way that allows us to grow jobs around the world, he said, in response to a question. I think it's really important that as we think about that collaboration that it's seen as one that is beneficial to both countries. In his prepared remarks, Muilenburg called Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Facebook Inc (FB.O) and Google Inc (GOOGL.O) nontraditional aerospace and defense competitors for their efforts in space, satellites and drones.  Boeing already has partnered with Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin to build a manned space vehicle capable of reaching the International Space Station. Boeing is working on other partnerships, Muilenburg said. We see emerging competitors and collaborators, he said, and need to be adept at partnering with them. Boeing, he said, cannot compete unless we have a global-scale, global diversification strategy, a strategy that accounts for collaboration in all parts of the world ... We must continue to expand in that direction. Reporting by Alwyn Scott; Editing by James Dalgleish and Alan Crosby"

The ruling African National Congress (ANC) has made job creation a priority, but the rate has been stuck above 20 percent for more than a decade despite periods of strong economic growth, fuelling social unrest. Joblessness increased to 25.5 percent of the labour force, Statistics South Africa said on Thursday, putting 197,000 more workers on the streets during the quarter. The agency said 4.667 million people were registered as unemployed, the highest figure since current records began four years ago. It's amongst the highest unemployment rates globally and highlights quite strongly that we need to be taking some corrective action, said Colen Garrow, an economist at Johannesburg-based consultancy Meganomics. By sector, mining was the second biggest contributor to the losses, shedding 8,000 jobs in a quarter that witnessed the most serious labour-related violence since apartheid's end in 1994. In the worst incident, police shot dead 34 striking miners at platinum miner Lonmin's  Marikana complex. A hefty wage settlement brought an end to the six-week walkout. But Lonmin, which employs 25,000 people, told unions this week an unspecified number of workers would be laid off as part of restructuring to get the firm out of a financial hole. That alone suggests the jobless rate is likely to rise further in the final three months of the year. It is expected that we will see more job losses in mining, said Kefiloe Masiteng, Stats SA's head of population and social statistics. Anglo American Platinum chief executive Chris Griffith said the industry was in severe financial distress and elevated wage settlements to get wild-cat strikers back to work would lead to job cuts. The world's top platinum producer has lost 141,640 ounces of platinum to date from a seven-week strike. This is completely the wrong time to be offering unsustainable wage increases that the moment people are back at work you just have to (lay off) a whole lot of people, Griffith told Talk Radio 702. There will be implications for jobs. Stuck in a Rut South Africa's jobless rate has been stuck between 21 and 29 percent since current records began in 2000, and it did not dip appreciably even when the economy was growing strongly in the years leading up to a 2008/09 recession. The ANC has unveiled a big infrastructure development plan in February that it says should create millions of jobs in Africa's biggest economy. But Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan has said the economy needs sustained growth of 7 percent a year - nearly three times the 2.5 percent forecast for 2012 - to make a dent in unemployment. South Africa's relatively rigid labour laws are part of the problem, making it difficult and costly for employers to fire workers, although the powerful unions have rejected any notion of reform, saying it would lead to exploitation. Youngsters -- defined as 15 to 34-year-olds -- accounted for 71 percent of all jobless people, compounding the fears of ANC leaders that they are sitting on a ticking time-bomb of youth unemployment that could ultimately trigger major social unrest. The expanded definition of unemployment, which includes people who have stopped looking for work, increased to 36.3 percent from 36.2 percent previously. Private households got rid of 29,000 workers during the quarter in a sector that mostly makes use of temporary workers."

The views expressed are his own) By John Kemp LONDON, Feb 13 (Reuters) - This is the really crappy part of the job, and this is what I hate about this industry frankly, the chief executive of oilfield services company Baker Hughes complained as he announced it would lay off 7,000 employees. Baker Hughes is cutting jobs in response to slumping prices and a downturn in drilling activity. But the company's obviously frustrated chief acknowledged that this is the industry, and it's throwing us another one of these downturns, and we're going to be good stewards of our business and do the right thing. So the company will cuts costs, he told investors in a conference call on January 20 to discuss the firm's fourth-quarter earnings and outlook for 2015. More than 100,000 layoffs have been announced across the industry worldwide since prices began to slide last summer, according to a tally kept by Bloomberg. In recent weeks other major service companies have announced job reductions. Halliburton announced it will cut 6,400 jobs (8 percent of its global workforce) while Schlumberger  will eliminate 9,000 positions (around 7 percent of its workforce). Precision Drilling, one of the largest rig contractors in North America, has idled more than 50 of the 250 rigs it had working this time last year, leaving more than 1,000 skilled operators out of work, the company said on Thursday. Industry downturns are difficult for all, but they affect our rig crews more than anybody else, the company's chief executive said in a statement. Precision recruited, trained and developed many excellent crews to support the demands of our customers over the past several years, and unfortunately we now don't have work for many of these dedicated workers. Human Capital Tens of thousands more jobs have been cut, through layoffs or retirements, across every part of the industry, ranging from self-employed drilling contractors and well-completion crews to full-service companies, seismic surveyors and of course the oil and gas producers themselves. Oil and gas production is an exceptionally capital-intensive industry. But the sector's most important and scarce resource is its workforce. The oil industry's popular image may be a roughneck in soiled overalls drinking in a strip joint, but it has an enormous demand for highly skilled and, during a boom, very well compensated workers. Modern oil and gas production is technically complicated and dangerous work. The days of drilling wildcat wells more or less at random and allowing the well to blow out in a massive gusher are long over. The industry still provides employment for unskilled casual labour. In boom times some of the jobs for truck drivers and other support staff can be exceptionally well paid. But at its core are tens of thousands of petroleum engineers and petroleum geoscientists, as well as tool pushers, drillers, derrickmen and roughnecks on the rigs themselves, who perform specialised functions which demand years of formal education and, most importantly, experience in the field. The challenge is recruiting, training and retaining these workers and maintaining an appropriate long-term labour force profile in an industry stuck with a profound boom-bust cycle and beset by periodic mass layoffs. The Great Crew Change Until recently, the oil industry was preoccupied by a looming shortage of skilled workers -- especially mid-career professionals ready to step into supervisory and senior leadership roles. Schlumberger's consulting arm, which offers human resources planning advice to third parties, has warned repeatedly about the looming talent shortage as a result of what it termed the great crew change. Oil and gas companies have lots of experienced workers in their late 40s and 50s, and have recently succeeded in attracting more young graduates. But there is an acute shortage of mid-career professionals aged 35-45, with 10-20 years training and experience. The large number of professionals in their 50s poses a major problem as they reach the age for retirement, while recent graduates are still 10-15 years away from being ready to assume supervisory positions. The industry's uneven age profile is the legacy of the last downturn during the late 1980s and through the 1990s, when low oil prices and the squeeze on profits resulted in enormous job losses and a virtual freeze on hiring. As a result, the cohort of workers recruited in the mid and late 1990s, who should be moving into supervisory and eventually leadership positions, is unusually small. Back in 2013, Schlumberger predicted the oil and gas industry would have a shortage of around 15,000 experienced petroleum engineers and geoscientists by 2016. The predicted shortfall of experienced petro-technical professionals (PTPs) would approach 20 percent of the total required number. The looming shortage was seen by many as the biggest single threat to increasing oil and gas supplies in the second half of the current decade and into the 2020s. Graduate Recruits Schlumberger forecast the industry would need to hire 10,000 new petro-technical professionals every year through 2020 to offset retirements and meet the need for expansion. The oil industry spent years working to encourage more college students to specialise in petroleum engineering and related disciplines. Petroleum engineering departments hired extra instructors and increased enrolments. According to the U.S. Department of Education, the number of students enrolled in petroleum engineering programmes at U.S. universities increased from a recent low of just 561 in 1997 to 1,301 in 2011 (link.reuters.com/tux93w). Now, of course, the downturn has thrown thousands of oil and gas professionals out of work, and led to pay freezes and cuts in contracting rates. Amid all the headlines about layoffs, falling salaries and a potentially prolonged downturn in oil prices, the industry somehow has to avoid losing current graduates to other sectors and continue encouraging high school students that oil and gas engineering and science is an attractive long-term career. Because if the oil industry cannot maintain an adequate skill base, with the right age structure, skill shortages will re-emerge and set the stage for the next brutal boom-bust cycle. In practice, the industry has never succeeded in balancing long-term personnel planning with the short-term financial imperative to control the wage bill. It may not be any more successful this time around, if the slump in oil prices and drilling continues long enough. And that's why the chief executive of Baker Hughes could say truthfully mass lay-offs are what he and everyone else hates most about the oil and gas industry.    (Editing by Andrew Heavens)"

Average prime rents dropped by 0.4 percent to 60 pounds per square foot for the best homes in the year to mid-June versus the same period last year and were likely to remain subdued for the rest of 2012 as the UK banking sector's difficulties persisted, it said Friday. Central London's prime rental market is dominated by tenants from the financial services sector and is a barometer for what's happening in the City of London employment market, Savills' director of research Lucian Cook told Reuters. The number of jobs in London's finance sector is expected to slump to its lowest level in 16 years this year as the euro zone debt crisis drives firms in the UK capital to cut 25,000 jobs, consultancy Centre for Economics and Business Research said in May. On Tuesday, state-backed lender Royal Bank of Scotland said it would make 600 staff redundant as a result of new UK rules due to take effect at the end of the year, bringing the total number of layoffs it has made since its 2008 bailout to 36,000. Hedge fund managers have more money than bankers to spend renting the best homes, Cook said, with bankers' spending power also hit by shrinking bonus pots. In February, Savills said hedge fund managers were likely to outspend bankers on buying London homes this year. Reporting by Brenda Goh; Editing by Tom Bill and Hans-Juergen Peters"
"https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-states-employees-idUSL2E8F39HE20120408","FEATURE: Despite recovery, US public employees face more layoffs","","April 8, 2012 /  11:01 AM / 5 years ago","","April 8 (Reuters) - Since 2009, the city of Chesapeake, tucked up against the Great Dismal Swamp in southern Virginia, has cut its workforce twice. This summer, nearly three years after the recession ended, the city of 222,209 has plans for a third round of layoffs. We're not seeing the recovery we want to see, said Budget Director Steven Jenkins, who is hoping many of the 20 people will move into other jobs. The city's revenues are still feeling the concussions from the housing market downturn, which started in 2006, even as overall growth in the United States has improved. We are heavily reliant on the residential real estate market, said Jenkins. In a recent assessment the average property value dropped 3.7 percent, which hits property taxes, and hurts government budgets. The reassessment we just had was as big as any we've seen since the recession started. While Friday's report of weak growth in U.S. March payrolls raised concerns about the pace of private-sector hiring, local government jobs remain a drag on the recovery, one that is not anticipated to end soon. State and local governments for a time were able to shield public safety and education workforces from harmful cuts as the recession deepened. The 2009 federal stimulus fund helped offset lost tax revenue, but that money is gone. Now, many cities and counties nationwide are facing the same dilemma as Chesapeake. Squeezed by depressed property tax revenues and cuts in state aid, they are chipping away at their workforces. The result? The last three years of job losses at the state and local government level has been the most dramatic since Labor Department records began in 1955, according to a Reuters analysis. Public-sector employees tended to have more job security, which in some ways helps during weak economic climates, as their steady demand for goods and services spread through the economy. The recent trend, conversely, can make things worse. If public-sector employment had grown since June 2009 by the average amount it grew in the three previous recoveries (2.8 percent) instead of shrinking by 2.5 percent, there would be 1.2 million more public-sector jobs in the U.S. economy today, said the Economic Policy Institute in a recent report, which included federal employees in the calculation. Local governments have cut 482,000 jobs since the beginning of 2009. They added jobs in just two months since 2011 started. Previously, states only had two consecutive years of layoffs, 1995 and 1996, when they scrapped about 57,000 jobs, or about one-third of the 150,000 cut since the beginning of 2009. The current recovery is the only one that has seen public-sector losses over its first 31 months, the report said. As of March, 14.1 million people worked for local governments and 5.1 million for states. Public employees outnumber those in manufacturing, construction, and other areas typically considered engines of the economy. Hit by Housing, Low Demand Three weeks ago, firefighters in Scranton, Pennsylvania, took 10 minutes to respond to a fire, instead of the usual four minutes or less. Lighter staffing was blamed, as the city had laid off 29 firefighters in January. We had been telling them ... there's a catastrophe that's going to happen here, said John J. Judge IV, president of the International Association of Fire Fighters Local 60. After the delay, 12 of the firefighters were rehired, but that's still a reduction of 17 workers. In March, local governments shed 3,000 jobs after gaining 1,000 in February, according to the Labor Department. State governments added 2,000 jobs. However, states employ 39,000 fewer people than a year ago, and the slight recent improvement is unlikely to be confirmed. The rate of decline is slower, said Christopher Hoene, research director at the National League of Cities. But I don't think the curve is shifting upward. I don't think we're going to see hiring in the local government sector. Meanwhile, the private sector is creating jobs. Friday's employment report showed private payrolls gained 121,000 jobs in March, while public payrolls lost 1,000. Moody's expects states to lose at least another 15,000 jobs through 2012 and local governments between 150,000 and 175,000. It's going to continue to be a drag on overall employment, said Moody's Investors Services Economist Daniel White. States vs. Locals Des Moines, Iowa, weathered the recession better than many other cities. Its unemployment rate is 6.1 percent, more than two percentage points below the national average. Nonetheless, it recently eliminated more than 40 full-time positions after property valuations dropped 3.5 percent. It too wants to put those workers into other jobs, said Deputy City Manager Allen McKinley, a former finance director and budget officer for the Iowa capital. Des Moines also has fewer dollars to spend as the state recently mandated bigger contributions to police and fire pensions, McKinley said. As public pensions attempt to close total shortfalls of at least $600 billion, many state and local governments are having to pitch in more money to retirement systems, taking dollars away from other departments. Also, with fewer employees on the payrolls, the smaller the worker contributions to pension systems that must send retirees fixed amounts each month. A new threat has emerged in Iowa. Both parties in the legislature, along with the governor, hope to boost growth by cutting commercial property taxes, which make up around half of Des Moines revenues, by about 40 percent. Cities across the state are protesting the three proposals. All states except Vermont must end their fiscal years with balanced budgets. For its upcoming fiscal year, Florida cut 4,000 state jobs and reduced higher education and healthcare funds. Spending cuts in the $70 billion budget are so bad that Palm Beach County Clerk and Comptroller Sharon Bock said constituents might sue. Florida's new budget means Bock must find $2.5 million in savings and still keep the courts open, she said. The office has already laid off 111 employees to cope with four years of budget cuts. Now, it will not fill 40 vacancies or replace departing employees - its annual turnover rate is about 10 percent. The staff size is currently around 430 people. The worker shortage will result in 10 hours of backlog each week, Bock said. Here is the dilemma that I am in: I take an oath as a constitutional officer to provide services to the public, she said about her duties, which include keeping vital records and operating court systems. Do I get sued by the public because I can't open a branch office or because I have to close one day a week? Or do I lay off people, and e n d up in the same scenario?"

Switzerland's biggest bank, which announced the layoffs last week along with a plan to virtually eliminate its bond trading business, has a massive trading floor in Stamford, Conn., comprised primarily people who trade and sell bonds. Several fixed-income employees in Stamford and New York City were fired by phone this week because the devastating storm Sandy that hit the region on Monday prevented them from traveling to their offices, a UBS spokeswoman said on Thursday. Still, UBS and Connecticut officials said that the Swiss bank will carefully work to ensure that a sizeable staff remains working in that state east of New York. At stake is a $20 million interest-free development loan that UBS got from the state in May. The bank signed a contract committing to keeping at least 2,000 people employed in the state, and has agreed to forgive the loan after five years if all terms of their contract are met. I have been assured that the layoffs will be structured in such a way that UBS will be able to meet the obligations it has under the agreement, Catherine Smith, commissioner of Connecticut's Department of Economic and Community Development told Reuters. We feel relatively comfortable about it. UBS spokeswoman Katrina Byrne declined to discuss the nature of the jobs that will remain in Connecticut but said more than 3,500 bank employees now work in the state. We are honoring our commitment, she said. Smith said she checked with UBS this week after reading press reports that some 3,000 employees around Stamford would lose their jobs. In announcing the bank's plan to ax 10,000 employees over three years as it seeks to build a new business model, UBS Chief Executive Sergio Ermotti did not spell out details of the cuts. But he said last week that about 30 percent of the total investment banking layoffs will occur in the United States. Smith and two UBS officials said the exact number of layoffs in the United States, and the areas that will be affected, are still being determined. The state's concerns show how cash-strapped local economies have been affected by the global bloodbath in a financial services sector that has announced more than 100,000 job reductions this year. Many municipalities and other local government bodies are increasingly doling out sweetheart deals such as the loan to UBS in a bid to attract and keep businesses in their tax base. UBS got the state handout earlier this year as it threatened to transfer many jobs to Manhattan. That negotiating leverage also meant the state had to agree to a looser contract than it would have liked. Some bankers said UBS can easily keep its employment commitment and still replace high-paid banking jobs with lower-paying ones, yielding less tax revenue for the state. Smith, who was chief executive of U.S. retirement services for Dutch bank ING Group ING.AS before taking the state job last year, conceded the UBS contract was looser than many others it has negotiated by not including growth or job-level targets. We were faced with the concept they would actually pick up and leave, which was not a pretty picture, Smith said, referring to the bank's threats to move its traders to Manhattan. We still value them as a partner in the Stamford community in terms of all they do for job creation and community-mindedness. When UBS opened its Stamford trading floor in 2002, it boasted that the space, about the size of about two U.S. football fields, was the world's largest. UBS has been slammed by trading and other investment banking losses since the financial crisis of 2008, punctuating other crises in which it has been accused of abetting tax-avoidance schemes for wealthy Americans and participating with other banks in fraudulent fixing of the London Interbank Offered Rate, a key determinant of interest rates. Through the first half of 2012 its investment banking revenue was down another 55 percent from the same period in 2011. The contract with Connecticut was negotiated under a prior regime of UBS executives who were committed to the fixed-income business but lost their jobs following a summer trading scandal.

Alaska is facing a $3 billion budget shortfall, worsened by a global oil price plunge, and lawmakers have been fighting for more than four months over how to fund day-to-day operations. The amount of difference right now being argued in the legislature is really about 1 percent of the problem, said Walker, an Independent who last year defeated incumbent Republican Sean Parnell. We want to focus on the 99 percent opportunity we have to solve this. The state House and Senate have differed on how much they can cut without hurting services to the 750,000 residents.  If no agreement is reached, some 10,000 workers doing a range of jobs from communications to issuing permits and certain non-emergency road maintenance would be laid off temporarily, though some personnel could be recalled for emergencies, according to government statements. The 11 marine highway ferries that serve Alaska's coastal communities, plus one Canadian and Washington state port, would also be out of service. In April, the legislature approved a budget that would fund only certain government operations into the fall. Walker vetoed those sections, saying he wants a fully funded budget. Major differences remain about how much to fund public education, the state's universities, and the marine highway system and restoring pay raises to state workers. On Saturday, the House approved a $5 billion budget that reflects a compromise between the Republican-dominated majority and the Democratic-led minority.  Without a compromise, the minority caucus could hold up the House's ability to tap into a state savings account for $3 billion, which requires a three-quarters vote among the 40 members. The Senate, however, did not sign off on the budget. The Senate Finance Committee produced its own budget and has said it wants to create a conference committee for the two chambers to negotiate differences. This prompted Walker to follow through on his pledge from two weeks ago of issuing layoff notes one month in advance to personnel not essential to life, health and safety. We are contractually bound to do that and morally bound to do that, Walker said. Reporting by Steve Quinn in Juneau, Alaska; Editing by Eric M. Johnson and Mohammad Zargham"

The agencies affected are the Central Intelligence Agency, the Office of Director of National Intelligence and 15 others, the officials said. The CIA expects to furlough about 12,500 civilians working for the agency, according to the sources. But specific numbers for other agencies were not immediately clear, the officials told Reuters. The CIA and White House declined to comment. No uniformed military personnel will be affected, officials said. Some large spy agencies under control of the Pentagon employ as many, or more, military personnel than civilian workers. These agencies include the Defense Intelligence Agency and the National Security Agency, whose secretive electronic eavesdropping methods recently become the focus of controversy following leaks by former contractor Edward Snowden. The U.S. government partially shut down for the first time in 17 years on Tuesday as a standoff between President Barack Obama and congressional Republicans over healthcare reforms closed museums and national parks and slowed everything from trade negotiations to medical research. Federal agencies cut back services and up to 1 million workers were put on unpaid leave. Shawn Turner, chief spokesman for the Director of National Intelligence, declined to discuss specifics of the layoffs but acknowledged that the performance of spy agencies could be affected if the shutdown continues. The Intelligence Community's ability to identify threats and provide information for a broad set of national security decisions will be diminished for the duration, Turner said. The immediate and significant reduction in employees on the job means that we will assume greater risk and our ability to support emerging intelligence requirements will be curtailed, he said. The fraction of Intelligence Community employees who remain on the job will be stretched to the limit and forced to focus only on the most critical security needs. Some officials said that while spy agencies play critical roles in gathering information on foreign governments and potential militant threats, they are subject to the same budget laws as other government units. Under current circumstances, they must temporarily lay off large numbers of staff to comply with the law, the officials said. Precisely how intelligence operations will be affected by the shutdown, and precise numbers of individuals affected, remain classified, officials said. However, among the types of activities likely to be cut back as a result of the furloughs are strategic planning and analyses and some foreign liaison activities. In many parts of the world, U.S. agencies rely heavily on their partnerships with local spy outfits, such as Britain's MI5 and MI6 and Israel's Mossad.

Although we continue to pursue various avenues, it is possible that adverse developments could ultimately result in the closure of the firm, which would result in the termination of your employment, the firm said in a letter to employees that was obtained by Reuters. Angelo Kakolyris, a spokesman for the firm, declined to comment. The firm issued the notification under a federal law known as the WARN Act and similar state laws that require employers to notify workers of mass layoffs in advance. The federal WARN Act requires employers with 100-plus employees to give them 60 days' notice, while New York's WARN Act requires employers with 50 or more workers to give at least 90 days' notice. Although we continue to pursue various avenues, it is possible that adverse developments could ultimately result in the closure of the firm, the letter said. Dewey & LeBoeuf, once one of the biggest law firms in the United States, has been struggling this year with growing debt, declining revenue and partner defections, which continued unabated on Friday. Since January, the firm has lost at least 120 of its 300 partners amid a mounting debt crisis. It has tried and failed to find a merger partner. Employees leaving Dewey's offices in midtown New York on Friday declined to talk to a reporter. Workers from a local moving company called Moishe's loaded about two dozen boxes labeled Dewey & LeBoeuf early on Friday evening before driving away. A Facebook site set up to help Dewey attorneys and staff find jobs grew to 220 members on Friday afternoon. Earlier on Friday, another source close to the situation said that Dewey & LeBoeuf had dismissed Executive Director Stephen DiCarmine within the last week. DiCarmine has retained a prominent criminal defense lawyer, the source said. Last week, the firm informed its partners that the New York District Attorney launched an investigation into allegations of wrongdoing by former Chairman Steven Davis. No allegations of wrongdoing have been brought against DiCarmine. The reasons for his termination couldn't be determined. Davis has denied any wrongdoing and DiCarmine did not return phone calls seeking comment. DiCarmine has hired Edward Little, a former federal prosecutor in Manhattan, according to the source, who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter. Little, a partner at law firm Hughes Hubbard & Reed, declined to comment on whether he had been hired in connection with the DA probe. Defections from the firm decimated its overseas offices on Friday, with a wave of departures in Britain, Germany, Kazakhstan, UAE and Russia. Dewey's options could include an out-of-court wind-down or a bankruptcy, whether voluntary or forced by its creditors, bankruptcy experts said. Earlier this week, Dewey denied any plans to file for bankruptcy. Industry experts say a filing would be expensive and unlikely to salvage the firm, but could provide an efficient legal framework for Dewey to collect receivables from departed partners. People who are owed money by Dewey have already begun seeking to sell their claims to third parties on a secondary market at a heavy discount, said Kevin Starke, a bankruptcy analyst with CRT Capital Group, a brokerage that specializes in distressed securities. When businesses are insolvent or close to it, their stakeholders, fearing they will not be paid fully or on time, commonly sell their claims at a discount to institutional buyers in an effort to recover some money. In Dewey's case, sellers will likely include trade vendors, suppliers and other service providers who may have receivables against the firm, Starke said. A market for receivables is shaping up around 10-to-15 cents on the dollar, he said."

In a striking reversal of years of aggressive hiring and expansion into segments dominated by their private-sector peers, state lenders are stepping up voluntary retirement programs for long-serving staff or closing empty positions, executives and union leaders said. Increased layoffs in a sector that was recently one of Brazil's most dynamic underscore a broader downturn in the nation's labor market, where the jobless rate has climbed faster than expected. State banks are grappling with slumping demand for credit and scarcer funding from the government, which is struggling to contain a swelling budget deficit. The nation's unemployment rate rose to 6.7 percent in May from 4.3 percent in December, statistics agency IBGE said last month. The souring of Brazil's job market marks an end to a decade of cumulative gains in employment, wages and social security coverage for millions of Brazilians. State lenders added more employees during the onset of the 2008-2009 global financial crisis after the government ordered them to offer more credit at cheaper costs. For instance, Caixa Economica Federal's [CEF.UL] payroll grew 30 percent since 2008 as the mortgage lender saw its market share grow by one-third during that period. Both Caixa and Banco do Brasil SA (BBAS3.SA), the nation's largest lender by assets, recently launched early retirement incentive plans that could trim their payroll by 8,500 people. State-run Banco do Estado de Rio Grande do Sul SA (BRSR6.SA) and Banco do Brasilia SA are following suit. The focus is shifting towards expense controls as revenue has become harder to generate in the current downturn, a source familiar with Banco do Brasil's payroll-reduction plans told Reuters. After years of budget profligacy, the government is now asking state banks to rein in some of their prior largess and implement thriftier management practices. About 101,000 people work at Caixa, while Banco do Brasil had about 112,600 employees as of March. Unions are planning demonstrations in coming months to prevent more dismissals. Contraf-CUT, a labor confederation representing financial industry workers, will stage nationwide protests to repudiate Caixa's dismissals, senior union official Fabiana Uehara said. Caixa said that reworking the size of its payroll forms part of its strategy and budget. Banco de Brasilia, known as BRB, said cost-cutting programs like this help the bank to stay competitive.

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits slipped 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 307,000 for the week ended Jan. 17, the Labor Department said on Thursday. That reversed the bulk of the prior week's increase which had pushed claims to their highest level since early June, but fell short of economists expectations for a 300,000 reading. Economists had dismissed the prior week's increase as noise given that claims data is difficult to adjust for seasonal variations around the holidays. Some, however, wondered if some of the elevation in claims reflected layoffs in the oil industry in the wake of plunging crude prices. It is unclear at this point whether or not this move up in the trend reflects issues seasonally adjusting the data around the holidays or if it represents a more meaningful deterioration in the labor market, said Daniel Silver, an economist at JP Morgan in New York. State-level data for the week ending Jan. 10 showed an increase in claims in the oil-producing states like Texas, Louisiana and North Dakota. But claims also rose in states such Missouri, Indiana and Illinois, which are not oil-dependent. Oilfield service provider Baker Hughes Inc BHI.N this week announced it would cut 7,000 jobs, with most of the redundancies expected in the first quarter, because of slowing drilling activity. Schlumberger NV (SLB.N) has announced 9,000 job cuts. Crude oil prices CLc1 LCOc1 have plunged almost 60 percent since June, hitting five-year lows as increased shale production in the United States and weak global demand has caused a glut on the market. The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, increased 6,500 last week to 306,500, taking it above the 300,000 mark for the first time since September. The claims data covered the week during which the government surveyed employers for January's nonfarm payrolls.  Despite the gyrations in claims and the four-week average rising 7,750 between the December and January payroll survey periods, there is little doubt that the labor market is tightening.   Employment gains have exceeded 200,000 in each of the last 11 months, the longest stretch since 1994, and job openings are  near 14-year highs. In addition, the ratio of unemployed people for every job opening is the lowest since early 2008. The claims report showed the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid increased 15,000 to 2.44 million in the week ended Jan. 10.

Disney, whose empire spans TV, film, merchandise and theme parks, is exploring cutbacks in jobs it no longer needs because of improvements in technology, one of the people said. It is also looking at redundant operations that could be eliminated following a string of major acquisitions over the past few years, said the person. The people did not want to be identified because Disney has not disclosed the internal review. After years of repeated and sometimes severe cost cutting in the wake of the financial crisis, by last summer it looked as though Corporate America had trimmed all the fat and was back on the path of profits through operating growth. But news Disney is weighing cuts - on the heels of Eli Lilly and Co's warning last week that cost controls would drive earnings this year - could herald yet another wave of retrenchment. Disney executives warned in November that the rising cost of sports rights and moribund home video sales would dampen growth. We are constantly looking at eliminating redundancies and creating greater efficiencies, especially with the rapid rise in new technology, said Disney spokeswoman Zenia Mucha. In terms of profit margin, Disney's studio is the least profitable of the entertainment conglomerate's four major product divisions. The studio had a profit margin of 12.3 percent in 2012. Its fifth division, the interactive unit that creates online games, lost $758 million over the last three years, according to the company's financial filings. The unit lost $216 million last year. Disney could trim jobs at both the studio and interactive divisions as well as its music arm, said Tony Wible, an analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott, who has a neutral rating on the company's stock. The media company is in what CEO Bob Iger calls a transition year after spending on projects such as the Cars Land expansion at the Disneyland Resort in California and a new cruise ship that launched last year. We invested a lot of money in our theme parks and resorts business, Disney Chief Financial Officer Jay Rasulo told a media conference in December. We want to execute against delivering the returns that we've been promising all of you for the years that we've been making those investments. We really want to hunker down on it. Cuts Not Certain Staff cuts are not a certainty at this point, the source added, although the company has a history of streamlining operations through layoffs. In 2011, the interactive group laid off about 200 people at its video games unit after what Disney executives said at the time was a shift away from console games to focus on online and mobile entertainment. In September, 50 employees at Disney Interactive were laid off in a restructuring of the money-losing unit, according to one of the sources. The company also made cuts at its publishing unit last year, and cut workers at its studio in 2011. Statues of Walt Disney and Mickey Mouse are seen at Disneyland in Anaheim, California, March 11, 2011.Mike BlakeThis is not necessarily a negative thing, said Michael Morris, an analyst with Davenport and Co who has a buy recommendation on the stock but was not aware of the review. It speaks to a fiscally responsible management. Corporate America Cuts Back If Disney does make some cuts, it would be the latest company to warn that costs still need to come under control. Lilly said last week that sales this year would be flat to slightly higher, but said profit growth would exceed Wall Street estimates on the back of cost controls. In late December, book publisher Scholastic Corp said it too would look for cost savings in the current fiscal year. Disney and Lilly are far from alone, though. Tech companies in particular are expected to have been hurt by the fourth-quarter uncertainty over the impending fiscal cliff of automatic tax increases and spending cuts which led corporate clients to slow or stop spending. The signage at the main gate of The Walt Disney Co. is pictured in Burbank, California in this May 7, 2012 file photograph.Fred Prouser/FilesCongress agreed to a deal on January 1 that averted the cliff. Fear of the cliff may have affected sales across a range of industries, further clouding the growth picture. Retailers are also expected to contend with the fallout of a lackluster holiday season, which could lead to cutbacks. Thomson Reuters corporate earnings research analyst Greg Harrison said many of the themes that held true in 2012 -- like cost cuts that helped earnings, even as sales stalled -- were likely to carry over into this year. In the absence of any fresh catalysts for profits emerging, it may be reasonable to expect that current estimates for earnings growth in the low- to mid-single digits throughout 2013 may shrink, even though analysts believe that the slowest part of the earnings growth is now behind us, Harrison wrote in a preview of the fourth-quarter earnings season. If a trend is emerging, it should begin to be clear as soon as the next two weeks, as companies start reporting 2012 results and offering up their 2013 outlooks. Studio Could Be Target The present review, headed by CFO Rasulo, has already identified areas to change in the company's travel policy, said one of the sources. It is also looking at a hiring freeze rather than layoffs, said a second source. Cuts are most likely at the studio, said two of the three sources, where the strategy has changed to focus on fewer films and rely more on outside producers such as Steven Spielberg's DreamWorks studio, which finances its own films and pays Disney a fee to market and distribute them. The film strategy shift began when Iger took over as CEO in late 2005. Under Iger, the company purchased Toy Story creator Pixar Animation and Marvel, which brought it characters such as Thor and Iron Man that featured in this summer's blockbuster hit The Avengers. Disney completed a $4.06 billion acquisition of Star Wars creator George Lucas' Lucasfilm in December, and has said that it will begin producing new installments of the lucrative franchise in 2015, and make a film every two to three years. Shares in the company fell 2.3 percent on Monday to close at $50.97, sharply underperforming broader markets. Editing by Edwin Chan, Richard Pullin and Phil Berlowitz"

The 24-hour general strike against a new scheme to transfer or fire state workers comes a day before parliament votes on a series of reforms that must be passed before the European Union and International Monetary Fund can disburse more financial aid. Over 30,000 demonstrators - including municipal police and teachers targeted in the layoff scheme - gathered in the central square before parliament beating drums and blowing whistles in one of the biggest anti-austerity protests in Greece this year. It feels like Greece is dead and now the vultures are fighting over its corpse, said Eleni Fotopoulou, 58, a retired teacher and mother of two. I'm not angry anymore, I am disgusted. We have to fight back. Greeks are split over whether state workers - whose jobs are protected by the constitution - should also feel the pain of layoffs that have ravaged the private sector. But virtually all agree that Greek society cannot handle any more spending cuts and tax hikes - a message the government will relay to Germany's finance minister, Europe's leading proponent of economic austerity, when he visits Athens later this week. Outside parliament, protesters chanted No more sacrifices and waved banners that read Fire the troika in reference to the trio of European Commission, European Central Bank and IMF propping up Greece with over 200 billion euros in aid. Domestic flights were disrupted after civil aviation unions staged a four-hour work stoppage and Athens's main tourist attraction - the Acropolis - shut early.

The 24-hour general strike against a new scheme to transfer or fire state workers comes a day before parliament votes on a series of reforms that must be passed before the European Union and International Monetary Fund can disburse more financial aid. Over 30,000 demonstrators - including municipal police and teachers targeted in the layoff scheme - gathered in the central square before parliament beating drums and blowing whistles in one of the biggest anti-austerity protests in Greece this year. It feels like Greece is dead and now the vultures are fighting over its corpse, said Eleni Fotopoulou, 58, a retired teacher and mother of two. I'm not angry anymore, I am disgusted. We have to fight back. Greeks are split over whether state workers - whose jobs are protected by the constitution - should also feel the pain of layoffs that have ravaged the private sector. But virtually all agree that Greek society cannot handle any more spending cuts and tax hikes - a message the government will  relay to Germany's finance minister, Europe's leading proponent of economic austerity, when he visits Athens later this week. Outside parliament, protesters chanted No more sacrifices and waved banners that read Fire the troika in reference to the trio of European Commission, European Central Bank and IMF propping up Greece with over 200 billion euros in aid. Domestic flights were disrupted after civil aviation unions staged a four-hour work stoppage and Athens's main tourist attraction - the Acropolis - shut early.

The 27-year-old, who has worked here for years, now faces unemployment as the company implements major layoffs. They only told us they will let go a mix of people, from all departments, she told Reuters outside the factory on Wednesday, shivering as a bitter cold wind blew from the north. Of course it upsets everyone, she said. In this world a good living is hard to come by. We'll stay as long as we can, then we may get our severance cheques... Then we'll see. Nokia arrived in Hungary during the boom years of the late 1990s. As its devices reigned supreme on global markets, Hungary produced so many that consumers in Asia and Africa often came to identify the country with the Nokia phone. But globalisation has moved more jobs further east to Asia, and the spread of smartphones has knocked Nokia off its throne in the mobile world, spelling bad news in Komarom, a town of just 20,000 residents in the northwest of Hungary. Komarom is separated from Komarno in Slovakia only by the Danube river, and many Slovaks commute every day to work in the Nokia plant. Nokia said on Wednesday it would let go 4,000 more people around the world, more than half of them in Hungary, ending all phone assembly operations in Europe. In Hungary, 2,300 jobs will be axed in two or three steps by the end of the year, Nokia told its workers, adding that most of the losses would be blue-collar, manufacturing positions. The move hurts the labour market in Hungary as well as Slovakia, where about a third of Nokia's workers have commuted from, even as Hungary's political elite repeatedly declared the phone giant one of its most prized investors. I still stand by this: we should support foreign investors who, for decent profit, create jobs for Hungarians and using Hungarian labour they create value, Prime Minister Viktor Orban told an audience of his supporters on Tuesday, praising Nokia along with companies like German car makers Audi and Daimler. These firms must be welcomed and kept around, Orban said. It remains to be seen just how big a dent Nokia's move will put in Hungary's economic output. The firm's Hungarian revenues have topped 1 trillion forints ($4.56 billion) per year despite any recent market trouble, the news web site index.hu said. The phone maker's output has boosted Hungary's overall industrial performance so much that its struggles were felt on a macroeconomic level, analysts said. The silver lining is that Nokia is not moving the highest added-value activities, only the assembly function, which represents the lowest added-value in the factory, Takarekbank analyst Gergely Suppan told Reuters. The higher-value functions remain here and the lower-value is shipped off to Asia. A Badly Kept Secret The fact that Nokia would lay off a large chunk of its Hungarian workers was more than obvious for a long time in Komarom, workers told Reuters. The size of the changes was kept secret but the fact that it was coming was clear, said Zoltan Laszlo, who leads the workers' union at the Komarom plant. Nokia, like most such firms, adopted a new strategy to move assembly as close to its suppliers as possible, and for quite some time, we have ordered our supplies from Asia. Workers filed out from the factory at 2 p.m. as the morning shift ended, silently boarding dozens of buses that awaited them in the parking lot. Few of them would give their names in conversations, because they said management only told them big layoffs would come this year, but who would stay and who would go was not yet clear. Massive layoffs have been in the air for a long time, several workers said. When Nokia closed down its plant in Romania last year, some of the assembly equipment was installed in Komarom, but the factory was used far below capacity. There were times when entire rows of machines just sat there idle, said Kornel Kisistok, 29. People were told to take weeks off at a time. Bosses never admitted what was going on, but we knew it could not continue like this for long. Then today they set up an event hall, gathered everyone around and told us what we needed to know.

Thursday's reports support views of faster growth this year, driven by consumer spending, despite a faltering global economy. Labor market conditions continue to improve, providing support for consumers and contributing to a virtuous cycle for the economy, said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors in Kalamazoo, Michigan. Initial claims for state unemployment benefits slipped by 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 294,000 for the week ended Jan. 3, the Labor Department said.  While that was a bit less than Wall Street's expectations of a drop to 290,000, the trend in claims remained consistent with a steadily tightening labor market. At current levels, claims probably have little room to fall further. Claims have never dropped below the 280,000-290,000 range in the last 20 years, reflecting the reality that a certain number of layoffs is a natural part of the growth/lifecycle of companies even in the best of times, said Anthony Karydakis,  chief economic strategist at Millar Tabak in New York. The four-week moving average of claims, a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, held below the key 300,000 mark for the 17th straight week. The data helped U.S. stocks rally for a second straight day, while U.S. government debt prices fell. The dollar climbed to a nine-year high against the euro on views the European Central Bank could soon embark on a monetary stimulus program to fend off a recession in the euro zone. Fewer Layoffs The strengthening job market backdrop could bring the Federal Reserve a step closer to raising its short-term interest rate, which it has kept near zero since December 2008.  In a separate report, global outplacement consultancy Challenger, Gray & Christmas said the number of job cuts announced by U.S. employers fell 9.2 percent in December.  For the whole of 2014, employers announced a total of  483,171 job cuts. That was 5 percent fewer than in 2013 and the smallest number since 1997. This bodes well for job seekers who will not only find more employment opportunities in 2015, but will enjoy increased job security once they are in those new positions, said John A. Challenger, chief executive officer of Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Reports on Wednesday showed a jump in small business hiring and another month of solid gains in private payrolls. The government is expected to report on Friday that nonfarm payrolls rose by 240,000 in December after surging by 321,000 in November. That would mark the 11th consecutive month of job gains above 200,000, the longest stretch since 1994.  Overall employment gains in 2014 are expected to be the largest since 1999. The unemployment rate is forecast slipping one-tenth of a percentage point to 5.7 percent in December, which would be the lowest level since June 2008.

Many oil producers and their contractors are trying to strike a balance between cutting costs and maintaining workforce reserves after a more-than 50 percent drop in oil prices  since last June. The drop has made some oil patch investors anxious that North Dakota could experience a third oil bust after slumps in the 1950s and 1980s. Local business leaders, though, say they're confident the state's economy can abide the slowdown. Indeed, oil prices are nothing if not volatile, up about 19 percent in the past four trading days after plunging for months. Whiting Petroleum Corp, the largest North Dakota oil producer, has no plans to lay off any of its 507 employees in the state, spokesman Eric Hagen said. Oilfield service provider Halliburton has told its roughly 1,500 North Dakota employees that job cuts are not coming, for now. The update came in a letter to staff from Brent Eslinger, senior district manager for Halliburton in Williston, considered capital of North Dakota's oil patch. Halliburton spokeswoman Susie McMichael added that the company will continue to monitor the business environment and cut costs as needed. Hess Corp, the state's third-largest oil producer and one that uses Halliburton to hydraulically fracture wells, has no plans to cut North Dakota staff. We're all about lean efficiencies, but there are no plans for layoffs, Hess spokesman John Roper said. Other large North Dakota producers, including Oasis Petroleum Inc and Statoil, have said they have no plans to reduce their workforce. EOG Resources Inc hasn't announced any layoffs, spokeswoman K Leonard said. To be sure, all energy-related companies in North Dakota's oil patch are hunkering down. Many of the state's oil producers, including Hess and Oasis, have cut 2015 capital budgets. Whiting and EOG release spending plans later this month. While there are nearly 800 wells needing to be fracked in North Dakota, oil producers can wait up to a year to do so. Hess, for instance, plans to bring fewer wells online in 2015. Halliburton's announcement last month that it will lay off 1,000 in the eastern hemisphere - as well as similar plans by peers Schlumberger NV and Baker Hughes Inc, which Halliburton is buying for roughly $35 billion - sparked concern that the companies would cull large portions of their North Dakota staffs, steps that would have a negative economic ripple effect. Such fears, for now, appear unwarranted. Continental Resources Inc, North Dakota's second-largest oil producer, did not return a call seeking comment on staffing levels. Chief Executive Harold Hamm, though, bragged in a Tuesday press release that Continental's North Dakota acreage continues to provide exceptional results.

The Australian world number four had been in sparkling form earlier this year before his unexpected time on the sidelines, right after he had clinched his second PGA Tour victory at the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship. Though he is still icing his left thumb and keeping it taped up as a precaution, his main concern going into the first of the season's four majors is whether he can regain his precision off the tee after a lengthy layoff. I just need to tighten up a few things, get a little sharper with my tee shots, Day told reporters at a wet Augusta National on Monday after only two hours of practice was possible due to the threat of lightning. I think I'll be good. I took six, seven weeks off after coming back from Australia last year and my first event of the (PGA Tour) year, which was Torrey, I finished second there. To me, personally, I think it's the amount of work that I put into my game before the actual week starts, so the preparation is very huge for me. Day tied for second in the Farmers Insurance Open at Torrey Pines in late January before winning the biggest title of his career at the Match Play Championship in Arizona a month later. Doctor's Advice Two weeks after that, he pulled out of the WGC-Cadillac Championship in Miami on the advice of his doctor and focused on getting his troublesome thumb ready for the Masters. It's fine now, said Day, who has triumphed twice on the PGA Tour but has made a habit of playing some of his best golf in the biggest events. I've had about six weeks off, I had a cortisone injection into it on Monday of last week. Had about a week off after the injection and everything's been progressing nicely. There's no pain. I'm taping it just as a precaution ... and I've been icing it a lot. It was more frustrating for me because just coming off the WGC win at the Match Play, I was playing some pretty good golf. It was trending in the right direction going into Doral (Miami) and the Florida Swing. Day has been at Augusta National since last Wednesday and experienced no adverse effects while playing 36 holes at the venue over the past four days. To get the cortisone injection into it, to be able to swing pain-free now, is great, the 26-year-old Queenslander smiled. The hand's coming up nicely, and I'm really looking forward to a nice, solid start (in Thursday's opening round). Day has produced two top-three finishes in three starts at Augusta National and has been an unabashed fan of the Masters since he first watched it on television as a child in his native Australia. I've been watching this golf tournament ever since I was a little kid watching Tiger Woods win around here, seeing highlights of José Maria Olazábal winning, as well, he said. Just the memories of watching Augusta and knowing that one day, I wanted to be the Masters champion and slip on the green jacket. I always wanted to be the first Australian to win it. Obviously Scotty got there first, but I'm happy to be the second. I just love everything about this place, the history and the tradition behind Augusta National and the Masters. It's golfing heaven. Day's compatriot Adam Scott became the first Australian to win the Masters with a gripping, highly emotional playoff victory over Argentina's Angel Cabrera last year. Editing by Frank Pingue"

The $12.7 billion fund that specializes in distressed-debt investing is eliminating 16 jobs after bringing in a consulting firm to review the New York-based fund's overhead, efficiency and expenses. Most of the employees losing their jobs are either in back-office or administrative positions. Two people who are part of the hedge fund's investment team are also being let go, a person familiar with Avenue said. Avenue, founded in 1995 by Lasry and his sister Sonia Gardner, specializes in investing in distressed debt and equity. The firm has offices in a number of cities, including London, Beijing and Munich. Earlier this year we retained a consulting firm to conduct a review that was recently completed, Lasry and Gardner wrote in the memo, sent to staff last week. One outcome of this process is that we are reducing Avenue's global workforce by approximately 6.5 percent, the memo said. The layoffs come during a year the firm is rebounding from a disappointing 2011, when its flagship U.S hedge fund lost about 10 percent. The memo to staff said several portfolios are generating double digit returns this year, with that flagship U.S. fund up more than 12 percent through Oct. 3, according to a person familiar with the returns. The firm's principal European fund, which lost 3 percent last year, has risen almost 13 percent year-to-date. The average hedge fund is up a little over 3 percent this year, while the Standard & Poor's 500 index is up 16 percent. In the memo, Lasry and Gardner said Avenue will continue to make hires in other areas, singling out a new direct lending business. In recent years, hedge funds have begun making loans to smaller companies, filling in some of the financing gap left by big banks that retreated from the business in the wake of the financial crisis. Hedge fund lenders often charge higher rates of interest than traditional lenders. We have recently added a senior member to the Avenue team to establish a direct lending business and expect to bring on additional professionals as this new business scales up, the memo said. Lasry is a well-known name in the hedge fund industry and a prominent supporter of President Obama. In June, he hosted a fundraiser for Obama at his Upper East Side home. He has remained a strong supporter of the administration, even after many in the $2 trillion hedge fund industry have thrown their support behind Republican challenger Gov. Mitt Romney. Recently Lasry said the debt crisis in Europe presents some very appealing investment opportunities, and the firm recently closed a second fund focused on making investments in the troubled euro zone region. The $2.8 billion fund was oversubscribed, the memo said. His hedge funds most recent 13-F regulatory filing revealed Avenue owns stock and warrants in General Motors and shares of CIT."
"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-states-employees-idUSBRE83706720120408","Despite recovery, U.S. public employees face more layoffs","","April 8, 2012 /  11:14 AM / in 5 years","","(Reuters) - Since 2009, the city of Chesapeake, tucked up against the Great Dismal Swamp in southern Virginia, has cut its workforce twice. This summer, nearly three years after the recession ended, the city of 222,209 has plans for a third round of layoffs. We're not seeing the recovery we want to see, said Budget Director Steven Jenkins, who is hoping many of the 20 people will move into other jobs. The city's revenues are still feeling the concussions from the housing market downturn, which started in 2006, even as overall growth in the United States has improved. We are heavily reliant on the residential real estate market, said Jenkins. In a recent assessment the average property value dropped 3.7 percent, which hits property taxes, and hurts government budgets. The reassessment we just had was as big as any we've seen since the recession started. While Friday's report of weak growth in U.S. March payrolls raised concerns about the pace of private-sector hiring, local government jobs remain a drag on the recovery, one that is not anticipated to end soon. State and local governments for a time were able to shield public safety and education workforces from harmful cuts as the recession deepened. The 2009 federal stimulus fund helped offset lost tax revenue, but that money is gone. Now, many cities and counties nationwide are facing the same dilemma as Chesapeake. Squeezed by depressed property tax revenues and cuts in state aid, they are chipping away at their workforces. The result? The last three years of job losses at the state and local government level has been the most dramatic since Labor Department records began in 1955, according to a Reuters analysis. Public-sector employees tended to have more job security, which in some ways helps during weak economic climates, as their steady demand for goods and services spread through the economy. The recent trend, conversely, can make things worse. If public-sector employment had grown since June 2009 by the average amount it grew in the three previous recoveries (2.8 percent) instead of shrinking by 2.5 percent, there would be 1.2 million more public-sector jobs in the U.S. economy today, said the Economic Policy Institute in a recent report, which included federal employees in the calculation. Local governments have cut 482,000 jobs since the beginning of 2009. They added jobs in just two months since 2011 started. Previously, states only had two consecutive years of layoffs, 1995 and 1996, when they scrapped about 57,000 jobs, or about one-third of the 150,000 cut since the beginning of 2009. The current recovery is the only one that has seen public-sector losses over its first 31 months, the report said. As of March, 14.1 million people worked for local governments and 5.1 million for states. Public employees outnumber those in manufacturing, construction, and other areas typically considered engines of the economy. <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Graphic on job loss rate link.reuters.com/fuc57s Graphic on job loss span link.reuters.com/duc57s <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Hit by Housing, Low Demand Three weeks ago, firefighters in Scranton, Pennsylvania, took 10 minutes to respond to a fire, instead of the usual four minutes or less. Lighter staffing was blamed, as the city had laid off 29 firefighters in January. We had been telling them ... there's a catastrophe that's going to happen here, said John J. Judge IV, president of the International Association of Fire Fighters Local 60. After the delay, 12 of the firefighters were rehired, but that's still a reduction of 17 workers. In March, local governments shed 3,000 jobs after gaining 1,000 in February, according to the Labor Department. State governments added 2,000 jobs. However, states employ 39,000 fewer people than a year ago, and the slight recent improvement is unlikely to be confirmed. The rate of decline is slower, said Christopher Hoene, research director at the National League of Cities. But I don't think the curve is shifting upward. I don't think we're going to see hiring in the local government sector. Meanwhile, the private sector is creating jobs. Friday's employment report showed private payrolls gained 121,000 jobs in March, while public payrolls lost 1,000. Moody's expects states to lose at least another 15,000 jobs through 2012 and local governments between 150,000 and 175,000. It's going to continue to be a drag on overall employment, said Moody's Investors Services Economist Daniel White. States vs. Locals Des Moines, Iowa, weathered the recession better than many other cities. Its unemployment rate is 6.1 percent, more than two percentage points below the national average. Nonetheless, it recently eliminated more than 40 full-time positions after property valuations dropped 3.5 percent. It too wants to put those workers into other jobs, said Deputy City Manager Allen McKinley, a former finance director and budget officer for the Iowa capital. Des Moines also has fewer dollars to spend as the state recently mandated bigger contributions to police and fire pensions, McKinley said. As public pensions attempt to close total shortfalls of at least $600 billion, many state and local governments are having to pitch in more money to retirement systems, taking dollars away from other departments. Also, with fewer employees on the payrolls, the smaller the worker contributions to pension systems that must send retirees fixed amounts each month. A new threat has emerged in Iowa. Both parties in the legislature, along with the governor, hope to boost growth by cutting commercial property taxes, which make up around half of Des Moines revenues, by about 40 percent. Cities across the state are protesting the three proposals. All states except Vermont must end their fiscal years with balanced budgets. For its upcoming fiscal year, Florida cut 4,000 state jobs and reduced higher education and healthcare funds. Spending cuts in the $70 billion budget are so bad that Palm Beach County Clerk and Comptroller Sharon Bock said constituents might sue. Florida's new budget means Bock must find $2.5 million in savings and still keep the courts open, she said. The office has already laid off 111 employees to cope with four years of budget cuts. Now, it will not fill 40 vacancies or replace departing employees - its annual turnover rate is about 10 percent. The staff size is currently around 430 people. The worker shortage will result in 10 hours of backlog each week, Bock said. Here is the dilemma that I am in: I take an oath as a constitutional officer to provide services to the public, she said about her duties, which include keeping vital records and operating court systems. Do I get sued by the public because I can't open a branch office or because I have to close one day a week? Or do I lay off people, and end up in the same scenario?

Precision Drilling, one of the largest rig contractors in North America, has idled more than 50 of the 250 rigs it had working this time last year, leaving more than 1,000 skilled operators out of work, the company said on Thursday. “Industry downturns are difficult for all, but they affect our rig crews more than anybody else,” the company’s chief executive said in a statement. “Precision recruited, trained and developed many excellent crews to support the demands of our customers over the past several years, and unfortunately we now don’t have work for many of these dedicated workers.” Human Capital Tens of thousands more jobs have been cut, through layoffs or retirements, across every part of the industry, ranging from self-employed drilling contractors and well-completion crews to full-service companies, seismic surveyors and of course the oil and gas producers themselves. Oil and gas production is an exceptionally capital-intensive industry. But the sector’s most important and scarce resource is its workforce.  The oil industry’s popular image may be a roughneck in soiled overalls drinking in a strip joint, but it has an enormous demand for highly skilled and, during a boom, very well compensated workers. Modern oil and gas production is technically complicated and dangerous work. The days of drilling wildcat wells more or less at random and allowing the well to blow out in a massive gusher are long over. The industry still provides employment for unskilled casual labor. In boom times some of the jobs for truck drivers and other support staff can be exceptionally well paid. But at its core are tens of thousands of petroleum engineers and petroleum geoscientists, as well as tool pushers, drillers, derrickmen and roughnecks on the rigs themselves, who perform specialized functions which demand years of formal education and, most importantly, experience in the field. The challenge is recruiting, training and retaining these workers and maintaining an appropriate long-term labor force profile in an industry stuck with a profound boom-bust cycle and beset by periodic mass layoffs. The Great Crew Change Until recently, the oil industry was preoccupied by a looming shortage of skilled workers -- especially mid-career professionals ready to step into supervisory and senior leadership roles. Schlumberger’s consulting arm, which offers human resources planning advice to third parties, has warned repeatedly about “the looming talent shortage” as a result of what it termed “the great crew change”. Oil and gas companies have lots of experienced workers in their late 40s and 50s, and have recently succeeded in attracting more young graduates. But there is an acute shortage of mid-career professionals aged 35-45, with 10-20 years training and experience. The large number of professionals in their 50s poses a major problem as they reach the age for retirement, while recent graduates are still 10-15 years away from being ready to assume supervisory positions. The industry’s uneven age profile is the legacy of the last downturn during the late 1980s and through the 1990s, when low oil prices and the squeeze on profits resulted in enormous job losses and a virtual freeze on hiring. As a result, the cohort of workers recruited in the mid and late 1990s, who should be moving into supervisory and eventually leadership positions, is unusually small. Back in 2013, Schlumberger predicted the oil and gas industry would have a shortage of around 15,000 experienced petroleum engineers and geoscientists by 2016. The predicted shortfall of experienced petro-technical professionals (PTPs) would approach 20 percent of the total required number. The looming shortage was seen by many as the biggest single threat to increasing oil and gas supplies in the second half of the current decade and into the 2020s. Graduate Recruits Schlumberger forecast the industry would need to hire 10,000 new petro-technical professionals every year through 2020 to offset retirements and meet the need for expansion. The oil industry spent years working to encourage more college students to specialize in petroleum engineering and related disciplines. Petroleum engineering departments hired extra instructors and increased enrolments. According to the U.S. Department of Education, the number of students enrolled in petroleum engineering programs at U.S. universities increased from a recent low of just 561 in 1997 to 1,301 in 2011 (link.reuters.com/tux93w). Now, of course, the downturn has thrown thousands of oil and gas professionals out of work, and led to pay freezes and cuts in contracting rates. Amid all the headlines about layoffs, falling salaries and a potentially prolonged downturn in oil prices, the industry somehow has to avoid losing current graduates to other sectors and continue encouraging high school students that oil and gas engineering and science is an attractive long-term career. Because if the oil industry cannot maintain an adequate skill base, with the right age structure, skill shortages will re-emerge and set the stage for the next brutal boom-bust cycle. In practice, the industry has never succeeded in balancing long-term personnel planning with the short-term financial imperative to control the wage bill. It may not be any more successful this time around, if the slump in oil prices and drilling continues long enough. And that’s why the chief executive of Baker Hughes could say truthfully mass lay-offs are what he and everyone else “hates” most about the oil and gas industry. Editing by Andrew Heavens"

Employers announced 40,430 job cuts this month, up 24.2 percent from 32,556 in December, according to the report from consultants Challenger, Gray & Christmas, Inc. But January's job cuts were down almost the same amount from the same time a year ago, declining 24.4 percent from 53,486 in January 2012. It was the third lowest number of January lay-offs recorded by Challenger going back to 1993. The relatively low job-cut totals we have seen for the last couple of months indicate that employers do not foresee a prolonged decline in economic activity, John Challenger, chief executive officer of Challenger, Gray & Christmas, said in a statement. The financial and retail sectors lost the most workers. Financial firms cut 8,578 workers, while retail companies dropped 6,676 jobs. But at the same time, the retail industry announced plans to hire 54,000 employees. Overall hiring announcements climbed to 60,585 from 16,266 in December. Such announced plans account for only a small fraction of actual hiring in the economy, the survey said. The report comes a day ahead of the key U.S. jobs report, which is forecast to show hiring held steady in January, pointing to modest growth.

Average prime rents dropped by 0.4 percent to 60 pounds per square foot for the best homes in the year to mid-June versus the same period last year and were likely to remain subdued for the rest of 2012 as the UK banking sector's difficulties persisted, it said Friday. Central London's prime rental market is dominated by tenants from the financial services sector and is a barometer for what's happening in the City of London employment market, Savills' director of research Lucian Cook told Reuters. The number of jobs in London's finance sector is expected to slump to its lowest level in 16 years this year as the euro zone debt crisis drives firms in the UK capital to cut 25,000 jobs, consultancy Centre for Economics and Business Research said in May. On Tuesday, state-backed lender Royal Bank of Scotland  said it would make 600 staff redundant as a result of new UK rules due to take effect at the end of the year, bringing the total number of layoffs it has made since its 2008 bailout to 36,000. Hedge fund managers have more money than bankers to spend renting the best homes, Cook said, with bankers' spending power also hit by shrinking bonus pots. In February, Savills said hedge fund managers were likely to outspend bankers on buying London homes this year."
"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eads-jobs-idUSBRE9B80OY20131209","EADS breaks layoff taboo in plan to cut 5,800 jobs","","December 9, 2013 /  3:52 PM / 4 years ago","","PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus parent EADS EAD.PA risked a collision with unions and European politicians by unveiling plans to cut 5,800 mainly defense and space jobs that for a first time include significant forced redundancies, driven by weak European budgets. Breaking a taboo on forced job cuts throughout most of its 13-year history, the aerospace group said 1,500 people would be found new posts and some would not see temporary contracts renewed, but 1,000-1,450 people could not be spared redundancy. Chief Executive Tom Enders, who has pledged to run EADS as a normal company after a shake-up of French and German state shareholdings earlier this year, told unions that EADS had to be competitive or face worse turmoil as pressures increase. We need to act now, we cannot sit idle, he told an internal union meeting, according to a person who was present. Inaction would be irresponsible and would result in a much more severe situation for our employees and the performance of our company a few years down the road, he added. The cutbacks coincide with plans to merge the company's defense and space divisions into one unit combining its share of Eurofighter combat jets and Ariane space rockets as EADS becomes the latest defense firm to respond to weak orders. One of France's leading unions, Force Ouvriere, pre-pempted the announcement by disclosing the jobs news immediately following Enders' briefing to the EADS works council and vowed to used any initiative to resist compulsory redundancies. German union IG Metall also criticized the plans but noted they were still subject to further negotiations. Especially the announcement that compulsory redundancies are not ruled out irritates us, said IG Metall's Ruediger Luetjen, head of the EADS European works council. To the works council and IG Metall, compulsory redundancies are not an option at EADS. Political Test Shares in the company closed up 0.8 percent at 50.49 euros as investors welcomed the cost reductions, despite the prospect of a one-off restructuring charge that is still to be decided. It is financially positive and will reduce costs though EADS also has to face some structural problems, said Agency Partners analyst Nick Cunningham, referring to heavy reliance on shared fighter and missile programs for defense earnings. Compulsory redundancies are relatively rare in France and Germany, where EADS has its main operations, and so far the majority of its 140,000 workers have been shielded by the strength of its fast-growing Airbus commercial business. Sackings were specifically excluded when Airbus announced plans to reduce its workforce in 2007 and since then the civil planemaking division has reached its Power8 targets mainly through increased volumes rather than by reducing manpower. EADS said it would open up posts at Airbus and helicopter division Eurocopter for the redeployment of affected staff. It said it would also freeze renewal of 1,300 temporary contracts and bring in further voluntary measures. Some 500 corporate posts are included in the headcount reduction. The company said the restructuring would lead to a substantial consolidation of sites across Germany, France, Spain and the UK, which are considered its home nations. The location and size of company operations has historically been a politically sensitive issue at EADS, but the geographical spread of cuts and the prospect of forced layoffs are likely to test Enders' claims to run a normal company. EADS is owned by France and Germany with 12 percent and Spain at 4 percent, with the rest floated on the market. But most special state powers were removed under new governance rules that came together in the wake of a failed bid to merge EADS and Britain's BAE Systems (BAES.L) in 2012. The proposal to create a new European giant, with an equal focus on defense, was blocked by German Chancellor Angela Merkel, according to people involved in the negotiations. Under the merger proposal, EADS offered guarantees on German defense jobs. EADS said it needed to be competitive even as it aims to double margins to 10 percent by 2015. It is not clear to me why valuable jobs in Germany and Bremen have to be cut to satisfy exaggerated margin expectations, said Bremen mayor Jens Boehrnsen, a member of the Social Democrats which are forming a coalition government with Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats. The German economy ministry declined comment. French government officials were not available for comment. EADS meanwhile plans to sell its Paris office building - the former headquarters of now defunct French state aerospace firm Aerospatiale, whose assets became part of EADS when it was created from a Franco-German-Spanish merger in 2000. Enders has moved the company's headquarters to Toulouse, France and plans to change its name to Airbus from next year: two decisions that have inflamed critics in his native Germany.

The chipmaker forecast a drop in fourth-quarter revenue that is worse than Wall Street expected, and Chief Executive Rory Read said he does not expect the PC industry to improve for several quarters. AMD, which is a distant No. 2 to top chipmaker Intel Corp,  said in a statement it expects its restructuring actions, which will also include site consolidations, to result in operational savings of $190 million next year. It expects to record a restructuring expense in the fourth quarter of about $80 million. It'll bring earnings up, I guess, but you still have to ask how disruptive this will be and what roles are they cutting, said Stacy Rasgon, an analyst at Bernstein Research. The market is not going their way, and they're not in a strong position. Last week, AMD warned that its third-quarter revenue fell more than it had previously expected and that gross margins suffered from a $100 million writedown due to lower future growth of some products. AMD said it has set a target for a quarterly $1.3 billion revenue break-even point. Read took over at AMD last year promising to fix long-standing execution problems that have plagued the chipmaker. But AMD has continued to lose money as well as market share to Intel and graphic chip rival Nvidia. The trends we knew would re-shape the industry are happening at a much faster pace than we anticipated, Read told analysts on a conference call. Looking for markets with faster growth than PCs, AMD said it plans to increase its focus on selling chips for communications, industrial and gaming applications. Read said those areas will grow to account for 20 percent of quarterly revenue by the fourth quarter of next year compared with 5 percent now. Flat-Footed Like Intel, Sunnyvale, California-based AMD was caught flat-footed in recent years with the emergence and fast growth of mobile devices like Apple's iPad. Tablets and smartphones, once considered a niche market by Intel and others, are quickly gaining favor with consumers and eating into sales of laptops and desktop computers, while a slowing global economy is dampening spending in general. One of Read's first major moves was to announce a plan last November to slash 10 percent of AMD's workforce to save about $200 million in operating costs. AMD and Intel have been slow to adapt their PC chip designs to mobile. But while Intel has poured its massive resources into efforts to catch up to smartphone chipmakers like Qualcomm, AMD has yet to define a clear mobile strategy. Shares of AMD have fallen 43 percent over the past year to levels last seen in 2009. AMD posted third-quarter revenue of $1.27 billion, down from $1.69 billion a year ago, and a net loss of $157 million, or 21 cents a share, compared with a year ago profit of $97 million, or 13 cents a share. Analysts had expected AMD to post $1.28 billion in revenue for the third quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. AMD estimated fourth-quarter revenue would fall 9 percent from the third quarter, plus or minus 4 percent. AMD's fourth-quarter revenue forecast translates into a range of $1.116 billion to $1.196 billion. Analysts on average expected $1.33 billion. The guide is actually surprisingly weak, it shows that AMD still has issues to deal with in the near term, said Patrick Wang, an analyst at Evercore Partners. AMD's stock was unchanged in extended trade after closing down 5.41 percent at $2.62."

LOUIS -- A long All-Star break did not slow down the St. Louis Blues. Playing their first game since Jan. 19, the longest hiatus of any team in the NHL, the Blues got shootout goals from right winger T.J. Oshie and defenseman Kevin Shattenkirk to give them a 5-4 win over the Nashville Predators on Thursday night. The Blues (30-13-4) improved to 8-0-1 in their past nine games and pulled within four points of the Central Division-leading Predators (31-10-6). The victory might have been costly, however, as the Blues lost left winger Patrik Berglund and center Jori Lehtera to injuries. Coach Ken Hitchcock said neither would play Friday night in Carolina, at which time their status will be re-evaluated. The Blues fell behind 2-0 before rallying with four goals in a span of 9:53 in the second period to take a 4-3 lead into the third period. The Predators forced overtime thanks to a goal by left winger James Neal with 2:38 remaining in regulation. In the shootout, Oshie put the Blues in front before Predators defenseman Roman Josi tied it to send the shootout to an extra round. Shattenkirk then beat Nashville goalie Carter Hutton, and St. Louis goalie Brian Elliott stopped Neal for the victory. Related CoveragePreview: Predators at BluesThe win was a nice cap to Shattenkirk's 26th birthday. I felt like that late goal in the third was something that kind of fell on my shoulders, Shattenkirk said. I wanted the opportunity to get it back. I really wanted to make it count. There's no way you can get gypped on your birthday. It was a nice little present. We have the fathers here, so my dad was able to see it, too. Shattenkirk improved his career record in shootouts to six goals on 14 chances, five of which were game-winners. Even though the goal late in the third period allowed the Predators to earn one point, the Blues extended the momentum they established before the nine-day break. We're staying on a roll, Shattenkirk said. We had a pretty solid game. They're a tough team. They never quit. They wear you down. They can beat you up. I thought we did a great job. The teams met for the fifth and final time in the regular season, with Predators going 3-1-1 in games that were all decided by one goal. We knew they were going to be playing hard, and they came out hard tonight, said Predators center Mike Fisher, who had two goals and an assist. His first goal, on a first-period power play, was the 500th point of his career. I guess it's nice, but it would have been nicer to come on a night when we got a win, Fisher said. The Predators played Tuesday night, winning in overtime against Colorado, in their first game after the break. They are 7-1-3 in their past 11 games. It was a hard-fought game both ways, said Nashville coach Peter Laviolette. They had their moments and we had our moments. It came down to breakaways, and we lost. Oshie, who scored one of the Blues' second-period goals, said he was not worried that the long layoff would have a negative effect on the team. We've got guys who work hard on and off the ice, he said. There's a little rivalry going there with us and Nashville. They're a good team, they're hard to play against. They match up well against us, and it's always fun to rise to these occasions and get the two points against them. NOTES: St. Louis LW Alexander Steen was held scoreless, ending a 10-game scoring streak in which he recorded seven goals and 11 assists. ... St. Louis G Martin Brodeur, who officially retired Thursday, dropped the ceremonial first puck. He is joining the Blues' front office as a senior adviser to GM Doug Armstrong. ... C Marcel Goc, acquired from Pittsburgh on Tuesday, played his first game with the Blues. He was a plus-1 while winning 72 percent of his faceoffs in just under 13 minutes of ice time. ... Blues LW Chris Porter, out since Dec. 28 because of an ankle injury, is scheduled to be re-evaluated Monday. ... Injured G Pekka Rinne joined the Predators for their morning skate but remains on a three- to five-week timetable announced when he sustained a knee injury Jan. 15. ... Thursday night's game began a stretch that will see the Blues play nine games in a 15-day span. They play at Carolina on Friday night. ... The Predators began a three-game trip.

In 2013, the 45-year-old boilermaker left his hometown of Cebu in the Philippines, where he was getting paid about $10 a day, to work in Karratha in Western Australia for $30 an hour. Enough to support his relatives and build a new life Down Under. What Junio didn't expect was that Australia's booming resources industry would go bust less than two years later, taking his job, and leaving him just 60 days to find work or go home. It's very difficult because most of the companies don't want 457 visa holders, he said, referring to temporary permits for skilled workers. Across the country, people like Junio are falling victim to downsizing. Jobs, once plentiful and well paid, are scarce. Real estate prices in boom towns are sinking and even the notoriously high coffee prices in mining capital Perth have leveled off at under $4. Prices of iron ore and coal, the country's two biggest export earners, have plunged during the last two years amid falling demand from China, in the wake of its economic slowdown. Just a few years ago, foreign workers were flooding into Australia, lured by huge pay as the resources industry scrambled to fill positions. Truck driving and cooking jobs offering $100,000 a year made headlines abroad. But those workers, like Junio, are now hard-pressed to find work, especially if they are on temporary visas. Even permanent residents have to take lower pay. There is reality coming into the marketplace about salaries, said John Downing, who runs global resources recruiting firm Downing Teal, adding that salary expectations have fallen 10 percent to 25 percent. Nobody in the Streets For Lease signs are everywhere in West Perth, the headquarters of many mining, oil and gas companies. You could shoot a cannon down those streets, said resources analyst Peter Strachan. There's nobody there. Commercial vacancy rates in the city are near a 20-year high of 15 percent as resources companies downsize or shut down, said Joe Lenzo, of the Property Council of Australia. The real estate market has also been hit in the coal country of Queensland, across the continent. Owner will throw in a brand new car, read advertisements for houses in the coal-mining town of Moranbah. Just pick your favorite color. Such ploys were unheard of two years ago, when investors were snapping up property and shift workers were hotbedding, or rotating use of beds. But the bottom has fallen out of the Moranbah real estate market after coal prices slumped. If you bought a property for $1 million, you'd be lucky to have it valued at $400,000, said John Wood of Moranbah Real Estate. People are walking away. And it's not just real estate. The impacts are right across the board, said Dawson Wilkie, the director of a civil engineering firm in the coastal city of Townsville. His firm had been set to make $300,000 to $400,000 on a $40-million upgrade to the Townsville airport, a hub for fly-in, fly-out mining workers, but the plan was shelved. Wilkie has just five contractors now, down from 20 in the boom times. It may be the worst of times, but old hands expect things will improve. Just as a lot of people thought the boom would never end, some people might think the bust will never end, said recruiter Downing. We will go through better times.

It was the one that got everybody's attention - the public and the bank regulators. Erickson did not base his Tolkien retake on a blow-by-blow account of the WaMu debacle, but 'The Hobbit' is an allegory, and it's kind of fitting someone would (find inspiration) in Washington Mutual, Barrington said. It was a cautionary tale, and not in abstract way. With more than 6,000 e-books in circulation, The Wobbit currently ranks 43rd in Amazon.com's ranking of parodies. But that could soon change with Peter Jackson's film The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey due out in December; Erickson hopes to exploit the fortuitous tie-in to the fullest. (Jackson is filming two Hobbit movies back-to-back, the second to be released in 2013; Erickson is working on another Tolkien parody: Superfriends of the Ring.) Soon after The Wobbit went on Amazon, it caught the attention of Carsten Polzin, an editorial director at Piper Verlag in Munich, Germany. His company now plans to release a German-language edition, and has more ambitious plans for The Wobbit as the release of Jackson's film draws near, including the possible sale of English-language rights in North America and elsewhere. I instantly liked Erickson's style and prose; very funny and yet respectful for Tolkien's masterpiece, said Polzin.  Nor did the use of bankers as Hobbits throw him. It's most impressive how well they fit in to the story. One wonders how Tolkien could've done without them. Typical Tolkien parodies are a whole lot of jokes about Scottish accents and Oscar Wilde, said Erickson, who first read The Hobbit as an adolescent. I kind of went in an entirely different direction. It was largely 'write what you know.' There's also the sense of history involved, obscure as it is; Erickson's Wobbit is the first parody of a Tolkien book to use bankers as the main protagonists and antagonists, coming courtesy of a laid-off banker. In his five years at WaMu, he was surrounded by numerous creepy creatures. The Bilbo Baggins character (Bulbo Bunkins) is recast as a laid-off bank teller who journeys across a recession-plagued Little Earth. Bunkins' mission: to steal a resentful dragon's treasure and restore the economy. Dwarves, as Tolkien portrays them, are cranky, cheap and hierarchical guys - and everybody's related to somebody else, Erickson said. And I thought, 'Well you know, that kind of sounds like banking.' So it was really easy to write that way. The question is, can a profession so devoid of humor actually generate enough funny material for a parody novel? Kevin J. Williams, an MBA and former investment banker who now works in the comedy world, thinks so. He has written about the comedy-banking connection for no less than the Harvard Business Review, and likes what he has read of Erickson's book. A parody of hobbits that are bankers is a great thing, said Williams, 36. First of all, I actually worked with some bankers that physically looked like hobbits. And using parody as a tool to disarm or make sense of an industry or profession is definitely a healthy thing. If we lose our ability to do that, we lose our capacity to reflect."

We looked at five different scenarios and modeled them all and talked about them all, Bennett said in an interview on Wednesday. The scenarios included divesting specific units in Symantec's portfolio such as profitable consumer anti-virus business and a sluggish storage management and backup software unit. We can create a lot more value by running the company. Still, he left room for the board to change its mind if any of the new businesses do not work out. This process is going to be ongoing and we'll deal with anything that doesn't fit, he said during a meeting with investors at Symantec's headquarters in Silicon Valley. Bennett, who quoted former GE CEO Jack Welch during the presentation, unveiled plans to reorganize Symantec's sales force, expand its marketing efforts and change the way it sells goods over the web. He told Reuters that the company had erred by failing to integrate many products it has acquired into suites, losing opportunities to achieve cost efficiencies and bundle complementary technologies into packages that rivals could not match. Eliminating Bureacracy Bennett would not say how many managers would be laid off, but noted that Symantec, which has 20,000 employees, had far more managers than most companies. Symantec managers on average have few than five people reporting to them. That is about half as many managers at a typical company, he noted. It is hard to make decisions. It slows you down. Communication is bad. There are too many people in meetings, he said. We have tremendous assets, but we haven't been deploying them, he said. Our system doesn't work. The company forecast that the changes will boost profit margins, partly due to big increases in the efficiency of Symantec's vast sales and marketing groups. It forecast that spending on those activities will fall to 27 percent of revenue by 2017, down from 41 percent last year. Meanwhile, spending on research and development will rise to 16 percent of revenue from 14 percent over the same period as the company boosts investment in its new product suites, which it will build over the next six months to two years. The company's shares were holding steady at $21.66 in after-hours trade, from a close of $21.46 on the Nasdaq. Quarterly Results Separately on Wednesday, Symantec reported quarterly earnings that beat expectations and said it was splitting the chief executive and chairman jobs. It reported a profit of 45 cents per share, excluding items, for its fiscal third quarter ended Dec. 28. That topped the average analyst estimate of 38 cents, according to a poll by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company also named independent director Dan Schulman to the position of non-executive chairman, replacing Bennett, who  remains CEO and president. Bennett said the appointment would boost oversight of the senior executive team and give him more time to focus on managing the business and executing the new plan that he laid out on Wednesday. Symantec's problems trace back to 2004 when the company bought storage software maker Veritas for $13.5 billion in a deal the companies promised would transform the software industry.  It failed to live up to those expectations and instead Symantec has reported mixed results in the years that followed, repeatedly disappointing Wall Street. Salem inherited that legacy when he took over as CEO in 2009 from John Thompson, who engineered the Veritas acquisition. During Salem's tenure, Symantec shares fell about 19 percent, while the Nasdaq Composite Index climbed about 77 percent."

Penney Co Inc said it has recently laid off about 2,200 employees at 100 of its stores and district offices, the latest move by the struggling department store operator to contain costs as it contends with deep sales declines. Penney last week reported sales had fallen 25 percent in the first year of Chief Executive Ron Johnson's strategy of refashioning Penney stores into collections of branded boutiques and getting rid of hundreds of sales events and coupons. Johnson, who has started reversing that strategy, told a New York court last week that the retailer had laid off 19,000 workers up that point. The latest job cuts were concentrated in about 100 stores where sales fell the most, and the eliminations hit back office positions. A Penney spokeswoman said none of the cuts affected staff who deal with customers. We wanted to ensure that these reductions do not compromise the level of customer service provided in stores, spokeswoman Daphne Avila said in an email. The company is bringing back some sales events as it seeks to win back shoppers who balked at Penney's promotional strategy. Next week, the company will open boutiques for Joe Fresh, an up-and-coming trendy apparel brand from Canada that Johnson has said will help improve Penney's performance. Penney shares were up 2.3 percent to $14.77 at midday. The shares were trading at around $21 late last month before the retailer reported a fourth-quarter sales decline of more than 30 percent."

Greek labour unions have gone on strike repeatedly since early 2010, when the country was plunged into a debt crisis and sought a bailout from the European Union and International Monetary Fund to avert bankruptcy. The latest action, at the height of the tourist season, is against Athens's plans to shrink its spendthrift civil service, widely blamed for the crisis, by firing thousands of workers. The union representing the workers, OSYPA, plans to stage 24-hour rolling strikes on August 9-11. Greece relies heavily on tourism to help pull it out of a deep recession but the strike will mostly affect smaller airports. Traffic at major Greek airports is not expected to be disrupted because air traffic controllers are not participating. Plans to fire the workers were illegal, unconstitutional and beyond reason, OSYPA said. In the past, Greek courts have ruled strikes affecting tourism illegal, forcing workers to call them off. Firing public sector workers as part of measures Athens promised its lenders in return for billions of euros in aid is an incendiary issue in Greece, which is stuck in a sixth year of a recession that has pushed unemployment to a record 27 percent, twice the euro zone average.

As we ramp up capabilities in China, including additional 737-related work, the actions that we'll take are actions that will also allow us to grow jobs here in the U.S., Muilenburg said at an aerospace conference in Seattle organized by SAE International. In a memo to employees on Tuesday, Boeing Commercial Airplanes Chief Executive Ray Conner said the company was negotiating a strategic partnership and sales with China. These discussions are at a sensitive stage, Conner said in an internal memo seen by Reuters. I hope (it) will be a win for Boeing, a win for the Puget Sound, and a win for our stakeholders. I want to assure you that agreements we may reach with our Chinese partners will not result in layoffs or reduce employment for the 737 program in Washington state. Conner and Muilenburg did not discuss specifics of Boeing's proposed 737 finishing facility in China, a step expected to be announced during Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to Seattle this week. Boeing's plan to set up a facility in China that would paint, finish and deliver 737 jetliners built at its factory near Seattle has provoked its largest union, representing about 35,000 Boeing employees. The International Association of Machinists said Boeing has discussed its desire to expand collaboration with China but shared no details. Any shift of aerospace jobs from our bargaining unit or Washington State causes grave concern, the union has said. Muilenburg, who became CEO on July 1, said Boeing has had operations in China for 42 years and is continuing to invest to expand its capabilities there. Boeing is investing in a way that allows us to grow jobs around the world, he said, in response to a question. I think it's really important that as we think about that collaboration that it's seen as one that is beneficial to both countries. In his prepared remarks, Muilenburg called Apple Inc , Amazon.com Inc, Facebook Inc and Google Inc nontraditional aerospace and defense competitors for their efforts in space, satellites and drones. Boeing already has partnered with Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin to build a manned space vehicle capable of reaching the International Space Station. Boeing is working on other partnerships, Muilenburg said. We see emerging competitors and collaborators, he said, and need to be adept at partnering with them.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hedge-layoffs-avenue-idUSBRE89316320121004","Layoffs hit Lasry's Avenue Capital, firm to begin lending: memo","","October 4, 2012 /  5:21 PM / in 5 years","","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Marc Lasry's Avenue Capital Group hedge fund is downsizing and laying off roughly 6.5 percent of its staff, according to an employee memo reviewed by Reuters. The $12.7 billion fund that specializes in distressed-debt investing is eliminating 16 jobs after bringing in a consulting firm to review the New York-based fund's overhead, efficiency and expenses. Most of the employees losing their jobs are either in back-office or administrative positions. Two people who are part of the hedge fund's investment team are also being let go, a person familiar with Avenue said. Avenue, founded in 1995 by Lasry and his sister Sonia Gardner, specializes in investing in distressed debt and equity. The firm has offices in a number of cities, including London, Beijing and Munich. Earlier this year we retained a consulting firm to conduct a review that was recently completed, Lasry and Gardner wrote in the memo, sent to staff last week. One outcome of this process is that we are reducing Avenue's global workforce by approximately 6.5 percent, the memo said. The layoffs come during a year the firm is rebounding from a disappointing 2011, when its flagship U.S. hedge fund lost about 10 percent. The memo to staff said several portfolios are generating double digit returns this year, with that flagship U.S. fund up more than 12 percent through October 3, according to a person familiar with the returns. The firm's principal European fund, which lost 3 percent last year, has risen almost 13 percent year-to-date. The average hedge fund is up a little over 3 percent this year, while the Standard & Poor's 500 index .SPX is up 16 percent. In the memo, Lasry and Gardner said Avenue will continue to make hires in other areas, singling out a new direct lending business. In recent years, hedge funds have begun making loans to smaller companies, filling in some of the financing gap left by big banks that retreated from the business in the wake of the financial crisis. Hedge fund lenders often charge higher rates of interest than traditional lenders. We have recently added a senior member to the Avenue team to establish a direct lending business and expect to bring on additional professionals as this new business scales up, the memo said. Lasry is a well-known name in the hedge fund industry and a prominent supporter of President Obama. In June, he hosted a fundraiser for Obama at his Upper East Side home. He has remained a strong supporter of the administration, even after many in the $2 trillion hedge fund industry have thrown their support behind Republican challenger Gov. Mitt Romney. Recently Lasry said the debt crisis in Europe presents some very appealing investment opportunities, and the firm recently closed a second fund focused on making investments in the troubled euro zone region. The $2.8 billion fund was oversubscribed, the memo said. His hedge funds most recent 13-F regulatory filing revealed Avenue owns stock and warrants in General Motors (GM.N) and shares of CIT (CIT.N).

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-korea-politics-chaebol-idUSBRE8BP02Q20121226","South Korea president-elect urges chaebol think twice before layoffs","","December 26, 2012 /  8:45 AM / 5 years ago","","SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's president-elect asked the leaders of the country's big businesses, or chaebol, on Wednesday to think twice before cutting jobs, saying it was time for the conglomerates her father helped build four decades ago to look beyond profits. The election last week of Park Geun-hye, the 60-year-old daughter of former military ruler Park Chung-hee, was welcomed by the country's big businesses which dominate the world's 14th largest economy. The five biggest chaebol control assets worth more than half of gross domestic product. A week after her victory, Park said in a meeting with leaders of the top conglomerates that she would make sure fair business activities were encouraged and uncertainties were minimized. At the same time, I have a request that I must make to you, Park told the heads of such conglomerates as Hyundai Motor (005380.KS), Samsung SAGR.UL, SK and POSCO (005490.KS). It is my feeling that big conglomerates should try to change. I believe that the management goal of conglomerates should not remain maximizing profit but should involve pursuing coexistence with the larger community. I ask that as you try to overcome management difficulties, that you do not start with restructuring or layoffs but instead with sharing wisdom and pain, by trying as much as you can to save the jobs of our workers. Park's defeated left-wing challenger in the election had threatened to end the complex shareholding of subsidiaries that allows chaebol owners to control their sprawling business empires. Park did not say she would introduce any changes to make it easier for companies to lay off workers. South Korean employment law makes it nearly impossible for companies to dismiss salaried workers, which has led employers to use part-time, or contract, workers to ensure some degree of management flexibility in a notoriously rigid labor market. South Korea has the third highest rate of temporary workers among Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development member countries. Chung Mong-koo, chairman of Hyundai Motor Co., Chey Tae-won, chairman of the SK Group and Koo Bon-moo, chairman of the LG Group, were in attendance but not Lee Kun-hee, chairman of the Samsung Group, who was on a business trip abroad. Park's father, Park Chung-hee, was responsible for building up the chaebol during the 1960s and 1970s with a mix of threats and inducements for their bosses, the fathers and grandfathers of the current company heads. Analysts said the president-elect was not likely to use regulatory measures on conglomerates but she has pledged to share wealth more widely to try to ease social inequities. Park is to succeed incumbent Lee Myung-bak in February, who himself was the chief executive of a Hyundai company, who oversaw South Korea's pull out of the 2008 global economic downturn faster than its peers although he has been criticized for favoring export-oriented chaebol.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/layoffs-preparation-idUSL1E8MTDCZ20121207","YOUR MONEY: Layoff rumors? Gird yourself before the axe falls","","December 7, 2012 /  7:25 PM / 5 years ago","","NEW YORK, Dec 7 (Reuters) - Never mind coal. There may be pink slips in some holiday stockings this year. The end of the year can be a dangerous season for employees. As companies make last-minute attempts to adjust payrolls or to meet earnings goals, layoffs tend to pick up. Indeed, as many as 150,000 jobs could disappear in the fourth quarter, up 46 percent from the previous quarter, according to consulting firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc. Citigroup Inc employees know this all too well. The third-largest U.S. bank announced 11,000 job cuts worldwide, affecting 4 percent of its work force, Wednesday . It's easy to panic as rumors of layoffs fly at the office. Anger, fear and confusion can cloud final days that would be better spent preserving your professional reputation and contacting possible future employers. So, cancel the bridge-burning email and don't waste time stocking up on pens and paper clips from the supply cabinet. Instead, take these two steps immediately: Network like crazy, and start working on the most favorable exit package possible. That's what David Berman wishes he had done when he lost his senior financial adviser post at Morgan Stanley Smith Barney in mid-2011. I still believed that I had people fighting for me on the inside, says Berman, who is based in St. Petersburg, Florida. I was wrong. In hindsight, I was not aggressive enough. Among other things, Berman regrets not having used LinkedIn.com, the online networking site, to find connections and advice. And he's still looking for a full-time job. Here's how you can gird yourself for the best possible outcome if the axe falls. Be Prepared Knowing weeks ahead of a job loss can have its benefits. Use this time to prepare for your severance meeting with your boss or human resources specialist. It can bring months more of paid health insurance or a longer severance pay period. Go in with a list of questions, says Brooklyn, New York, executive coach Elaine Weinstein, who runs her own firm. Weinstein recommends these: -Is there a severance and how long does it last? -When does it begin? -Is it a lump sum and who pays taxes? -What are your health benefits? -Do they last as long as severance pay? -When they end, who will notify you about beginning Cobra? -What happens to your 401(k) retirement plan? Make the firm explain in its own words why you're being let go. You can use this terminology when you apply for a new job, if it is favorable. And, depending on your relationship with your employer and your company's rules, you may be able to walk out with a letter of recommendation, too. You will probably receive papers to sign. Don't sign them immediately, but ask how long you have to review them. Threatening to call a lawyer may not be prudent, but it doesn't hurt to suggest - obliquely - that you might consult one, says Weinstein. You can say something like, I'm very disappointed in this package. I have to think about this and think about my next actions, suggests Weinstein. Always ask for more: A longer severance, longer paid health insurance, or a paid career counseling service. Fight for it, says Weinstein. All they can do is say 'no.' Contacts, and Contact Details If you don't have a personal cell phone or computer, get one, and transfer your contacts to your new equipment, says Weinstein. Once you leave the company, it won't be possible to access those systems or documents again. Consider adding your personal email address to your email signature, as appropriate. Most companies will allow employees a health care coverage grace period, so you may not need to schedule all your doctors appointments immediately. Still, if it takes time to see a medical specialist, make those appointments now. Immediately activate your business network, Weinstein says. Reach out to professional and personal contacts, even if you have not spoken to them in years. Admit that you may have been sloppy about staying in touch, but say you would like to reestablish communication. Break the ice by offering to help them. Weinstein suggests a humorous approach, such as: 'Other than babysitting, let me know if I can help you in any way.' Seek Employment (While Employed) In September, New Jersey insurance consultant, Lori Sternthal, learned how valuable a network can be. When the senior business analyst learned that her contract would end within weeks, she reached out to recruiters, friends and business contacts, using LinkedIn.com, phone calls and emails - using her personal phone and computer and not those of her client's. A recruiter located a full-time staff position and Sternthal was at a new desk within nine weeks. Recruiters prefer to find someone who is currently employed, says Cobb. Otherwise they can't justify their fee, he says. That makes these precious few weeks remaining at your job vital for reaching recruiters. No matter how angry, upset or worried you might be, remain positive, says Sternthal. She suggests job seekers say something like, I had a great experience at the company, but I'm in transition and open to new opportunities. You could say you're open to both staff or contract work. You'll be surprised how many people will offer help when they learn you're about to lose your job, says Weinstein. It's survivor guilt. "

Hollande, 57, is on track to win the May 6 runoff against President Nicolas Sarkozy, due largely to the conservative leader's failure to keep his promise to cut stubbornly high unemployment in the euro zone's second largest economy. Sarkozy, who would become the first president to lose a re-election bid in more than 30 years, received a fresh blow on Thursday when the jobless rate hit its highest level since September 1999. Unemployment in France has not fallen below 7 percent in 30 years. Hollande said unions were already warning that companies were preparing a round of redundancies after the end of the presidential campaign, during which Sarkozy has done everything possible to avoid high-profile industrial closures. The unions are aware of this. Decisions are being prepared which have been postponed, Hollande told Le Parisien newspaper in an interview. It is not our victory which will trigger redundancy plans after May 6. The prospect of a Socialist winning control of France for the first time since Francois Mitterrand left office in 1995 has irked some investors. Hollande's promise to renegotiate a German-inspired budget discipline pact to redress European governments' finances had stirred fears of a return to the depths of the euro zone crisis. But Hollande warned business leaders he would not stand by as they turned workers onto the streets. We must tell these companies that we will not accept this without reacting, he told the newspaper. Debate Likely to Be Tough Large French companies seeking to cut their workforce are obliged by law to agree a plan with unions and the government, which often includes retraining or reallocation of some workers. If this plan is not approved by authorities, employees can contest their redundancies before a tribunal. Hollande has already announced plans to tax income over one  million euros at 75 percent and increase taxes on large corporations, particularly banks. He told the newspaper that he would press ahead with plans for a small one-off increase in France's minimum wage, one of the most generous in Europe. The size of the increase will have to be small given the economic situation, especially for many small businesses, said Hollande, who proposes indexing the minimum wage not just to inflation but also to economic growth. While Sarkozy blames France's declining competitiveness versus its main trade partner Germany on a steady rise in French wages since 2000, the Socialists say other factors are more decisive, such as technological innovation, the speed and flexibility of production processes and quality of goods. Sarkozy, whose brash personal style has alienated many conservative voters, became the first incumbent to finish second in a presidential first round vote last week, when Hollande beat him 28.6 percent to 27.2. National Front leader Marine Le Pen shocked France by finishing third with 18 percent, the far-right party's best showing at a national election. Hollande has blamed Sarkozy's fiery anti-immigrant rhetoric for fostering the growth of the far-right, which flourished in high unemployment areas. The Left's real responsibility is not convincing ordinary voters - workers, employees, rural people, even the young - that it was useful to vote for us, he told Le Parisien. It is to these voters who feel down trodden, who have suffered a lot in the crisis, that I must appeal as a candidate and as president. Hollande warned that Sarkozy would be free to impose even tougher austerity measures, meaning higher taxes on consumers, if he won the 6 vote because he would not be seeking reelection after a second term. With the tone of the campaign becoming increasingly bitter in recent days, as both Sarkozy and Hollande seek to appeal to far right voters, the Socialist said a head-to-head debate on Wednesday between the two men was likely to be tough. To judge by the tone and content of the campaign, the debate will be rough. I am ready, he said."

Mayor Dave Bing and top officials outlined plans to lay off 400 to 500 employees over the next two to three months in all non-revenue generating departments, including police and fire, exempting beat officers. He also reiterated plans to put more city workers on unpaid leave. I've got to make sure that this house that's on fire doesn't implode, Bing told reporters. Bing, however, cautioned that Detroit's financial recovery is likely to take more than eight years. Frustrated by the slow pace of reform and worried about the city's long-term viability, Michigan's Treasury Department said this week it will start a review process that could lead to an appointment of an emergency financial manager to oversee Detroit's finances. The city avoided such an appointment earlier this year by signing a consent agreement that gave the state some oversight. However, Bing and the nine-member city council have been at odds over some of the measures the mayor and state officials believe will lift Detroit out of its fiscal hole. Bing said he will urge council members to approve at a meeting on Tuesday several conditions tied to reforms that state officials want in order to release $30 million of bond proceeds for Detroit's near-empty coffers. One of those conditions is a contract with law firm Miller Canfield to deal with issues related to the consent agreement. The council rejected that contract last month, citing concerns over potential conflicts of interest by the law firm and the validity of the contract. Detroit, a city of 700,000, has been hard hit by a steep population drop, years of severe budget deficits and escalating employee costs, factors that led state officials to begin an intervention process a year ago. The appointment of an emergency manager to oversee the city's finances would bring Detroit a step closer to a possible municipal bankruptcy filing because a manager is a prerequisite for that move under a current state law. However, that law, which took the place of a stronger 2011 emergency manager law that Michigan voters repealed on November 6, also gives the state the opportunity to block the path to bankruptcy court. Bing reiterated on Friday that he did not think the city would benefit from an emergency manager or a bankruptcy. But he also said he understood it was a possibility. I'm a realist and I know that could in fact happen, Bing said. But I'm also a fighter, so I haven't given up. A new emergency manager bill that includes a bankruptcy option for local governments and that has the backing of Governor Rick Snyder's administration surfaced in the Republican-controlled Michigan House this week. The new legislation would keep intact any ongoing review process, existing consent agreement and appointed manager for Michigan local governments and school districts. However, it would give the elected officials of local governments determined to be in a fiscal emergency several options: a choice between municipal bankruptcy if the move is approved by the governor, an emergency manager, arbitration with a neutral party or a consent agreement.

Appointment of an emergency manager to oversee the city's finances would bring Detroit a step closer to a possible bankruptcy filing. The city's path to fiscal restructuring has been clouded by confusion over state emergency manager laws. Last month, Michigan voters overturned a 2011 law championed by Republican Governor Rick Snyder that gave emergency managers more power, including the ability to amend unionized labor contracts under certain conditions. Cities and districts in Michigan with emergency managers now operate under a 1990 state law, which stipulates that an emergency manager is a prerequisite for a municipal bankruptcy. This week, a proposed law surfaced in the Republican-controlled Michigan House that would give elected officials a range of options to deal with fiscal emergencies, including municipal bankruptcy if approved by the governor or appointment of an emergency manager. The bill has Snyder's backing."

Penney Co Inc (JCP.N) said it has recently laid off about 2,200 employees at 100 of its stores and district offices, the latest move by the struggling department store operator to contain costs as it contends with deep sales declines. Penney last week reported sales had fallen 25 percent in the first year of Chief Executive Ron Johnson's strategy of refashioning Penney stores into collections of branded boutiques and getting rid of hundreds of sales events and coupons. Johnson, who has started reversing that strategy, told a New York court last week that the retailer had laid off 19,000 workers up that point. The latest job cuts were concentrated in about 100 stores where sales fell the most, and the eliminations hit back office positions. A Penney spokeswoman said none of the cuts affected staff who deal with customers. We wanted to ensure that these reductions do not compromise the level of customer service provided in stores, spokeswoman Daphne Avila said in an email. The company is bringing back some sales events as it seeks to win back shoppers who balked at Penney's promotional strategy. Next week, the company will open boutiques for Joe Fresh, an up-and-coming trendy apparel brand from Canada that Johnson has said will help improve Penney's performance. Penney shares were up 2.3 percent to $14.77 at midday. The shares were trading at around $21 late last month before the retailer reported a fourth-quarter sales decline of more than 30 percent.

Italy's often divided union confederations united to call on Mario Monti's caretaker government to find around 1.5 billion euros to guarantee payments due to some 700,000 workers sent home on reduced pay under the cassa integrazione scheme. The scheme is paid for jointly by the state and companies and allows firms in crisis to stand down workers for a limited period on a reduced salary in the hope of better times. But it is struggling to meet those commitments due to the huge numbers of workers thrown onto the programme by an economy deep in recession. Some 520,000 have already been sent home this year and the fund for 2013 is almost empty. With Italy striving to reduce its 2 trillion euro public debt, that raises the risk that the workers will soon have no income at all, like most of the country's 3 million of officially unemployed. If we go on like this then crime will rise, said Salvatore Gazzolino, a worker from the poor, mafia-infested southern region of Calabria. If you have no money and no work what can you do? You can only go out and steal. The protesters carried union flags and banners attacking welfare minister Elsa Fornero, a frequent target of workers' anger following her unpopular reforms last year of the pension system and labour rules. Fornero said she would meet worker representatives later on Tuesday but gave no guarantees that all the money could be found, a position the unions say is unacceptable. The government has no more alibis, said Susanna Camusso, leader of the 6-million strong, left-wing CGIL union. If we don't get assurances then there will be more protests, we will continue to occupy the squares of this country. The union leaders told the demonstrators the money could be found by reducing military spending, cutting waste or hiking taxes on financial assets. Recession With Italy mired in its longest recession for 20 years and thousands of companies going to the wall every month, the cassa integrazione scheme has been inundated this year, according to CGIL data. At the same time, Italy has promised to keep its budget deficit below the European Union's limit of 3 percent of output and with an official target of 2.9 percent for this year has little room for manoeuvre. But the unions said there could be no compromise. This is not a dispute that can end in a tie, said union chief Luigi Angeletti of the UIL confederation. If the government does not find the money we will bring hundreds of thousands of workers onto the streets of Rome. Monti's outgoing cabinet is officially only empowered for ordinary administration, having remained in office after February's inconclusive election which left no party with enough votes to form a new government. Yet since the vote Monti has already hiked Italy's fiscal deficit and debt targets and passed a decree to begin settling billions of euros of unpaid bills owed by the state to private companies. New Chamber of Deputies Speaker Laura Boldrini said if Monti produced an emergency decree to top up the cassa integrazione, then parliament would be able to begin examining it immediately to turn it into law."

Hagel, speaking to aircraft maintenance workers at Naval Air Station Jacksonville, defended his decision to put civilian workers on unpaid leave for 11 days through the end of the fiscal year on September 30, saying further cuts in other areas could have jeopardized military readiness. Some 6,900 civilians at the base had their first day of unpaid leave last week, including 2,700 at the maintenance facility, officials said. That amounts to an effective 20 percent pay cut through the end of the fiscal year. The defense secretary, who is on a three-day listening tour to talk to personnel at bases across the southern United States, painted a sobering picture of the uncertainty hanging over the department as a result of automatic budget cuts known as sequestration. The cuts, ordered by the White House and the Congress, reduced Pentagon spending by $37 billion this fiscal year, prompting the unpaid leave and other cuts. They are likely to cut $52 billion from defense spending in fiscal 2014. Responding to questions from the workers, Hagel said an additional $52 billion in cuts in fiscal 2014 would inevitably require a reduction in the Defense Department's workforce. This is not a good way to do it, he said. You don't save any money at the front end when you RIF (reduction in force) people. In fact it costs you more money. It's just a dumb way to do things. Sequestration is an irresponsible deferral of policymaking. But we are where we are. Hagel said he and Army General Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, had decided to implement a 20 percent across-the-top cut in our offices. He said later the 20 percent cut would also affect the staffs of the combatant commanders and would be implemented in the 2015-2019 time frame. That isn't going to fix the problem, he said. But ... everyone's got to do their part. The secretary said cuts could eventually affect compensation packages, such as retirement benefits, healthcare and pay, which combined represent about half of the Defense Department's budget. That's not going to go untouched, he said. You don't get the money in the overhead of the office of the secretary of the Defense Department. You need billions and billions of dollars. Speaking later at a luncheon with members of the Jacksonville Chamber of Commerce, Hagel said he was not optimistic about Congress and the White House reaching an agreement to avert the next round of budget cuts. I don't see a lot of hopeful signs that this is going to be resolved, he said. Editing by Mohammad Zargham"

The ruling African National Congress (ANC) has made job creation a priority, but the rate has been stuck above 20 percent for more than a decade despite periods of strong economic growth, fuelling social unrest. Joblessness increased to 25.5 percent of the labor force, Statistics South Africa said on Thursday, putting 197,000 more workers on the streets during the quarter. The agency said 4.667 million people were registered as unemployed, the highest figure since current records began four years ago. It's amongst the highest unemployment rates globally and highlights quite strongly that we need to be taking some corrective action, said Colen Garrow, an economist at Johannesburg-based consultancy Meganomics. By sector, mining was the second biggest contributor to the losses, shedding 8,000 jobs in a quarter that witnessed the most serious labor-related violence since apartheid's end in 1994. In the worst incident, police shot dead 34 striking miners at platinum miner Lonmin's Marikana complex. Related CoverageSouth Africa mine unrest to lead to job losses: AmplatsA hefty wage settlement brought an end to the six-week walkout. But Lonmin, which employs 25,000 people, told unions this week an unspecified number of workers would be laid off as part of restructuring to get the firm out of a financial hole. That alone suggests the jobless rate is likely to rise further in the final three months of the year. It is expected that we will see more job losses in mining, said Kefiloe Masiteng, Stats SA's head of population and social statistics. Anglo American Platinum chief executive Chris Griffith said the industry was in severe financial distress and elevated wage settlements to get wild-cat strikers back to work would lead to job cuts. The world's top platinum producer has lost 141,640 ounces of platinum to date from a seven-week strike. This is completely the wrong time to be offering unsustainable wage increases that the moment people are back at work you just have to (lay off) a whole lot of people, Griffith told Talk Radio 702. There will be implications for jobs. Stuck in a Rut South Africa's jobless rate has been stuck between 21 and 29 percent since current records began in 2000, and it did not dip appreciably even when the economy was growing strongly in the years leading up to a 2008/09 recession. The ANC has unveiled a big infrastructure development plan in February that it says should create millions of jobs in Africa's biggest economy. But Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan has said the economy needs sustained growth of 7 percent a year - nearly three times the 2.5 percent forecast for 2012 - to make a dent in unemployment. South Africa's relatively rigid labor laws are part of the problem, making it difficult and costly for employers to fire workers, although the powerful unions have rejected any notion of reform, saying it would lead to exploitation. Youngsters -- defined as 15 to 34-year-olds -- accounted for 71 percent of all jobless people, compounding the fears of ANC leaders that they are sitting on a ticking time-bomb of youth unemployment that could ultimately trigger major social unrest. The expanded definition of unemployment, which includes people who have stopped looking for work, increased to 36.3 percent from 36.2 percent previously. Private households got rid of 29,000 workers during the quarter in a sector that mostly makes use of temporary workers. Additional reporting by Olivia Kumwenda; Editing by Ed Cropley/Jeremy Gaunt"

Officers surrounded the small factory in northern Greece where the gunman, a 61-year-old father of two, was holding the workers hostage. Police said his captives had not been harmed. Greeks are growing increasingly desperate as public sector spending cuts, designed to save the country from a debilitating debt crisis, exacerbate a recession now in its fifth year.

Frank Pace, president of the company's aircraft systems group, said the Pentagon's current plan to halve its purchases of Predator B drones to around 24 a year, coupled with continued restrictions on foreign sales, were putting pressure on the San Diego-based company, a unit of General Atomics. Unless additional orders come in, the company may have to lay off about 25 percent of its current production staff of about 1,400 people, Pace told Reuters at the Dubai Airshow. It's significant. We're still working off the fiscal 2012 buy, but eventually if we can't make some more overseas sales or sell to the Marines or something like that, we'll have to cut back staff, Pace said. Company officials said the U.S. Marine Corps is looking at buying Predator B drones in fiscal 2018, but funding is being cut across the military given $500 billion in mandatory budget reductions that took effect earlier this year and are due to continue for a decade. When the budgets are going down in the U.S., you would like to be able to export more, Pace told Reuters, adding that U.S. restrictions on foreign sales slowed the company's ability to respond to strong foreign demand which could offset the slump in U.S. military spending. Foreign sales of larger unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that can carry 500 kilograms or more of sensors and payloads are banned under the Missile Technology Control Regime, and require special waivers from the U.S. government, in addition to the already lengthy regular process for approving weapons sales. Pace said there was widespread frustration about the restrictions in the unmanned systems industry, but it was unclear if any changes in the statute were forthcoming. Some efforts are under way in the U.S. government, but the process has been moving very slowly. Wes Bush, the chief executive of Northrop Grumman Corp (NOC.N) has warned that failure to adjust the rules could result in a competitive advantage for manufacturers outside the United States. General Atomics' new larger Predator C drone - which can go three times as fast as the Predator B and carries 10 times as many sensors - would be subject to the restrictions, Pace said. It's one of those things where all of industry is frustrated with the government, so there's a chance that they might do something, he said when asked if the U.S. government was making any moves to loosen the current rules. Pace said unmanned plane sales had probably peaked in the United States, but there was still strong demand from Europe. General Atomics has built nearly 200 Predator B drones, and has sold the airplanes to Italy and France. Germany, the Netherlands, Canada and Australia have also expressed interest, but that may not translate into firm orders until 2015 or 2016, Pace said. In the Gulf region, General Atomics has sold five of the XP or export version of the unmanned plane to the United Arab Emirates, which is looking at additional purchases, Pace said. Other Gulf countries including Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and Oman had also expressed interest, he added. Editing by Mark Potter"

The Calgary-based oil and gas producer, whose share price has fallen about 56 percent over the last two years, said late on Tuesday that it had appointed former Marathon Chief Operating Officer David Roberts as president and chief executive officer, effective June 19. He replaces Murray Nunns, who will retire from the company on July 1. Penn West said it planned to focus on increasing efficiency, starting with a 10 percent workforce reduction over the next few weeks. The company had about 2,130 employees at the end of 2012. For the third quarter, the company is cutting its quarterly payout to 14 Canadian cents a share from 27 Canadian cents to increase its financial flexibility, it said. Shares of Penn West were unchanged at C$10.90 in early trading in Toronto. Penn West also said its board would form a special committee to explore such options as strategic financing alternatives, asset divestments, joint ventures and other business combinations. The changes come barely a month after the company named two respected industry leaders to its board - former Suncor Energy Inc head Rick George as chairman and former Canadian Natural Resources head Allan Markin as vice chairman. We believe the announced CEO change signals a step forward in the ongoing reorganization and restructuring of Penn West, said BMO Capital Markets analyst Gordon Tait in a research note. We are encouraged that the company appears to be making the difficult organizational and financial changes needed. Tait and other analysts said, however, that Penn West was not out of the woods and still needed to improve operational efficiency, shed assets and strengthen its balance sheet. The company's base operations are unsustainable today, said Barclays analyst Grant Hofer. This makes Penn West a unattractive as a takeover target and joint venture partner, he said. The company said its outlook on full-year production and capital spending remained unchanged. Penn West has many high-quality assets, but the company has yet to unlock their complete value, Chairman George said in a release. The company will maintain the second-quarter dividend at 27 Canadian cents a share and pay it to shareholders of record on June 28.

In a television interview, Hollande said a government rescue plan for the ailing car sector due to be announced on July 25 would include public incentives to encourage consumers to purchase French-made, environmentally friendly cars. He ruled out, however, a return to the scrappage subsidies introduced in the 2009 financial crisis by former conservative President Nicolas Sarkozy, which he said had cost the taxpayer dearly and had often been spent on foreign-made vehicles. However, he admitted he could not halt Peugeot's plant to stop production at the Aulnay assembly plant near Paris in 2014. Hollande, who won power in May with a promise to tackle high unemployment and halt France's steady industrial decline, acknowledged Peugeot had economic reasons for making the cuts. The company said last week its manufacturing arm is losing 200 million euros ($244.88 million) a month. However, the plan in its current condition is not acceptable. It must be renegotiated, Hollande said, adding he wanted to make sure voluntary redundancy packages or new jobs were found for all workers. We want to open discussions so  that there are no straight firings at Peugeot. Peugeot has so far said it will find jobs within the group for 1,500 of the workers concerned, with a further 3,600 workers offered voluntary redundancy until 2013. The Peugeot announcement came as Hollande faces scrutiny over billions of euros in tax rises to hit a deficit target this year - with the prospect of worse to come in 2013 - and struggles to fulfil a campaign pledge to bring down France's highest unemployment rate in 12 years. The shock announcement from Europe's second-largest carmaker last week revived memories of former Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin's failure to halt Renault's closure of its Vilvoorde plant in Belgium after winning power in 1997. Jospin's admission the state cannot do everything is credited with helping to sink his 2002 presidential bid. The state will not stand idly by, Hollande said, asked if his government would follow Jospin's route. Exerting Pressure Hollande said the government had means of exerting pressure and could provide credit to ensure Peugeot stuck to its commitment to see Aulnay remains an industrial site. He dismissed a call from Peugeot Chief Executive Philippe Varin for the state to cut the heavy social charges weighing on labour costs, which the executive said made manufacturing uncompetitive. It's too easy to blame labour costs. There were bad strategic choices, Hollande said. There were delays in taking difficult decisions and shareholders who were too hungry for dividends when investment should have been the priority. Hollande's government has said it will consider steps such as lowering social charges on labour as part of a competitiveness review headed by former EADS Chief Executive Louis Gallois due to be completed in October. That will come too late, however, to defuse the current crisis in the car sector. The president accused Peugeot of misleading public opinion by concealing its plans until after presidential and legislative elections in May and June. A company spokesman declined comment. There was both a lie - this plan was not announced although it was already on the agenda - and a deliberate delay until after the elections, Hollande said. Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault will announce incentives on July 25 for buying French vehicles as part of a package to support the sector, Hollande said. In France, we have an industry which has taken the lead in making clean vehicles and hybrid vehicles. We should make sure these type of vehicles have the advantage, he said.

We will create a plan which costs as little as possible to the taxpayer and is as effective as possible, said Hollande. "

Nokian was ahead of its Western rivals Michelin  and Continental to put a large factory in Russia, a prime market for its core business, high-margin winter tyres. But a drop in demand in amid the Ukraine crisis and a weakened rouble have hit the company hard since last year. The company on Friday said the Russian market had again proved weaker than expected. It said it now expects its 2015 operating profit to be in a range of 270-295 million euros ($295-$322 million), down from 309 million euros last year. It previously had forecast a slight fall in profit, with analysts in Reuters poll expecting full-year figure of 291 million euros. Chief Executive Ari Lehtoranta said sales in Russia fell 29 percent due to the devalued rouble and restrained consumer demand, but Nokian also lost market share as consumers switched to cheaper tyres. Tyre manufacturers have carried out price increases in the local currency, partly compensating for the rouble devaluation. Some tyre manufacturers chose to pursue a more aggressive pricing policy, buying market share, Lehtoranta said. Shares in the company were down 3.6 percent as of 0919 GMT. They had somewhat optimistic expectations for new car sales in Russia, so the downgrade in their profit forecast was not a huge surprise, said Nordea analyst Rauli Juva, who has a buy-rating on the stock. While the weak rouble hurts Nokian's sales, it also lowers costs at its Russian plant near St Petersburg, which has an annual capacity of 15 million tyres, 60 percent of them for export out of Russia. Due to the cost benefit, Nokian said it plans to slash output instead at its smaller plant in Finland. It looks to cut up to 150 of about 900 jobs there. Nokian's operating profit in the second quarter fell 11 percent from a year earlier to 80.6 million euros, missing a market forecast of 83.2 million.

Detroit Mayor Dave Bing outlined plans to lay off 400 to 500 employees over the next two to three months in all non-revenue generating departments, including police and fire. He also reiterated plans to put more city workers on unpaid leave. Bing said financial recovery for Detroit would be unlikely this decade, and he did not rule out the possibility of a state-appointed emergency financial manager or bankruptcy even as he emphasized that he would not support those measures. I'm a realist and I know that could in fact happen, Bing told reporters in downtown Detroit. But I'm also a fighter, so I haven't given up. Frustrated by the slow pace of reform and worried about the city's long-term viability, Michigan's Treasury Department said this week that it would start a review process that could lead to an appointment of an emergency financial manager to oversee Detroit's finances. Detroit avoided such an appointment earlier this year by signing a consent agreement that gave the state some oversight. However, Bing and the nine-member city council have been at odds over some of the measures the mayor and state officials believe will lift Detroit out of its fiscal hole. Bing said he would urge council members on Tuesday to approve several conditions tied to reforms that state officials want in order to release $30 million of bond proceeds for Detroit's near-empty coffers. One of those conditions is a contract with law firm Miller Canfield to deal with issues related to the consent agreement. The council rejected that contract last month, citing concerns over potential conflicts of interest by the firm and the validity of the contract. I've taken things to city council over time and they've not been able to respond as fast as I'd like them to so we can start an implementation plan, Bing said. What I'm frustrated with is we've not been able to change the trajectory. Detroit, a city of 700,000, has been hard hit by a steep population decline, years of severe budget deficits, and escalating employee costs, all of which led state officials to begin an intervention process a year ago. Appointment of an emergency manager to oversee the city's finances would bring Detroit a step closer to a possible bankruptcy filing. The city's path to fiscal restructuring has been clouded by confusion over state emergency manager laws. Last month, Michigan voters overturned a 2011 law championed by Republican Governor Rick Snyder that gave emergency managers more power, including the ability to amend unionized labor contracts under certain conditions. Cities and districts in Michigan with emergency managers now operate under a 1990 state law, which stipulates that an emergency manager is a prerequisite for a municipal bankruptcy. This week, a proposed law surfaced in the Republican-controlled Michigan House that would give elected officials a range of options to deal with fiscal emergencies, including municipal bankruptcy if approved by the governor or appointment of an emergency manager. The bill has Snyder's backing. Additional reporting and writing by Karen Pierog in Chicago; Editing by Dan Grebler"

Hagel, speaking to aircraft maintenance workers at Naval Air Station Jacksonville, defended his decision to put civilian workers on unpaid leave for 11 days through the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30, saying further cuts in other areas could have jeopardized military readiness. Some 6,900 civilians at the base had their first day of unpaid leave last week, including 2,700 at the maintenance facility, officials said. That amounts to an effective 20 percent pay cut through the end of the fiscal year. The defense secretary, who is on a three-day listening tour to talk to personnel at bases across the southern United States, painted a sobering picture of the uncertainty hanging over the department as a result of automatic budget cuts known as sequestration. The cuts, ordered by the White House and the Congress, reduced Pentagon spending by $37 billion this fiscal year, prompting the unpaid leave and other cuts. They are likely to cut $52 billion from defense spending in fiscal 2014. Responding to questions from the workers, Hagel said an additional $52 billion in cuts in fiscal 2014 would inevitably require a reduction in the Defense Department's workforce. This is not a good way to do it, he said. You don't save any money at the front end when you RIF (reduction in force) people. In fact it costs you more money. It's just a dumb way to do things. Sequestration is an irresponsible deferral of policymaking. But we are where we are. Hagel said he and Army General Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, had decided to implement a 20 percent across-the-top cut in our offices. He said later the 20 percent cut would also affect the staffs of the combatant commanders and would be implemented in the 2015-2019 time frame. That isn't going to fix the problem, he said. But ... everyone's got to do their part. The secretary said cuts could eventually affect compensation packages, such as retirement benefits, healthcare and pay, which combined represent about half of the Defense Department's budget. That's not going to go untouched, he said. You don't get the money in the overhead of the office of the secretary of the Defense Department. You need billions and billions of dollars. Speaking later at a luncheon with members of the Jacksonville Chamber of Commerce, Hagel said he was not optimistic about Congress and the White House reaching an agreement to avert the next round of budget cuts. I don't see a lot of hopeful signs that this is going to be resolved, he said."

As an Olympic sprinter, it is an occupational hazard she has learned to live with. But surgery has put a halt on her athletic ambitions, at least for now. The 28-year-old took a break after last year's London Olympics to repair a problem in her big toe that had plagued her for years. By her own standards, the American has had to take things slow. Her recovery from an operation, where surgeons shaved two bones on her troublesome big toe, took longer than expected. She only began training three weeks ago, on a special treadmill which reduces the body weight placed on her foot. Richards-Ross was not able to put her spikes on until this week but makes her competitive return at Saturday's Adidas Grand Prix, the New York leg of the Diamond League. The race has attracted a stellar field, featuring the last two Olympic champions and the last three world champions. Right into the fire, just the way I like it, Richards-Ross told a news conference in Manhattan on Thursday. I feel that in order for me to be ready for the world championships I just need to get back on the horse. I just want to see where I'm at so I may as well race the best and hopefully they'll pull me to a great time. For Richards-Ross, Saturday's race is a way for her to gauge her fitness. Her goals are still further down the track. Her first ambition is to make the U.S. team for this year's world championships and build towards the 2016 Rio Olympics. Richards-Ross already has four Olympic gold medals, tying the all-time record for any female in track and field. She was a member of the American relay team that won the 4x400 metres gold at Athens, Beijing and London, and also won the individual 400m title in London last year. I'm not too concerned about my condition here. I just want to get going and get ready for nationals in June and world championships in August. I'm having fun, I have my Olympic gold medals, so I will not get stressed out. While she may have been taking it easy on the track, Sanya has been living the rest of her life in the fast lane. She owns a hair salon in Texas and has been starring in a reality television show, called Glam & Gold, with her husband, a National Football League cornerback who won two Super Bowls with the New York Giants. With four Olympic gold medals already in her possession, she might have been tempted to call it quits after London but said her success has only reinforced her determination to continue. I definitely want to compete for four more years, she said. I'm going through to Rio then I'm going to start having babies. I wasn't sure if I wanted to go past 2008 and go to '12 but now I know for sure.   (Editing by Frank Pingue)"

Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack described the impact of the cuts, amounting to $2 billion, in a letter that warned these furloughs and other actions would severely disrupt our ability to provide a broad range of public services. USDA released a copy of the letter on Tuesday. Vilsack reiterated the prospect of a nationwide shutdown of meat and poultry plants during a furlough of (meat) inspection personnel for as much as 15 days of lost production, costing over $10 billion in production losses. Meat packers and processors cannot sell beef, pork, lamb and poultry meat without the USDA inspection seal. Inspection of meat for export or import also would stop during a furlough, said USDA. The industry has appealed to USDA to find ways to avoid a disruptive shutdown. Vilsack did not say how soon furloughs might occur. An aide said she had no additional information. Vilsack assured USDA employees in early February they would get at least 30 days' notice if they were being furloughed. Should sequestration occur, we would likely need to implement furloughs impacting about a third of our workforce, as well as other actions, Vilsack wrote in the letter to Democratic Senator Barbara Mikulski of Maryland, head of the Senate Appropriations Committee. USDA has roughly 100,000 employees, down by 4,000 in two years. Up to 600,000 low-income women and infants could be cut from the so-called WIC program that provides supplemental food and nutrition education if the budget cuts last for the rest of this fiscal year, according to the letter. Current enrollment is nearly 9 million pregnant women, new mothers and their children. Other cuts, Vilsack said, could include: -Closure of 670 of the Forest Service's 19,000 recreation sites, such as campgrounds, picnic areas and trailheads, in the national forests and shorter hours at visitor centers. This would largely occur during the peak use seasons in spring and summer, said USDA. The Forest Service would reduce its law enforcement force by 35 workers to 707 officers. -A work pause on the Census of Agriculture. Data will become incomplete and will not be statistically sound for publication, said USDA. The census, conducted every five years, provides valuable data on farm operation and output that is used in USDA's forecasts. USDA faced repeated funding shortages for its crop and livestock reports in the past couple of years. -A slowdown in USDA aid to landowners wanting expert advice or matching funds to control runoff from fields and feedlots and a reduction in USDA-backed loans to farmers to buy land or cover operating costs until harvest."
"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-italy-jobless-protest-idUSBRE93F0T920130416","Italy's temporary layoff scheme runs out of cash, sparks protests","","April 16, 2013 /  3:36 PM / 4 years ago","","ROME (Reuters) - Thousands of idled Italian workers staged a sit-in in front of parliament on Tuesday and trade unions threatened strikes unless the government steps in to back a temporary jobless scheme which is running out of funds. Italy's often divided union confederations united to call on Mario Monti's caretaker government to find around 1.5 billion euros to guarantee payments due to some 700,000 workers sent home on reduced pay under the cassa integrazione scheme. The scheme is paid for jointly by the state and companies and allows firms in crisis to stand down workers for a limited period on a reduced salary in the hope of better times. But it is struggling to meet those commitments due to the huge numbers of workers thrown onto the program by an economy deep in recession. Some 520,000 have already been sent home this year and the fund for 2013 is almost empty. With Italy striving to reduce its 2 trillion euro public debt, that raises the risk that the workers will soon have no income at all, like most of the country's 3 million of officially unemployed. If we go on like this then crime will rise, said Salvatore Gazzolino, a worker from the poor, mafia-infested southern region of Calabria. If you have no money and no work what can you do? You can only go out and steal. The protesters carried union flags and banners attacking welfare minister Elsa Fornero, a frequent target of workers' anger following her unpopular reforms last year of the pension system and labor rules. Fornero said she would meet worker representatives later on Tuesday but gave no guarantees that all the money could be found, a position the unions say is unacceptable. The government has no more alibis, said Susanna Camusso, leader of the 6-million strong, left-wing CGIL union. If we don't get assurances then there will be more protests, we will continue to occupy the squares of this country. The union leaders told the demonstrators the money could be found by reducing military spending, cutting waste or hiking taxes on financial assets. Recession With Italy mired in its longest recession for 20 years and thousands of companies going to the wall every month, the cassa integrazione scheme has been inundated this year, according to CGIL data. At the same time, Italy has promised to keep its budget deficit below the European Union's limit of 3 percent of output and with an official target of 2.9 percent for this year has little room for maneuver. But the unions said there could be no compromise. This is not a dispute that can end in a tie, said union chief Luigi Angeletti of the UIL confederation. If the government does not find the money we will bring hundreds of thousands of workers onto the streets of Rome. Monti's outgoing cabinet is officially only empowered for ordinary administration, having remained in office after February's inconclusive election which left no party with enough votes to form a new government. Yet since the vote Monti has already hiked Italy's fiscal deficit and debt targets and passed a decree to begin settling billions of euros of unpaid bills owed by the state to private companies. New Chamber of Deputies Speaker Laura Boldrini said if Monti produced an emergency decree to top up the cassa integrazione, then parliament would be able to begin examining it immediately to turn it into law.

With luxury homes costing HK$100 million ($15 million) or more, rental yields for high-end homes already yield less than 2 percent, a return set to dwindle further. Housing budgets have been cut, and companies are switching from corporate leases to personal leases, which will affect super luxury rents as well, Marcos Chan, the company's head of research for Hong Kong, told Reuters. Hong Kong has the most expensive office and retail property in the world. According to Knight Frank, only London's Knightsbridge neighborhood commands dearer rents than Hong Kong. It costs $25,000 per month to house a CEO and his family in a 3,000-square-foot home in the city's traditional luxury neighborhoods, the Peak and the south side of Hong Kong island, the rival brokerage reported last week. Housing the same family in a Knightsbridge costs $30,000 a month. Jones Lang Lasalle, issuing a mid-year report on the state of Hong Kong's property market, saw rentals at the luxury end falling 4.2 percent in the second half of 2012, after a 7.5 percent fall in the first half. Multinationals have been cutting back on expensive expatriate packages and increasingly prefer to hire employees on local terms. With the company no longer paying expensive rents directly to a landlord, employees often opt to keep some of their allowance and make do with a smaller home. The hard times in the financial sector is also seen reining in a runaway market. Hong Kong property prices have risen 9 percent in the first half of the year, to stand around 50 percent higher than they were at the start of 2009, with luxury homes showing the fastest gains. Buyers from mainland China, loaded with cash made during boom times there, have supercharged Hong Kong's property market. Brokers estimate that last year they made up one-quarter of the purchasers for new properties and luxury homes. With prices moving out of reach for many residents, the city's new leader, Leung Chun-ying, has pledged to increase supply and make housing more affordable. Despite fears that Hong Kong has formed a housing bubble, home prices remain supported by record-low interest rates and the large amounts of equity that home owners have built up, leaving them with strong holding power. Economic uncertainty has however hit demand, with transactions in the city down 25 percent in the first half of 2012 compared the same period the year before. You will see a dramatic stop in growth in luxury capital values, Joseph Tsang, Hong Kong managing director for Jones Lang LaSalle, said, with at most a 2 percent increase in values for the second half of the year.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-jobs-reentry-idUSL1E8MR9BP20121207","YOUR MONEY-Rebooting your career after a long layoff","","December 7, 2012 /  4:06 PM / in 5 years","","(The writer is a Reuters contributor. The opinions expressed are his own.) By Chris Taylor NEW YORK, Dec 7 (Reuters) - As any astronaut will tell you, re-entry is the trickiest and most dangerous part of space flight. The same might be said about returning jobseekers. Despite the challenges of increased competition and gap-filled resumes, more people who left the workforce, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, are coming back into it, according to the U.S. Labor Department. And they have not always found it easy to reboot careers that may have stalled in the last recession. In October, there were 3.3 million Americans who had re-entered the workforce, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Some of those people had been laid off and discouraged; others may have taken breaks to care for kids or elderly parents, or even retired and then thought better of it. Whatever their reasons, they may find the going tough. Just ask Dixie Morse. The Cambridge, Massachusetts, mother of two spent 17 years raising her sons and being the trailing spouse as her husband worked in financial services in London and Brussels. When her kids reached high school, she was able to land a job as a trainer at financial giant Sun Life - but not before 10 months of what she calls banging my head against the wall. I was surprised at how hard it was to come back, says Morse, 54. As soon as people saw my resume with a big hole in it, I got weeded out. To recruiters, all that time didn't seem to count as real. People re-entering the workforce, like Morse, have shown up in some recent jobs reports. In October, the U.S. unemployment rate ticked up 0.1 percentage points to 7.9 percent, even as employers added 171,000 jobs for the month, because the number of people joining or re-entering the workforce was growing faster than the jobs listings. In November, the jobless rate dropped to 7.7 percent as there were fewer people entering the labor force than the 146,000 jobs created, the Labor Department reported on Friday. In fact, in economic recoveries the unemployment rate usually rises a bit, because people are looking for work again, says Philippa Dunne of The Liscio Report, an economic research firm. People who were discouraged and had essentially dropped out of the labor force see their friends getting jobs and start trying again themselves. The number of discouraged workers - those who have given up looking for work because they do not think they can find a job and thus are not counted in the workforce -  has fallen, though not in a straight line, to 979,000 in November from roughly 1.2 million in 2010, the Labor Department said. When people do return to the workforce, they are finding plenty of competition, even from retirees. A survey by brokerage firm Charles Schwab & Co found that 9.5 million retired people were considering re-entering the labor force. That is what Hank Smith did. The 57-year-old from Wiggins, Colorado, retired in 2010 after 26 years as a postmaster, plotting what he wanted to do with the years ahead. The answer: He wanted to go back to work. Smith got certified as a nursing assistant, and after a year out of the workforce, is now a transportation coordinator who helps older people get to their doctor's appointments. I didn't want to just sit around for the rest of my life, he says. By choosing a profession that is in increasing demand, Smith was able to manage his re-entry successfully. Here are some other key strategies: - Rebuild your network. The biggest challenge is that you become professionally disconnected and lose track of your network, says Carol Fishman Cohen, founder of career re-entry firm iRelaunch. Re-establish casual contact through social media like Facebook or LinkedIn, and ask your former colleagues for informational meetings rather than pleading for a gig. - Refresh your skills with targeted coursework. Especially in fields like information technology or engineering, it is easy for your skills to become outdated within a few years. Even if you are not going back to school for a full-fledged degree, certifications in key areas - like cutting-edge programming languages, say - will let hiring managers know you can hit the ground running. - Volunteer at relevant organizations. You are helping the world, sure. But you are also assembling a portfolio of work that will help bridge lengthy time gaps on your resume. If you're looking to manage construction projects, do a weekend build for Habitat for Humanity, suggests Cohen. If you're a journalist, run a charity's online newsletter. - Get the resume right. A gaping hole is enough to give any hiring manager pause, so fill in that gap for him or her since you presumably were not just sitting on the couch the whole time. As any member of the Sandwich Generation will tell you, raising a child or caring for an infirm parent is perhaps one of the most challenging jobs in America, and those achievements should be celebrated instead of minimized. - Be open to short-term roles. Despite the economic recovery, companies are still reluctant to take on full-timers. Assuage their concerns by suggesting less binding arrangements, like special projects or contract work. That's a very effective strategy for those who feel they retired too early and want to get back in, says Cohen. Suggest it to employers who are hesitant because you've been out of the game, and it gives you an opportunity to show your value and produce a work sample.

Some 6,000 outdoor maintenance workers joined the walk-out at midnight after private companies, contracted by Madrid's city hall, proposed slashing salaries by up to 40 percent and laying off 1,144 people, a union representative said. We are fighting for our jobs. We've been working for years and they are going to kick us out with shameful severance pay. These are people who have worked 28, 30 years, said Angel Jornosa, 58, a gardener working for one of the contractors. Among the companies with garbage, street cleaning and park maintenance contracts in Madrid are units of infrastructure firms and builders including Ferrovial, Sacyr , OHL and FCC. A street cleaner in Madrid, a city of 3.2 million people, earns 1,000 to 1,200 euros a month, said Felix Carrion, a union representative at Spain's largest labour federation CCOO. Spain has made deep spending cuts throughout its public services sector in an effort to reduce one of the euro zone's highest public deficits, prompting mass demonstrations and strikes by students, health workers and public servants. Madrid has seen almost daily protests over the last few years as the conservative government digs deeper into public coffers to balance the books and show nervous investors it can control its finances. The cuts have done nothing to ease severe unemployment, which has risen to record levels of more than 26 percent. Almost a third of all those currently out of work in the 17-country euro zone live in Spain.   (Reporting by Paul Day and Catherine Macdonald; Editing by Fiona Ortiz and Kevin Liffey)"

With luxury homes costing HK$100 million ($15 million) or more, rental yields for high-end homes already yield less than 2 percent, a return set to dwindle further. Housing budgets have been cut, and companies are switching from corporate leases to personal leases, which will affect super luxury rents as well, Marcos Chan, the company's head of research for Hong Kong, told Reuters. Hong Kong has the most expensive office and retail property in the world. According to Knight Frank, only London's Knightsbridge neighborhood commands dearer rents than Hong Kong. It costs $25,000 per month to house a CEO and his family in a 3,000-square-foot home in the city's traditional luxury neighbourhoods, the Peak and the south side of Hong Kong island, the rival brokerage reported last week. Housing the same family in a Knightsbridge costs $30,000 a month. Jones Lang Lasalle, issuing a mid-year report on the state of Hong Kong's property market, saw rentals at the luxury end falling 4.2 percent in the second half of 2012, after a 7.5 percent fall in the first half. Multinationals have been cutting back on expensive expatriate packages and increasingly prefer to hire employees on local terms. With the company no longer paying expensive rents directly to a landlord, employees often opt to keep some of their allowance and make do with a smaller home. The hard times in the financial sector is also seen reining in a runaway market. Hong Kong property prices have risen 9 percent in the first half of the year, to stand around 50 percent higher than they were at the start of 2009, with luxury homes showing the fastest gains. Buyers from mainland China, loaded with cash made during boom times there, have supercharged Hong Kong's property market. Brokers estimate that last year they made up one-quarter of the purchasers for new properties and luxury homes. With prices moving out of reach for many residents, the city's new leader, Leung Chun-ying, has pledged to increase supply and make housing more affordable. Despite fears that Hong Kong has formed a housing bubble, home prices remain supported by record-low interest rates and the large amounts of equity that home owners have built up, leaving them with strong holding power. Economic uncertainty has however hit demand, with transactions in the city down 25 percent in the first half of 2012 compared the same period the year before. You will see a dramatic stop in growth in luxury capital values, Joseph Tsang, Hong Kong managing director for Jones Lang LaSalle, said, with at most a 2 percent increase in values for the second half of the year. People will wait and see. "

Nuerburgring hosts the German Grand Prix every second year, alternating with Hockenheim. It last staged the race in 2011, with Hockenheim the venue for this year's grand prix in July.

Steinkuehler said more talks were expected within the first quarter of 2012, adding that the commercial future of the Nuerburgring track was secure despite the loss of some 92 jobs and ongoing negotiations over what NAG says are the excessive leasing costs of the facilities. The operators have no problem and the season starting in April this year is fully guaranteed, said Steinkuehler. The cutbacks are necessary to meet the leasing costs.

Frank Pace, president of the company's aircraft systems group, said the Pentagon's current plan to halve its purchases of Predator B drones to around 24 a year, coupled with continued restrictions on foreign sales, were putting pressure on the San Diego-based company, a unit of General Atomics. Unless additional orders come in, the company may have to lay off about 25 percent of its current production staff of about 1,400 people, Pace told Reuters at the Dubai Airshow. It's significant. We're still working off the fiscal 2012 buy, but eventually if we can't make some more overseas sales or sell to the Marines or something like that, we'll have to cut back staff, Pace said. Company officials said the U.S. Marine Corps is looking at buying Predator B drones in fiscal 2018, but funding is being cut across the military given $500 billion in mandatory budget  reductions that took effect earlier this year and are due to continue for a decade. When the budgets are going down in the U.S., you would like to be able to export more, Pace told Reuters, adding that U.S. restrictions on foreign sales slowed the company's ability to respond to strong foreign demand which could offset the slump in U.S. military spending. Foreign sales of larger unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that can carry 500 kilograms or more of sensors and payloads are banned under the Missile Technology Control Regime, and require special waivers from the U.S. government, in addition to the already lengthy regular process for approving weapons sales. Pace said there was widespread frustration about the restrictions in the unmanned systems industry, but it was unclear if any changes in the statute were forthcoming. Some efforts are under way in the U.S. government, but the process has been moving very slowly. Wes Bush, the chief executive of Northrop Grumman Corp has warned that failure to adjust the rules could result in a competitive advantage for manufacturers outside the United States. General Atomics' new larger Predator C drone - which can go three times as fast as the Predator B and carries 10 times as many sensors - would be subject to the restrictions, Pace said. It's one of those things where all of industry is frustrated with the government, so there's a chance that they might do something, he said when asked if the U.S. government was making any moves to loosen the current rules. Pace said unmanned plane sales had probably peaked in the United States, but there was still strong demand from Europe. General Atomics has built nearly 200 Predator B drones, and has sold the airplanes to Italy and France. Germany, the Netherlands, Canada and Australia have also expressed interest, but that may not translate into firm orders until 2015 or 2016, Pace said. In the Gulf region, General Atomics has sold five of the XP or export version of the unmanned plane to the United Arab Emirates, which is looking at additional purchases, Pace said. Other Gulf countries including Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and Oman had also expressed interest, he added."

The company also plans to cut about 500 positions globally, or roughly 6 percent of its workforce, said a person familiar with the company. The move to reorganize the publisher's six-year-old structure comes as Time Inc integrates American Express Publishing, which it bought last year, and prepares to separate from Time Warner Inc this year. The magazine industry has been hit with declining circulation and advertising revenue as people choose to read on mobile devices. For the third quarter, revenue at Time Inc fell 2 percent to $844 million on weaker subscriptions and advertising sales. Time Warner plans to report its fourth-quarter results on Wednesday. The performance of print and individual brands will always be important, but Wall Street's focus will be on the performance of Time Inc and on our ability to grow beyond print, Ripp wrote. Ripp appointed Evelyn Webster and Todd Larsen to oversee the operations of about 100 titles. Both will report directly to Ripp. Larsen is the former president of Dow Jones and The Wall Street Journal. Webster served as CEO of Time Inc's British publishing unit IPC.

Multiple commercial orders were being delayed by recent failures of launch vehicles and uncertainties about the future availability of financing from the U.S. Export-Import Bank, whose government charter lapsed on June 30, the company told key managers in an internal communication. Boeing spokesman Tim Neale confirmed the reductions and said the total number of people affected would be finalized in coming months. Some could find work in other parts of Boeing, he said. He said the reductions were necessary to remain competitive for ongoing and future business. The Boeing announcement marks the latest fallout from the ongoing debate about the future of EXIM, the U.S. government's export credit agency, which can no longer write new loans and trade guarantees. U.S. government officials have said they are growing more concerned about the impact of the bank's forced shutdown on a wide range of U.S. companies, including many small businesses.  Tea Party conservatives in the U.S. Congress did not vote to renew the agency's charter, arguing the trade bank provides corporate welfare for big companies like Boeing and General Electric Co (GE.N). Business executives said it was unclear if the bank will be reopened. EXIM backers say the bank generates revenue for the U.S. government, and helps level the playing field for U.S. companies whose rivals in other countries receive similar trade credits. Boeing does not break down workforce numbers for separate business units, but the company has about 16,800 workers in California, where Boeing builds satellites and does some commercial airplane work. Monday's announcement comes a little over a month after commercial satellite provider ABS canceled a large satellite contract with Boeing due to uncertainty about the future of the EXIM bank. Neale said Boeing officials were still working with ABS, based in Bermuda and Hong Kong, to find an alternate financing solution, but ABS was in active discussions with other satellite makers that had access to government trade credits. He said many of Boeing's international customers relied on EXIM financing to buy commercial satellites and airplanes, and uncertainty about EXIM's future was making those buyers very nervous. In the absence of Ex-Im, Boeing may need to serve as the lender of last resort but there are real limits to how much of this the company can do, he said.

As of today, the staffing issues remain and, in some divisions, also the issues of labour costs, the company said in a statement, confirming what trade union sources had said. Telecom Italia has 66,000 employees, of which 53,000 are in Italy, where its business has long been struggling. The group has delayed investments in an effort to cut its 27-billion euro ($30 billion) debt, exacerbating the impact of Italy's three-year economic recession on its domestic operations. Telecom Italia met trade union representatives on Thursday at the industry ministry as the government tries to broker an agreement. A new meeting is scheduled on July 29. But the job cuts and a decision to move employees in charge of customer services to the newly created Telecom Caring unit have angered unions. As long as the plan to turn the customer services division into a (separate) company remains on the table, the SLC CGIL (union) will not start a negotiation, Massimo Cestaro, secretary general of the left-wing union, said in a statement. The Uilcom union also opposes the plan, which affects around 9,000 people working at Telecom Italia's call centres, Secretary General Salvo Ugliarolo said.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/detroit-mayor-idUSL1E8N7CNX20121207","Detroit eyes layoffs, other actions to avoid state control","","December 7, 2012 /  10:15 PM / in 5 years","","DETROIT, Dec 7 (Reuters) - Under pressure by Michigan officials to turn around Detroit's sagging finances, city officials said on Friday they will lay off hundreds of workers in addition to putting some on unpaid leave to stave off increased state oversight. Mayor Dave Bing and top officials outlined plans to lay off 400 to 500 employees over the next two to three months in all non-revenue generating departments, including police and fire, exempting beat officers. He also reiterated plans to put more city workers on unpaid leave. I've got to make sure that this house that's on fire doesn't implode, Bing told reporters. Bing, however, cautioned that Detroit's financial recovery is likely to take more than eight years. Frustrated by the slow pace of reform and worried about the city's long-term viability, Michigan's Treasury Department said this week it will start a review process that could lead to an appointment of an emergency financial manager to oversee Detroit's finances. The city avoided such an appointment earlier this year by signing a consent agreement that gave the state some oversight. However, Bing and the nine-member city council have been at odds over some of the measures the mayor and state officials believe will lift Detroit out of its fiscal hole. Bing said he will urge council members to approve at a meeting on Tuesday several conditions tied to reforms that state officials want in order to release $30 million of bond proceeds for Detroit's near-empty coffers. One of those conditions is a contract with law firm Miller Canfield to deal with issues related to the consent agreement. The council rejected that contract last month, citing concerns over potential conflicts of interest by the law firm and the validity of the contract. Detroit, a city of 700,000, has been hard hit by a steep population drop, years of severe budget deficits and escalating employee costs, factors that led state officials to begin an intervention process a year ago. The appointment of an emergency manager to oversee the city's finances would bring Detroit a step closer to a possible municipal bankruptcy filing because a manager is a prerequisite for that move under a current state law. However, that law, which took the place of a stronger 2011 emergency manager law that Michigan voters repealed on Nov. 6, also gives the state the opportunity to block the path to bankruptcy court. Bing reiterated on Friday that he did not think the city would benefit from an emergency manager or a bankruptcy. But he also said he understood it was a possibility. I'm a realist and I know that could in fact happen, Bing said. But I'm also a fighter, so I haven't given up. A new emergency manager bill that includes a bankruptcy option for local governments and that has the backing of Governor Rick Snyder's administration surfaced in the Republican-controlled Michigan House this week. The new legislation would keep intact any ongoing review process, existing consent agreement and appointed manager for Michigan local governments and school districts. However, it would give the elected officials of local governments determined to be in a fiscal emergency several options: a choice between municipal bankruptcy if the move is approved by the governor, an emergency manager, arbitration with a neutral party or a consent agreement."

Greek labor unions have gone on strike repeatedly since early 2010, when the country was plunged into a debt crisis and sought a bailout from the European Union and International Monetary Fund to avert bankruptcy. The latest action, at the height of the tourist season, is against Athens's plans to shrink its spendthrift civil service, widely blamed for the crisis, by firing thousands of workers. The union representing the workers, OSYPA, plans to stage 24-hour rolling strikes on August 9-11. Greece relies heavily on tourism to help pull it out of a deep recession but the strike will mostly affect smaller airports. Traffic at major Greek airports is not expected to be disrupted because air traffic controllers are not participating. Plans to fire the workers were illegal, unconstitutional and beyond reason, OSYPA said. In the past, Greek courts have ruled strikes affecting tourism illegal, forcing workers to call them off.

TF1 also said it had filed an appeal to the country's highest administrative court to overturn the ruling made by the CSA broadcast regulator. LCI, which launched 20 years ago as France's first 24-hour news channel, is trailing behind its free-to-air rivals iTele, owned by Canal+, and BFM TV from NextRadioTV. TF1 had hoped for permission to stop charging for the channel so as to attract more viewers and advertisers. TF1 considers that the future of LCI in its current format can only be envisaged on free television and that it has strong grounds for an appeal, said the company in a statement on Tuesday. But TF1 has so far stopped short of shutting the channel completely, something CEO Nonce Paolini has warned was a possibility. Instead it presented a plan to LCI unions that would shift LCI from a 24-hour news channel to a paid online portal, stocked with video clips and programming. This marks the end of LCI as a real-time news channel to be replaced by a product that for the moment has no certain distribution, Emmanuel Raoul, a union representative at the channel, said. According to the unions, Paolini also said LCI was not for sale. The owners of French daily Le Monde had earlier expressed interest in buying the channel or some of its assets. In a statement on Tuesday, the owners - industrialist Pierre Berge, telecoms billionaire Xavier Niel and investment banker Matthieu Pigasse - said they remained interested in buying LCI and regretted no discussions had taken place with TF1. The proposal we made to TF1 called for us to keep onboard all the journalists at LCI, the trio said.

The warnings come as military contractors weigh uncertainties over scheduled maintenance and repair work that may be put on hold as the federal government makes $85 billion in spending cuts. The U.S. Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) requires most companies with 100 or more employees to give notification 60 days in advance of mass layoffs or plant closings. Military contractors appear to be the hardest hit by the cuts because a large part the reductions are expected to come from Defense Department spending. Based in San Diego, NASSCO is a wholly-owned subsidiary of General Dynamics and the largest full-service shipyard on the West Coast. It has built 63 ships for the U.S. Navy since the 1960s.

The Caixin/Markit China Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 48.0 in February, below market expectations of 48.3 and January's reading of 48.4, according to the business survey released on Tuesday.  The employment sub-component of the index fell to 46.0, down from January's 47.0 and the lowest level since January 2009, when China and other trade-reliant economies were reeling from a near-collapse in global trade following the financial crisis. Both readings were below the 50-point neutral level, which separates contraction from expansion on a monthly basis. The headline index was in negative territory for the 12th month in a row. Firms that reported lower headcount cited company downsizing and cost-cutting, and said more workers who were leaving voluntarily were not being replaced. Sluggish demand at home and abroad and years of overexpansion fueled by debt have weighed on China's manufacturers, leaving many with large amounts of idle capacity and helping to drag China's broader economic growth to 25-year lows.     New orders slipped to 48.3 in February, down from January's 48.5 and the eighth straight month of contraction. Export orders fell for the third month running, though at a slightly more moderate rate. China said on Monday it expects to lay off 1.8 million workers in the coal and steel sectors as part of efforts to reduce industrial overcapacity, but no timeframe was given. To be sure, although the survey compilers adjust their figures for seasonal effects, the shifting dates of the long Lunar New Year holiday sometimes make Chinese data in January and February difficult to interpret. Chinese economic activity slows dramatically around the week-long holiday, which falls on a different date in late winter every year.  The Caixin survey focuses more on small and medium-sized private firms, in contrast to the official manufacturing gauge, which focuses more on larger state-owned firms. Analysts have been watching closely for signs that the sharp slowdown in China's industrial sector is filtering into employment and wage growth.

Some investors had been bracing for weak readings after the central bank unexpectedly eased policy late on Monday, injecting an estimated $100 billion worth of cash into the banking system to cushion the pain of upcoming reforms such as restructuring bloated state enterprises. The official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 49.0 in February from January's reading of 49.4 and below the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction. Economists polled by Reuters had expected only a slight dip to 49.3. It was the lowest reading since November 2011. The PMI came in much weaker than markets expected, hinting that recent easing measures have had limited impact in turning around the weakening manufacturing sector, wrote senior emerging markets economist Zhou Hao at Commerzbank in Singapore. We think PBoC will cut policy rates by 25 basis points in the first quarter and lower RRR (banks' reserve requirement ratio) by another 100-150 basis points this year.  The private Caixin/Markit China Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), which focuses more on small to medium- sized, private firms, showed activity contracted for a 12th straight month. It fell to 48.0, below market expectations of 48.3 and January's reading of 48.4. Both surveys showed conditions in China's job market were continuing to deteriorate, challenging policymakers who are finalising Beijing's next five-year development plan ahead of the annual parliament meeting starting on March 5. The Caixin report showed companies shed jobs at the fastest pace since January 2009, when China and other trade-reliant economies were reeling from a near-collapse in global trade following the financial crisis.

The employment sub-component of the index fell to 46.0 from January's 47.0. The official PMI survey, which tends to focus on larger, state firms, has shown persistent declines in employment for the last 3-1/2 years.     To be sure, although Markit adjusts figures for seasonal effects, the timing of the long Lunar New Year holiday can make Chinese data in January and February difficult to interpret. Economic activity slows dramatically around the holiday, which falls on a different date in late winter every year. Still, the findings in the latest surveys have dashed hopes that a year-long blitz of stimulus measures would start to produce signs of economic stabilization early in 2016.     China's factory sector has been under pressure from weak demand at home and abroad and massive overcapacity in key industries such as steel and coal, diluting the impact of six central bank interest rate cuts and a spate of other support measures since November 2014. Industrial profits fell 2.3 percent in 2015 after rising 3.3 percent in 2014. Both surveys on Tuesday showed further contractions in domestic and export orders, suggesting industrial output will remain sluggish in coming months.     In addition, some manufacturers in capital-intensive sectors are struggling with heavy debt loads, which are becoming increasingly difficult to repay as they have to constantly cut  prices to win sales. Last year witnessed a rash of bond defaults by steel, cement and chemical firms. Chinese factory gate prices fell for the 47th straight month in January. The government has made cutting overcapacity in steel and other old economy sectors a priority this year, though previous efforts have run into strong resistance locally as big  firms are often a key source of tax revenue and employment. China said on Monday it expects to lay off 1.8 million workers in the coal and steel industries, or about 15 percent of the workforce, but no timeframe was given. Recent tax changes have also raised concerns that China hopes to export more of its excess industrial capacity abroad, further worsening global gluts of chemical and steel products and effectively exporting deflation abroad. China's economic growth cooled to 6.9 percent in 2015, the slowest pace in 25 years, and economists see it slowing further to around 6.5 percent this year. Some market watchers believe it is already much weaker than official data suggests. Services Softening? A growth slowdown in China's services sector last month was also singled out by analysts as a cause for concern. The official non-manufacturing PMI fell from 53.5 in January to 52.7 in February, still in expansion territory but the weakest reading since late 2008. The services sector has been taking up an increasing amount of economic slack as manufacturing cools, but analysts have wondered how long it can remain resilient in the face of the prolonged factory slump and increasing unemployment. With manufacturing in both a cyclical and structural funk, Beijing has been keen to grow the services sector and make consumption a stronger driver of the economy.  Today’s data suggest that policy makers will take further measures in the upcoming National People’s Congress in order to achieve a GDP growth target of 6.5 to 7 percent in 2016, ANZ economists said in a note. A proactive fiscal policy will be needed to support investments and we expect the fiscal deficit could be increased to a range of 3-4 percent in 2016, from 2.3 percent in 2015 in order to boost government spending.

The Labor Department advisory said the circumstances surrounding the planned cuts were too uncertain to require defense and other federal contractors to comply with provisions of a law requiring employees to be notified 60 days before major layoffs or plant closures. Under current law, the U.S. Defense Department is facing across-the-board budget cuts beginning Jan. 2 aimed at cutting $500 billion in projected national security spending over the next decade. Under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining and Notification ACT, companies have to send out notices 60 days ahead of time advising their employees of impending mass layoffs or plant closures. If notices were sent out ahead of the impending budget cuts, the workers would be receiving them just before the Nov. 6 presidential election. Apart from the January reductions, the Pentagon is working to trim spending by $487 billion as ordered by the Budget Control Act last year. Lawmakers from both parties say they oppose the across-the-board cuts that will hit in January under a process known as sequestration, but they have not been able to agree on alternative ways to reduce spending. Representative Gerry Connolly, a Democrat from Virginia, said on Monday Congress should cancel its annual August recess to focus instead on stopping the $500 billion in automatic spending cuts. Congress has only 11 more legislative days, he said, to broker a deal halting the cuts before the November election. If the two parties are unable to agree on a deal before the end of the term, the issue may be taken up in a post-election lame-duck session of Congress. We got to stay in session and solve this problem, Connolly told reporters after speaking at a rally to protest sequestration. It is not rocket science. Call for Compromise The rally, held by Northrop Grumman Corp, brought together defense industry leaders and members of the Virginia Congressional delegation, as well as Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell, who urged Congress and the White House to find a solution to stop the expansive budget cuts, citing the more than 200,000 Virginia jobs at risk if a deal is not reached. More than 2.14 million jobs nationally could be lost because of sequestration, a George Mason University analysis for the Aerospace Industries Association said. McDonnell, a Republican, called for a compromise between Republicans and Democrats in Congress, saying a practical solution that includes cuts and revenue increases must be agreed on. We know we got to get our fiscal house in order, but it's got to be in a way that is systematic, that is practical, that looks out for the American war fighter and the men and women of the private sector that support them, McDonnell said. That's not the way this was done. The Labor Department decision drew swift condemnation from Republican Representative Buck McKeon, head of the Armed Services committee, who called it politically motivated. McKeon said instead of trying to find a way to avert the cuts, the president is focused on preventing advance notice to American workers that their jobs are at risk and on perpetuating uncertainty. People will still get laid off because of the president's irresponsibility, but they won't have the notice to protect themselves and their families, McKeon said. The president is doing nothing to look out for the American worker and is using our troops as leverage to push his failed political agenda. The Labor Department said that the law did not apply in the current circumstances because while sequestration may occur, efforts are being made to avoid it. So even the occurrence of sequestration is not necessarily foreseeable, the guidance said. It said relevant case law would not require employers to provide notices under the current conditions."

Sprint has been reshuffling executives and laying off workers as it struggles to reverse a subscriber exodus brought about by a messy network overhaul that has caused gaps in coverage. In March, the company cut 330 jobs and closed 55 stores around the country, as part of an ongoing plan to shrink its workforce in 2014. The new round of layoffs, expected to end by October, will cost the company $160 million in the second fiscal quarter for severance and related costs and will include cuts to management and non-management positions. Sprint warned in the filing that additional charges associated with future job cuts may be coming, but provided no further details. In August, the company appointed Bolivian entrepreneur Marcelo Claure as its new chief executive after dropping a long-sought bid for rival T-Mobile US due to regulatory resistance. Claure has pledged to turn around the struggling company by slashing prices and cutting costs. The company, which is 80 percent owned by Japan's SoftBank Corp, has since launched some of the industry's most aggressive promotions, but is facing intense competition from its rivals. No.4 carrier T-Mobile has vowed to overtake Sprint as the third-largest carrier by the end of the year and Verizon  and AT&T; have launched fierce promotions of their own.

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits slipped 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 307,000 for the week ended Jan. 17, the Labor Department said on Thursday. That reversed the bulk of the prior week's increase which had pushed claims to their highest level since early June, but fell short of economists expectations for a 300,000 reading. Economists had dismissed the prior week's increase as noise given that claims data is difficult to adjust for seasonal variations around the holidays. Some, however, wondered if some of the elevation in claims reflected layoffs in the oil industry in the wake of plunging crude prices. It is unclear at this point whether or not this move up in the trend reflects issues seasonally adjusting the data around the holidays or if it represents a more meaningful deterioration in the labor market, said Daniel Silver, an economist at JP Morgan in New York. State-level data for the week ending Jan. 10 showed an increase in claims in the oil-producing states like Texas, Louisiana and North Dakota. But claims also rose in states such Missouri, Indiana and Illinois, which are not oil-dependent. Oilfield service provider Baker Hughes Inc this week announced it would cut 7,000 jobs, with most of the redundancies expected in the first quarter, because of slowing drilling activity. Schlumberger NV has announced 9,000 job cuts. Crude oil prices  have plunged almost 60 percent since June, hitting five-year lows as increased shale production in the United States and weak global demand has caused a glut on the market. The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, increased 6,500 last week to 306,500, taking it above the 300,000 mark for the first time since September. The claims data covered the week during which the government surveyed employers for January's nonfarm payrolls. Despite the gyrations in claims and the four-week average rising 7,750 between the December and January payroll survey periods, there is little doubt that the labor market is tightening. Employment gains have exceeded 200,000 in each of the last 11 months, the longest stretch since 1994, and job openings are  near 14-year highs. In addition, the ratio of unemployed people for every job opening is the lowest since early 2008. The claims report showed the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid increased 15,000 to 2.44 million in the week ended Jan. 10.

Thursday's reports support views of faster growth this year, driven by consumer spending, despite a faltering global economy. Labor market conditions continue to improve, providing support for consumers and contributing to a virtuous cycle for the economy, said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors in Kalamazoo, Michigan. Initial claims for state unemployment benefits slipped by 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 294,000 for the week ended Jan. 3, the Labor Department said. While that was a bit less than Wall Street's expectations of a drop to 290,000, the trend in claims remained consistent with a steadily tightening labor market. At current levels, claims probably have little room to fall further. Claims have never dropped below the 280,000-290,000 range in the last 20 years, reflecting the reality that a certain number of layoffs is a natural part of the growth/lifecycle of companies even in the best of times, said Anthony Karydakis,  chief economic strategist at Millar Tabak in New York. The four-week moving average of claims, a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, held below the key 300,000 mark for the 17th straight week. The data helped U.S. stocks rally for a second straight day, while U.S. government debt prices fell. The dollar climbed to a nine-year high against the euro on views the European Central Bank could soon embark on a monetary stimulus program to fend off a recession in the euro zone. Fewer Layoffs The strengthening job market backdrop could bring the Federal Reserve a step closer to raising its short-term interest rate, which it has kept near zero since December 2008. In a separate report, global outplacement consultancy Challenger, Gray & Christmas said the number of job cuts announced by U.S. employers fell 9.2 percent in December. For the whole of 2014, employers announced a total of  483,171 job cuts. That was 5 percent fewer than in 2013 and the smallest number since 1997. This bodes well for job seekers who will not only find more employment opportunities in 2015, but will enjoy increased job security once they are in those new positions, said John A. Challenger, chief executive officer of Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Reports on Wednesday showed a jump in small business hiring and another month of solid gains in private payrolls. The government is expected to report on Friday that nonfarm payrolls rose by 240,000 in December after surging by 321,000 in November. That would mark the 11th consecutive month of job gains above 200,000, the longest stretch since 1994. Overall employment gains in 2014 are expected to be the largest since 1999. The unemployment rate is forecast slipping one-tenth of a percentage point to 5.7 percent in December, which would be the lowest level since June 2008.

Euro zone finance ministers were due to decide on Monday how to keep Greece afloat and had threatened to delay the latest 8.1-billion-euro ($10.42-billion) payment to Athens to put more pressure on it to enact unpopular reforms. More than 6,000 local administration workers, among them guards and uniformed municipal police on motorbikes, marched to the Administrative Reform Ministry in central Athens, waving black flags, honking horns and sounding sirens. Take your memorandum and get out of here! the workers chanted, in the first protest since the lenders completed their latest review of Greece's cost cutting efforts on Sunday, a sign of the resistance the government may face. Hundreds more rallied outside the Interior Ministry later on Monday, where the administrative and interior ministers were meeting with local government representatives, chanting Thieves and Traitors. The head of the POE-OTA union, Themis Balasopoulos, broke the news to workers that school guards would be placed in a mobility scheme by the end of summer - meaning they will be transferred or fired within a year - prompting some workers to break into tears. It's not fair, said Georgia Martaki, a state school guard. I pay my rent, my electricity and phone bills only because I have this job. It's not fair to fire a 50-year-old woman like me, to throw me in the rubbish. The largest public sector union, ADEDY, also staged a work stoppage in Athens. Municipal workers planned another 24-hour nationwide strike on Tuesday. Greece has struggled to convince the troika of lenders from the European Union, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund that it can deliver on its pledges and shrink its spendthrift public sector, widely blamed by many Greeks for the debt crisis. Public sector layoffs are a taboo in Greece, where a sixth year of recession has made one in four people in the workforce jobless and eroded living standards. With tempers boiling over the plans to put municipal workers in the mobility pool, five workers attacked Athens Mayor George Kaminis on Sunday, pushing him and throwing punches, police said. TV footage showed Kaminis running away from a group of protesters who pelted him with a water bottle before being driven away on a motorbike by one of his security guards. After missing a June deadline, Athens agreed to put 12,500 state workers into a the mobility pool by September. Around 3,500 of those will be municipal workers, government officials have said. A second wave of 12,500 staff will be placed in the scheme by the end of the year while the government has also promised to fire 4,000 state workers this year. "

Ten former employees claim they were selected when the company cut 360 positions last summer because they or covered family members had costly disabilities or medical conditions. Spirit's health care administrators shared information with high-level managers so that Spirit - in its role as employer - could identify the employees associated with the most expensive medical claims and target them for termination, according to one of the charges filed on Wednesday and reviewed by Reuters. The charges, filed with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the Office of Civil Rights, request class status and also allege age discrimination, disability discrimination and violations of privacy rights, said Diane King, a lawyer with King and Greisen, a Denver law firm that assisted the employees. Ken Evans, a spokesman for Spirit, said the allegations are filled with distortions and misstatements. Personal health information is certainly not used to make layoff decisions. All of the charges relate to the July 2013 layoffs, when Spirit cut the positions at its facilities in Wichita, Kansas, including 221 members of the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace (SPEEA), a Seattle-based union that also represents workers at Boeing. Evans said SPEEA had made unfounded allegations before, including several charges filed with the National Labor Relations Board last year related to the job cuts that were either withdrawn or dismissed by the board. While terminations are always difficult, all such decisions are based on job-related, non-discriminatory criteria, and Spirit has made every effort to carry them out with respect for our employees, Evans said in a statement. The job cuts were necessary in a competitive, cost-sensitive industry, Evans said, and Spirit provided the laid-off employees with severance and help finding new jobs. Pressure to Cut Costs King said circumstantial evidence supports the employees belief that top Spirit managers misused individual employees' health care information, but she declined to provide details. She did not immediately provide any statistical analysis showing that a higher proportion of those with expensive medical costs were among those laid off. Spirit has been under pressure to cut costs and since 2012 has set aside more than $2.2 billion in provisions for future losses on unprofitable contracts. The company was formed in 2005 when Boeing Co spun off some of its facilities. It makes parts for all major Boeing jets, including about 40 fuselages a month for Boeing's top-selling 737 jetliner. Spirit also makes parts for Airbus, Bombardier Inc , Gulfstream, a unit of General Dynamics Corp  and Mitsubishi Aircraft Corp, owned by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Toyota Motor Corp. The losses at Spirit prompted it to undertake a strategic review last year and consider sale of facilities in Oklahoma. If the employee charges are substantiated, penalties could include back pay, out-of-pocket health care costs, job reinstatement or forward pay through retirement in lieu of employment, plus attorneys fees, according to lawyers with knowledge of these kinds of claims. The case raises questions about possible misuse of health information gathered by companies through self insurance or wellness programs. In interviews, two former Spirit employees said they were singled out by upper management and that their own supervisors didn't know their performance ratings were being cut until just before it happened. They tried to make it look like it was performance issues, said Debra, 54, a former quality analyst, whose husband is in need of two organ transplants. She and other employees and family members who spoke with Reuters declined to have their full names used out of concern for the privacy of their medical and employment information. She said she received a B retention rating on Spirit's A-C rating scale during a previous review. On July 1, her rating was lowered to a C, and she was told she was not eligible for recall rights if she was laid off. Her direct supervisor wanted to give her an A, she said. On July 25, she and the other employees were let go. Scott, 51, a planner, said his rating also was downgraded to C from B at the same time and he was also laid off. He said his daughter requires expensive medical treatment for two conditions.    (Reporting by Alwyn Scott; Editing by Martin Howell)"

XL Foods said on Saturday it was laying off 2,000 workers at its Brooks, Alberta plant, prompting the Canadian food regulatory agency on the same day to announce it could not complete its safety assessment if the plant was not in production. But the privately held company said on Sunday it was now recalling hundreds of employees to satisfy the condition of the temporary license to demonstrate the implementation of the enhanced protocols. XL Foods was given the green light to resume beef production at its plant last Thursday under the close inspection of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, or CFIA, after a massive recall of beef suspected of being tainted with the E. coli bacteria. On Saturday XL Foods' announcement of temporary layoff of most of its staff, prompted the CFIA to say it could not continue to assess the plant's operations because the cutting of carcasses had stopped. Unfortunately, the company decided to stop operations after only cutting about half the carcasses, CFIA said in a statement late Saturday. At this time, we are unable to complete our assessment. The CFIA suspended the plant's operating license on Sept. 27, after a recall of millions of pounds of beef suspected of being contaminated with E. coli bacteria. At least 12 people in Canada are recovering from eating meat contaminated with the bacteria. Doug O'Halloran, president of the plant's local union, said earlier on Sunday that it was a stupid move by XL Foods to layoff workers and called on the company to explain its actions. So it doesn't make sense why they would lay these workers off if CFIA says that they need to see more processing, O'Halloran, president of United Food and Commercial Workers Local 401, told CTV News on Sunday. Millions of pounds of beef have been recalled across Canada and the United States, hitting food stores such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc, Costco Wholesale Corp, Safeway and Loblaw Companies Ltd. Some of the tainted beef also reached Hong Kong. Both the plant's operators and the Canadian food inspection system have come under withering attack from Canadian opposition leaders and consumers for being slow to contain the crisis that they believe should also have been prevented. CFIA has criticized the privately-held company for not  following its own plan to ensure the safety of the beef it produces. XL Foods said in a statement last week that it has addressed the problems raised by federal regulators, such as the need for better analysis detecting E. coli and improved record-keeping and monitoring. But the plant's union said the culture at the plant needed to change to make food and worker safety the highest priority. The high speed production lines were a serious problem, along with sloppy practices such as in the sterilizing of knives, the union said. As the plant shutdown drags on, Western Canadian ranchers and feedlots were holding back cattle from the market, incurring extra costs. Some Canadian ranchers were shipping cattle to   slaughter houses in Nebraska, Utah and Washington. Canada is the world's sixth-largest exporter of beef and veal."

The Labor Department advisory said the circumstances surrounding the planned cuts were too uncertain to require defense and other federal contractors to comply with provisions of a law requiring employees to be notified 60 days before major layoffs or plant closures. Under current law, the U.S. Defense Department is facing across-the-board budget cuts beginning Jan. 2 aimed at cutting $500 billion in projected national security spending over the next decade. Under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining and Notification ACT, companies have to send out notices 60 days ahead of time advising their employees of impending mass layoffs or plant closures. If notices were sent out ahead of the impending budget cuts, the workers would be receiving them just before the Nov. 6 presidential election. Apart from the January reductions, the Pentagon is working to trim spending by $487 billion as ordered by the Budget Control Act last year. Lawmakers from both parties say they oppose the across-the-board cuts that will hit in January under a process known as sequestration, but they have not been able to agree on alternative ways to reduce spending. Representative Gerry Connolly, a Democrat from Virginia, said on Monday Congress should cancel its annual August recess to focus instead on stopping the $500 billion in automatic spending cuts. Congress has only 11 more legislative days, he said, to broker a deal halting the cuts before the November election. If the two parties are unable to agree on a deal before the end of the term, the issue may be taken up in a post-election lame-duck session of Congress. We got to stay in session and solve this problem, Connolly told reporters after speaking at a rally to protest sequestration. It is not rocket science. Call for Compromise The rally, held by Northrop Grumman Corp, brought together defense industry leaders and members of the Virginia Congressional delegation, as well as Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell, who urged Congress and the White House to find a solution to stop the expansive budget cuts, citing the more than 200,000 Virginia jobs at risk if a deal is not reached. More than 2.14 million jobs nationally could be lost because of sequestration, a George Mason University analysis for the Aerospace Industries Association said. McDonnell, a Republican, called for a compromise between Republicans and Democrats in Congress, saying a practical solution that includes cuts and revenue increases must be agreed on. We know we got to get our fiscal house in order, but it's got to be in a way that is systematic, that is practical, that looks out for the American war fighter and the men and women of the private sector that support them, McDonnell said. That's not the way this was done. The Labor Department decision drew swift condemnation from Republican Representative Buck McKeon, head of the Armed Services committee, who called it politically motivated. McKeon said instead of trying to find a way to avert the cuts, the president is focused on preventing advance notice to American workers that their jobs are at risk and on perpetuating uncertainty. People will still get laid off because of the president's irresponsibility, but they won't have the notice to protect themselves and their families, McKeon said. The president is doing nothing to look out for the American worker and is using our troops as leverage to push his failed political agenda. The Labor Department said that the law did not apply in the current circumstances because while sequestration may occur, efforts are being made to avoid it. So even the occurrence of sequestration is not necessarily foreseeable, the guidance said. It said relevant case law would not require employers to provide notices under the current conditions."

From January, mining companies must process ore before shipping it overseas, part of policies aimed at boosting the value of exports of raw materials from Indonesia, the world's top exporter of nickel ore, thermal coal and refined tin. But a tumbling currency, a precarious trade deficit and protests from industry have made the Southeast Asian nation reconsider the step. Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono is expected to make a final decision soon on the ban. We are trying to inform and convince the government how serious this is, Freeport Indonesia CEO Rozik Soetjipto told Reuters. Last week, lawmakers said they would not dilute the law, adopted five years ago, and it must go ahead as scheduled. If there are no changes to the ban, Freeport was expected to face a loss in revenue of around $5 billion next year, or 65 percent of its total in Indonesia, due to losses in production from the world's second-largest copper mine. The U.S. mining giant estimated that output at its Grasberg mine would fall by 60 percent next year, consisting of a cut of 900 million pounds of copper and 1.7 million ounces of gold. It would also have to layoff half of its 15,000 employees in Indonesia. For Indonesia, that translates into a loss of $1.6 billion in taxes, royalties and dividends, or 0.6 percent of GDP growth. The central bank expects GDP growth of around 6 percent next year, compared to 5.7 percent this year. What we are trying to convince government and members of parliament is that allowing us to continue exporting our product would not be breaching the law, Soetjipto said. Freeport currently processes only around 40 percent of its ore mined domestically at one smelter in East Java, but the prevailing law requires it to smelt all of it in Indonesia from mid-January. PT Indovasi and PT Indosmelt also plan to build smelters to take ore from Freeport, but construction has yet to start.      (Writing by Randy Fabi; Editing by Ed Davies)"

We are leaving no stone unturned and looking at all areas, company spokesman Dave Tovar said in an interview. He declined to predict how many employees would be laid off, saying it was too early in the budgeting process. The estimated cost savings for Sprint, which has 31,000 employees, would be equivalent to about 10 percent of its current annual operating costs of $26 billion. The ratio of the company's capital expenditures to its sales is more than 20 percent, which Tovar said is higher than for other wireless carriers. We are trying to get more in line with the industry average, he said. He said Sprint on Tuesday will provide more details about the job cuts and the company's plans to bolster the quality, speed and capacity of its wireless network, when it reports fiscal second-quarter results. Savings are also expected to come from cutting severance for laid off employees and temporarily eliminating raises. In its first quarter ended June 30, the company posted a $20 million loss as revenue fell 8.7 percent to $8.03 billion, missing analysts' estimates of $8.43 billion. But majority owner Softbank Corp eased investor concerns by saying it has no plans to sell its stake in Sprint.

David Hess, president of aircraft engine maker Pratt & Whitney, told Reuters on Wednesday the company was still examining its legal obligations regarding notification of employees who could be put out of jobs in January. At issue are some $55 billion in automatic spending cuts for fiscal 2013 that are due to hit on Jan. 2 and which could cost the defense industry thousands of jobs. Hess and other aerospace industry executives are mounting a campaign to persuade Congress to stop them. In a controversial move last week, the U.S. Labor Department said the circumstances surrounding the planned cuts were too uncertain to require defense and other federal contractors to comply with the provisions the so-called WARN Act, which requires employees to be notified 60 days before major layoffs or plant closures. Republican lawmakers immediately accused the Obama administration of trying to suppress potentially damaging notices of layoffs just before the election. Right now the WARN Act is the law, and we always comply with the law, so we're not quite sure we understand the direction from the Department of Labor, Hess told Reuters at a rally for employees at Pratt & Whitney's jet engine test facility and rocket engine plant near West Palm Beach, Florida. The cuts in January stem from an August 2011 congressional budget deal to avoid a historic default on U.S. Treasury debt. Congress pledged to find $1.2 trillion in additional spending cuts by the end of 2012, or they would happen automatically, with half coming from defense spending. Although defense firms have warned that some $500 billion in cuts over 10 years will ultimately cause the loss of more than two million jobs countrywide, they have little clarity on how the Defense Department will parse out the pain starting in January. Pay and benefits for military personnel are exempt from the cuts, but executives are waiting to hear which weapons programs will be hit hardest. Details Due Within 30 Days On Tuesday, President Barack Obama signed legislation requiring his administration to detail within 30 days how it will administer the cuts, which may help contractors decide where to cut. We'll make a decision in the future as to whether or not we'll issue WARN notices. Some of it may depend on what clarity we get in 30 days, Hess said. Job cuts at Pratt & Whitney's U.S. operations could reach into the hundreds, Hess said. The Florida plant does development work on engines for the stealthy F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and builds rocket engines and has been under consideration for new investment to produce engines for exported F-35s. Should the cuts cause a reduction in the fighter jet's  production rate, the company would have to re-evaluate its expansion plans, Hess added. Tom Burbage, program integration manager for the F-35 at the plane's prime contractor, Lockheed Martin, said his firm appreciates and will analyze the Labor Department guidance, but management must first answer to shareholders and employees. The Labor Department is not a major shareholder in corporations like Lockheed Martin or (Pratt & Whitney parent)United Technologies, Burbage said. Generally speaking, if we know there's a potential to have a major reduction in the future, we have to take appropriate action, he said. All we are trying to do is be transparent with our employees so that nobody is caught by surprise. Lawmakers from both parties say they oppose the across-the-board cuts that will hit in January as a result of a budget deal made a year ago, but they have not been able to agree on alternative ways to reduce spending. Congress is on a five-week recess and when it returns in September, it will have only 11 legislative days to try to broker a deal before the November election.

Hagel, speaking to civilian aircraft maintenance workers at Naval Air Station Jacksonville, said he and the Pentagon's top military chiefs had decided to implement a 20 percent across-the-top cut in our offices. He said later the 20 percent cut would also affect the headquarters of the combatant commanders and would be implemented over the 2015-2019 time frame. Pentagon spokesman George Little said the spending cuts would save about $1.5 billion to $2 billion a year. Personnel reductions associated with these savings will be determined during the development of detailed execution plans, Little said in a statement. He said the decision was given in fiscal guidance to department leaders earlier this month as a result of an internal review ordered by the secretary. Some critics have charged that the bureaucracy that supports the secretary of defense and some combatant commanders has become bloated over a decade of war. Hagel's comments came as he was on a three-day listening tour of military bases in the U.S. South to get a look at how an across-the-board $37 billion budget cut this year is affecting Defense Department personnel, including civilians who began taking a day a week of unpaid leave last week. Some 6,900 civilians at the Jacksonville base had their first day of unpaid leave last week, including 2,700 at the aircraft maintenance facility, officials said. That amounts to an effective 20 percent pay cut through the end of the fiscal year. Hagel defended the decision to put civilian workers on unpaid leave, saying further cuts in other areas would have jeopardized military training and readiness, which had to be the Pentagon's top priority. In the end, I had to make all my final decisions on readiness, supporting our war-fighters and preserving as much combat power as I could, Hagel told the group. I could not take our readiness down any further, any deeper than where we are. I just couldn't do it. Sobering Picture The defense secretary painted a sobering picture of the uncertainty hanging over the department because of automatic budget cuts known as sequestration. The cuts, ordered by the White House and the Congress, reduced Pentagon spending by $37 billion this fiscal year, prompting the unpaid leave and other cuts. The reductions are likely to cut $52 billion from defense spending in fiscal 2014 and could continue at that level for a further eight years. The Pentagon is in the process of reducing spending by $487 billion over a decade as required by the 2011 Budget Control Act, which aimed to reduce massive U.S. deficits. The act also required an additional $500 billion in across-the-board cuts unless Congress and the White House could find an alternative. So far, the president and lawmakers have been unable to reach a deal to avert the cuts. The first round of automatic cuts began earlier this year after being reduced to $37 billion, and the Pentagon's proposed $526.6 billion budget did not take into account the cuts required by the law. Responding to questions from the workers, Hagel said an additional $52 billion in cuts in the 2014 fiscal year would inevitably require a reduction in the Defense Department's workforce. There will be further cuts in personnel, make no mistake about it, he said. I won't have any choice. We took a $37 billion cut this year and you see the consequences of that. And then if you take a $52 billion cut, there'll be continuing significant and serious reductions. The secretary said cuts in the future could eventually affect not only jobs but compensation packages, such as retirement benefits, healthcare and pay, which combined represent about half of the Defense Department's budget. That's not going to go untouched, he said. You don't get the money in the overhead of the office of the secretary of the Defense Department. You need billions and billions of dollars. Speaking later at a luncheon with members of the Jacksonville Chamber of Commerce, Hagel said he was not optimistic about Congress and the White House reaching an agreement to avert the next round of budget cuts. I don't see a lot of hopeful signs that this is going to be resolved, he said."

The Calgary-based oil and gas producer said late on Tuesday that it had appointed former Marathon Chief Operating Officer David Roberts as president and chief executive officer, effective June 19. He replaces Murray Nunns, who will retire from the company on July 1. Penn West is one of Canada's largest conventional oil producers with nearly 6 million acres (2.5 million hectares) of exploration lands in Western Canada and 676 million barrels of reserves. However, its shares have dropped by more than half over the past two years as production declined while its rich dividend drained the cash needed to boost output. The company has been struggling and it needed to take decisive action, said Jim Hall, chief investment officer at Mawer Investment Management Ltd, which owns some 1.32 million Penn West shares, according to the latest Thomson Reuters data. I'm happy they are doing so. Penn West said it plans to increase efficiency, starting with a 10 percent workforce reduction over the next few weeks. The company had about 2,130 employees at the end of 2012. For the third quarter, the company is cutting its quarterly payout to 14 Canadian cents a share from 27 Canadian cents to increase its financial flexibility, it said. Shares of Penn West were down 30 Canadian cents at C$10.60 by early afternoon in Toronto. They need the cash to operate the business and invest in the business so it makes sense to retain it rather than pay it out when they couldn't afford to do so, Hall said. The company will maintain the second-quarter dividend at 27 Canadian cents a share and pay it to shareholders of record on June 28. It also said its outlook on full-year production and capital spending remained unchanged. Strategic Review Penn West also said its board will form a special committee to explore such options as strategic financing alternatives, asset divestments, joint ventures and other business combinations. The changes come barely a month after the company named two respected industry leaders to its board - former Suncor Energy Inc head Rick George as chairman and former head of Canadian Natural Resources Allan Markin as vice chairman. We believe the announced CEO change signals a step forward in the ongoing reorganization and restructuring of Penn West,  BMO Capital Markets analyst Gordon Tait said in a research note. We are encouraged that the company appears to be making the difficult organizational and financial changes needed. Tait and other analysts said, however, that Penn West was not out of the woods and still needed to improve operational efficiency, shed assets and strengthen its balance sheet. The company's base operations are unsustainable today, said Barclays analyst Grant Hofer. This makes Penn West a unattractive as a takeover target and joint venture partner, he said. Despite Penn West's not so solid financial position, some investors do not rule out the possibility of a takeover. We never buy anything based on take-out value, but if you do look at some of the take-outs that have happened, it is not necessarily the companies in the best financial position that get taken out, said Ryan Bushell, a portfolio manager for the IA Clarington Canadian Conservative Equity Fund at Leon Frazer. I could see someone finding some value in (Penn West). We certainly still think there is value in it, said Bushell, whose firm owns roughly 1.94 million Penn West shares, according to Thomson Reuters data."
"https://www.reuters.com/article/indonesia-minerals-miners-idUSL3N0KM01S20140112","Indonesia's small miners feel betrayed by export ban; fear more layoffs, closures","","January 12, 2014 /  8:40 AM / 4 years ago","","DAMPALA, Indonesia, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Hundreds of small Indonesian mines, like nickel miner Mobi Jaya Persada, are preparing for the worst after the government imposed a controversial mineral export ban on Sunday that could force them to close down. Mobi Jaya Presada, which contributes to Indonesia being the world's biggest exporter of nickel ore that is used in stainless steel production, has already laid off half of its 100 employees ahead of the ban coming into force. We've already started reducing the workforce and we're going to continue if the regulation stops ore exports, said Roy Kojongan, business development manager for the remote Mobi Jaya Persada, adding the company only had 44 employees left. It's not fair for the people of Indonesia. Almost 30,000 mine workers have been laid off as mines cut back operations ahead of the long-expected ban, according to the Indonesian Mineral Entrepreneurs Association. Mine lay offs have already sparked protests in Jakarta and thousands more could see the export ban become a hot political issue in 2014's legislative and presidential elections. We call on all mining workers to prepare to go on the streets and swarm the presidential palace if the government goes ahead with the implementation of the ban, said Juan Forti Silalahi of the National Mine Workers Union in a statement earlier on Saturday. On Sunday, the export ban took effect requiring all mineral ore be processed domestically in an attempt to transform Southeast Asia's biggest economy from being simply a supplier of raw materials into a producer of finished goods. But fearing the ban would significantly impact Indonesia's already slowing economy, President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono signed last-minute regulations diluting the law to allow major miners, like U.S. giants Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold  and Newmont Mining Corp, to continue exporting as usual. That leaves the burden of the ban on hundreds of smaller, locally-owned operations that cannot afford hundreds of millions of dollars to build a smelter to comply with the law. More than 100 junior mining companies, from privately held PT Harita Prima Abadi Mineral to Singapore's Ibris Nickel Pte Ltd, have reduced or shut down operations because of the uncertainty surrounding the mineral export ban. Why are they releasing Freeport and Newmont, but banning local companies? questioned Erry Sofyan, director PT Harita Prima Abadi Mineral which mines bauxite, an ore used to make aluminium. We already stopped mining operations at the end of December. If we can't continue exporting bauxite, we will layoff 4,700 workers. Villagers Mining Lifeline at Risk Despite knowing for more than five years that this ban was coming, companies have hesitated to invest in smelters and refining facilities due to the lack of infrastructure and power in remote areas where mines are often located. Ample global smelting capacity and weak metal prices, also make new smelters less economically viable. We are not against the downstream processing policy, but with the assumption that the government would provide the infrastructure, said Kojongan, whose company has yet to make its first shipment but has already been approached from buyers in Australia, Canada and China. Kojongan's firm, Mobi Jaya Persada, owns a small 34-hectare mining concession in Dampala in a distant part of Central Sulawesi, a hub of Indonesia's nickel mining industry that provides a lifeline for many local villages. Its hauling road carves a steep and winding path into the densely forested hills behind Morowali's crystal blue coast, where wooden canoes have been used for fishing for centuries. Silt from the mines is changing this and many fishermen complain that their catches have dropped sharply since mining permits were issued in 2009, the start of the nickel boom in the sprawling eastern Indonesian island of Sulawesi. But the mines provide work for villagers and the significant impact the export ban threatens to have on the local communities in Sulawesi makes Rudi Chandra, a mining contractor for Mobi Jaya, hopeful Jakarta will eventually relent allow small miners to continue production. In 2012, when the first (mining) regulation was brought in we were all hurt -- toothaches, headaches and heartaches. Now if they implement this out we will be dead, Chandra said. There has to be a solution. It's just that we don't know what the solution will be yet. "

Glencore said last week it would proceed with a plan to close some of its Optimum Coal operations because of weak prices. The Swiss-based company said it would place on care and maintenance some opencast operations, large parts of the coal processing plants and associated support services at the mine and would consider reopening them if market conditions improve. The NUM said in a statement Glencore had, in its view, failed to comply with its social and labour plans regarding severance packages and it was therefore up to the department of mineral resources (DMR) to enforce compliance. We are consulting with our lawyers as to what recourse we will take against DMR if they fail and Glencore succeeds with retrenchment, NUM Deputy General Secretary William Mabapa was quoted as saying. Glencore rejected the NUM's allegations. We have continually engaged with all parties ... in order to determine whether measures were available to avoid the closure, it said in a statement. It was demonstrated during these sessions that these operations are financially not viable in the current market conditions and that there are no measures available to avoid the retrenchments. The London-listed group said the redundancy packages it offered were above industry standards and added that Optimum will also consider redeploying some of the employees to other parts of the business should jobs become available. Optimum produces about 10 million tonnes of coal annually, half of which is sold to power utility Eskom, while the rest is exported. Officials from the DMR were not immediately available for comment.    (Additional reporting by Silvia Antonioli; Editing by Joe Brock and David Holmes)"

ConocoPhillips in March agreed to sell oil sands and western natural gas assets to Cenovus for C$17 billion ($12.4 billion), making it the latest international oil major to pull back from a region beset by high costs and low crude prices. Norwegian oil company Statoil ASA (STL.OL), which late last year agreed to sell Canadian oil sands assets to local producer Athabasca Oil Corp (ATH.TO), has also shed staff, a spokesman said on Thursday, without disclosing the precise number. The resulting layoffs will pile on to the high unemployment rate facing oil-producing Alberta province after the two-year crash in commodity prices. The unemployment rate was 8.4 percent in March, slightly down from months earlier, but still at a level not seen in more than 20 years. The government of Alberta has been publicly firm that the asset sales are good news as buyers have been domestic companies eyeing expansion. But privately, in written advice to Energy Minister Marg McCuaig-Boyd days after the Cenovus deal, a senior civil servant conceded one negative aspect in the financial and labour impact of the exodus. Some energy jobs may be at risk because such mergers and acquisitions yield duplications and redundancies, according to the government briefing note, seen by Reuters under freedom-of-information laws. Asked about the note, Alberta Premier Rachel Notley said job losses are a cost of consolidation, although she does not necessarily anticipate more layoffs. The province is working hard to seek export markets for its landlocked energy products to ensure the sector's long-term stability, she said. ConocoPhillips spokesman Rob Evans said the layoffs will be mostly in the Canada's oil capital of Calgary, Alberta, and will occur by mid-May. The company had more than 2,000 staff in Canada as of late 2015. Global energy majors have sold off more than $22.5 billion worth of Canadian oil sands assets so far this year to domestic companies. Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L), which in March agreed to sell most oil sands assets for $8.5 billion to Canadian Natural Resources (CNQ.TO), said at the time that layoffs among head office employees and technical staff were possible. Shell spokeswoman Tara Lemay on Thursday declined to provide a precise figure, saying most workers will be kept on and those laid off are eligible to apply for positions within Shell globally.

Wall Street's reaction was lukewarm, after two previous Yahoo CEOs failed to find an answer to rivals like Web-search leader Google and the Facebook social-networking site. Sunnyvale, California-based Yahoo, which ended 2011 with some 14,000 employees, said it would save $375 million annually from the cuts and incur a pre-tax cash charge in the second quarter of $125 million to $145 million. The company declined to comment on severance details. Some analysts were skeptical about the widely expected layoffs, which weren't accompanied by details of Yahoo's broader plan to revamp its business. You can't cut your way to revenue growth, said Colin Gillis of BGC Partners. What people want to see out of Yahoo is ... a plan and provision for revenue growth. Third Point, an activist hedge fund that is waging a proxy fight to install a slate of handpicked directors on Yahoo's board, described the layoffs as necessary. But the hedge fund, Yahoo's largest shareholder with a 5.8 percent stake, said in a statement that it was disappointed that this round of cuts occurred before CEO Scott Thompson has articulated his strategic plan for the company. Thompson, in all-staff memo obtained by Reuters, said the changes would transform Yahoo into a leaner outfit that focuses on its main businesses, which he identified as core media and communications, platforms and data. The changes we're announcing today will put our customers first, allow us to move fast, and to get stuff done, Thompson said in the memo, adding that the changes would result in a smaller, nimbler, more profitable company. We are intensifying our efforts on our core businesses and redeploying resources to our most urgent priorities, Thompson wrote in the memo. Macquarie Research's Ben Schachter saw the layoffs as a start in determining the new direction of the company. Scott Thompson is not there to tweak the business, Schachter said. He saw something in the assets to make him think there was potential. A Yahoo spokeswoman said that every organization within the company was affected by the layoffs but that some groups were affected more than others. She declined to specify the groups most affected. Yahoo said it would provide more details of its plans when it releases first-quarter results on April 17. The layoffs come as Yahoo's revenue declines due to competition from Google and Facebook. Last year, Yahoo's revenue totaled $4.98 billion, compared with Facebook's $3.71 billion, accomplished with just 3,200 employees. Yahoo is also fighting a battle with hedge fund manager Daniel Loeb. Loeb, who runs Third Point, is seeking to appoint four new directors to Yahoo's board. Third Point, with a 5.8 percent stake in Yahoo, is the company's largest shareholder.

The company, which offers free human-resources software to manage benefits and payroll while making its money as an insurance broker, said on Thursday that 430 employees would lose their jobs. That leaves 4-year-old Zenefits with about 500 employees, roughly a third of what it had a year ago. The layoffs are part of a widespread restructuring effort to reduce costs and had been planned by Zenefits' board and previous chief executive officer, according to a company spokeswoman. This has been planned for some time and is the result of a lot of hard work over the past year to improve our products and service and make the operations of the company more efficient, the spokeswoman said in a statement. Employees were alerted to the layoffs in a memo sent by Jay Fulcher, who started as the San Francisco-based company's CEO on Monday. In 2015, Zenefits grew too quickly, hiring employees to support revenue projections that far surpass where we are today, Fulcher said in the memo, which Reuters saw. Today's action aligns our costs more closely to our business realities and gives us the runway we need to build the business properly for the long term. Fulcher said Zenefits would move its operations to its Tempe, Arizona, office while expanding product and engineering groups in Vancouver and Bangalore, India, to supplement its San Francisco team.  This isn't how any CEO would choose to spend his first week on the job, Fulcher said in the memo, but I strongly believe these difficult decisions are essential in setting Zenefits up for success. Zenefits also laid off more than 350 people last year. The company's software provides a range of human-resources functions, but Zenefits primarily makes money as a middleman between businesses and health insurance providers such as Anthem Blue Cross. Founder Parker Conrad was replaced as CEO a year ago after revelations that employees had acted as insurance brokers without obtaining the required licenses, circumventing state laws. Several states began investigating the company. In November, California fined Zenefits $7 million for licensing violations, one of the largest in the state insurance department's history.

There are no plans for plant closures, he told journalists at a news conference on Thursday. Bombardier said in October it would slash 7,500 jobs worldwide, mostly in its train-making division, in a second round of layoffs announced last year, following extended delays and budget overruns in its aerospace business. A source had told Reuters last week that around 2,200 of those jobs would be at the train-making business in Germany, mostly at the company's plants in Hennigsdorf near Berlin and Goerlitz on the German border with Poland.

The company, which offers free human-resources software to manage benefits and payroll while making its money as an insurance broker, said on Thursday that 430 employees would lose their jobs. That leaves 4-year-old Zenefits with about 500 employees, roughly a third of what it had a year ago. The layoffs are part of a widespread restructuring effort to reduce costs and had been planned by Zenefits' board and previous chief executive officer, according to a company spokeswoman. This has been planned for some time and is the result of a lot of hard work over the past year to improve our products and service and make the operations of the company more efficient, the spokeswoman said in a statement. Employees were alerted to the layoffs in a memo sent by Jay Fulcher, who started as the San Francisco-based company's CEO on Monday. In 2015, Zenefits grew too quickly, hiring employees to support revenue projections that far surpass where we are today, Fulcher said in the memo, which Reuters saw. Today's action aligns our costs more closely to our business realities and gives us the runway we need to build the business properly for the long term. Fulcher said Zenefits would move its operations to its Tempe, Arizona, office while expanding product and engineering groups in Vancouver and Bangalore, India, to supplement its San Francisco team.  This isn't how any CEO would choose to spend his first week on the job, Fulcher said in the memo, but I strongly believe these difficult decisions are essential in setting Zenefits up for success. Zenefits also laid off more than 350 people last year. The company's software provides a range of human-resources functions, but Zenefits primarily makes money as a middleman between businesses and health insurance providers such as Anthem Blue Cross. Founder Parker Conrad was replaced as CEO a year ago after revelations that employees had acted as insurance brokers without obtaining the required licenses, circumventing state laws. Several states began investigating the company. In November, California fined Zenefits $7 million for licensing violations, one of the largest in the state insurance department's history. Fulcher, the company's third CEO in a year, previously headed software companies Ooyala Inc and Agile Software Corp. His predecessor, David Sacks, announced his resignation in December.

ConocoPhillips in March agreed to sell oil sands and western natural gas assets to Cenovus for C$17 billion ($12.4 billion), making it the latest international oil major to pull back from a region beset by high costs and low crude prices. Norwegian oil company Statoil ASA (STL.OL), which late last year agreed to sell Canadian oil sands assets to local producer Athabasca Oil Corp (ATH.TO), has also shed staff, a spokesman said on Thursday, without disclosing the precise number. The resulting layoffs will pile on to the high unemployment rate facing oil-producing Alberta province after the two-year crash in commodity prices. The unemployment rate was 8.4 percent in March, slightly down from months earlier, but still at a level not seen in more than 20 years. The government of Alberta has been publicly firm that the asset sales are good news as buyers have been domestic companies eyeing expansion. But privately, in written advice to Energy Minister Marg McCuaig-Boyd days after the Cenovus deal, a senior civil servant conceded one negative aspect in the financial and labour impact of the exodus. Some energy jobs may be at risk because such mergers and acquisitions yield duplications and redundancies, according to the government briefing note, seen by Reuters under freedom-of-information laws. Asked about the note, Alberta Premier Rachel Notley said job losses are a cost of consolidation, although she does not necessarily anticipate more layoffs. The province is working hard to seek export markets for its landlocked energy products to ensure the sector's long-term stability, she said. ConocoPhillips spokesman Rob Evans said the layoffs will be mostly in the Canada's oil capital of Calgary, Alberta, and will occur by mid-May. The company had more than 2,000 staff in Canada as of late 2015. Global energy majors have sold off more than $22.5 billion worth of Canadian oil sands assets so far this year to domestic companies. Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L), which in March agreed to sell most oil sands assets for $8.5 billion to Canadian Natural Resources (CNQ.TO), said at the time that layoffs among head office employees and technical staff were possible. Shell spokeswoman Tara Lemay on Thursday declined to provide a precise figure, saying most workers will be kept on and those laid off are eligible to apply for positions within Shell globally.

Wall Street's reaction was lukewarm, after two previous Yahoo CEOs failed to find an answer to rivals like Web-search leader Google and the Facebook social-networking site. Sunnyvale, California-based Yahoo, which ended 2011 with some 14,000 employees, said it would save $375 million annually from the cuts and incur a pre-tax cash charge in the second quarter of $125 million to $145 million. The company declined to comment on severance details. Some analysts were skeptical about the widely expected layoffs, which weren't accompanied by details of Yahoo's broader plan to revamp its business. You can't cut your way to revenue growth, said Colin Gillis of BGC Partners. What people want to see out of Yahoo is ... a plan and provision for revenue growth. Third Point, an activist hedge fund that is waging a proxy fight to install a slate of handpicked directors on Yahoo's board, described the layoffs as necessary. But the hedge fund, Yahoo's largest shareholder with a 5.8 percent stake, said in a statement that it was disappointed that this round of cuts occurred before CEO Scott Thompson has articulated his strategic plan for the company. Thompson, in all-staff memo obtained by Reuters, said the changes would transform Yahoo into a leaner outfit that focuses on its main businesses, which he identified as core media and communications, platforms and data. The changes we're announcing today will put our customers first, allow us to move fast, and to get stuff done, Thompson said in the memo, adding that the changes would result in a smaller, nimbler, more profitable company. We are intensifying our efforts on our core businesses and redeploying resources to our most urgent priorities, Thompson wrote in the memo. Macquarie Research's Ben Schachter saw the layoffs as a start in determining the new direction of the company. Scott Thompson is not there to tweak the business, Schachter said. He saw something in the assets to make him think there was potential. A Yahoo spokeswoman said that every organization within the company was affected by the layoffs but that some groups were affected more than others. She declined to specify the groups most affected. Yahoo said it would provide more details of its plans when it releases first-quarter results on April 17. The layoffs come as Yahoo's revenue declines due to competition from Google and Facebook. Last year, Yahoo's revenue totaled $4.98 billion, compared with Facebook's $3.71 billion, accomplished with just 3,200 employees. Yahoo is also fighting a battle with hedge fund manager Daniel Loeb. Loeb, who runs Third Point, is seeking to appoint four new directors to Yahoo's board. Third Point, with a 5.8 percent stake in Yahoo, is the company's largest shareholder.

Some are paid directly by advisers while others get most of their pay from the firm. The layoffs began about a week ago and are ongoing, said the spokeswoman, Karina Byrne. A small number involve employees who are retiring and are not being replaced. The layoffs affect a small number of the firm's approximately 3,000 service associates nationwide, but are part of our ongoing review of costs and resources, she said. Expenses at UBS Wealth Americas, an outgrowth of the firm formerly known as PaineWebber, jumped 8 percent to $1.7 billion on legal, compensation and recruiting costs last quarter, while results at its parent bank also were marred by regulatory issues.  UBS, like other large Swiss banks, has been cutting certain trading operations and taking the ax to peripheral areas as it scrambles to meet new bank capital requirements and deal with the demise of Switzerland as a tax haven for the very wealthy. UBS Wealth Management Americas Chief Executive Bob McCann has guided the broker-dealer back to profitability since he took over in 2009 by cutting the brokerage force almost 40 percent from its pre-financial crisis levels while recruiting top brokers from rival firms. He also has focused advisers on soliciting ultra-wealthy clients and steering them to sales of mortgages, insurance and loans to supplement standard investment products. In May, McCann reorganized his management team - most of whom had worked with him when he ran Merrill Lynch's retail brokerage business - and said in a memo that his top aide will be further realigning the field leadership structure to create greater accountability.  The layoffs follow a quarter in which the brokerage's pretax operating profit fell 3 percent as compensation and recruiting costs were up 8 percent each.

We are always looking at our business to make sure that we have the right people in the right roles to operate efficiently, safely and reliably, Abendhoff said.  Abendhoff did not say when the cuts, which are between 3 percent and 4 percent of the plant's total workforce of 1,800 employees and contractors, would take effect.

A Venezuelan court last week ordered the seizure of the company's Valencia plant, ruling in favor of two dealers that had filed a case in 2000 against the subsidiary on grounds they had not complied with an agreed sale of 10,000 vehicles. Workers say that before the seizure was announced, GM had been dismantling the plant, which has not produced a car since the beginning of 2016 because of shortages of parts and strict currency controls in the OPEC nation.  The seizure, which GM called illegal, comes amid a deepening economic and social crisis in leftist-led Venezuela that has already roiled many U.S. companies.  We all received a payment and a text message, said a worker who had worked for the company for more than a decade, adding that his corporate email account had been deactivated over the weekend.     Our former bosses told us the executives left and we were all fired.

The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the layoffs or the worker allegations it had already been dismantling the plant.  GM said last week that it was halting operations and laying off workers due to the illegal judicial seizure of its assets. 'Show Your Face' The leftist government of Nicolas Maduro says it is not seeking to expropriate the plant, which has been operating for 35 years, and has called on GM to come back.

The world's oldest bank, whose troubles date back several years, asked for state support in December after failing to raise 5 billion euros ($5.3 billion) on the market to shore up its capital. The European Central Bank has since put the capital shortfall that the bank must fill at 8.8 billion euros. The Italian government is expected to pump 6.6 billion euros into the bank, taking a stake of around 70 percent. [nL5N1EL0X3] [nR1N1DP27R] But for state aid to be unlocked, the European Commission must approve the bank's restructuring and negotiations are dragging on.  Morelli's own business plan, unveiled in October, envisaged 2,600 layoffs - around 10 percent of the bank's employees - and 500 branch closures, but he said Brussels is demanding a much more stringent approach in terms of cost cuts and revenue targets.  [nL4N1CV2E1] Morelli told a shareholder meeting on Wednesday he did not know the final number of job cuts. A source close to the matter said the EU was asking for a staff reduction of more than 5,000 people.  We are negotiating a plan that will be radically different from the one that the bank had presented to the market, Morelli said. We have told our counterparts that we need to find the right compromise ... Right now I am not in a position to give numbers (on layoffs). One big hurdle is the bank's mountain of problem loans, which stand at 46 billion euros on a gross basis - the highest amount relative to a bank's capital in Italy. Monte dei Paschi's failed capital raising last year was designed to cover losses from the planned disposal of 28 billion euros of its most toxic soured debts.  Morelli said the bank needed to get rid of such loans as soon as possible, but also said the timing and details of the sale were still being discussed as Monte dei Paschi wanted to minimize further loan losses. He said it would take years for the bank to reverse a 28 billion euros loss in commercial deposits suffered in 2016 when customers were worried about its survival. Italy is trying to shore up its problem banks to avoid losses for creditors and depositors that could undermine confidence in the banking system. Monte dei Paschi is not the only Italian bank that is seeking a state bailout. Two regional lenders, Banca Popolare di Vicenza and Veneto Banca, last month also requested a so-called precautionary recapitalization by the state. The ECB has put the combined capital shortfall for these two lenders at 6.4 billion euros.  [nL8N1HJ4TM] Editing by Jane Merriman"

The one-day picket, which attracted tens of thousands of demonstrators, was the first march by the CGT umbrella labor group this year. It came amid a two-day teachers' strike that on Monday delayed the opening of school after the Southern Hemisphere summer holidays. Mauricio Macri became Argentina's president in late 2015, vowing to jumpstart the economy through fiscal reforms aimed at attracting sorely-needed investment. But the promised wave of foreign direct investment has been slow to manifest itself as inflation, while moderating, remains in the double digits. Consumer prices rose by about 40 percent last year. The central bank hopes to cut that rate by more than half in 2017. Employers have been hard-pressed to raise pay packages in line with inflation while Macri's push to cut business costs  has prompted layoffs in the public and private sectors. Protesters clash during a march of Argentina's National General Confederation of Labor (CGT) in solidarity with striking teachers in Buenos Aires, Argentina March 7, 2017.Martin AcostaThe layoffs have continued and deepened since January, CGT spokesman Julio Piumato told Reuters. The discontent comes at a bad time for Macri, who needs his Cambiemos political coalition to do well in October's mid-term elections in order for him to keep pushing his economic reforms through Congress and position himself for re-election in 2019. Slideshow (4 Images)A group of CGT demonstrators shouted for a general strike to be called. But their leaders declined to confirm that a nationwide work stoppage was being planned, prompting shouts of traitors and set a date for the strike from some members.

He was pitching for the first time since July 4, thanks to the All-Star break and being a late scratch from his scheduled start Sunday against the Cubs in Chicago because of food poisoning. Manager Clint Hurdle thought the long layoff affected Taillon. It's a challenge. Eleven days off. I don't think he's ever experienced anything like that. Hurdle said. There's a lot of good to hunt out of it. I just think there was just a little too much rust to knock off. Taillon had not surrendered a run in his previous two starts, and St. Louis' first run, in the fourth, ended a career-high streak of 18 2/3 scoreless innings. As a starting pitcher, you always want to go deep into games, said Taillon. Going five just sounds gross. Anytime a starting pitcher goes five, it leaves a really sour taste in your mouth. Taillon did not agree with Hurdle that the layoff was to blame. I felt pretty fresh, he said. I don't think being wild was a problem, which is usually what I do when I'm rusty.

The government hopes the elimination of the tariff, which will take effect in April, can normalize the distorted consumer electronics market. Computers are three times more expensive in Argentina than in the United States, and 50 percent more expensive than in neighboring Chile, the ministry said in a statement. Former populist President Christina Fernandez instituted a number of tariffs and import restrictions in a bid to boost domestic manufacturing employment. That often resulted in higher prices, and it is common for Argentines to cross into Chile or Paraguay to buy cheaper goods. Center-right President Mauricio Macri has implemented a number of market-friendly reforms since taking office in December 2015, including removing capital controls and cutting the budget deficit.

The protest came roughly a month and a half after a fractious 43-day strike at BHP's much larger Escondida copper mine in Chile. By midmorning the protest had ended, and it was not clear if there had been any impact on production. The company could not be reached immediately for comment, but union president Marcelo Franco told Reuters that workers were scheduled to meet with the mine's manager today. We've established that the company has maintained a hostile attitude toward the workers, the union said in a statement. The protest occurred just hours after BHP officially started a sales process for the mine, one of its smaller operations in South America. Cerro Colorado, which together with the Spence mine forms BHP's Pampa Norte division, produced 74,000 tonnes of copper in 2016. Banking sources have named Chile's Empresas Copec SA and Canadian companies such as Lundin Mining Corp as possible buyers for the deposit.

Appearing for the eighth time in Dubai, where he has won twice with a 92-under par record for the 28 rounds played there since 2001, the 41-year-old Woods looked out of sorts as he continued his comeback at the European Tour event.

After his round, Woods said he was not in any pain on the course but decided to withdraw on Friday morning, trailing overnight leader Sergio Garcia by 12 shots.

Job openings, a measure of labor demand, decreased 301,000 to a seasonally adjusted 5.7 million, the Labor Department said in its monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) on Tuesday. The drop pushed the jobs openings rate to 3.7 percent, the lowest reading this year, from a nine-month high of 3.9 percent in April. Hiring jumped to 5.47 million from 5.04 million the prior month.  There were broad increases in hiring from manufacturing to retail and professional and business services. That narrowed the gap between job openings and hiring, which had raised concerns of a troubling skills mismatch in the economy. The hiring rate climbed two-tenths of a percentage point to 3.7 percent. Economists shrugged off the dive in job openings, which they attributed to the rise in hiring. The job openings plunge in May shows further evidence that the economy is hitting the wall of full employment, said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York.  As the economy ages there's going to be fewer available jobs out there simply because companies have hired all the workers they need for now. The so-called JOLTS report is among the data watched by Federal Reserve officials to get a pulse on both the labor market and inflation. Pointing to labor market strength, 3.2 million Americans voluntarily quit their jobs in May, lifting the quits rate to 2.2 percent from 2.1 percent in April. This rate, which the Fed looks at as a measure of job market confidence, has rebounded from a low of 1.3 percent in late 2009. Despite the labor market nearing full employment, with the jobless rate at 4.4 percent, wage growth has remained frustratingly sluggish.  Average hourly earnings have failed to break above 2.5 percent on a year-over-year basis.

Altice Chief Executive Michel Combes, speaking on Friday after the 440 million euro ($502 million) deal to buy Media Capital from Spain's Prisa was announced, said his firm wanted to grow its digital platforms and content. The Media Capital purchase has raised expectations of further acquisitions in Portugal's media sector, prompting a 14 percent jump in the shares of Impresa, which owns SIC television channel. Analysts say PT's main rivals NOS and Vodafone Portugal might now try to buy Impresa and its rival Cofina , owner of CMTV. Cofina shares were up around 2 percent. The Media Capital deal still needs approvals by regulators in Portugal. But Combes said he expected that to run smoothly. Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa has criticised the sale of PT, the former state telecoms monopoly, and has said he was concerned Altice would break up the firm, leading to layoffs in a nation with a jobless rate of about 10 percent. Altice, founded and controlled by Franco-Israeli tycoon Patrick Drahi, bought PT in 2015. Combes did not comment directly on the prime minister's concerns but when asked about plans for PT and Media Capital, he said: We are not laying off people at PT ... We have no intention to lay off workers at Media Capital. It's all about growing business, that's where we are going to concentrate our efforts, he told a joint news conference with PT CEO Paulo Neves.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-banks-jobs-idUSKBN1441N9","Job cuts announced by European banks tumble in 2016","","December 15, 2016 /  1:27 PM / 7 months ago","","LONDON (Reuters) - Job cuts announced by European banks have tumbled in 2016, as they work through a backlog of layoffs unveiled in previous years and struggle to find new areas where they can trim staff without threatening profitable operations. Some industry watchers say lenders might even recruit a little next year overall, provided the market rally following Donald Trump's U.S. presidential election victory continues, although banks themselves are looking to joint ventures with rivals to cut costs further - signaling more layoffs. On Tuesday, UniCredit (CRDI.MI) said it plans to cut 14,000 jobs by 2019, bringing the total number of layoffs announced by 17 major banks in Europe this year to just under 50,000, according to analysis by Reuters. But in the second half of 2015 alone, the number of announced job losses was 130,000, with culls at HSBC (HSBA.L), Standard Chartered (STAN.L), Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) and Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) among others. Widely seen to be lagging their American counterparts in an era of low interest rates and tight regulation, European banks have implemented major restructurings since 2011 in an attempt to boost profits and stay competitive. This year the cuts at UniCredit, along with layoffs at Commerzbank (CBKG.DE), ING Groep (INGA.AS) and more at Credit Suisse, accounted for over 25,000 of the announced job losses. However, other banks held back despite their repeated emphasis that low profit margins caused by low or negative interest rates and new regulations imposed on the industry since the global financial crisis mean they need to slash costs. Related CoverageFactbox: Job cuts announced by European banks in 2016That's because many are still implementing previously announced reductions, as well as finding they are running out of areas where they can easily lay off staff, having slashed their numbers in retail and investment banking.  Banks seem to be reasonably content and comfortable with their size right now, said Richard Hoar, a director at recruitment firm Goodman Mason. They've trimmed down a lot and might actually need to go up a bit next year if the market bounce continues. One of the problems for banks has been that while they have cut back heavily in some areas, the new rules and ageing IT systems have forced them to bulk up their headcount in areas such as regulatory compliance and technology. The result is that while major banks have made hundreds of thousands of job cuts since the 2008 crisis, the overall number of people working in Europe's financial industry has stayed relatively steady. Total headcount at banks on the STOXX Europe 600 Banks Index .SX7P was 2,362,677 at the end of 2015, just 5.2 percent below the 2,491,125 employees in 2007, according to data compiled by Reuters. Staff numbers haven't come down much because there's been a dramatic shift in who the banks employ. There has been ramp-up in IT and tech staff as they automate, and a reduction in administrative functions, said Xavier Van Hove, fund manager at GAM. New Ways of Cutting Costs With the major restructurings of the past five years failing to revive profitability, the European banks are now being forced to think of more innovative ways to cut costs.  In August, UBS chief executive Sergio Emmotti said the industry would have to share economies of scale by forming joint ventures in certain business areas. Credit Suisse has since said it is in talks with another bank about a cost-sharing project, without elaborating on what that involves.  Octavio Marenzi, CEO of consultancy firm Opimas, said he expects banks will announce plans to start sharing back-office administrative operations in certain areas, where they have little competitive advantage to going it alone.  We'll see more of those kinds of plays where banks try and get the same economies of scale without full blown mergers ... merging portions of their business, undifferentiated aspects of their business, cost centers ... and try and reduce things that way, he said, suggesting fixed income operations as one area likely to see this happen.  However, some investors think banks will need to go further, saying the cuts to areas such as trading and investment banking have left some lenders too small to go it alone.  The problem for European investment banks is the lack of scale, not the quality of the banks, said Eric Knight, founder of activist investor Knight-Vinke, who once tried to force UBS to spin off its investment bank. They're unprofitable because they're too small. He believes there will eventually be mergers between U.S. or Chinese banks and European lenders, because they lack scale in wholesale trading and have no deep domestic market to subsidize their activities. In August, top executives from Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) and Commerzbank (CBKG.DE) held talks on a potential combination of Germany's two biggest lenders, while Sweden's Nordea (NDA.ST) confirmed in October it had approached Dutch state-owned ABN AMRO (ABNd.AS) for a takeover. But so far regulatory reluctance and governments wary of losing control over their national lenders mean few full-blown mergers are likely to come about in the near future. Regulators clearly do not want larger banks, Knight told a banking summit in November. But the idea that these banks could carry on just shrinking their way into a successful strategy is not tenable. editing by David Stamp"

Other data on Thursday showed worker productivity slowing in the fourth quarter, which economists said suggested companies would need to keep hiring to increase output. Increased demand for workers against the backdrop of weak productivity and a shrinking labor pool is starting to put upward pressure on wages, paving the way for interest rate increases from the Federal Reserve this year. It looks like firms will have to keep hiring if they want to expand output, as productivity is barely growing, said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. They are going to have to make do with their workforces as the labor market continues to tighten.  Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 14,000 to a seasonally adjusted 246,000 for the week ended Jan. 28, the Labor Department said. Claims have now been below 300,000, a threshold associated with a healthy labor market, for 100 straight weeks. That is the longest stretch since 1970, when the labor market was much smaller. The labor market is at or close to full employment, and the Fed said on Wednesday it expected labor market conditions would strengthen somewhat further. A tight labor market is expected to boost wage growth and support the economy through strong consumer spending and the continued recovery of the housing market.  The Fed, which has forecast three rate increases this year, kept its benchmark overnight lending rate unchanged in a range of 0.50 percent to 0.75 percent at the end of its latest two-day policy meeting on Wednesday. The U.S. central bank increased borrowing costs in December. The dollar was trading marginally lower against a basket of currencies, while prices for U.S. government bonds rose. U.S. stocks were trading slightly higher.  Economists had forecast first-time applications for jobless benefits falling to 250,000 in the latest week. The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose 2,250 to 248,000 last week. Last week's claims data have no bearing on January's employment report, which is due to be released on Friday, as they fall outside the survey period. Retail Layoffs Surge Although claims were low in January, a report on Thursday from global outplacement consultancy Challenger, Gray & Christmas showed U.S. employers announced 45,934 job cuts last month, a 37 percent jump from December and the largest number of cuts since April 2016.  Retailers announced 22,491 layoffs, accounting for 49 percent of all job cuts recorded last month. Department store giant Macy's, which is closing 68 stores, announced 10,000 job cuts last month. Other retailers announcing layoffs included The Limited, American Apparel, Sears and Abercrombie & Fitch. Department stores have faced stiff competition from online rivals including Amazon.com. According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls probably increased by 175,000 jobs last month, picking up from the 156,000 jobs added in December. The unemployment rate is expected to be unchanged at 4.7 percent in January, near a nine-year low.  There is, however, a possibility that employment gains could beat expectations after reports on Wednesday showed jumps in private sector hiring and manufacturing jobs in January. But retail payrolls pose a downside risk.  In another report, the Labor Department said worker productivity rose at a 1.3 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter, slowing from the prior period's brisk 3.5 percent pace of increase.  While productivity rebounded in the second half of the year after contracting in the first six months, it only increased 0.2 percent in 2016, the smallest gain since 2011. That followed a 0.9 percent gain in 2015.  Productivity has increased at less than 1.0 percent in each of the last six years. Productivity growth averaged 1.1 percent from 2007 to 2016, well below the long-term rate of 2.1 percent from 1947 to 2016. The data illustrate the challenges facing businesses in terms of maintaining profitability as a tight labor market is pushing up wage costs faster than productivity, said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York. Unit labor costs, the price of labor per single unit of output, increased at a 1.7 percent pace in the fourth quarter, accelerating from the prior quarter's 0.2 percent rate. Unit labor costs rose 2.6 percent in 2016 after increasing 2.0 percent in 2015.  Hourly compensation per hour rose at a 3.0 percent rate in the fourth quarter. While that was slower than the third quarter's 3.7 percent rate of increase, it continued to suggest that wage growth is picking up.

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast first-time applications for jobless benefits rising to 257,000 in the latest week. First-time claims were the lowest since April, when initial applications for aid were at levels not seen since November 1973. U.S. futures slightly trimmed losses following the release of the data, while the dollar held gains against a basket of currencies. Treasury debt yields were slightly higher.

Economists polled by Reuters forecast nonfarm payrolls increasing by 175,000. The unemployment rate is seen holding steady at 4.9 percent. Jobs growth has been slowing but is still well above the threshold needed to absorb new entrants into the labor market.  A report by global outplacement consultancy Challenger, Gray & Christmas on Thursday showed layoffs rose in September from a month earlier but were down from a year ago. Employers announced plans to shed 44,324 workers from payrolls in September, 38 percent more than in August but 25 percent fewer than in September 2015. Despite the September increase, the third quarter saw an overall decline in planned layoffs.

Total compensation for the Canadian plane and train maker's top five executives and board chairman rose to $32.7 million in 2016, up from $21.9 million a year earlier, according to a proxy circular published on Wednesday ahead of Bombardier's May 11 annual meeting. In 2016, Bombardier announced two rounds of layoffs totaling 14,500 people over two years at sites around the world. Bombardier has said it will still hire for certain programs.  If I was Bombardier, I would reflect on the message they are getting from the public, Economy Minister Dominique Anglade said in provincial parliament, as angry Quebecers took to social media and popular talk shows on Thursday to denounce the raises. In an email, Bombardier spokesman Simon Letendre said the higher compensation reflects management's success in hitting the company's 2016 targets. He said a large proportion of executive remuneration is tied to performance or to share price appreciation. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, pressed to comment on the issue at a news conference in Brampton, Ontario, said, “We respect the free market and choices companies will make, but we also have a responsibility to ensure the investments we make with taxpayers’ dollars are leading to good jobs and growth.” He did not elaborate. Bombardier's chief executive officer, Alain Bellemare, who launched a five-year turnaround plan, earned almost $9.5 million last year, up from $6.4 million in 2015.  Bombardier, which was forced to consider bankruptcy in 2015 after facing a cash crunch while developing two new planes,  received a $1 billion investment from Quebec that year in its CSeries jets. In February, it got C$372.5 million in loans from Canada's federal government. Bellemare did a good job last year,” said Michel Nadeau, executive director of the Institute for Governance of Private and Public Organizations. “But I think they should wait (for raises) until the company is doing better. Nadeau said the 36 percent raise secured by Bombardier's executive chairman and former CEO, Pierre Beaudoin, to $5.2 million was out of line with Canadian industry norms. Beaudoin is a member of Bombardier’s founding family that controls the company.  I think the shareholders have the right to know why he is being paid $5 million,” Nadeau said. Canada's second largest pension fund, Caisse de depot et placement du Quebec, has invested $1.5 billion for a 30 percent stake in Bombardier's rail division. A Caisse spokesman said the fund considers the importance of a strong link between performance and compensation in all its investments, including Bombardier.

The economy created 227,000 jobs in January. Further tightening in labor market conditions could boost wage growth, which has remained stubbornly sluggish despite anecdotal evidence of more companies struggling to find qualified workers. Pretty Upbeat Signal  Lackluster wage growth, if sustained, could hurt consumer spending and crimp economic growth. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast first-time applications for jobless benefits rising to 250,000 in the latest week.  Today's report sent a pretty upbeat signal about conditions in the job market, said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan in New York. It looks like conditions in the job market have remained solid in the few weeks since the reference period for the January payroll report. The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 3,750 to 244,250 last week, the lowest level since November 1973. The claims report also showed the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid increased 15,000 to 2.08 million in the week ended Jan. 28. The four-week average of the so-called continuing claims fell 3,750 to 2.08 million. In a separate report on Thursday, the Commerce Department said wholesale inventories increased 1.0 percent after a similar jump in November. The back-to-back strong increases of stock accumulation, however, suggest a moderation in the pace of inventory investment in the months ahead. Wholesale stocks excluding autos, the component of wholesale inventories that goes into the calculation of gross domestic product, increased 0.9 percent in December.  Inventory investment contributed one percentage point to the economy's 1.9 percent annualized growth rate in the fourth quarter. That was the second straight quarterly contribution to GDP growth. Inventories had been a drag on GDP growth since the second quarter of 2015. Sales at wholesalers jumped 2.6 percent in December, the largest increase since March 2011, after increasing 0.5 percent in November.  At December's sales pace it would take wholesalers 1.29 months to clear shelves, the smallest since December 2014 and down from 1.31 months in November. The ratio has declined from the 1.37 months touched in January of last year, which was the highest since March 2009. Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Paul Simao and Meredith Mazzilli"

Total compensation for the Canadian plane and train maker's top five executives and board chairman rose to $32.7 million in 2016, up from $21.9 million a year earlier, according to a proxy circular published on Wednesday ahead of Bombardier's May 11 annual meeting. In 2016, Bombardier announced two rounds of layoffs totaling 14,500 people over two years at sites around the world. The company has said it would still hire for certain programs. If I was Bombardier, I would reflect on the message they are getting from the public, Economy Minister Dominique Anglade said in provincial parliament, as angry Quebecers took to social media and popular talk shows on Thursday to denounce the raises. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, pressed to comment on the issue at a news conference in Brampton, Ontario, said, “We respect the free market and choices companies will make, but we also have a responsibility to ensure the investments we make with taxpayers’ dollars are leading to good jobs and growth.” He did not elaborate. Bombardier's chief executive officer, Alain Bellemare, who launched a five-year turnaround plan, earned almost $9.5 million last year, up from $6.4 million in 2015. In an email, Bombardier spokesman Simon Letendre said the higher compensation reflects management's success in hitting the company's 2016 targets. He said a large proportion of executive remuneration is tied to performance or to share price appreciation. Bombardier, which was forced to consider bankruptcy in 2015 after facing a cash crunch while developing two new jets, slashed 7,500 jobs last October, in a second round of layoffs. The company has received a $1 billion investment from Quebec in its CSeries narrowbody program, in 2015. In February, it got C$372.5 million in loans from Canada's federal government. Bellemare did a good job last year,” said Michel Nadeau, executive director of the Institute for Governance of Private and Public Organizations. “But I think they should wait (for raises) until the company is doing better. Nadeau said the 36 percent compensation raise secured by Bombardier's executive chairman and former CEO, Pierre Beaudoin, to $5.2 million was out of line with Canadian industry norms. Beaudoin is a member of Bombardier’s founding family that controls the company. I think the shareholders have the right to know why he is being paid $5 million,” Nadeau said.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/boeing-layoffs-idUSL4N1EE4F6","Boeing airplane unit to cut more jobs in 2017, shares rise","","December 19, 2016 /  7:19 PM / 7 months ago","","SEATTLE (Reuters) - Boeing Co's (BA.N) commercial airplane unit said on Monday it would cut an as-yet-undetermined number of jobs in 2017 after slashing its workforce by 8 percent in 2016, as it struggles to sell planes in the face of a strong dollar. Chicago-based Boeing and European rival Airbus (AIR.PA) are battling especially slow demand for their lucrative, long-range twin-aisle jetliners, such as the Boeing 777 and Airbus A330, in a global climate of political and economic uncertainty. Boeing said last week that it would cut 777 production to five a month in August 2017, a 40 percent reduction from the current rate of 8.3 a month, because of slow sales. The company did not say how many jobs it will cut next year, noting it is still assessing its 2017 budget and employment needs.  But the announcement shows the world's biggest plane maker is axing jobs more aggressively than it forecast earlier this year, and that it will not let up the pressure to cut costs under the new chief executive of the airplane unit, Kevin McAllister, who succeeded Ray Conner on Nov. 21. Conner is now vice chairman of Boeing Co. To successfully compete and win new orders that will fund future product development and growth requires us to achieve much better performance, Conner and McAllister said in a memo to Boeing Commercial Airplanes employees on Monday, which was made public. Boeing will need to do more in 2017 to lower costs and make its planes more affordable, the memo said. Its shares closed up 1.1 percent at $156.18. Boeing is contending with a strong dollar that makes its products more expensive overseas, a non-functioning U.S. Export-Import Bank that hampers aircraft financing, and President-elect Donald Trump's provocation of China, one of Boeing's biggest markets.  Trump has also targeted Boeing for criticism, saying the United States should cancel a pending order to buy modified Boeing 747s as new presidential aircraft, Air Force One, because the cost was too high.  A Boeing spokesman said plane sales are getting more competitive, requiring additional cost-cutting beyond what was envisioned in 2016. We've got to perform better, he said. It's an ongoing process. Boeing has booked just 468 net jetliner orders this year, down from 768 last year and 1,432 in 2014. The figure is also well below Boeing's target of having sales roughly match the 745 to 750 aircraft Boeing expects to deliver to customers this year. Boeing gets the majority of the payment on a plane when it is delivered.  The company also is under pressure to cut costs as it tries to hit Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg's goal of lifting its operating profit margins to the mid-teens by 2020. The figure has averaged 6.9 percent over the last decade. By comparison, Airbus' margins have averaged about 3.7 percent over the past 10 years. The company said last month it would cut about 900 jobs to restructure, reduce costs and prepare for tougher competition. For 2016, Boeing said it expects job reductions to total 8 percent of the commercial airplane workforce, including a 10 percent reduction in the ranks of executives and managers.  The unit cut 6,115 jobs, or 7.3 percent, through November compared with the tally on Dec. 31, 2015, according to Boeing's employment data. That suggests a further 565 job reductions in 2016, and more next year. In March, the company said it planned to cut about 4,000 jobs at the unit.     The company is offering a voluntary layoff program in early 2017, according to Monday's memo, which added that involuntary layoffs may occur in some cases. A spokesman said employees participating in the voluntary layoff program will receive a lump sum payment of one week's pay for each year served, for a maximum of 26 weeks.

Freeport is at loggerheads with Indonesia over rights to the Grasberg mine in Papua in a dispute that has cost both sides hundreds of millions of dollars, and tensions with workers threaten to disrupt the mine's operations further. Freeport resumed copper concentrate export shipments from Grasberg late last month after a 15-week outage stemming from the dispute with government and had planned to ramp up production after it was cut by around two-thirds during the outage. As of mid-April Freeport had demobilized around 10 percent of its Indonesian workforce of 32,000 among efforts to cut costs resulting from the dispute. The company has repeatedly warned workers that striking will result in disciplinary action. The union has demanded an end to Freeport's furlough policy and began a 30-day strike on May 1 in an effort to get workers' jobs back. We will extend the strike for 30 more days, Freeport Indonesia union industrial relations officer Tri Puspital told Reuters on Saturday, referring to a government recommendation for a resolution of the matter. We regret the stance of the businessmen who unilaterally laid off workers, Puspital said. It is a kind of discrimination in terms of disciplinary action. According to Puspital, output from Grasberg has been reduced by half as result of the strike, but he stopped short of providing further detail. In a Freeport inter-office memo titled Making the Right Choice for Your Family and You obtained by Reuters, the company said the strike was illegal and that voluntary resignation is the consequence for workers that ignored demands to return to work and were absent for five consecutive days. Already, 840 workers have suffered this consequence and others will follow if they do not immediately contact the company, the memo dated May 15 said. A U.S.-based spokesman for Freeport referred to a recent statement in response to Reuters questions on the strike and its impact on operations. Worker absenteeism since mid April has unfavorably impacted mining and milling rates, it said, noting that the company is working with union leaders, with the support of Indonesian government officials, to encourage a safe and efficient return to normal operations for the benefit of all stakeholders. Freeport Indonesia plans to ramp up its production to full rates during second-quarter 2017, it said.

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits declined 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 245,000 for the week ended June 3, the Labor Department said on Thursday. The report followed data on Tuesday showing job openings at a record high in April.  There is no sign of a pickup in the rate of layoffs. Against this backdrop of high job openings, firms appear to be holding on to their workers, said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York. Claims surged by 20,000 in the prior week, with California, Tennessee, Kansas, and Missouri accounting for the bulk of the increase. Some of that increase was related to school summer breaks in which bus drivers and cafeteria workers were left temporarily unemployed. Claims have now been below 300,000, a threshold associated with a healthy labor market, for 118 straight weeks. That is the longest such stretch since 1970, when the labor market was smaller. The labor market is near full employment, with the jobless rate at a 16-year low of 4.3 percent. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast first-time applications for jobless benefits falling to 240,000 in the latest week. The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, increased 2,250 to 242,000 last week. The dollar rose against the euro after the European Central Bank kept interest rates on hold but cut its forecasts for inflation and said policymakers had not discussed scaling back the central bank's massive bond-buying program. Prices for U.S. Treasuries fell, while stocks on Wall Street were slightly higher.

The economy created 138,000 jobs in May, well below the average monthly 181,000 jobs gained over the prior 12 months. The Labor Department reported on Tuesday that job openings, a measure of labor demand, increased by 259,000 to a seasonally adjusted 6.0 million in April, the highest level since the government started tracking the series in 2000. Labor market supply constraints are expected to bite into job creation but should also help to keep a lid on jobless claims as employers focus on retaining talent, so long as the economy continues to chug along, said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors in Kalamazoo, Michigan.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/europe-banks-jobs-idUSL5N1E062B","Job cuts announced by European banks tumble in 2016","","December 15, 2016 /  1:27 PM / 7 months ago","","LONDON (Reuters) - Job cuts announced by European banks have tumbled in 2016, as they work through a backlog of layoffs unveiled in previous years and struggle to find new areas where they can trim staff without threatening profitable operations. Some industry watchers say lenders might even recruit a little next year overall, provided the market rally following Donald Trump's U.S. presidential election victory continues, although banks themselves are looking to joint ventures with rivals to cut costs further - signaling more layoffs. On Tuesday, UniCredit (CRDI.MI) said it plans to cut 14,000 jobs by 2019, bringing the total number of layoffs announced by 17 major banks in Europe this year to just under 50,000, according to analysis by Reuters. But in the second half of 2015 alone, the number of announced job losses was 130,000, with culls at HSBC (HSBA.L), Standard Chartered (STAN.L), Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) and Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) among others. Widely seen to be lagging their American counterparts in an era of low interest rates and tight regulation, European banks have implemented major restructurings since 2011 in an attempt to boost profits and stay competitive. This year the cuts at UniCredit, along with layoffs at Commerzbank (CBKG.DE), ING Groep (INGA.AS) and more at Credit Suisse, accounted for over 25,000 of the announced job losses. However, other banks held back despite their repeated emphasis that low profit margins caused by low or negative interest rates and new regulations imposed on the industry since the global financial crisis mean they need to slash costs. Related CoverageFactbox: Job cuts announced by European banks in 2016That's because many are still implementing previously announced reductions, as well as finding they are running out of areas where they can easily lay off staff, having slashed their numbers in retail and investment banking.  Banks seem to be reasonably content and comfortable with their size right now, said Richard Hoar, a director at recruitment firm Goodman Mason. They've trimmed down a lot and might actually need to go up a bit next year if the market bounce continues. One of the problems for banks has been that while they have cut back heavily in some areas, the new rules and ageing IT systems have forced them to bulk up their headcount in areas such as regulatory compliance and technology. The result is that while major banks have made hundreds of thousands of job cuts since the 2008 crisis, the overall number of people working in Europe's financial industry has stayed relatively steady. Total headcount at banks on the STOXX Europe 600 Banks Index .SX7P was 2,362,677 at the end of 2015, just 5.2 percent below the 2,491,125 employees in 2007, according to data compiled by Reuters. Staff numbers haven't come down much because there's been a dramatic shift in who the banks employ. There has been ramp-up in IT and tech staff as they automate, and a reduction in administrative functions, said Xavier Van Hove, fund manager at GAM. New Ways of Cutting Costs With the major restructurings of the past five years failing to revive profitability, the European banks are now being forced to think of more innovative ways to cut costs.  In August, UBS chief executive Sergio Emmotti said the industry would have to share economies of scale by forming joint ventures in certain business areas. Credit Suisse has since said it is in talks with another bank about a cost-sharing project, without elaborating on what that involves.  Octavio Marenzi, CEO of consultancy firm Opimas, said he expects banks will announce plans to start sharing back-office administrative operations in certain areas, where they have little competitive advantage to going it alone.  We'll see more of those kinds of plays where banks try and get the same economies of scale without full blown mergers ... merging portions of their business, undifferentiated aspects of their business, cost centers ... and try and reduce things that way, he said, suggesting fixed income operations as one area likely to see this happen.  However, some investors think banks will need to go further, saying the cuts to areas such as trading and investment banking have left some lenders too small to go it alone.  The problem for European investment banks is the lack of scale, not the quality of the banks, said Eric Knight, founder of activist investor Knight-Vinke, who once tried to force UBS to spin off its investment bank. They're unprofitable because they're too small. He believes there will eventually be mergers between U.S. or Chinese banks and European lenders, because they lack scale in wholesale trading and have no deep domestic market to subsidize their activities. In August, top executives from Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) and Commerzbank (CBKG.DE) held talks on a potential combination of Germany's two biggest lenders, while Sweden's Nordea (NDA.ST) confirmed in October it had approached Dutch state-owned ABN AMRO (ABNd.AS) for a takeover. But so far regulatory reluctance and governments wary of losing control over their national lenders mean few full-blown mergers are likely to come about in the near future. Regulators clearly do not want larger banks, Knight told a banking summit in November. But the idea that these banks could carry on just shrinking their way into a successful strategy is not tenable. editing by David Stamp"

The world's oldest bank, whose troubles date back several years, asked for state support in December after failing to raise 5 billion euros ($5.3 billion) on the market to shore up its capital. The European Central Bank has since put the capital shortfall that the bank must fill at 8.8 billion euros. The Italian government is expected to pump 6.6 billion euros into the bank, taking a stake of around 70 percent. [nL5N1EL0X3] [nR1N1DP27R] But for state aid to be unlocked, the European Commission must approve the bank's restructuring and negotiations are dragging on.  Morelli's own business plan, unveiled in October, envisaged 2,600 layoffs - around 10 percent of the bank's employees - and 500 branch closures, but he said Brussels is demanding a much more stringent approach in terms of cost cuts and revenue targets.  [nL4N1CV2E1] Morelli told a shareholder meeting on Wednesday he did not know the final number of job cuts. A source close to the matter said the EU was asking for a staff reduction of more than 5,000 people.  We are negotiating a plan that will be radically different from the one that the bank had presented to the market, Morelli said. We have told our counterparts that we need to find the right compromise ... Right now I am not in a position to give numbers (on layoffs). One big hurdle is the bank's mountain of problem loans, which stand at 46 billion euros on a gross basis - the highest amount relative to a bank's capital in Italy. Monte dei Paschi's failed capital raising last year was designed to cover losses from the planned disposal of 28 billion euros of its most toxic soured debts.  Morelli said the bank needed to get rid of such loans as soon as possible, but also said the timing and details of the sale were still being discussed as Monte dei Paschi wanted to minimize further loan losses. He said it would take years for the bank to reverse a 28 billion euros loss in commercial deposits suffered in 2016 when customers were worried about its survival. Italy is trying to shore up its problem banks to avoid losses for creditors and depositors that could undermine confidence in the banking system. Monte dei Paschi is not the only Italian bank that is seeking a state bailout. Two regional lenders, Banca Popolare di Vicenza and Veneto Banca, last month also requested a so-called precautionary recapitalization by the state. The ECB has put the combined capital shortfall for these two lenders at 6.4 billion euros.  [nL8N1HJ4TM] Editing by Jane Merriman"

Everybody's been kind of joking that it's going to be robots and drones, Clark said of potential changes from Amazon, which uses robots in its warehouses and is testing drones for delivery. But she is giving Amazon the benefit of the doubt. I have purchased from Amazon for five years. It's a good company, she said. Reuters approached a dozen employees in California, New York, Illinois, South Carolina and Rhode Island. Many said they had been told by managers not to speak to reporters. Several workers expressed relief and happiness about the planned sale, which came as Whole Foods faced pressure from hedge fund investor Jana Partners to improve results. Whole Foods recently overhauled its board and redoubled cost-cutting efforts, seeking to change a high-price image that has tagged it with the nickname Whole Paycheck. But Whole Foods has lost market share to rivals Kroger Co , Wal-Mart Stores Inc, Costco Wholesale Corp and others that have elbowed into the natural and organic segment Whole Foods pioneered. Some workers at the nonunion grocery chain wondered whether Amazon, known for its hard-driving culture, would mean big changes to their pay, benefits or employment. I think that they are a very profit-driven company, so there might be some streamlining as far as labor, said Sasha Hardin, 28, of the Mount Pleasant store, who has been with Whole Foods for 6-1/2 years. A Los Angeles deli worker in his 30s, who is expecting his first child this summer, is worried about layoffs. I want to keep working, said the worker, who did not want his name used. Whole Foods has a corporate culture that prizes inclusive decision-making, such as allowing workers to vote on benefits every three years and disclosing executive pay. I've heard that Amazon's culture is really cutthroat. That worries me, one bagger at a Providence, Rhode Island, store said. At least one customer was concerned that an Amazon purchase would further distance Whole Foods from its roots as a purveyor of premium, organic and specialty foods. This store has become a money-making machine, said Tony Castro, a 40-year-old private chef, who shops daily in Whole Foods' sprawling downtown Los Angeles store.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-boeing-layoffs-idUSKBN14826M","Boeing airplane unit to cut more jobs in 2017, shares rise","","December 19, 2016 /  7:19 PM / 7 months ago","","SEATTLE (Reuters) - Boeing Co's (BA.N) commercial airplane unit said on Monday it would cut an as-yet-undetermined number of jobs in 2017 after slashing its workforce by 8 percent in 2016, as it struggles to sell planes in the face of a strong dollar. Chicago-based Boeing and European rival Airbus (AIR.PA) are battling especially slow demand for their lucrative, long-range twin-aisle jetliners, such as the Boeing 777 and Airbus A330, in a global climate of political and economic uncertainty. Boeing said last week that it would cut 777 production to five a month in August 2017, a 40 percent reduction from the current rate of 8.3 a month, because of slow sales. The company did not say how many jobs it will cut next year, noting it is still assessing its 2017 budget and employment needs.  But the announcement shows the world's biggest plane maker is axing jobs more aggressively than it forecast earlier this year, and that it will not let up the pressure to cut costs under the new chief executive of the airplane unit, Kevin McAllister, who succeeded Ray Conner on Nov. 21. Conner is now vice chairman of Boeing Co. To successfully compete and win new orders that will fund future product development and growth requires us to achieve much better performance, Conner and McAllister said in a memo to Boeing Commercial Airplanes employees on Monday, which was made public. Boeing will need to do more in 2017 to lower costs and make its planes more affordable, the memo said. Its shares closed up 1.1 percent at $156.18. Boeing is contending with a strong dollar that makes its products more expensive overseas, a non-functioning U.S. Export-Import Bank that hampers aircraft financing, and President-elect Donald Trump's provocation of China, one of Boeing's biggest markets.  Trump has also targeted Boeing for criticism, saying the United States should cancel a pending order to buy modified Boeing 747s as new presidential aircraft, Air Force One, because the cost was too high.  A Boeing spokesman said plane sales are getting more competitive, requiring additional cost-cutting beyond what was envisioned in 2016. We've got to perform better, he said. It's an ongoing process. Boeing has booked just 468 net jetliner orders this year, down from 768 last year and 1,432 in 2014. The figure is also well below Boeing's target of having sales roughly match the 745 to 750 aircraft Boeing expects to deliver to customers this year. Boeing gets the majority of the payment on a plane when it is delivered.  The company also is under pressure to cut costs as it tries to hit Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg's goal of lifting its operating profit margins to the mid-teens by 2020. The figure has averaged 6.9 percent over the last decade. By comparison, Airbus' margins have averaged about 3.7 percent over the past 10 years. The company said last month it would cut about 900 jobs to restructure, reduce costs and prepare for tougher competition. For 2016, Boeing said it expects job reductions to total 8 percent of the commercial airplane workforce, including a 10 percent reduction in the ranks of executives and managers.  The unit cut 6,115 jobs, or 7.3 percent, through November compared with the tally on Dec. 31, 2015, according to Boeing's employment data. That suggests a further 565 job reductions in 2016, and more next year. In March, the company said it planned to cut about 4,000 jobs at the unit.     The company is offering a voluntary layoff program in early 2017, according to Monday's memo, which added that involuntary layoffs may occur in some cases. A spokesman said employees participating in the voluntary layoff program will receive a lump sum payment of one week's pay for each year served, for a maximum of 26 weeks.

Indonesia halted Freeport's copper concentrate exports in January under new rules requiring the Arizona-based company to adopt a special license, pay new taxes and royalties, divest a 51 percent stake in its operations and relinquish arbitration rights.  However, hopes of a resumption of exports from Freeport's Grasberg mine have improved since the end of March, when the mining minister said a temporary license would be granted while discussions on longer-term issues continued.     We have approval for exports and are working on finalizing an export permit, Freeport Indonesia spokesman Riza Pratama told Reuters on Tuesday. Mining ministry officials could not be reached for comment on the matter. An earlier recommendation for Freeport to export up to 1.1 million tonnes of concentrate would still apply, but the company still needs an export permit from the Trade Ministry, Director General of Coal and Minerals Bambang Gatot said at that time. The latest deal is expected to allow Freeport to export copper concentrate for six months, while working to reach agreement with the government on the other disputed issues. The stoppage has resulted in thousands of layoffs and cost both sides hundreds of millions of dollars. In February Freeport served notice, saying it has the right to commence arbitration in 120 days if no agreement is reached. Freeport's joint venture partner at Grasberg, Rio Tinto, has also warned several times it is considering whether to continue the partnership at the world's second-largest copper mine, given the uncertainties surrounding Freeport's negotiations over long-term mining rights in Indonesia.

The move comes after Beaudoin asked the board to reset his compensation as the rise in pay had become a distraction from the company's regular work. The Canadian plane and train maker has faced a backlash over its executives' pay rises, which come after Bombardier announced two rounds of layoffs in 2016 totaling 14,500 people over two years at sites around the world. Total compensation for the company's top five executives and board chairman rose to $32.7 million in 2016, up from $21.9 million a year earlier, according to a proxy circular published ahead of Bombardier's May 11 annual meeting. Bombardier, which has received more than $1 billion in federal and provincial government aid since 2015, awarded its top five executives and board chairman raises of up to 50 percent for 2016. The pay hikes sparked protests outside Bombardier's Montreal headquarters last week and calls by opposition leaders for a company freeze on executive compensation, with Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau criticizing the planned pay hikes for its senior executives. In addition, Chief Executive Alain Bellemare last week requested the board to defer the payment of more than half of the total planned 2016 compensation for its six named executive officers until 2020. The company also said the deferred compensation will only be payable if Bombardier achieves performance goals that position it for long term success.

CEO Richard Adkerson met with mining ministry officials in Jakarta to start talks over a range of disagreements including legal assurances over investments beyond 2021, tax rates, and a government requirement for Freeport to divest a 51 percent stake in its local operations. We have work to do, issues to discuss, but we're all going in this with goodwill and optimism about reaching a win-win situation, Adkerson told reporters after meeting with mining minister Ignasius Jonan and other officials from the central and Papua provincial government. For Freeport, the key issue is having assurance about our ability to operate, he added. Teguh Pamuji, secretary general at the mining ministry, said the negotiations would focus on fiscal certainty, taxes and royalties, divestments, and the development of smelters.     The dispute arose after Indonesia revised its mining rules in January, which brought Freeport’s copper concentrate exports to a halt and led to the company scaling back operations and temporarily laying off thousands of workers in the impoverished Papua province. To comply with the new rules, Freeport and other miners are required to convert their original contracts of work to a special contract. Freeport, which argues this requirement and others violate its existing contract, has threatened arbitration. But both sides have recently softened their tone, saying instead that arbitration is a last resort. So long as we're progressing to (a) ... mutually acceptable resolution, there would be no arbitration, Adkerson said.      Freeport was last month granted an export permit valid until February 2018, allowing it to resume export shipments until at least October 2017, pending further negotiations.

The Baltimore-based group said the layoffs were due to the closure of five offices, or a fifth of its U.S. total, that have resettled more than 25,000 refugees over the past four decades. Our staff at each of these locations have served diligently and sacrificially - some of them for many years - and we are deeply saddened to have to make this difficult decision, World Relief President Scott Arbeiter said in a statement on Wednesday. The shuttered offices are in Boise, Idaho; Columbus, Ohio; Miami, Florida; Nashville, Tennessee; and Glen Burnie, Maryland.  World Relief works with local churches to resettle people referred to it by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, according to its website. Trump last month put a four-month hold on allowing refugees into the United States, and indefinitely barred those from Syria. He also temporarily barred travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries, saying his order would help protect Americans from terrorist attacks. About half of Americans backed the ban, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll, but it triggered protests across the country and caused chaos at some U.S. and overseas airports. A Ninth Circuit appeals court panel has put the travel ban on hold, and legal challenges are going ahead in the appeals court and in federal court in Seattle.

Gatta, an investment professional who worked at various private equity firms like Basso Capital Management and Pegasus Capital Advisors, will replace current CEO Phil Rinaldi, who recently announced he was retiring in March. The transition comes as the 335,000 barrel-per-day refinery, the largest and oldest on the U.S. East Coast, is fighting to survive an industry downturn that has hit the region harder than other parts of the country. Rinaldi has been CEO of the privately held company since 2010, when The Carlyle Group (CG.O) and Sunoco formed a joint venture to rescue the nearly shuttered Philadelphia refinery. He quickly became the region's strongest advocate for energy expansion as the refinery turned profits off cheap crude flowing out of North Dakota. The boom turned to bust by the end of 2015, as the Bakken discount to the U.S. benchmark crude price disappeared, production dropped and more pipeline capacity came online.  The refinery has suffered several high-profile setbacks in the past two years, including a failed effort to take the company public, followed by layoffs and benefit cuts amid weak margins. Moody's and Standard & Poor's have recently downgraded the company's debt amid concerns about falling profits. Reporting By Jarrett Renshaw; Editing by Chris Reese"

Industry Minister Carlo Calenda has signed a decree backing the 1.8 billion euro ($2 billion) offer from the world's largest steelmaker and Marcegaglia for Europe's biggest steel plant by output capacity, the ministry said in a statement. Italy has been trying to sell Ilva, which is near the port city of Taranto, since 2015 when the state took full control of the plant in a bid to clean up the polluted site and save thousands of jobs in an economically depressed area. The commissioners running Ilva said last month the ArcelorMittal consortium had won the bidding but unions opposed the thousands of layoffs involved in its plan, and a rival consortium led by India's JSW Steel raised its offer. Under the plan of the ArcelorMittal consortium, called Am Investco Italy, Ilva's total workforce, which includes two smaller bases in northern Italy, will be cut from more than 14,000 to eventually reach 8,480 by 2024, the ministry said. Up to 4,100 of those to be laid off will be eligible for state unemployment support. Am Investco has said it was open to trying to reduce the number of job losses in the near term, the ministry said. Steel production will remain at 6 million tonnes a year during the clean-up of the site, which magistrates sequestered in 2012 amid allegations its emissions were causing abnormally high cancer rates. By 2024, Am Investco aims to have boosted output to the full 8 million tonnes Ilva is authorised to produce, the statement said, using three of Ilva's original five furnaces. The plan also includes a pledge to invest about 2.4 billion euros in technology and environmental improvements. The next step in the sale process involves the environment ministry examining Am Investco's plans for cleaning up the site.

President Mauricio Macri took office 15 months ago promising to jumpstart the economy by regaining the trust of investors after a decade of free-spending populism. Until last week, organized labor had signaled patience with his program aimed at cutting labor costs, interest rates and the fiscal deficit. Thousands of workers picketed on March 7 in protest of job cuts and wages that have not kept up with inflation, which was clocked at about 40 percent in 2016. Strikes by major labor groups have been threatened over the weeks ahead. One can suspect that this is linked to the fact that this is an election year, Frigerio told reporters. Labor issues, he said would be resolved through negotiation rather than strikes. We had a very tough first year of policymaking, and we felt we had the support of big labor organizations, he added. You have to ask yourself why they were with us during the toughest months and are now threatening strikes and marches. The one-day labor march last week attracted tens of thousands of demonstrators in Buenos Aires. It was the first demonstration by the CGT umbrella labor group this year and came amid a two-day teachers' strike that delayed the opening of school after the Southern Hemisphere summer holidays. Employers have been hard-pressed to raise pay packages in line with inflation while Macri's push to cut business costs has prompted layoffs in the public and private sectors. He needs his Cambiemos political coalition to do well in October's elections in order for him to keep pushing his economic reforms through Congress and position himself for re-election in 2019.

The move comes after Beaudoin asked the board to reset his compensation as the rise in pay had become a distraction from the company's regular work. The Canadian plane and train maker has faced a backlash over its executives' pay rises, which come after Bombardier announced two rounds of layoffs in 2016 totaling 14,500 people over two years at sites around the world. Total compensation for the company's top five executives and board chairman rose to $32.7 million in 2016, up from $21.9 million a year earlier, according to a proxy circular published ahead of Bombardier's May 11 annual meeting. Bombardier, which has received more than $1 billion in federal and provincial government aid since 2015, awarded its top five executives and board chairman raises of up to 50 percent for 2016. The pay hikes sparked protests outside Bombardier's Montreal headquarters last week and calls by opposition leaders for a company freeze on executive compensation, with Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau criticizing the planned pay hikes for its senior executives. In addition, Chief Executive Alain Bellemare last week requested the board to defer the payment of more than half of the total planned 2016 compensation for its six named executive officers until 2020.

Mine operator Freeport McMoRan's exports of copper concentrate from Grasberg, the world's richest copper mine, have been at a standstill since mid-January, when Indonesia introduced rules intended to improve revenues from its resources and create jobs. There is no doubt that Grasberg is a world-class resource. However, there's a difference between a world-class resource and a world-class business, Rio Tinto Chief Executive Jean-Sebastien Jacques said on Wednesday, responding to a shareholder at the company's annual general meeting in London. Depending what will happen in the coming months and years in terms of negotiations with the government, the extension beyond 2021, Rio will have to come to a conclusion whether we want to stay or not, Jacques said, adding discussions involving all parties would continue over the next six months. Rio Tinto has a joint-venture with Freeport-McMoRan Inc for the huge Grasberg copper and gold complex in remote Papua, with rights to 40 percent of production above specific levels until 2021 and 40 percent of all production after 2021. As pressure mounts on Indonesia to agree a compromise    U.S. Vice President Mike Pence will visit the country next week and Arnaud Soirat, head of Rio Tinto's copper and diamonds business, will visit shortly afterwards, Rio officials said.

In Washington state, the $43.7 billion two-year operating budget, which includes a $5.2 billion revenue increase paid for in part with new taxes, was approved by both chambers of the legislature earlier on Friday. Governor Jay Inslee, a Democrat, signed the spending bill before midnight, preventing the closure of many state agencies and the layoff of thousands of employees. He called the budget a transformational investment in the future of our state in a message on Twitter.  Apart from funding government operations, the budget adds about $1.8 billion in new funding for K-12 public schools over the next two years and promises $7.3 billion total over four years, according to a summary of the legislation.  It was not immediately clear whether the education funding increase would satisfy a 2012 order by the state's Supreme Court that found the state was failing to fully fund basic education in violation of its own constitution. The court gave lawmakers a deadline - the first day of school in 2018 - to lay out a credible plan to fix the problem.

Microsoft is hoping to carve a niche among customers who cannot or do not want to have to move all their computing operations to the massive shared data centers that are collectively known as the cloud.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-economy-idUSL1N1DW0O2","U.S. factory activity at five-month high, bottlenecks emerging","","December 1, 2016 /  1:36 PM / 8 months ago","","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. factory activity accelerated to a five-month high in November amid a pickup in new orders and production, suggesting that the manufacturing sector was regaining its footing after a prolonged slump. Thursday's report from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM), which also showed some bottlenecks in the supply chain that could drive prices higher, was the latest indication that the economy continued to gain momentum in the fourth quarter.  The ISM said its index of national factory activity rose 1.3 percentage points to a reading of 53.2 last month, the best since June. A reading above 50 indicates an expansion in manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy.  The factory sector has started to show some building momentum, strengthening the case for Federal Reserve action at the December policy meeting, said Kevin Cummins, senior economist at RBS in Stamford, Connecticut. Manufacturing is recovering as some of the drag from the dollar's past rally eases and oil prices continue to stabilize after last year's collapse. Gains in factory activity are, however, likely to be modest amid renewed dollar strength following the election of Donald Trump as the next president.  Since the Nov. 8 election, the dollar has surged more than 4 percent against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners as investors viewed the president-elect's proposed fiscal policy as inflationary.  But Trump's plan to increase infrastructure spending could offer some boost to manufacturing and benefit heavy machinery  makers such as Caterpillar (CAT.N), whose profit has been hurt by poor demand for construction equipment. Last month, the ISM production sub-index increased 1.4 percentage points and a gauge of new orders rose 0.9 percentage point. While a measure of factory employment fell last month, manufacturing payrolls remained above expansion territory. The ISM survey also showed bottlenecks starting to emerge, with a measure of supplier deliveries surging 3.5 percentage points last month to its highest reading since December 2014, indicating longer delivery delays. Manufacturers who participated in the ISM survey reported  increasing demand, some tightness in the labor market and plans to reduce inventory by the end of the year.   While we are gaining confidence that the manufacturing sector is starting to improve, the recent dollar appreciation may prove to be a headwind for the sector over time, said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan in New York.  People enter the Nassau County Mega Job Fair at Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Uniondale, New York October 7, 2014.Shannon StapletonThe dollar was trading lower against a basket of currencies on Thursday. Prices for U.S. government bonds also fell as did stocks on Wall Street. Claims Rise Though a second report on Thursday showed the number of Americans claiming unemployment benefits rising to a its highest level in five months last week, labor market strength remains intact, with layoffs falling 12 percent in November.  The Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 17,000 to a seasonally adjusted 268,000 for the week ended Nov. 26. That was the highest reading since June and marked the second straight week of increases.  Despite the increase, claims remained below the 300,000 threshold, which is associated with a healthy labor market, for the 91st straight week. That is the longest run since 1970, when the labor market was much smaller. Jobless claims, which hit a 43-year low in mid-November, tend to be volatile at this time of the year as the model the government uses to strip out seasonal fluctuations from the data does not fully account for changes in the timings of different holidays. The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, edged up 500 to 251,500 last week. The ongoing low level of claims should give the Fed comfort that labor markets continue to tighten. We view incoming claims data as very supportive of further improvement in labor market conditions this year, said Rob Martin, an economist at Barclays in New York.  Last week's claims data has no bearing on November's employment report, which is scheduled for release on Friday, as it falls outside the survey period.  New filings for jobless benefits fell between the October and November survey weeks, supporting expectations for another month of solid employment gains. According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls probably increased by 175,000 jobs last month after rising 161,000 in October. In a third report, global outplacement consultancy Challenger, Gray & Christmas said U.S.-based employers announced plans to lay off 26,936 workers last month, down from the 30,740 job cuts announced in October. Jobs cuts in November were concentrated in the retail sector, with 4,850 announced layoffs, most of which stemmed from the bankruptcy of American Apparel. The retail losses were, however, more than offset by a surge in holiday hiring.  Reporting By Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Andrea Ricci"

The loan, repayable over 10 years, will go to the government-run, industry-funded Orphan Well Association (OWA), which cleans up wells for which no party is legally responsible, Alberta Premier Rachel Notley said at a news conference.  The number of so-called orphan wells in Canada spiked after the 2014 oil price crash as layoffs swept the oil patch and companies went bankrupt. Alberta, which produces about 80 percent of Canada's crude, had more than 1,500 orphan wells in February, up from 26 in 2012. The loan is lower than the C$500 million an industry group  asked for in 2016. The OWA will double indefinitely its levies charged to all petroleum producers to a total of C$60 million a year, starting in 2019, Notley said. That, however, could be adjusted in the future based on how many orphan wells are left, said Brad Herald, OWA chairman and vice president of western Canadian operations for the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers industry lobby group.  Notley said part of the loan, C$30 million, comes from the federal government, which in this year's budget allocated C$30 million to Alberta to stimulate economic activity and employment in the resource sector. Cleaning up the wells will create 1,650 jobs over three years, she said. Reporting by Ethan Lou; Editing by Tom Brown"

The news is good for U.S. shale producers reeling from a two-year price slump that has forced millions of dollars of cuts in capital spending and caused the layoff of thousands of workers. A historic deal reached by OPEC at the end of last year to collectively curb global supplies has pushed oil prices  to trade near $55 a barrel this week. A year ago, oil was trading around $30 a barrel. In its monthly short-term energy forecast released on Tuesday, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said crude oil production this year is expected to rise by 110,000 bpd to 9 million barrels per day compared with a year ago. Last month, it said production would fall by 80,000 bpd. For 2018, oil production is set to rise by 300,000 bpd to 9.3 million bpd, the EIA added. The general decline in U.S. crude oil production that began almost two years ago is likely over, as higher average oil prices and improvements in drilling efficiency are giving a boost to output, EIA Administrator Adam Sieminski said in a statement.

Gatta, an investment professional who worked at various private equity firms like Basso Capital Management and Pegasus Capital Advisors, will replace current CEO Phil Rinaldi, who recently announced he was retiring in March. The transition comes as the 335,000 barrel-per-day refinery, the largest and oldest on the U.S. East Coast, is fighting to survive an industry downturn that has hit the region harder than other parts of the country. Rinaldi has been CEO of the privately held company since 2010, when The Carlyle Group (CG.O) and Sunoco formed a joint venture to rescue the nearly shuttered Philadelphia refinery. He quickly became the region's strongest advocate for energy expansion as the refinery turned profits off cheap crude flowing out of North Dakota. The boom turned to bust by the end of 2015, as the Bakken discount to the U.S. benchmark crude price disappeared, production dropped and more pipeline capacity came online.  The refinery has suffered several high-profile setbacks in the past two years, including a failed effort to take the company public, followed by layoffs and benefit cuts amid weak margins. Moody's and Standard & Poor's have recently downgraded the company's debt amid concerns about falling profits. Reporting By Jarrett Renshaw; Editing by Chris Reese"

President Mauricio Macri took office 15 months ago promising to jumpstart the economy by regaining the trust of investors after a decade of free-spending populism. Until last week, organized labor had signaled patience with his program aimed at cutting labor costs, interest rates and the fiscal deficit. Thousands of workers picketed on March 7 in protest of job cuts and wages that have not kept up with inflation, which was clocked at about 40 percent in 2016. Strikes by major labor groups have been threatened over the weeks ahead. One can suspect that this is linked to the fact that this is an election year, Frigerio told reporters. Labor issues, he said would be resolved through negotiation rather than strikes. We had a very tough first year of policymaking, and we felt we had the support of big labor organizations, he added. You have to ask yourself why they were with us during the toughest months and are now threatening strikes and marches. The one-day labor march last week attracted tens of thousands of demonstrators in Buenos Aires. It was the first demonstration by the CGT umbrella labor group this year and came amid a two-day teachers' strike that delayed the opening of school after the Southern Hemisphere summer holidays. Employers have been hard-pressed to raise pay packages in line with inflation while Macri's push to cut business costs has prompted layoffs in the public and private sectors. He needs his Cambiemos political coalition to do well in October's elections in order for him to keep pushing his economic reforms through Congress and position himself for re-election in 2019.

That could further strain the government-run, industry-funded Orphan Well Association (OWA), which cleans up wells for which no party is legally responsible. The group has said it needs extra funding and upping levies for producers is an option. Last year, a court in Canada's oil heartland of Alberta ruled that proceeds from the sale of assets belonging to privately held Redwater Energy Corp would go first to secured creditors, rather than toward cleaning up the company's inactive oil and gas wells. The OWA and its parent, the Alberta Energy Regulator (AER), had appealed that decision. Alberta's Court of Appeal on Monday ruled 2-1 against them, saying the previous decision contained no errors. The AER said in a statement it is disappointed at the decision and is studying it to determine whether to appeal further. The number of so-called orphan wells in Canada spiked after the 2014 oil price crash as layoffs swept the oil patch and companies went bankrupt. Alberta, which produces about 80 percent of Canada's crude, had more than 1,500 orphan wells in February, up from 26 in 2012. This year's federal budget allocated C$30 million to Alberta to stimulate economic activity and employment in the resource sector, which Premier Rachel Notley said would be used to clean up orphan wells.

CEO Richard Adkerson met with mining ministry officials in Jakarta to start talks over a range of disagreements including legal assurances over investments beyond 2021, tax rates, and a government requirement for Freeport to divest a 51 percent stake in its local operations. We have work to do, issues to discuss, but we're all going in this with goodwill and optimism about reaching a win-win situation, Adkerson told reporters after meeting with mining minister Ignasius Jonan and other officials from the central and Papua provincial government. For Freeport, the key issue is having assurance about our ability to operate, he added. Teguh Pamuji, secretary general at the mining ministry, said the negotiations would focus on fiscal certainty, taxes and royalties, divestments, and the development of smelters.     The dispute arose after Indonesia revised its mining rules in January, which brought Freeport’s copper concentrate exports to a halt and led to the company scaling back operations and temporarily laying off thousands of workers in the impoverished Papua province. To comply with the new rules, Freeport and other miners are required to convert their original contracts of work to a special contract. Freeport, which argues this requirement and others violate its existing contract, has threatened arbitration. But both sides have recently softened their tone, saying instead that arbitration is a last resort. So long as we're progressing to (a) ... mutually acceptable resolution, there would be no arbitration, Adkerson said.      Freeport was last month granted an export permit valid until February 2018, allowing it to resume export shipments until at least October 2017, pending further negotiations. The move came after U.S. Vice President Mike Pence visited the Southeast Asian nation.

The $43.7 billion operating budget, which includes a $5.2 billion revenue increase paid for in part with new taxes, was approved by both chambers of the legislature. Governor Jay Inslee, a Democrat, has already signaled he intends to sign the spending bill into law before midnight to prevent the closure of many state agencies and the layoff of thousands of employees. Apart from funding government operations, the budget adds about $1.8 billion in new funding for K-12 public schools over the next two years and promises $7.3 billion total over four years, according to a summary of the legislation. It was not immediately clear whether the education funding increase would satisfy a 2012 order by the state's Supreme Court that found the state was failing to fully fund basic education in violation of its own constitution. The court gave lawmakers a deadline - the first day of school in 2018 - to lay out a credible plan to fix the problem.

Malloy's plan proposed to increase employee pension contributions by 2 percent of pay from 2019 financial year and reduce the state's share of pension contributions by $400 million to $500 million per year. The proposal aims to redesign the health insurance plan and to increase the employee share of premiums by 1 percent a year for existing employees from 2020 to 2022, raising the average contribution to 15 percent. The framework will reopen the contract currently in effect through June 30, 2022. If adopted it could save the state up to $10 billion over the next decade. Malloy, a Democrat, also proposed to freeze wages until 2019, before a 3.5 percent wage increase a year in 2020 and 2021. The wage freeze could result in savings of $385.2 million in 2019. The governor said the plan would avoid the need for mass layoffs and provide the state greater flexibility.  This framework will surely create more affordable and more sustainable labor costs in a way that generates structural, long-term savings of over $20 billion over the course of the next two decades, Malloy said in a statement. Earlier this month, Fitch Ratings downgraded the state one notch to A-plus because of a dimming economic outlook and a lack of fiscal flexibility, making it the third-lowest-rated U.S. state on Fitch's roster. Connecticut is the wealthiest U.S. state on a per capita personal income basis and its economic growth has been unusually slow and uncertain during the current national economic expansion, Fitch said on May 12.

The state has a multibillion dollar deficit that must be sorted before July 1, the start of Alaska' new fiscal year, in order to avoid shuttering government offices and services. Last week, Alaska warned thousands of state workers about potential layoffs unless legislators can agree on a fix to the fiscal crisis. The legislature has been convening through a special session, but Walker described the negotiations as in a stalemate. On Monday, Walker proposed a compromise package that would reduce the state's deficit from at least $3.7 billion last year to a $300 million shortfall. I'm not wild about the compromise, said Walker, an independent, during a news conference on Tuesday. But we're running out of time. Since 2013, Alaska has struggled with substantial consecutive budget deficits, in part caused by the state's large reliance on oil revenues and the continued low prices of oil. The state has balanced its budget over the last few years by drawing $10 billion from its savings without adding new revenues. The state's budget has been slashed from $7.8 billion in 2013 to $4.3 billion proposed for 2018. I know some people say, 'We need to do some cuts.' We've been doing that, Walker said on Tuesday. We have done that significantly. Almost 2,300 state positions were eliminated in recent years, along with 70 state programs, and over 40 state facilities, such as prisons, youth detention, and motor vehicle sites, have been closed, Walker said.

Alberta's job vacancy rate increased to 2.3 percent from 2.2 percent in the second quarter of last year, Statistics Canada said. The number of job vacancies rose to 44,915 from 42,290. For Canada overall, the job vacancy rate held steady at 2.5 percent. Higher vacancy rates are generally considered a sign of an active job market. It's pretty consistent with some more stability that we've seen in the labor market in Alberta over the last six months or so, said Robert Kavcic, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets. It's another indicator ... that maybe the worst is behind the labor market in Alberta. Still, Alberta is not out of the woods yet with the vacancy rate well below the 3.1 percent that was seen in the third quarter a year ago. Oil-producing Alberta has been hit hard by the drop in crude prices, which put the province in a budgetary deficit and led to layoffs in the energy sector. With prices stabilizing, economists and policymakers believe the worst of the oil shock has been seen. Alberta's unemployment rate fell to 8.5 percent in December from 9.0 percent the month before, though that was still above the 6.9 percent national rate. The higher job vacancies in the third quarter were driven by more job openings in the other services category, which includes repair and maintenance, as well as in the manufacturing and construction sectors. The numbers are not seasonally adjusted.    (Reporting by Leah Schnurr; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)"

Labour leaders at Volkswagen (VW) earlier this month halted cooperation with management on issues including overtime work, efficiency gains and apprenticeships and accused executives of trying to squeeze greater savings than previously agreed. But the works council on Monday said the talks have led to early signs of how to overcome disagreement over how to implement the 'future pact' designed to raise profit at VW's core autos division, which accounts for almost half of revenue at Europe's largest automotive group. Related CoverageVW says it has fixed 470,000 cars in Britain affected by diesel scandalStaff representatives are in constructive talks with top management on the open questions regarding the future pact, a spokesman for the works council said by email. Workers at VW's main plant in Wolfsburg employing about 60,000 people can expect more information at a staff gathering on Tuesday, he said, without being more specific. A company spokesman confirmed both sides were in constructive discussions as agreed under the future pact. Unions last week said VW brand chief executive Herbert Diess, who established a reputation for cutting costs at BMW (BMWG.DE), sought to cut temporary workers more quickly and deeply than agreed in November. VW is having to trim high-cost operations in Germany to fund a strategic shift and shed costs after its diesel emissions scandal, which is costing it billions of dollars in settlements. The 'future pact' targets 3.7 billion euros ($3.9 billion) in annual savings by 2020 and foresees 30,000 job cuts at the VW brand without forcing layoffs until 2025.

The loan, repayable over 10 years, will go to the government-run, industry-funded Orphan Well Association (OWA), which cleans up wells for which no party is legally responsible, Alberta Premier Rachel Notley said at a news conference.  The number of so-called orphan wells in Canada spiked after the 2014 oil price crash as layoffs swept the oil patch and companies went bankrupt. Alberta, which produces about 80 percent of Canada's crude, had more than 1,500 orphan wells in February, up from 26 in 2012. The loan is lower than the C$500 million an industry group  asked for in 2016. The OWA will double indefinitely its levies charged to all petroleum producers to a total of C$60 million a year, starting in 2019, Notley said. That, however, could be adjusted in the future based on how many orphan wells are left, said Brad Herald, OWA chairman and vice president of western Canadian operations for the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers industry lobby group.  Notley said part of the loan, C$30 million, comes from the federal government, which in this year's budget allocated C$30 million to Alberta to stimulate economic activity and employment in the resource sector.

Shares in the unit of Barrick Gold rose 4.7 percent after the company stuck to its full-year production guidance despite the ban. Acacia is losing $15 million per month after Tanzania banned the export of all unprocessed ore in March, forcing the company to make contingency plans in case a resolution is not found. Chief Executive Brad Gordon told a conference call on Friday it would cost $30 million to shut Bulyanhulu mine for layoffs and breaking contracts and between $2-$3 million per month in care and maintenance charges. Tanzanian President John Magufuli fired his mining minister and the chief of the state-run mineral audit agency last week after an investigation into possible undeclared exports by mining companies, including Acacia, to evade tax. A second audit of Acacia is now under way after the first audit committee last week said it found Acacia had 10 times more gold in its containers than the company had declared, as well as undeclared minerals such as iron and sulphur. Acacia has denied any wrongdoing and said it still has not seen the report. If we get to a point following the release of the second report where we see an impasse in dialogue with the government then we would put Bulyanhulu on care and maintenance, Gordon said, adding that the burn on cash could also be a trigger. The ban mainly affects the Bulyanhulu mine which is a larger, newer mine that has higher running costs. Buzwagi mine is nearing the end of its life. It said production for the year would still fall between 850,000-900,000 ounces. Acacia, which is also listed in Tanzania, said its cash at the end of May was $165 million.

Although Bank of America is also hiring, the employees that it is trying to reduce cost more than those who are joining, Moynihan said at a conference last month. The bank has also been cutting costs by shuttering data centers and moving information to less costly systems run by technology firms. For any large bank, technology and operations costs run high. Old systems are reliable but dated, while new ones are expensive to develop. Separately, at a conference on Wednesday, Chief Operating Officer Tom Montag said the global banking and markets unit has roughly 1,300 applications that cost about $1.3 billion to maintain and run.

Malloy's plan proposed to increase employee pension contributions by 2 percent of pay from 2019 financial year and reduce the state's share of pension contributions by $400 million to $500 million per year. The proposal aims to redesign the health insurance plan and to increase the employee share of premiums by 1 percent a year for existing employees from 2020 to 2022, raising the average contribution to 15 percent. The framework will reopen the contract currently in effect through June 30, 2022. If adopted it could save the state up to $10 billion over the next decade. Malloy, a Democrat, also proposed to freeze wages until 2019, before a 3.5 percent wage increase a year in 2020 and 2021. The wage freeze could result in savings of $385.2 million in 2019. The governor said the plan would avoid the need for mass layoffs and provide the state greater flexibility.  This framework will surely create more affordable and more sustainable labor costs in a way that generates structural, long-term savings of over $20 billion over the course of the next two decades, Malloy said in a statement. Earlier this month, Fitch Ratings downgraded the state one notch to A-plus because of a dimming economic outlook and a lack of fiscal flexibility, making it the third-lowest-rated U.S. state on Fitch's roster. Connecticut is the wealthiest U.S. state on a per capita personal income basis and its economic growth has been unusually slow and uncertain during the current national economic expansion, Fitch said on May 12. It said the state is expecting weak job growth in coming years.

For CBS, the BBC deal replaces a previous arrangement it had with Sky, which is being acquired by 21st Century Fox, pending regulatory approval. For BBC News, CBS replaces a deal it had with Walt Disney Co's (DIS.N) ABC. The partnership will enable both news organizations to strengthen coverage of complex international situations such as the crisis in Syria and Iraq, said David Rhodes, president of CBS News.  The deal also gives BBC more resources to cover the United States, particularly the Donald Trump presidency, in which there was a lot of international interest, he said. Jonathan Munro, head of newsgathering at BBC News, said his organization began working with CBS more closely during the U.S. Presidential campaign as it became clear they could offer unrivalled logistical support to our teams in the field. In an e-mailed statement, Munro said: We will also benefit from their focus on original journalism, their significant radio and digital operations and their extensive affiliate network which covers every state in the Union. There will be no layoffs at either organization as a result of the agreement, according to Rhodes and a representative at BBC News. The two organizations will begin sharing content immediately and additional newsgathering components will be added in the coming months, CBS News said.

The escalating labor issue comes as Freeport, the world's largest publicly traded copper miner, is snarled in a lengthy and costly dispute with Indonesia's government over rights to the Grasberg copper and gold mine. Freeport resumed copper concentrate exports from Grasberg, the world's second-largest copper mine, in April after a 15-week outage related to that row, but a permanent solution is yet to be found. Copper prices CMCU3 hit a 4-1/2 month peak on Friday, fueled by strong growth in top consumer China, a weak dollar and worries about supply disruptions. Freeport is pushing back against revised government rules that require miners to pay new taxes and royalties, divest a 51-percent stake and relinquish arbitration rights. The Arizona-based miner wants an 'investment stability agreement' that replicates the legal and fiscal rights under its existing agreement. Freeport Indonesia union industrial relations officer Tri Puspital told Reuters on Friday that the strike was extended because there is still no solution for worker concerns.  The strike began in May after Freeport laid off some 10 percent of its workforce to cut costs. In May, Freeport said that mining and milling rates at Grasberg were affected by the strike, and investors will look for more information when the company reports second-quarter financial results July 25.  Indonesia said last week it would invite Freeport chief executive Richard Adkerson to Jakarta this month to try to settle a dispute, but a company spokesman would not confirm whether he would attend.

The vote, which is subject to approval by the U.S. National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), would take place on Aug. 3 and 4 at Nissan's Canton, Mississippi, plant, involving at least 4,000 production and skilled trade workers. In a release announcing the agreement, the UAW said that in the days after the union filed a July 11 petition with the NLRB, Nissan employees have reported widespread pressure by company supervisors in one-on-one meetings and in videos broadcast inside the Canton plant. UAW Secretary-Treasurer Gary Casteel said in the statement that Nissan is running one of the most aggressive anti-worker campaigns that we’ve seen in modern U.S. history. Nissan said in its own statement that it does not believe UAW representation is is in the best interest of the plant and its workers. Our success has been built upon the direct relationship we have with employees, said Rodney Francis, human resources director at Nissan's Canton plant. Given the UAW’s history of strikes, layoffs and plant closures, it is clear that their presence could be harmful. Francis added that Nissan technicians enjoy pay and benefits that are among the best in Mississippi. The UAW's representation is largely focused in northern U.S. states. The last major vote on union representation in the South was at Volkswagen AG's (VOWG_p.DE) plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee, in 2014.  That vote failed, but the union was able to get a toehold in the plant in late 2015 when around 165 skilled trades workers voted to become the first members of UAW Local 42.  But that toehold is tenuous, as the German automaker has refused to acknowledge the result, arguing against allowing a small group within the plant to have union representation and saying that all 1,500 hourly workers should be treated as one unit.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-autos-workers-analysis-idUSKBN19C2R2","For thousands of U.S. auto workers, downturn is already here","","June 21, 2017 /  7:46 PM / a month ago",""," LORDSTOWN, Ohio (Reuters) - Wall Street is fretting that the U.S. auto industry is heading for a downturn, but for thousands of workers at General Motors Co factories in the United States, the hard times are already here.  Matt Streb, 36, was one of 1,200 workers laid off on Jan. 20 - inauguration day for Republican U.S. President Donald Trump - when GM canceled the third shift at its Lordstown small-car factory here. Sales of the Chevrolet Cruze sedan, the only vehicle the plant makes, have nosedived as U.S. consumers switch to SUVs and pickup trucks.  Streb is looking for another job, but employers are wary because they assume he will quit whenever GM calls him back.  I get it, said Streb, who has a degree in communications, but it's frustrating.  Layoffs at Lordstown and other auto plants point to a broader challenge for the economy in Midwestern manufacturing states and for the Trump administration.  The U.S. auto industry's boom from 2010 through last year was a major driver for manufacturing job creation. The fading of that boom threatens prospects for U.S. industrial output and job creation that were central to President Trump's victory in Ohio and other manufacturing states.    Infographic ID: '2smL7NQ'     This is about economics, not what Trump says, said Robert Morales, president of United Auto Workers (UAW) union Local 1714, which represents workers at GM's stamping plant at Lordstown. Even if Trump went out and bought 10,000 Cruzes a month, he wouldn't get the third shift back here.  Last week the Federal Reserve said U.S. factory output fell 0.4 percent in May, the second decline in three months, due partly to a 2-percent drop in motor vehicles and parts production.  Mark Muro, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, has compiled data from government sources that show the auto industry punching higher than its weight in job creation in recent years - accounting for between 60 percent and 80 percent of all U.S. manufacturing jobs added in 2015 and 2016.  In the first quarter of this year, the auto industry accounted for less than 2 percent of the 45,000 manufacturing jobs created.  There's no argument with the idea that auto has been pulling the manufacturing sled up the mountain for the last three or four years, Muro said. If you take auto out, you’re left with a very tepid outlook indeed.  Long-term auto layoffs could threaten the economies of communities and states directly affected, although after decades of boom and bust, many communities in the auto manufacturing heartland have diversified.  In Ohio's Mahoning Valley, which was battered by the collapse of the once-dominant steel industry, the boom in drilling for shale gas helps offset job cuts at auto plants.  Lordstown Mayor Arno Hill says the town salted away money during the boom to pay down its debts and new businesses are coming in, including a $900-million power plant being built in town that will burn cheap natural gas produced in the region.  GM makes up 40 percent of tax receipts versus 85 percent in the early 1990s, he said.  GM is still the brightest star in the Mahoning Valley, but luckily we have diversified our economy, Hill said. There is pain for the laid-off workers, but it won't hurt us as bad it used to.  Lordstown's workers have taken steps to blunt the impact of layoffs, with help from GM.  FILE PHOTO: A general view of the outside of the General Motors Chevrolet Cruze car assembly complex in Lordstown, Ohio July 22, 2011.Aaron Josefczyk/File PhotoMatt Streb's wife is due to start work soon after getting a degree, while he hopes to return to a former job as a mailman. In the meantime, GM gave advance notice of job cuts so he saved extra money and has drastically cut his spending.  The auto industry is cyclical and has always had its ups and downs, Streb said. This is just another Lordstown downturn.    Infographic ID: '2siZUJk'     Stalling Sedan Sales  The decline in U.S. auto sales is still minor compared to the dramatic collapse during the 2007-2009 financial crisis, when demand for new vehicles plunged to its lowest levels in decades.  However, the days when auto assembly and parts plants throughout the Midwest were running flat-out because of high demand for nearly every type of vehicle are over. Recent sales trends show consumers becoming more selective, shunning older models and especially smaller cars.  For much of the boom that ran from 2010 through to a record year in 2016 of 17.55 million new vehicles sold, the share of cars has declined versus light trucks - or pickup trucks, SUVs and crossovers.  After peaking at 51.32 percent of all sales in 2012, passenger cars fell to 40.4 percent of sales in 2016. That decline equates to the output of seven or eight vehicle assembly plants.  Through the first five months of this year, sedan sales fell 11 percent, even as the light truck category rose 4.7 percent.  To avoid profit-sapping discounts, and reverse a decline in prices of used vehicles, automakers are ordering more and deeper production cuts.  GM has laid off more than 5,000 workers so far this year - including 1,000 at its Fairfax plant in Kansas that makes the Chevrolet Malibu midsize sedan. GM has also laid off 1,100 workers at a plant in Lansing because it has ended production of the GMC Acadia SUV there.  More GM workers will be hit with temporary layoffs this summer. Lordstown will shut up shop for five weeks this summer, much longer than the usual two-week summer vacation closure.  Many laid-off GM workers are finding temporary employment at other facilities or taking permanent transfers to plants like its Arlington, Texas, facility where production of large sport utility vehicles continues unabated. However, those temporary postings require workers to relocate hundreds of miles from home.  Randy Freeman, president of UAW Local 652 which represents workers at GM's Grand River plant in Lansing, Michigan, which makes sedans, says he has been pleased by GM's efforts to rehire workers and relations with the automaker are on an upward swing.  The threats to U.S. workers building sedans are not likely to ease, barring a spike in the price of gasoline. Ford Motor Co signaled its long-term pessimism about small-car demand in the United States by announcing plans on Tuesday to shift production of its Focus compact car model to China. The Michigan plant that builds the Focus currently is expected to switch to building trucks and SUVs in 2018.  At GM's Lordstown and Lansing Grand River plants, UAW representatives say they are focused on improving quality in the hope that GM will pick their plant when it's time to find a location for producing a new truck or SUV.  At Lordstown, for instance, union officials tout the fact the plant has just won a quality award for local innovation on a part that helps the Cruz run better.  We're working hard to make the best product we can, said Glenn Johnson, president of UAW Local 1112 at Lordstown, so we can raise our hands and say to GM 'look at what we can do.

Singapore's trade-reliant economy has faced headwinds over the past two years from sluggish global growth, a slowdown in China and falls in global oil prices, which have all weighed on the city-state's marine and offshore engineering industry. We expect growth this year to be one plus percent, still positive though less than we had hoped for, Lee said in a pre-recorded New Year message to the nation. The government had previously forecast that the city-state's economy would grow by 1.0 to 1.5 percent in 2016, which puts the economy on track for its weakest performance since 2009, when gross domestic product (GDP) contracted 0.6 percent. While the labor market has eased, unemployment remains low and we are still creating new jobs. I know many employers and workers are concerned, but rest assured the government is watching this closely, Lee said. The government's Committee on the Future Economy will unveil its recommendations on longer term strategies for growth in a few weeks' time, he added.  Layoffs in Singapore in the first half of 2016 reached 9,510, the highest since 2009. The unemployment rate was 2.1 percent in the third quarter. The government is due to release its advance estimates for GDP in the fourth quarter and the whole of 2016 on Jan. 3.

A first meeting to discuss the proposed layoffs, which would be carried out through early retirements and cutting working days, is scheduled for Monday with three more due to take place before Christmas, one of the sources said. Popolare di Vicenza Chairman Gianni Mion said in October the bank would need to cut between 1,300 and 1,500 jobs, out of a total workforce of 5,400 employees as of mid-2016. Popolare di Vicenza and nearby Veneto Banca, a local rival     which was also rescued by Atlante earlier this year after failing to list, are seen as weak links in Italy's battered banking system which is struggling under a pile of bad loans left behind by a deep recession. Like other large popolari banks, Popolare di Vicenza has been forced to shed its cooperative status following a government reform in 2015 aimed at improving governance and paving the way for potential mergers. The bank's 119,000 shareholders, mostly retail clients, saw their savings wiped out as Popolare Vicenza wrote down the value of its shares by nearly 100 percent when it became a joint-stock company and attempted to list. Atlante has said Popolare di Vicenza and Veneto Banca have unsustainable costs, which eat up virtually all their income, and has told them to examine a possible tie-up and present a plan by year end to ensure their survival.

And that can't happen. He's going to have to take BP a few days consecutively and look good. Then we'll start talking about doing something live.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/indonesia-freeport-idUSL3N1HK3BY","Indonesia eyes truce with Freeport as losses mount for both sides","","April 12, 2017 /  8:59 AM / in 3 months","","JAKARTA (Reuters) - Losses amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars appear to be pushing the Indonesian government and mining giant Freeport McMoRan to resolve a row that has crippled operations at Grasberg, the world's richest copper mine, for three months. Freeport says it has lost revenue of about $1 billion since the export of copper concentrate from Grasberg was halted on Jan. 12 under new rules issued by the government. The government has lost millions of dollars in royalties and is worried about layoffs and a slowing economy in the restive Papua region, where the giant mine is located. There's a lot of grandstanding in public – that, with our economy being close to a $1 trillion a year now, Freeport is a small matter, said a senior Indonesian government official, who estimated the lost royalties and taxes from the mine at about $1 billion a year.  But truth be told, a $1 billion a year reduction in fiscal revenue is a lot, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Indonesia halted Freeport's copper concentrate exports under new rules that require the Phoenix, Arizona-based company to adopt a special license, pay new taxes and royalties, divest a 51 percent stake in its operations and relinquish arbitration rights. Freeport threatened in February to take the dispute to arbitration, saying the rules were in effect a form of expropriation. But now, Indonesia has promised to allow Freeport to export its copper concentrate once again, while negotiations continue over the next six months on contentious issues, including on divestment, economic and legal protection and smelting investment. The compromise comes ahead of a visit to Indonesia by U.S. Vice President Mike Pence next week. Pressure to resolve the row could also come from Freeport's third-biggest shareholder, activist investor Carl Icahn, who has been appointed a special adviser to President Donald Trump. For Indonesia, tensions at Grasberg could hamper its efforts to calm the Papua region, where a low-level insurgency has simmered for decades. The mine's social and environmental footprint also remains a source of friction. Papua's GDP growth is expected to drop to 3 percent this year due to the Freeport dispute, down from 9.21 percent in 2016, according to the Papua branch of Indonesia's central bank. A slump in Papua's economy could aggravate tensions with Jakarta, complicating efforts by President Joko Widodo to enforce policies to extract more from its natural resources. When there is a crisis at Freeport, it will send major ripples through Papuan society, said Achmad Sukarsono, an Indonesian expert at the Eurasia consultancy.

Rato, who was economy minister in Spain and a prominent figure in the ruling People's Party (PP) before moving to the IMF, chaired Bankia for two years until just before its state bailout in 2012.      He had been on trial along with 64 other executives and former board members of Bankia and its founding savings bank Caja Madrid. The case is one of several high-level corruption investigations now coming to fruition and seen as a test of whether Spain's rich and powerful are accountable to the law. Last week, a Spanish court found the king's brother-in-law guilty of using royal connections to overcharge regional governments through public contracts. Rato and ex-Caja Madrid Chairman Miguel Blesa, who was sentenced to six years in jail, were convicted of misappropriating funds, the court said in a written ruling.   Rato had denied any wrongdoing, arguing the expenses he accrued on the Bankia credit cards were legal. Neither Blesa's lawyer, Carlos Aguilar, nor Ratos' lawyer, Ignacio Ayala, responded to requests for comment. The so-called black cards case sparked widespread anger when the scandal first broke in 2014, at a time when Spain was recovering from years of recession, mass layoffs and a banking crisis partly triggered by Bankia's massive bailout. The court considered in its ruling both Rato and Blesa responsible for overseeing the misuse of credit cards and said that they could have reversed the practice. The defendants Miguel Blesa (...) and Rodrigo de Rato Figaredo were aware of the decision they made to allow business cards to circulate (...) with no legal and statutory support, based, as they said, on a principle of trust, which was not the case, the court said in its ruling. The cards were used to buy jewels, holidays and expensive clothes, according to documents filed with the court, but also to fund more mundane purchases such as trips to the cinema. Before chairing the Washington-based IMF between 2004 and 2007, Rato was deputy prime minister in the conservative PP's government in 1996. In total, prosecutors were investigating some 12 million euros in spending on the cards between 2003 and 2012 by the 65 former Bankia executives, including Rato and Blesa. The court ruling can be appealed before Spain's Supreme Court. Reporting by Inmaculada Sanz and Rodrigo de Miguel; Writing by Sarah White and Jesus Aguado; Editing by Catherine Evans"

Industry Minister Carlo Calenda has signed a decree backing the 1.8 billion euro ($2 billion) offer from the world's largest steelmaker and Marcegaglia for Europe's biggest steel plant by output capacity, the ministry said in a statement.  Italy has been trying to sell Ilva, which is near the port city of Taranto, since 2015 when the state took full control of the plant in a bid to clean up the polluted site and save thousands of jobs in an economically depressed area. The commissioners running Ilva said last month the ArcelorMittal consortium had won the bidding but unions opposed the thousands of layoffs involved in its plan. A rival consortium led by India's JSW Steel raised its offer. Under the plan presented by the ArcelorMittal consortium, called Am Investco Italy, Ilva's total workforce, which includes two smaller bases in northern Italy, will be cut from more than 14,000 to eventually reach 8,480 by 2024, the ministry said. Up to 4,100 of those to be laid off will be eligible for state unemployment support. Am Investco has said it was open to trying to reduce the number of job losses in the near term, the ministry said. The next step in the sale process involves the environment ministry examining Am Investco's plans for cleaning up the site. Once the ministry issues its decree, expected during autumn this year, the deal must be approved by the European Union. Steel production will remain at 6 million tonnes a year during the clean-up of the site, which magistrates sequestered in 2012 amid allegations its emissions were causing abnormally high cancer rates. ArcelorMittal chief executive Lakshmi Mittal said in a statement that the company will work with all interested parties to guarantee Ilva, its workers and the regions where it operates a better, more stable and sustainable future. By 2024, Am Investco aims to have boosted output to the full 8 million tonnes Ilva is authorised to produce, the statement said, using three of Ilva's original five furnaces. The plan also includes a pledge to invest about 2.4 billion euros in technology and environmental improvements.     Reporting by Isla Binnie; editing by David Clarke and Grant McCool"

In beating Czech Tomas Berdych in straight sets, the Swiss became the first man to reach 11 finals at the All England Club - making the contention that, after knee surgery and a six-month layoff, he is back to his best at 35 more compelling than ever. It was a long way back in some ways. Last year was so difficult. Just to stay calm and speak to the team, to take another decision that we were going to sit out and wait, Federer told the BBC after his 7-6(4) 7-6(4) 6-4 win. January's Australian Open marked his competitive comeback and he won it, besting great rival Rafa Nadal in five sets in a final for the ages. Since then Federer has only lost twice. I'm so happy I did (the break) because my life continues after tennis too. And that's at this point almost more important than playing itself, Federer said. I want to be a good dad and a good husband and a guy who can do sports later on too, so I think giving your body a rest from time to time is a good thing, as we see now.  After another dose of R&R; in missing the claycourt season to better prepare for his favorite tournament, he has yet to drop a set this fortnight. Croatia's Marin Cilic stands between him and a record eighth Wimbledon title, an outcome Federer was at pains not to take for granted. Last year we had a brutal quarter-final. I was down two sets to love and match points down, he said. At some stage things were extremely complicated and I had to get really, really lucky to win. Whether that might set a precedent for Sunday is another matter for the spectacularly rejuvenated Federer. In 2016, the Swiss lost in the Wimbledon semi-finals to Milos Raonic. This year he gained revenge over the Canadian in the quarters for the loss of just 12 games. Reporting by John Stonestreet, editing by Ed Osmond"
"https://www.reuters.com/article/illinois-budget-idUSL1N1FF148","Illinois governor cheers on effort to end budget impasse","","January 25, 2017 /  9:34 PM / 6 months ago","","CHICAGO (Reuters) - Illinois’ governor on Wednesday offered encouragement for a bipartisan bid to end the state’s record-setting budget stalemate, as Chicago’s mayor needled the chief executive for failing to deliver results.  Governor Bruce Rauner used his third State of the State address to nudge along efforts in the Senate to pass a behemoth budget omnibus that would include some of the nonbudgetary items he has sought unsuccessfully. Please don’t give up, he said. Please keep working. Please keep trying. The people of Illinois need you to succeed.” He did not indicate whether he will support the 13-bill package, which includes some of the so-called reforms he has been advocating. Since taking office in 2015, Rauner has feuded with the Democratic-led state legislature, leaving the nation's fifth-largest state without a full-year operating budget. No other state has gone 19 months, as Illinois has, without passing a budget. The impasse has put the state’s public universities and human services on a starvation diet that has caused declining college enrollment and program cuts and layoffs. “We are failing to be compassionate because we are failing to be competitive,” Rauner said in his speech to the legislature. At a news conference in Chicago, Mayor Rahm Emanuel took Rauner to task for the budget impasse, noting Illinois' huge unpaid bill pile has tripled and college students have been hurt under the governor's tenure. He is a (Republican) governor with a Democratic legislature. Maryland and Massachusetts have overwhelming Democratic bodies with Republican governors and they have done a budget on time all the time, Emanuel said.  Rauner has sought to insert items like legislative term limits, collective bargaining curbs and redistricting changes, which most Democrats oppose, as conditions for a budget. Last week, Democratic Senate President John Cullerton and Senate Republican Leader Christine Radogno had predicted votes on the package would begin Wednesday. But the plan appeared to hit legislative snags, driven in part by uncertainty over whether Rauner’s chief Democratic nemesis, House Speaker Michael Madigan, would kill the initiative in his chamber.  The speaker on Wednesday insisted on coming up with a  budget free of measures that would hurt middle-class families. Under my direction, the House will begin a thorough vetting process of proposals that will enable us to create jobs while also lifting up and helping the middle class and struggling families around our state,” Madigan said in a statement.

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits declined 5,000 to a seasonally adjusted 249,000 for the week ended Oct. 1, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast first-time applications for jobless benefits rising to 257,000 in the latest week. First-time claims were the lowest since April, when initial applications for aid were at levels not seen since November 1973. U.S. futures slightly trimmed losses following the release of the data, while the dollar held gains against a basket of currencies. Treasury debt yields were slightly higher. The four-week moving average of new claims, seen as a better measure of labor market trends as it smoothes out volatility, fell 2,500 to 253,500 last week, the lowest level since December 1973. It's the 83rd consecutive week claims have remained below 300,000, which is seen as indicative of a strong labor market. People wait in line to enter the Nassau County Mega Job Fair at Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Uniondale, New York October 7, 2014.Shannon Stapleton/File PhotoThe robust reading comes a day before the release of the closely watched September jobs report, although it has no direct bearing on that release as it falls outside the survey period for payrolls. Economists polled by Reuters forecast nonfarm payrolls increasing by 175,000. The unemployment rate is seen holding steady at 4.9 percent. Jobs growth has been slowing but is still well above the threshold needed to absorb new entrants into the labor market.  A report by global outplacement consultancy Challenger, Gray & Christmas on Thursday showed layoffs rose in September from a month earlier but were down from a year ago. Employers announced plans to shed 44,324 workers from payrolls in September, 38 percent more than in August but 25 percent fewer than in September 2015. Despite the September increase, the third quarter saw an overall decline in planned layoffs. The U.S. Federal Reserve has said it is inclined to raise rates by the end of the year should the labor market and inflation continue to strengthen. Thursday's claims report also showed continuing claims, which tallies how many people are still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid, fell 6,000 to 2.058 million in the week ended Sept. 24.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/india-economy-consumers-idUSL3N1IW1MC","Indian economy rides on consumer spending revival ahead of GST launch","","May 30, 2017 /  8:59 AM / 2 months ago","","GURUGRAM, India (Reuters) - Kaveri Shukla and her fiance are on a shopping spree ahead of their wedding next month. In just one week, the couple has bought home appliances ranging from a rice cooker to a refrigerator and is purchasing a new car. Marriage is a kind of big spending commitment, said the 28-year-old financial consultant while shopping at an upscale mall in Gurugram, a satellite city and business hub near Delhi. It is an excuse to spend, not defer your purchases. Shukla is not alone. Millions like her are thronging shopping malls and stores in India, thanks to a busy wedding season. A heatwave is also boosting demand for air conditioners and refrigerators. It's a welcome change for an economy where consumer spending, traditionally a driver of growth, took a blow after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's shock decision last November to scrap high-value bank notes. The prospect of another big reform - the launch of a multi-rate Goods and Services Tax (GST) from July 1 - could also be bringing forward spending into the current quarter as shoppers look to avoid rates of 28 percent, or higher, on some consumer durables and luxury items.  The impact of the new tax regime is not clear -- some items are expected to be cheaper -- but the prospect of a price rise is seen pushing some people to buy ahead of July. The risk is spending falls away after the tax is launched. GST is a big unknown, said Kumar Rajagopalan, head of the Retailers Association of India. But it could turn out to be a big fillip in the short run. Other headwinds loom: Layoffs in the information-technology sector are unsettling some households at a time when the economy is still not generating enough new jobs for workforce that is growing by around a million people a month. High Frequency Economists polled by Reuters expect Asia's third-largest economy to expand by 7.1 percent on year in the January-March quarter, just up from 7.0 percent in the prior quarter and ahead of China's 6.9 percent growth rate. Some even expect a growth print as high as 7.8 percent when the GDP figures come out on Wednesday. India doesn't publish national figures on retail sales. But high-frequency indicators such as car sales, retail lending and goods imports show consumer spending has roared back to life. New passenger car sales grew at their fastest annual pace in at least 16 months in April. Imports of consumer goods last month surged by nearly a half from a year ago. Credit card loans growth is at its highest in at least 15 months.  Quarterly earnings of consumer goods makers from Hindustan Unilever (HLL.NS) to auto maker Maruti MRTI.N have also been upbeat. The consumer rebound backs the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) prediction of a V-shaped recovery from the cash clampdown, whereas many in the private sector had expected a longer slump. With a good monsoon and government pay hikes in prospect, the outlook for a sustained recovery looks good. And as consumer spending powers more than half of India's economic growth, the recovery has bolstered the prospects of stronger growth. We hope these drivers will spread the recovery far and wide, said Kamal Nandi, business head of appliances at Godrej consumer products (GOCP.NS).  Radhika Rao, an economist with DBS Bank in Singapore, reckons spending has recovered to near pre-demonetisation levels. It should get a leg up from the GST, she says, as the measure will reduce taxes on food and other essential items. Cost savings on non-discretionary items post-GST will boost discretionary spending, she said. An upward revision in GDP estimates might be warranted after Wednesday's data.

The signs of renewed vigor in the economy and labor market tightness could encourage the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates later this month. The economy is moving forward at an acceptable pace and the Fed is likely to hike rates in June, but there is a cloud over the path of rates later on this year, said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its index of national factory activity ticked up to a reading of 54.9 last month from 54.8 in April. The index hit a 2-1/2-year high of 57.7 in February amid optimism over President Donald Trump's pro-business policy proposals. It had declined for two consecutive months as concerns mounted in the business community that political scandals could derail the Trump administration's economic agenda, including its push to cut corporate and individual taxes.  A reading above 50 in the ISM index indicates an expansion in manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy. The manufacturing recovery remains underpinned by the energy sector as steady increases in crude oil prices boost drilling activity, fueling demand for machinery. The ISM survey's new orders sub-index increased to 59.5 last month from 57.5 in April. A measure of factory employment jumped to a reading of 53.5 from 52.0 in April. Manufacturers of food and fabricated metals products reported difficulties finding qualified workers. Related CoverageU.S. construction spending posts biggest drop in a yearU.S. companies add 253,000 jobs in May: ADPManufacturers continued to steadily increase inventories and still viewed their customers' stocks as too low, according to the survey. While raw materials prices rose for a 15th straight month, the pace of increase slowed sharply in May. The upbeat economic data helped lift U.S. stocks, with each of the major indexes hitting record highs. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury debt prices fell slightly. The ADP National Employment Report showed private payrolls increased by 253,000 jobs last month, beating economists' expectations for a gain of 185,000 jobs. Private payrolls rose by 174,000 jobs in April. The ADP report is jointly developed with Moody's Analytics and was released ahead of the Labor Department's more comprehensive nonfarm payrolls report on Friday, which includes both public and private-sector employment. A job seeker fills out an application at the King Soopers grocery store table at a job fair at the Denver Workforce Center in Denver, Colorado, U.S. February 15, 2017.Rick WilkingThe ADP report, however, is not a good predictor of the private payrolls component of the employment report.       According to a Reuters survey of economists, payrolls likely increased by 185,000 jobs in May after a gain of 211,000 in April. The unemployment rate is forecast to be unchanged at a 10-year low of 4.4 percent. Economy Firming Still, the ADP report added to data this week showing an acceleration in consumer spending in April.  The economy grew at a 1.2 percent annualized rate in the first quarter. The Atlanta Fed is forecasting gross domestic product increasing at a 4.0 percent pace in the second quarter. Minutes of the Fed's May 2-3 policy meeting, which were published last week, showed that while policymakers agreed they should hold off hiking rates until there was evidence the growth slowdown was transitory, most participants believed it would soon be appropriate to raise borrowing costs. The U.S. central bank hiked rates by 25 basis points in March. It is expected to do so again at its June 13-14 policy meeting. In a third report on Thursday, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits jumped 13,000 to a seasonally adjusted 248,000 for the week ended May 27.  It was the 117th straight week that claims were below 300,000, a threshold associated with a healthy labor market. That is the longest such stretch since 1970, when the labor market was smaller. A Labor Department official said claims for California and seven other states were estimated because of the Memorial Day holiday on Monday, which could have distorted the data. The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose only 2,500 to 238,000 last week. While the claims report put a damper on what has been a pretty upbeat run for most of the recent labor market data, we still have a fairly favorable view of labor market conditions, said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan in New York. The Fed said on Wednesday in its Beige Book report of anecdotal information on business activity collected from contacts nationwide that labor markets continued to tighten from early April through late May.  It also said most districts had cited worker shortages across a broadening range of occupations and regions. A fourth report by global outplacement consultancy Challenger, Gray & Christmas showed layoffs announced by U.S.-based employers fell 9 percent to 33,092 in May.

Other data on Thursday showed house prices increasing solidly in December amid strong demand for housing even as mortgage rates rose. The reports highlighted strength in the economy that could allow the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in the near-term. All indications are that job creation remains solid, underscoring the resiliency of the nearly eight-year economic recovery, said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors in Kalamazoo, Michigan. A March (rate) hike cannot be ruled out. Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 6,000 to a seasonally adjusted 244,000 for the week ended Feb. 18, the Labor Department said. It was the 103rd straight week that claims remained below 300,000, a threshold associated with a healthy labor market.  That is the longest stretch since 1970, when the labor market was much smaller. The labor market is at or close to full employment, with the unemployment rate at 4.8 percent. Economists had forecast new claims for unemployment benefits rising to 241,000 in the latest week. The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 4,000 to 241,000 last week, the lowest reading since July 1973. The economy could get a boost from a tax reform being mulled by the Trump administration. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Thursday he wanted to see very significant tax reform passed before Congress' August recess. Mnuchin, however, said the government was still studying the merits of a proposed border tax system.   Hopes of tax cuts have boosted business and consumer confidence in recent months. The dollar was trading lower against a basket of currencies, hitting a two-week low versus the yen. Stocks on Wall Street slipped, while prices for U.S. government debt rose. Minutes of the Federal Reserve's Jan 31-Feb 1 monetary policy meeting published on Wednesday showed that many policymakers believed another interest rate hike might be appropriate fairly soon if labor market and inflation data meet or beat expectations. The U.S. central bank raised its benchmark overnight interest rate last December. It has forecast three rate increases this year. Tight Labor Market Last week's claims report covered the survey period for the Labor Department's nonfarm payrolls data for February. The four-week average of claims fell 6,500 between the January and February payrolls survey weeks. This suggests another month of strong job gains after payrolls increased 227,000 in January. The message of this report remains that layoffs rates are extremely subdued, said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York. We view subdued layoffs as a sign of labor market tightness with employers retaining the labor they have amid elevated job openings and a lack of available workers. The tightening labor market is helping to underpin demand for housing. In a report on Thursday, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) said its house price index rose a seasonally adjusted 6.2 percent in December from a year ago. That followed a 6.1 percent gain in November. The FHFA's index is calculated by using purchase prices of houses financed with mortgages sold to or guaranteed by mortgage finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.  The higher home prices largely reflect tight housing inventories against the backdrop of strong demand. This is despite the 30-year fixed mortgage rate rising more than 50 basis points since November to above 4.0 percent. But with the home price increases outpacing wage growth, economists expect demand for housing to slow this year. While appreciation has remained strong lately, we look for some moderation in price increases over time along with some broader cooling in the housing data, said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan in New York.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/indonesia-freeport-idUSL4N1G51S5","Freeport warns of arbitration as Indonesia mining dispute escalates","","February 20, 2017 /  5:44 AM / 5 months ago","","JAKARTA (Reuters) - U.S. mining giant Freeport-McMoRan Inc (FCX.N) warned on Monday it could take the Indonesian government to arbitration and seek damages over a contractual dispute that has halted operations at the world's second-biggest copper mine.  In an escalation of the dispute, Freeport Chief Executive Richard Adkerson also said the company's local unit had made its first layoffs since negotiations started in January over a new mining permit, and it may let go more workers this week.  The row, which centers around the sanctity of Freeport's 30-year mining contract, comes as Indonesia seeks to squeeze more revenue out of its mining industry through a shake-up of regulations over foreign ownership and ore processing.  Right now we are at an impasse with the government, Adkerson told a news conference in Jakarta.  Freeport has been at loggerheads with Indonesia over the terms of a special mining permit to replace its contract of work, after halting its exports of copper concentrate due to the new mining rules.  On Friday, the miner said it could not meet contractual obligations for copper concentrate shipments from the mine following a five-week export stoppage. Last week, all work was stopped at Freeport's giant Grasberg mine in the eastern Indonesian province of Papua.  Assuming the export ban continues and operations resume at a local smelter in March, Freeport estimated its first-quarter sales would be reduced by around 170 million pounds of copper and 270,000 ounces of gold. That is equal to a reduction of some 17 percent in Freeport's total first-quarter copper sales and 59 percent in gold sales, the company said in a statement later on Monday. The Gresik smelter was forced to halt operations on Jan. 19 because of a labor strike. Related CoverageIndonesia mining minister says government also has right to bring Freeport to arbitrationFreeport's existing contract of work is still in place based on legal advice, according to Adkerson, and the company has notified Indonesia's mining ministry of what it says are government violations of the contract. That starts a 120-day period for the two sides to settle the dispute themselves.  At the end of that period if this dispute is not resolved we reserve the right ... to commence arbitration, Adkerson said. I sincerely hope we can find a compromise.  The company also warned of severe unfavorable consequences for all stakeholders if no resolution is reached.  The consequences could include the suspension of capital investments, a significant reduction in domestic purchases of goods and services, and job losses for contractors and workers as we are forced to adjust our business costs, it said.  Adkerson said about 10 percent of the expatriate workforce was laid off on Friday, and this week we will be releasing contract workers.  (L-R) Freeport McMoRan Inc's chief executive Richard Adkerson, Freeport Indonesia spokesman Riza Pratama, and former chief executive of Freeport's Indonesian Chappy Hakim attend a news conference in Jakarta, Indonesia, February 20, 2017.BeawihartaOf Freeport Indonesia's 32,000 workers, only 12,000 are employees and the rest are contractors, he said.  Business or Lawsuit Do they want business or a lawsuit? Indonesia's mining minister, Ignasius Jonan, asked in remarks to reporters on Monday, responding to Freeport's warning that it could take the dispute to arbitration.  The government would try to reach an agreement that doesn't break the law and that continues to honor the contract, but failing that it could also seek arbitration, he said.  Slideshow (2 Images)Jonan said on Saturday that going to court would be a better option than firing workers to pressure the government. The layoffs were not a negotiating tactic, Adkerson said, but only to keep the business financially viable.  Adkerson said Freeport was committed to staying in Indonesia. The mine is critical for Papua, with contributions from Grasberg representing around one-third of the province's economy, he said.  The chief executive of Freeport's Indonesian unit, Chappy Hakim, appointed in November to navigate through the regulatory uncertainties, resigned on Saturday. Adkerson said the company was still assessing his replacement.  Under its current contract signed in 1991, Freeport has invested $12 billion in Indonesia. But it cannot make $15 billion in additional capital investment for further development without fiscal and legal guarantees from the government, Adkerson said.  How Indonesia handles the dispute is being watched from afar, he also noted.  Millions of U.S. citizens indirectly invest in Freeport with their savings accounts and their retirement plans, Adkerson said. So what happens ... will be a matter of interest for the U.S. government.  He said activist shareholder Carl Icahn, who holds around 7 percent of Freeport-McMoRan shares, was very concerned about what is happening.  Grasberg was expected to produce 800,000 tonnes of copper in 2017, about 3.5 percent of global supply, said Jefferies analyst Chris LaFemina.

Nonfarm payrolls increased by 98,000 jobs last month, the   fewest since last May, the Labor Department said on Friday.  Job gains, which had exceeded 200,000 in January and February, were also held back by a slowdown in hiring at construction sites, factories and leisure and hospitality businesses, which had been boosted by unseasonably warm temperatures earlier in the year. In March, temperatures dropped and a storm lashed the Northeast and Midwest. Economists said bad weather accounted for the stepdown in hiring. The two-tenths of a percentage point drop in the unemployment rate from 4.7 percent in February took it to its lowest level since May 2007. The disappointing gain in nonfarm payrolls in March is a bit of a head fake that doesn't reflect the underlying strength and momentum in the labor market, said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco. While the bigger establishment survey showed fewer jobs created last month, the smaller and more volatile survey of households showed employment increased 472,000.  The economy needs to create 75,000 to 100,000 jobs per month to keep up with growth in the working-age population and some Federal Reserve officials view the labor market as being at full employment. Economists had forecast payrolls increasing 180,000 last month and the unemployment rate unchanged at 4.7 percent.

The solid employment gains suggest that an apparent slowdown in gross domestic product growth to around a 1.0 percent annualized pace in the first quarter is probably temporary. The economy grew at a 2.1 percent rate in the fourth quarter. A fast food restaurant advertises for workers on its front window in Encinitas, California.Mike BlakeAverage hourly earnings increased 5 cents or 0.2 percent in March after rising 0.3 percent in February. That lowered the year-on-year gain in wages to 2.7 percent.  But with inflation rising and the unemployment rate below the most recent Fed median forecast for full employment, economists expect another interest rate increase in June. The U.S. central bank lifted its overnight interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point in March and has forecast two more increases this year. Minutes from the Fed's mid-March meeting showed most policymakers expected to start reducing the Fed's $4.5 trillion bond portfolio later this year. New York Fed President William Dudley said on Friday that would prompt only a little pause in the central bank's rate hike plans. If today's decline in the unemployment rate doesn't reverse itself they may be compelled not only to hike but also to signal a faster pace of future tightening, said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan in New York.  Other measures also showed labor market slack shrinking. The labor force participation rate, or the share of working-age Americans who are employed or at least looking for a job, held at an 11-month high of 63 percent in March.  A broad measure of unemployment, which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment, fell three-tenths of a percentage point to 8.9 percent, the lowest level since December 2007. The employment-to-population ratio increased one-tenth of a percentage point to a fresh eight-year high of 60.1 percent.  Last month, construction jobs rose 6,000, the weakest gain since August, after robust increases in January and February. Manufacturing employment advanced by 11,000 jobs, slowing from the 26,000 positions created in February. Retail payrolls fell 29,700, declining for a second straight month. Employment at clothing retailers decreased by 5,800 jobs last month and general merchandise stores shed 34,700 positions. Retailers including J.C. Penney Co Inc and Macy's Inc have announced thousands of layoffs as they shift toward online sales and scale back on brick-and-mortar operations. Leisure and hospitality payrolls increased 9,000, a third of February's job gains, as employment at amusement parks fell 6,900. Government payrolls increased 9,000 as state and local government hiring offset a 1,000 drop in federal jobs. Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Andrea Ricci"

Not ill will necessarily, but just a lot of familiarity. We've faced him so many times we really don't have to watch much video on him anymore because you kind of know what he's got and what he likes to do, Pirates shortstop Jordy Mercer said. Sometimes he's just got it; sometimes he doesn't. Lynn had it Saturday night. In his 20th career start against the Pirates, he pitched 6 1/3 scoreless innings and singled and scored in St. Louis' 4-0 victory at PNC Park. I had good command most of the night, he said. Yanked a few breaking balls that I would have liked to have back, but I was able to get some outs with the breaking ball, too. I was getting outs with every pitch. When you're moving the ball in and out, changing speeds, good things can happen. Lynn (8-6) combined with relievers Matt Bowman, Trevor Rosenthal and Tyler Lyons for the nine-hit shutout. Lynn struck out three and walked none as he improved to 5-1 within the National League Central. He has held opponents to two earned runs or fewer in 13 of his 19 starts. One of those strong starts was not June 24, when he gave up seven runs over 5 2/3 innings in a 7-3 loss to Pittsburgh in St. Louis. Related CoveragePreview: Cardinals at PiratesSt. Louis Cardinals - PlayerWatchPittsburgh Pirates - PlayerWatchToday's ball had more giddy-up on it, and he was locating better. He was able to sink it better, said Mercer, who was 1-for-4 for a Pittsburgh club that threatened at times but left nine men on base and was 1-for-10 with runners in scoring position. Tommy Pham was 3-for-4 with an RBI and a run scored for St. Louis, which scored one run in the fourth and three in the fifth. The Cardinals (44-46), third in the NL Central, kept the Pirates (43-48) from leapfrogging them. Pittsburgh had won three in a row and six of seven. Pirates starter Jameson Taillon (5-3) gave up four runs and eight hits in five innings, with five strikeouts and no walks. He was pitching for the first time since July 4, thanks to the All-Star break and being a late scratch from his scheduled start Sunday against the Cubs in Chicago because of food poisoning. Manager Clint Hurdle thought the long layoff affected Taillon. It's a challenge. Eleven days off. I don't think he's ever experienced anything like that. Hurdle said. There's a lot of good to hunt out of it. I just think there was just a little too much rust to knock off. Taillon had not surrendered a run in his previous two starts, and St. Louis' first run, in the fourth, ended a career-high streak of 18 2/3 scoreless innings. As a starting pitcher, you always want to go deep into games, Taillon said. Going five just sounds gross. Anytime a starting pitcher goes five, it leaves a really sour taste in your mouth. Taillon did not agree with Hurdle that the layoff was to blame. I felt pretty fresh, he said. I don't think being wild was a problem, which is usually what I do when I'm rusty. Pham doubled to lead off the fourth, moved to third on a grounder and scored on Jedd Gyorko's single to left for a 1-0 St. Louis lead. The threat ended when right fielder Gregory Polanco doubled Gyorko off first on Yadier Molina's line drive. In the fifth, Luke Voit led off with a base hit to left. Taillon struck out the next two batters before Lynn doubled to center, where Andrew McCutchen bobbled the ball, allowing Voit to score and make it 2-0. Lynn came home on Matt Carpenter's soft single up the middle. Carpenter stole second and scored on Pham's double for a 4-0 lead. It changes the complexion of (Taillon's) outing, Hurdle said of the Cardinals' three consecutive two-out hits. Lynn seemed as proud of the hit as he was his pitching performance. The hit came as a left-hander. He switched sides earlier this month. I know when pitchers get hits off me, it (ticks) me off, Lynn said. It's good when two outs, the pitcher's up, (as a pitcher) you're thinking, 'A couple pitches and I'm out of the inning.' And then it didn't work and next thing he knows he's got to face the top of the lineup. The Cardinals were pretty tickled about Lynn's left-handed blast. Great launch angle, manager Mike Matheny said kiddingly. NOTES: St. Louis RF Stephen Piscotty (right groin strain) was put on the 10-day disabled list. ... The Cardinals recalled OF Magneuris Sierra from Double-A Springfield. ... St. Louis sat 2B Kolten Wong, moved 1B Matt Carpenter to second base and gave IF Luke Voit a start at first base. ... Pittsburgh stuck with the same lineup from Friday night."

After dropping two of the first three contests on their four-game trek, the Grizzlies rallied from a 24-point deficit before defeating almighty Golden State in overtime 128-119 on Friday. Mike Conley recorded 27 points and Marc Gasol added 23 for Memphis, which is not acting as if it is satisfied with such an impressive rally. I love that it was a great team that we beat, but I want more consistency, coach David Fizdale told reporters. Right now, we play like spoilers. We haven't proven that, as a contender, we can do it night in and night out. The current stretch is a great test for Fizdale's squad, which played the Los Angeles Clippers before visiting the Warriors and will leave town to visit Oklahoma City and Houston in the coming days. The Jazz are no pushover either, having rallied for a 94-92 win at Minnesota on Saturday in the fourth of five straight road contests and also handing the Grizzlies an 82-73 defeat last month in Memphis. TV: 8 p.m. ET, ROOT (Utah), FSN Tennessee (Memphis) ABOUT THE JAZZ (23-15): Point guard George Hill returned from a concussion on Saturday and exhibited no real issues, contributing 19 points, seven assists and five rebounds. He has been absent for both games against the Grizzlies this season, but Utah is 11-3 with him in the lineup - including eight straight wins. Big man Rudy Gobert secured 13 rebounds versus the Timberwolves to extend his franchise record of consecutive games with at least 10 boards to 23. ABOUT THE GRIZZLIES (23-16): Conley had some ups and downs after returning from a back injury but appears to have hit his stride, averaging 21.8 points over his last four games and dishing out 12 assists in each of the last two. He showed his rust from the earlier layoff with a 3-of-16 shooting effort in the loss to the Jazz last month but had 18 points and seven assists in a win at Utah earlier in the season. Veteran forward Zach Randolph has averaged 16.3 points in 26.5 minutes on the road trip. Buzzer Beaters 1. Memphis shot 30.1 percent in the previous meeting. 2.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/china-economy-restructuring-idUSL3N1C22G8","China launches $52.5 billion fund to restructure state enterprises","","September 26, 2016 /  6:10 AM / 10 months ago","","BEIJING (Reuters) - China has launched a 350 billion yuan ($52.5 billion) state enterprise restructuring fund to advance its 'supply-side' reforms as the world's second-largest economy undergoes its most significant transformation in two decades. China has made reform of its lumbering and uncompetitive state-owned enterprises (SOEs) a priority as weak global demand drags on economic growth and excess capacity and idle workers bleed what precious resources companies have at their disposal. Earlier this year, China said it was planning to allocate 100 billion yuan to help local authorities and SOEs finance layoffs in its struggling coal and steel industries. Up to 1.8 million people in the sectors could lose their jobs, official estimates showed. The capital raised by the China State-owned Enterprises Restructuring Fund will focus on boosting the competitiveness of some SOEs and their international operations, including overseas acquisitions, the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC), which will manage the fund, said in a document. Among SOEs controlled by the central government, some have excess capacity while others are suffering from a severe lack of capacity, state radio cited Xiao Yaqing, head of SASAC, as saying on Monday. Setting up this new fund will help concentrate state capital on strategic and forward-looking industries. The fund will have an initial registered capital of 131 billion yuan provided by 10 SOEs. The 10 firms investing in the fund include China Mobile Ltd (0941.HK), China Railway Rolling Stock Corp (601766.SS) and China Petroleum & Chemical Corp (600028.SS). Key investment areas of the fund include assets pertaining to national security and are of economic importance such as strategic reserves of natural resources, oil-and-gas pipelines, power grids and telecommunication infrastructure, according to the SASAC document. The fund will also focus on restructuring SOEs. For some sectors like coal and steel, restructuring has meant closures of mines and plants, and layoffs. For others, it has meant high-profile marriages to create national champions with the heft to compete globally. Last year, Beijing ordered the merger of top train manufacturers China CNR Corp and China CSR Corp. This fund aims to facilitate the destocking and deleveraging process, said Zhou Hao, senior emerging markets economist at Commerzbank. China's state sector employed around 37 million people in 2013, and accounts for about 40 percent of the country's industrial output. The retrenchments are China's most significant layoffs since the restructuring of SOEs from 1998 to 2003. That round of reforms led to around 28 million redundancies and cost the government about 73.1 billion yuan in resettlement funds. China is not the first country to create a fund to support state firms going through hard times. The South Korean government has approved a $9.5 billion fund to help recapitalize state-run banks exposed to the country's troubled shipping sector. China will reduce the number of SOEs this year to no more than 100 from 106, state media reported in July, citing SASAC Deputy Secretary-General Peng Huagang, who added that 10 central SOEs were in talks to create five groups. China's central SOEs will complete their restructuring by the end of next year by introducing private capital and strategic investment, the Economic Information Daily reported earlier this month, citing unnamed insiders.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-economy-idUSL1N1D40KA","Slowdown in orders, hiring curbs U.S. services sector growth","","November 3, 2016 /  1:20 PM / 9 months ago","","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. services industry activity cooled in October amid a slowdown in new orders and hiring, suggesting a moderation in economic growth early in the fourth quarter.    Other data on Thursday showed planned job cuts by U.S.-based employers dropped 31 percent to a five-month low last month. That underscored the labor market's healthy fundamentals, though more Americans filed for unemployment benefits last week. The mixed reports came a day after the Federal Reserve  offered a fairly upbeat assessment of the economy and signaled it could raise interest rates next month.  While the services report was weak, it is not nearly weak enough to disrupt Fed plans to hike in December. It is consistent with a softer pace of economic growth, said Andrew Hollenhorst, an economist at Citigroup in New York. The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its non-manufacturing index fell 2.3 percentage points to a reading of  54.8 percent in October. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the economy.  It said respondents' comments remained mostly positive about business conditions and the overall economy, but added that several had highlighted uncertainty about the impact of the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election. Services industries reported a slowdown in new orders and employment, as well as demand for exports.  The new orders sub-index dropped 2.3 percentage points to 57.7, while a measure of services sector employment decreased 4.1 percentage points to 53.1. A sub-index for export orders fell 1.0 percentage point last month. Thirteen services industries including information, professional, retail and finance reported growth in October. The five industries reporting contraction included education, public administration and arts, entertainment and recreation. The economy grew at a 2.9 percent pace in the third quarter after expanding at a 1.4 percent rate in the April-June period. Separately, the Labor Department said on Thursday that initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 7,000 to a seasonally adjusted 265,000 for the week ended Oct. 29, the highest level since early August.  It was still the 87th straight week that claims remained below 300,000, a threshold associated with a healthy labor market. That is the longest stretch since 1970, when the labor market was much smaller. U.S. jobless claims remain supportive of labor market improvement, said Michael Gapen, chief economist at Barclays in New York. FILE PHOTO --  A man rubs his eyes as he waits in a line of jobseekers, to attend the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. career fair held by the New York State department of Labor in New York April 12, 2012.Lucas Jackson/File PhotoThe Fed on Wednesday held interest rates steady but said its monetary policy-setting committee judges that the case for an increase in the federal funds rate has continued to strengthen. The U.S. central bank is widely expected to increase its  overnight benchmark interest rate in December, but the decision could depend on the outcome of next week's election. The tightening of the race between Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and her Republican rival Donald Trump has rattled financial markets. The Fed raised borrowing costs last December for the first time in nearly a decade. U.S. financial markets were little moved by the data, with traders focused on the race for the White House. The dollar stabilized from multi-week lows against a basket of major currencies after a poll showed Clinton holding on to a narrow lead over Trump. U.S. stocks were a bit weaker, while prices for longer-dated U.S. government bonds fell. Layoffs Decline Last week's claims report has no bearing on October's employment report, which is scheduled for release on Friday, as it falls outside the survey period.  According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 175,000 last month after rising by 151,000 in September. The unemployment rate is seen slipping one-tenth of a percentage point to 4.9 percent. Expectations of an upbeat October employment report were supported by a report on Thursday from global outplacement consultancy Challenger, Gray & Christmas showing employers announced 30,740 job cuts last month, down from 44,324 in September. Job cuts in October were concentrated in the computer industry, where employers announced 4,792 layoffs. Most of the computer job cuts came from HP Inc, which laid off another 4,000 workers last month. That was in addition to the 30,000 job cuts the company announced in 2015.  In another report, the Labor Department said nonfarm productivity, which measures hourly output per worker, rose at a 3.1 percent annual rate, the fastest pace in two years. The increase ended three straight quarters of decline.  Despite the rise, the trend in productivity remains weak. A fifth report from the Commerce Department showed new orders for manufactured goods increased for a third consecutive month in September. Unfilled orders at factories, however, fell for a fourth straight month. Manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the economy, has been hurt by a strong dollar and weak global demand. Production has also been undermined by the collapse in oil drilling activity in the wake of the plunge in oil prices.  Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Paul Simao"

The move raises the stakes in a global battle to dominate the solar power industry, which has grown explosively in the past five years. As production has increased, prices have tumbled, favoring producers who can take advantage of economies of scale.  The United States, China and India are vying to be the market leader, and are looking out for any perceived breach of the international trade rules by their rivals. Last September, the WTO ruled that India was illegally discriminating against U.S. solar exports, while India launched its own WTO complaint about solar subsidies in eight U.S. states. The United States' ability to attract renewable energy investment has been tarnished by the shift in energy policy under U.S. President Donald Trump, putting China and India on top, a report by British accountancy firm Ernst & Young said earlier this month. The U.S. decision to consider safeguard tariffs follows a petition to the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) by Suniva, Inc, the filing said.  Under WTO rules, such temporary tariffs may be used to shield an industry from a sudden, unforeseen and damaging surge in imports. They can be challenged by other WTO members. The ITC will decide by Sept. 22 whether the U.S. industry has suffered serious injury, and if that is the case it will submit its report to Trump by Nov. 13, the filing said. Suniva's petition said the volume of imports rose by 51.6 percent between 2012 and 2016, while the value of those imports grew by 62.8 percent from $5.1 billion to $8.3 billion.   The petition alleges that increasing imports have taken market share from domestic producers and have led to bankruptcies, plant shutdowns, layoffs, and a severe deterioration of the financial performance of the domestic industry, the U.S. filing said. Suniva itself filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on April 17. While imports have risen, U.S. producers have seen business shrivel, with 1,200 manufacturing jobs lost and a 27 percent wage decline in the four years to 2016. U.S. solar cell plants went from running at 81.7 percent of capacity in 2014 to 28.9 percent in 2016, the filing said. Data in the petition also indicates that (U.S. producers')domestic market share fell from 21.0 percent in 2012 to 11.0 percent in 2016, despite a $4 billion growth of the U.S. market over the same period.

The Canadian aid package includes C$260 million to expand overseas markets for lumber, help affected workers learn new skills and provide support for work-sharing agreements and thereby avoid layoffs. The Forest Products Association of Canada welcomed the aid, describing it as a critical step as we work to secure a strong forest sector.

Telstra dominates the mobile telephone and broadband industries in Australia but like for many incumbent telecom firms around the world, profits from traditional fixed-line networks have dropped while new rivals move in on mobile market share. The latest round of cuts announced on Wednesday are equivalent to 4 percent of its workforce and bring total headcount reduction since December 2015 to 7.4 percent of staff. More jobs are likely to be shed as the company attempts to transform in to a technology company, said telecommunications analyst Paul Budde, who runs his own consultancy. It is a clear trend that's taking place and if you compare that to the Googles and the Facebooks and the Skypes of this world, the traditional telecommunications industry is still heavily overpopulated, he said. Telstra will lose its wholesale business when the new state -owned National Broadband Network (NBN) replaces the company's copper lines by about 2020 - a loss that will hit annual earnings by A$2 billion to A$3 billion ($1.5 billion-$2.3 billion). The market is getting more competitive, we're also seeing the acceleration of the rollout of the NBN, that's another significant contributing factor, and we're seeing Telstra, as indeed we see with all of our business customers, responding to the impacts of digital disruption, Telstra Chief Executive Andy Penn told reporters. The cuts are nationwide, will affect most business units and will happen over the next six months, he added. Telstra disappointed the market in February with a surprise profit drop and flagged restructuring costs between A$300 million and A$500 million ($226 million-$377 million) for the 2017 financial year. The latest job cuts are factored into those restructuring costs. The stock has dropped 14.5 percent so far this year, hurt by the weak results and a move by rival TPG Telecom to enter the mobile market.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-seattle-minimumwage-idUSKBN19H2MV","Seattle employers cut hours after latest minimum wage rise, study finds","","June 26, 2017 /  10:09 PM / a month ago","","(Reuters) - A Seattle law that requires many businesses to pay a minimum wage of at least $13 an hour has left low-wage workers with less money in their pockets because some employers cut working hours, a study released on Monday said. Low-wage workers on average now clock 9 percent fewer hours and earn $125 less each month than before the Pacific Northwest city set one of the highest minimum wages in the nation, the University of Washington research paper said.  Even so, overall employment at city restaurants, where a large percentage of low-wage earners work, held steady. Seattle, which has a booming economy and a strong technology sector, is midway through an initiative to increase its minimum wage for all employers to $15 an hour. The city is at the forefront of a nationwide push by Democratic elected officials and organized labor in targeting $15 for all workers. Most people will tell you there is a level of minimum wage that is too high, Jacob Vigdor, a professor of public policy at the University of Washington and director of the team studying the increase, said in a phone interview. There is a sense that as you raise it too high, then you get to a point where employers will really start cutting back. Many companies reached that point after Seattle, a city of nearly 700,000 residents, raised the minimum to $13 an hour for large employers beginning Jan. 1, 2016, according to the study.  Seattle's labor market held steady when the minimum rose to $11 from $9.47 on April 1, 2015, the university found in a study released last year.  Raising the minimum wage helps ensure more people who live and work in Seattle can share in our city's success, and helps fight income inequality, Seattle Mayor Ed Murray said in a statement in response to the study, which the city commissioned.  The federal minimum wage has stayed at $7.25 an hour since 2009, and the Republican-controlled U.S. Congress has opposed an increase. Critics of minimum wage increases say they lead to layoffs and force some companies out of business. The latest research from the University of Washington found no major reduction in hours or jobs at Seattle restaurants, in keeping with a finding in a study conducted by University of California, Berkeley, that was released last week.   Lawmakers in California, the nation's most populous state, voted last year to increase the minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2022. Elected officials in several states, including New York and Oregon, and large cities such as Chicago have in the last two years approved their own minimum pay hikes.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/minnesota-minimumwage-idUSL1N1JR1LD","Minneapolis approves gradual minimum wage hike to $15 an hour","","June 30, 2017 /  5:44 PM / a month ago","","(Reuters) - The Minneapolis City Council approved a measure on Friday requiring large companies to pay workers least at $15 an hour by 2022, following moves by other liberal-leaning U.S. cities to raise the minimum wage. The pay hike will be phased in citywide by 2024 and makes Minneapolis the first city in the Midwest to set a timetable for a $15 minimum wage. The measure, an effective pay increase of 58 percent for workers at large businesses and 94 percent for those at small ones, was approved by an 11-1 vote. Large businesses, including fast-food chains, must pay at least $10 an hour beginning Jan. 1, according to a news release from the city. On July 1, 2018, small businesses will have to pay $10.25 and the rate will go to $11.25 for large ones. Supporters of the $15 minimum wage in Minneapolis and other cities believe it provides a floor of support for those on the lowest rung of the economic ladder, including many single mothers and children. But critics say required pay increases lead to layoffs and force some employers out of business. The bottom line here is that we have huge disparities in our country and this is one of the ways we can address that, City Councilwoman Linea Palmisano said at the council meeting. In Minneapolis, Minnesota's biggest city, more than 70,000 workers stand to benefit from the increase, supporters say. But it is likely to be monitored closely for any negative impact on the labor market. Minnesota's current minimum wage - $9.50 for large businesses and $7.75 for small companies - is already the highest in the Midwest. City Councilman Blong Yang, who cast the lone dissenting vote, said he was concerned the ordinance would overburden small businesses, including many owned by minority groups, and would raise prices in the city. We cannot make Minneapolis an island, Yang said at the meeting. Los Angeles, the nation's second-largest city, as well as San Francisco, Seattle and some others have already approved measures to increase base pay to $15 an hour. Under a law approved last year, California set a $15 target for all workers, which it plans to reach in 2023. New York State is also gradually increasing its minimum wage to $15 an hour for all workers under a bill signed by the governor last year.

Rato, who was economy minister in Spain and a prominent figure in the ruling People's Party (PP) before moving to the IMF, chaired Bankia for two years until just before its state bailout in 2012.      He had been on trial along with 64 other executives and former board members of Bankia and its founding savings bank Caja Madrid. The case is one of several high-level corruption investigations now coming to fruition and seen as a test of whether Spain's rich and powerful are accountable to the law. Last week, a Spanish court found the king's brother-in-law guilty of using royal connections to overcharge regional governments through public contracts. Rato and ex-Caja Madrid Chairman Miguel Blesa, who was sentenced to six years in jail, were convicted of misappropriating funds, the court said in a written ruling.   Rato had denied any wrongdoing, arguing the expenses he accrued on the Bankia credit cards were legal. Neither Blesa's lawyer, Carlos Aguilar, nor Ratos' lawyer, Ignacio Ayala, responded to requests for comment. The so-called black cards case sparked widespread anger when the scandal first broke in 2014, at a time when Spain was recovering from years of recession, mass layoffs and a banking crisis partly triggered by Bankia's massive bailout. The court considered in its ruling both Rato and Blesa responsible for overseeing the misuse of credit cards and said that they could have reversed the practice. The defendants Miguel Blesa (...) and Rodrigo de Rato Figaredo were aware of the decision they made to allow business cards to circulate (...) with no legal and statutory support, based, as they said, on a principle of trust, which was not the case, the court said in its ruling. The cards were used to buy jewels, holidays and expensive clothes, according to documents filed with the court, but also to fund more mundane purchases such as trips to the cinema. Before chairing the Washington-based IMF between 2004 and 2007, Rato was deputy prime minister in the conservative PP's government in 1996. In total, prosecutors were investigating some 12 million euros in spending on the cards between 2003 and 2012 by the 65 former Bankia executives, including Rato and Blesa. The court ruling can be appealed before Spain's Supreme Court. Reporting by Inmaculada Sanz and Rodrigo de Miguel; Writing by Sarah White and Jesus Aguado; Editing by Catherine Evans"

In a letter addressed to EU Council President Donald Tusk and Commission President Jean Claude Juncker, Tsipras called for a clear statement on whether the declaration would apply to Greece, as talks over a key bailout review hit a snag again. We intend to support the Rome Declaration, a document which moves in a positive direction, Tsipras said. Nevertheless, in order to be able to celebrate these achievements, it has to be made clear, on an official level, whether they apply also to Greece. Whether, in other words, the European acquis is valid for all member states without exception, or for all except Greece. Earlier this week, Greece threatened not to sign the Rome declaration, demanding a clearer commitment protecting workers' rights - an issue on which it is at odds with its international lenders who demand more reforms in return for new loans. The disagreements among Athens, the EU and the IMF - which has yet to decide whether it will participate in the country's current bailout - have delayed a crucial bailout review. As leaders prepared for the summit, Greek ministers were negotiating with lenders' representatives in Brussels pension cuts and labour reforms, including freeing up mass layoffs and on collective bargaining. The latest round of talks ended inconclusively late on Thursday, according to Greek officials. Athens agreed last month to adopt more measures to help convince the IMF to participate in its third, 86-billion euro bailout, as demanded by EU countries including Germany, which faces a national election later this year. Greece has cut pensions 12 times since it signed up to its first bailout in 2010. It has also reduced wages and implemented labour reforms to make its market more flexible and competitive. Tsipras' leftist-led government came to power in 2015 promising to end austerity but signed up to a new bailout to keep the country in the eurozone. It was later re-elected on a mandate to protect workers' and pensioners' rights, but opinion polls show its popularity ratings sagging. Tsipras said Greece had met its bailout terms on fiscal adjustment and implemented labour reforms, which were not in line with EU best practices. I ask for your support in order to protect, together, the right of Greece to return to the standards of the European social model, he said.   (Reporting by Renee Maltezou; Editing by Michael Perry)"

The union representing a third of the 32,000 workforce sent a notice to Freeport on Monday threatening to strike from May 1 to the end of the month at the Grasberg mine, the world's second-biggest copper mine. Freeport is trying to ramp up output and exports at Grasberg after reaching a temporary deal with the government following a 15-week stoppage linked to new mining rules, but customers are concerned that labour unrest could now hit supply. Freeport has laid off about 10 percent of its workforce and warned it could cut another 5,000 to stem losses, sparking protests from workers. We are still waiting. We have good intention by opening up in a transparent and fair manner so the problem can be solved. We actually don't want a strike to happen, said the union leader Aser Gobai, adding that about 8,000 workers had taken part in the rally in Timika, the nearest town to the mine. A spokesman for Freeport Indonesia did not respond to requests for comment. Freeport Chief Executive Richard Adkerson said last month that the company was in talks with union leaders in an effort to get them back to work, and warned it could punish workers for absenteeism. Up to $40 million-per-month of spending on the Grasberg underground development could be cut if contract matters are not resolved, which could lead to more layoffs, he said. Any delays in resuming exports could also support copper prices, with London Metal Exchange prices currently around $5,735 a tonne. Adding to tensions around Grasberg, several Freeport workers and police were injured in a clash in Papua last month, when officers fired tear gas and rubber bullets at demonstrators in Timika who authorities said had been attempting to free a union leader at a court hearing. New rules in Indonesia require Freeport to obtain a new mining permit, divest a 51 percent stake, build a second copper smelter, relinquish arbitration rights and pay new taxes and royalties. Freeport insists any new permit must have the same fiscal and legal guarantees as under its 30-year mining contract, and in February it served notice to Jakarta, saying it has the right to commence arbitration if no agreement is reached by June 17.

The decision reflects the shift by shoppers toward buying groceries outside of grocery stores, as well as Kellogg's continued focus on revitalizing its snack business.      The distribution model change is part of an expanded Project K program, which Kellogg launched in 2013 to save up to $475 million annually by 2018 through job cuts and production optimization. Kellogg said it will close its distribution centers and that there would be layoffs, though it declined to provide details. Out of respect for employees who are still being notified, we are not sharing that information at this time, Kellogg said in a statement. Kellogg already distributes about 75 percent of its U.S. sales through warehouses, including products in its frozen foods and morning foods businesses.     The direct-store delivery model was part of the appeal that drew Kellogg to its 2001 $3.6 billion acquisition of Keebler snacks. Kellogg used the deal as a launching pad for its snack platform, adding chip company Pringles in 2012, in a deal valued at $2.7 billion.     The U.S. snacks business, which also includes Cheez-It crackers and Special K cereal bars, accounted for about 25 percent of Kellogg's sales in the third quarter. These sales declined in 2014 through the first half of 2016, before flattening out in the third quarter, led by core brands Cheez-It and Pringles. Kellogg, which is scheduled to report fourth-quarter results on Thursday, said it would start the transition in the second quarter of 2017 and expects to complete the move in the fourth quarter.     We believe (the move) will help us grow the business in the long term, taking resources tied up in distribution and putting them back into the brands themselves, said John Bryant, chairman and chief executive of Kellogg.     The company, which also makes Pop-Tarts and Fruit Loops, said it would provide severance, benefits and retention packages to employees impacted by the transition.

In his $18 billion general fund spending plan for 2018, Malloy also proposed roughly $320 million of revenue generators to close the gap, including the elimination of property tax credits on personal income taxes. In the following year of the two-year budget proposal, another $1.64 billion in cuts would be required to close a bigger deficit of $1.9 billion, according to budget documents released in conjunction with the Democratic governor's address to lawmakers. (bit.ly/2kTvlGP) These cuts are not made lightly, Malloy said. They include things that I myself strongly support. Including all funds, his biennial budget is $40.6 billion for the next two years combined. The proposal, if adopted, would result in an eight-year period in which the state general fund budget grew only 2 percent on average, he said. Connecticut has been daunted by slow revenue growth as fixed costs, including for public pensions hit by poor investment returns, continue to balloon. Malloy proposed shifting a third of the costs of the state teachers' pension fund - or about $408 million in fiscal 2018 - to local governments, which currently pay nothing into the Teachers Retirement System despite retaining local control of school staffing levels. The biggest portion of savings next year would come from $700 million of concessions, mostly on pension and health benefits, from the 15 unions that make up the State Employees Bargaining Agent Coalition (SEBAC). In 2019, those concessions would add up to another $868 million in taxpayer savings. The state's contract with SEBAC does not expire until 2022, so it is seeking voluntary changes from the unions. If there is no deal, Malloy's budget calls for layoffs of up to 4,200 state employees in order to save the money, though he said in his address that he is a staunch, lifelong advocate for the right to organize. As expected, Malloy also proposed an expansion of the state's system for municipal intervention to help avert a crisis in cities struggling with fiscal problems. It is in our collective best interest that no town be brought to the brink of bankruptcy, Malloy said. Additional measures to generate revenue include hiking tobacco taxes and lowering the state's Earned Income Tax Credit, used by low- and moderate-income families, by 2.5 percentage points to 25 percent of the federal benefit level.

A six-month temporary budget for the fiscal year that ends June 30 expired on Dec. 31.

Another $559 million would go to state universities, community colleges, and educational grants for low-income students. The bill's sponsor, Democratic State Representative Greg Harris, said the so-called life-line measure would allow social service organizations and state universities to continue to exist. He cited a United Way survey released on Wednesday that showed 69 percent of social service agencies had received no payments or partial payments from the state so far in fiscal 2017, forcing 49 percent of the agencies to reduce services.

The Bulls split a four-game road trip against four non-playoff teams, with Saturday's one-point loss at Brooklyn one of the worst setbacks of the season. With Dwyane Wade (elbow) back in the lineup following a lengthy layoff, Chicago blew a nine-point lead in the final four-plus minutes to fall into a tie with Miami for the eighth and final playoff spot in the East, a game behind seventh-place Indiana.

The last few weeks have been really cool. Obviously got married and went on honeymoon and enjoyed that, McIlroy told reporters at TPC Sawgrass on Tuesday. Got back home to Florida last Thursday, been trying to lose a bit of weight before this week ... but, yeah, everything's been great. The 28-year-old signed a reported $100 million deal to switch to TaylorMade for the next 10 years. He previously had an equipment contract with Nike before it announced late last year that it was pulling out of that market. The world number two, who signed a long-term extension to his Nike apparel contract in April, said he decided to switch to TaylorMade's clubs and balls starting this week after feeling a lack of control with his shots in windy conditions. So I sort of went back to the drawing board and tested for about 10 days pretty extensively after Augusta, worked with a lot of different things, he said. Saw stuff with the golf ball, that new TP5x ball that they have, and I thought, wow, this is what I need, this is exactly the thing that I've been struggling with. Then over the course of the next few days, I tested different combinations (of clubs), a lot of different stuff, and I came to the conclusion that that was the best way forward for me to try and improve, try and win more, try to get back to world number one, try to win more majors. McIlroy said he felt like he was starting a new chapter in my life ... but I really feel with the new equipment, as well, it's hopefully going to take me to that next level. The four-times major winner did not think his intensity and focus on the golf course would change now that he is a married man, but thought marriage could be beneficial off the course. It might help me get over tough losses a little bit easier, said McIlroy. I'm in a great place in my life and I feel very settled and very lucky to be in this position.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/twitter-results-idUSL4N1CX4BI","Twitter cuts jobs with eye on 2017 profit; Vine discontinued","","October 27, 2016 /  11:17 AM / 9 months ago","","(Reuters) - Twitter Inc said Thursday it would cut 9 percent of its global workforce to keep costs down even as quarterly results eclipsed Wall Street's beaten-down expectations, lifting shares that had fallen after a failed effort to sell the company. More than 300 Twitter employees will be affected by the layoffs as part of a broader restructuring, a figure similar to an earlier round of reductions announced a year ago. Separately, the company announced it would discontinue Vine, a video app launched in 2013 that played brief clips on a repeat loop that struggled to compete with Facebook's Instagram. The reductions of staff and services were blunted somewhat by the backdrop of third-quarter revenue growth that slowed sharply but topped analysts' expectations. Its stock was up 1.6 percent to $17.56, after rallying 5 percent in premarket trading. Revenue rose about 8 percent to $616 million, above the average analyst estimate of $605.8 million. The company had reported a 20-percent rise in revenue in the previous quarter and 58 percent in the year-ago quarter.  Twitter, which has seen user growth stall amid competition from nimbler rivals such as Instagram and Snapchat, said its user base ticked up 3 percent to 317 million average monthly active users in the quarter.  Analysts, on average, had expected 316.3 million monthly active users, according to market research firm FactSet StreetAccount. The building blocks for revenue are increasing the number of users, and Twitter is not doing a particularly good job of that, Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter said. He added that Twitter needed to grow revenue by $200 million to $300 million a quarter to achieve 2017 profitability. Related CoverageTwitter's video-sharing mobile app Vine to closeThe run-rate for the year is under $100 million in profit, so it is really hard to justify spending $15 or $18 billion to buy a $100-million profit (company), Pachter said. Total advertising revenue of $545 million grew 6 percent year-over-year, and 90 percent of it came from mobile. Excluding items, the company earned 13 cents per share, beating the average estimate of 9 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company is more disciplined about how we invest in the business and intends to be profitable in 2017, said Chief Financial Officer Anthony Noto.  The Twitter logo is displayed on a screen on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S., September 28, 2016.Brendan McDermidAmong its priorities, Twitter is dedicated to growing its burgeoning live video offerings through partnerships with organizations such as the National Football League, Noto said. Advertisers are increasingly interested in live video because of its potential to reach new and younger audiences, he added. Twitter hired bankers last month to field acquisition offers, but it has seen a dearth of potential bidders. Salesforce.com Inc, the last of a small cohort of companies including Walt Disney Co and Alphabet Inc believed to have been interested, said recently it would not pursue a deal. The apparent lack of interest forced the social media company to consider a route anathema to aspiring tech startups: a major restructuring. More Layoffs The Twitter logo is shown at its corporate headquarters  in San Francisco, California April 28, 2015.Robert GalbraithTwitter had 3,860 employees globally as of June. The reduction of more than 300, chiefly in its sales, partnerships, and marketing efforts. The cuts come about a year after a similar wave of layoffs of up to 336 employees were announced when Jack Dorsey, its co-founder who had been serving as interim chief executive, took over as permanent CEO. Since then, Dorsey has drawn criticism from some analysts for splitting his time between Twitter and Square.  The company said it expected cash expenditures of about $10 million to $20 million in the fourth quarter, mostly for severance costs. On an investor call Thursday, Dorsey said he would not comment on speculation about a potential sale. He said in a statement that the company has a clear plan, and we’re making the necessary changes to ensure Twitter is positioned for long-term growth.” Asked by investors whether major events such as presidential debates or the Olympics affected Twitter's quarterly growth in metrics, Noto said there needed to be such an event every day on the platform to meaningfully improve numbers, and that's where we're headed. The popular but money-losing microblogging service spent aggressively on product development and marketing in recent years, betting it could afford losses as long as it attracted new users. But that growth stalled this year after it exceeded 300 million active monthly users, less than a fifth of Facebook Inc's users and below Facebook's Instagram.   The company's net loss narrowed to $102.9 million, or 15 cents per share, in the third quarter, from $131.7 million, or 20 cents per share, a year earlier. Twitter also said it would roll out “meaningful updates” next month affecting how it protects users from abusive content, an issue for which the company has endured growing criticism.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-economy-idUSL1N1FT25W","U.S. jobless claims near 43-year low; wholesale inventories surge","","February 9, 2017 /  1:33 PM / in 6 months","","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell last week to near a 43-year low, amid a further tightening of the labor market that could eventually spur faster wage growth. Other data on Thursday showed inventories at wholesalers surged in December for a second straight month and sales recorded their biggest increase since 2011, signs of confidence in the economy as domestic demand strengthens. Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped by 12,000 to a seasonally adjusted 234,000 for the week ended Feb. 4, the Labor Department said. That left claims just shy of the 43-year low of 233,000 touched in early November. Claims have now remained below 300,000, a threshold associated with a strong labor market, for 101 straight weeks. That is the longest stretch since 1970, when the labor market was much smaller. There is no sign of a pickup in layoff activity. We continue to view the signal of extremely subdued layoffs from the jobless claims data as evidence of companies attempting to retain their workers in a tight labor market, said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York. Prices of U.S. Treasuries fell, with yields rising to session highs, while the dollar rose against a basket of currencies. The labor market is at or close to full employment, with the unemployment rate at 4.8 percent after hitting a more than nine-year low of 4.6 percent in November. The economy created 227,000 jobs in January. Further tightening in labor market conditions could boost wage growth, which has remained stubbornly sluggish despite anecdotal evidence of more companies struggling to find qualified workers. Pretty Upbeat Signal  Lackluster wage growth, if sustained, could hurt consumer spending and crimp economic growth. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast first-time applications for jobless benefits rising to 250,000 in the latest week.  Today's report sent a pretty upbeat signal about conditions in the job market, said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan in New York. It looks like conditions in the job market have remained solid in the few weeks since the reference period for the January payroll report. The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 3,750 to 244,250 last week, the lowest level since November 1973. The claims report also showed the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid increased 15,000 to 2.08 million in the week ended Jan. 28. The four-week average of the so-called continuing claims fell 3,750 to 2.08 million. In a separate report on Thursday, the Commerce Department said wholesale inventories increased 1.0 percent after a similar jump in November. The back-to-back strong increases of stock accumulation, however, suggest a moderation in the pace of inventory investment in the months ahead. Wholesale stocks excluding autos, the component of wholesale inventories that goes into the calculation of gross domestic product, increased 0.9 percent in December.  Inventory investment contributed one percentage point to the economy's 1.9 percent annualized growth rate in the fourth quarter. That was the second straight quarterly contribution to GDP growth. Inventories had been a drag on GDP growth since the second quarter of 2015. Sales at wholesalers jumped 2.6 percent in December, the largest increase since March 2011, after increasing 0.5 percent in November.  At December's sales pace it would take wholesalers 1.29 months to clear shelves, the smallest since December 2014 and down from 1.31 months in November. The ratio has declined from the 1.37 months touched in January of last year, which was the highest since March 2009. Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Paul Simao and Meredith Mazzilli"
"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-indonesia-freeport-idUSKBN15Z0EC","Freeport warns of arbitration as Indonesia mining dispute escalates","","February 20, 2017 /  5:44 AM / 5 months ago","","JAKARTA (Reuters) - U.S. mining giant Freeport-McMoRan Inc (FCX.N) warned on Monday it could take the Indonesian government to arbitration and seek damages over a contractual dispute that has halted operations at the world's second-biggest copper mine.  In an escalation of the dispute, Freeport Chief Executive Richard Adkerson also said the company's local unit had made its first layoffs since negotiations started in January over a new mining permit, and it may let go more workers this week.  The row, which centers around the sanctity of Freeport's 30-year mining contract, comes as Indonesia seeks to squeeze more revenue out of its mining industry through a shake-up of regulations over foreign ownership and ore processing.  Right now we are at an impasse with the government, Adkerson told a news conference in Jakarta.  Freeport has been at loggerheads with Indonesia over the terms of a special mining permit to replace its contract of work, after halting its exports of copper concentrate due to the new mining rules.  On Friday, the miner said it could not meet contractual obligations for copper concentrate shipments from the mine following a five-week export stoppage. Last week, all work was stopped at Freeport's giant Grasberg mine in the eastern Indonesian province of Papua.  Assuming the export ban continues and operations resume at a local smelter in March, Freeport estimated its first-quarter sales would be reduced by around 170 million pounds of copper and 270,000 ounces of gold. That is equal to a reduction of some 17 percent in Freeport's total first-quarter copper sales and 59 percent in gold sales, the company said in a statement later on Monday. The Gresik smelter was forced to halt operations on Jan. 19 because of a labor strike. Related CoverageIndonesia mining minister says government also has right to bring Freeport to arbitrationFreeport's existing contract of work is still in place based on legal advice, according to Adkerson, and the company has notified Indonesia's mining ministry of what it says are government violations of the contract. That starts a 120-day period for the two sides to settle the dispute themselves.  At the end of that period if this dispute is not resolved we reserve the right ... to commence arbitration, Adkerson said. I sincerely hope we can find a compromise.  The company also warned of severe unfavorable consequences for all stakeholders if no resolution is reached.  The consequences could include the suspension of capital investments, a significant reduction in domestic purchases of goods and services, and job losses for contractors and workers as we are forced to adjust our business costs, it said.  Adkerson said about 10 percent of the expatriate workforce was laid off on Friday, and this week we will be releasing contract workers.  (L-R) Freeport McMoRan Inc's chief executive Richard Adkerson, Freeport Indonesia spokesman Riza Pratama, and former chief executive of Freeport's Indonesian Chappy Hakim attend a news conference in Jakarta, Indonesia, February 20, 2017.BeawihartaOf Freeport Indonesia's 32,000 workers, only 12,000 are employees and the rest are contractors, he said.  Business or Lawsuit Do they want business or a lawsuit? Indonesia's mining minister, Ignasius Jonan, asked in remarks to reporters on Monday, responding to Freeport's warning that it could take the dispute to arbitration.  The government would try to reach an agreement that doesn't break the law and that continues to honor the contract, but failing that it could also seek arbitration, he said.  Slideshow (2 Images)Jonan said on Saturday that going to court would be a better option than firing workers to pressure the government. The layoffs were not a negotiating tactic, Adkerson said, but only to keep the business financially viable.  Adkerson said Freeport was committed to staying in Indonesia. The mine is critical for Papua, with contributions from Grasberg representing around one-third of the province's economy, he said.  The chief executive of Freeport's Indonesian unit, Chappy Hakim, appointed in November to navigate through the regulatory uncertainties, resigned on Saturday. Adkerson said the company was still assessing his replacement.  Under its current contract signed in 1991, Freeport has invested $12 billion in Indonesia. But it cannot make $15 billion in additional capital investment for further development without fiscal and legal guarantees from the government, Adkerson said.  How Indonesia handles the dispute is being watched from afar, he also noted.  Millions of U.S. citizens indirectly invest in Freeport with their savings accounts and their retirement plans, Adkerson said. So what happens ... will be a matter of interest for the U.S. government.  He said activist shareholder Carl Icahn, who holds around 7 percent of Freeport-McMoRan shares, was very concerned about what is happening.  Grasberg was expected to produce 800,000 tonnes of copper in 2017, about 3.5 percent of global supply, said Jefferies analyst Chris LaFemina.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/indonesia-freeport-idUSL3N1H8216","REFILE-Indonesia eyes truce with Freeport as losses mount for both sides","","April 12, 2017 /  8:54 AM / 3 months ago","","(Corrects spelling of U.S. vice president's name, paragraph 8) By Fergus Jensen JAKARTA, April 12 (Reuters) - Losses amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars appear to be pushing the Indonesian government and mining giant Freeport McMoRan to resolve a row that has crippled operations at Grasberg, the world's richest copper mine, for three months. Freeport says it has lost revenue of about $1 billion since the export of copper concentrate from Grasberg was halted on Jan. 12 under new rules issued by the government. The government has lost millions of dollars in royalties and is worried about layoffs and a slowing economy in the restive Papua region, where the giant mine is located. There's a lot of grandstanding in public – that, with our economy being close to a $1 trillion a year now, Freeport is a small matter, said a senior Indonesian government official, who estimated the lost royalties and taxes from the mine at about $1 billion a year. But truth be told, a $1 billion a year reduction in fiscal revenue is a lot, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Indonesia halted Freeport's copper concentrate exports under new rules that require the Phoenix, Arizona-based company to adopt a special license, pay new taxes and royalties, divest a 51 percent stake in its operations and relinquish arbitration rights. Freeport threatened in February to take the dispute to arbitration, saying the rules were in effect a form of expropriation. But now, Indonesia has promised to allow Freeport to export its copper concentrate once again, while negotiations continue over the next six months on contentious issues, including on divestment, economic and legal protection and smelting investment. The compromise comes ahead of a visit to Indonesia by U.S. Vice President Mike Pence next week. Pressure to resolve the row could also come from Freeport's third-biggest shareholder, activist investor Carl Icahn, who has been appointed a special adviser to President Donald Trump. For Indonesia, tensions at Grasberg could hamper its efforts to calm the Papua region, where a low-level insurgency has simmered for decades. The mine's social and environmental footprint also remains a source of friction. Papua's GDP growth is expected to drop to 3 percent this year due to the Freeport dispute, down from 9.21 percent in 2016, according to the Papua branch of Indonesia's central bank. A slump in Papua's economy could aggravate tensions with Jakarta, complicating efforts by President Joko Widodo to enforce policies to extract more from its natural resources. When there is a crisis at Freeport, it will send major ripples through Papuan society, said Achmad Sukarsono, an Indonesian expert at the Eurasia consultancy. Papua Economy In Timika, a sprawling town of around 250,000 people and a supply hub for Grasberg, the Freeport dispute has hit businesses, caused a slump in house prices and stalled credit, residents say. Mastael Arobi, who owns a car rental business there, has cut his fleet by two-thirds because of slow business and is worried about the interest he pays on loans. We are half-dead thinking about repayments, he said. Transport operators in Timika had similar complaints, with a motorcycle taxi driver saying it was hard to make even a third of the up to 300,000 rupiah ($22.50) he used to make each day. Since these furloughs and layoffs began we have stopped providing credit to Freeport workers, said Joko Supriyono, a regional manager at Bank Papua in Timika, who said ATM transactions had declined by around two-thirds since January. Freeport, which employs more than 32,000 staff and contractors in Indonesia, has now demobilised just over 10 percent of its workforce, a number expected to grow until the dispute is resolved. Persipura, the main soccer club in Papua and one of Indonesia's most decorated teams, announced last month that Freeport, its top sponsor, had stopped its funding. Indonesian Vice President Jusuf Kalla said in a recent interview that while he did not anticipate political pressure, Washington should not politicise the Freeport issue. Another Indonesian government official said moves to allow Freeport to export temporarily were aimed at showing that the government is willing to find a solution, and to send a positive message, especially to foreign investors, who are watching the saga closely. We are not changing our stance. Our basic stance on 51 percent divestment, our demand for smelters - all that is still there. But in negotiations, you should give a little to assure the other side that we are still open to some options, said the official. The two sides had opted for a temporary solution to break a deadlock in issues that cannot be resolved quickly, said Bambang Gatot, Director General of Coal and Minerals in the mining ministry, A spokesman for Freeport Indonesia declined to comment on the warming ties with the government. A senior Freeport McMoRan executive said last week the company was awaiting details of a temporary export permit from the Indonesian government that would allow it to ramp up production.

Diminishing job market slack has left companies scrambling for workers as they seek to shore up weak productivity, leading to a rise in labor costs. Other data on Thursday showed worker productivity falling in the first quarter.

The Fed on Wednesday kept its benchmark overnight interest rate unchanged and said it expected labor market conditions would strengthen somewhat further.

It increased at a 1.1 percent rate compared to the first quarter of 2016. Productivity has increased at an average annual rate of 0.6 percent over the last five years, well below its long-term rate of 2.1 percent from 1947 to 2016. Weak productivity suggests economic growth is likely to remain moderate.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-economy-idUSL1N1IX15Z","U.S. factory activity edges up; private payrolls surge","","June 1, 2017 /  12:34 PM / 2 months ago",""," (Corrects final paragraph in June 1 story following an official correction of layoff data from Challenger, Gray & Christmas) By Lucia Mutikani WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. factory activity ticked up in May after slowing for two straight months and private employers stepped up hiring, suggesting the economy is regaining speed after struggling at the start of the year. The signs of renewed vigor in the economy and labor market tightness could encourage the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates later this month. The economy is moving forward at an acceptable pace and the Fed is likely to hike rates in June, but there is a cloud over the path of rates later on this year, said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its index of national factory activity ticked up to a reading of 54.9 last month from 54.8 in April. The index hit a 2-1/2-year high of 57.7 in February amid optimism over President Donald Trump's pro-business policy proposals. It had declined for two consecutive months as concerns mounted in the business community that political scandals could derail the Trump administration's economic agenda, including its push to cut corporate and individual taxes.  A reading above 50 in the ISM index indicates an expansion in manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy. The manufacturing recovery remains underpinned by the energy sector as steady increases in crude oil prices boost drilling activity, fueling demand for machinery. The ISM survey's new orders sub-index increased to 59.5 last month from 57.5 in April. A measure of factory employment jumped to a reading of 53.5 from 52.0 in April. Manufacturers of food and fabricated metals products reported difficulties finding qualified workers.

While raw materials prices rose for a 15th straight month, the pace of increase slowed sharply in May. The upbeat economic data helped lift U.S. stocks, with each of the major indexes hitting record highs. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury debt prices fell slightly. The ADP National Employment Report showed private payrolls increased by 253,000 jobs last month, beating economists' expectations for a gain of 185,000 jobs. Private payrolls rose by 174,000 jobs in April. The ADP report is jointly developed with Moody's Analytics and was released ahead of the Labor Department's more comprehensive nonfarm payrolls report on Friday, which includes both public and private-sector employment. A job seeker fills out an application at the King Soopers grocery store table at a job fair at the Denver Workforce Center in Denver, Colorado, U.S. February 15, 2017.Rick WilkingThe ADP report, however, is not a good predictor of the private payrolls component of the employment report.       According to a Reuters survey of economists, payrolls likely increased by 185,000 jobs in May after a gain of 211,000 in April. The unemployment rate is forecast to be unchanged at a 10-year low of 4.4 percent. Economy Firming Still, the ADP report added to data this week showing an acceleration in consumer spending in April.  The economy grew at a 1.2 percent annualized rate in the first quarter. The Atlanta Fed is forecasting gross domestic product increasing at a 4.0 percent pace in the second quarter. Minutes of the Fed's May 2-3 policy meeting, which were published last week, showed that while policymakers agreed they should hold off hiking rates until there was evidence the growth slowdown was transitory, most participants believed it would soon be appropriate to raise borrowing costs. The U.S. central bank hiked rates by 25 basis points in March. It is expected to do so again at its June 13-14 policy meeting. In a third report on Thursday, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits jumped 13,000 to a seasonally adjusted 248,000 for the week ended May 27.  It was the 117th straight week that claims were below 300,000, a threshold associated with a healthy labor market. That is the longest such stretch since 1970, when the labor market was smaller. A Labor Department official said claims for California and seven other states were estimated because of the Memorial Day holiday on Monday, which could have distorted the data. The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose only 2,500 to 238,000 last week. While the claims report put a damper on what has been a pretty upbeat run for most of the recent labor market data, we still have a fairly favorable view of labor market conditions, said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan in New York. The Fed said on Wednesday in its Beige Book report of anecdotal information on business activity collected from contacts nationwide that labor markets continued to tighten from early April through late May.  It also said most districts had cited worker shortages across a broadening range of occupations and regions. A fourth report by global outplacement consultancy Challenger, Gray & Christmas showed layoffs announced by U.S.-based employers fell 9 percent to 33,092 in May.

Other data on Thursday showed house prices increasing solidly in December amid strong demand for housing even as mortgage rates rose. The reports highlighted strength in the economy that could allow the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in the near-term. All indications are that job creation remains solid, underscoring the resiliency of the nearly eight-year economic recovery, said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors in Kalamazoo, Michigan. A March (rate) hike cannot be ruled out. Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 6,000 to a seasonally adjusted 244,000 for the week ended Feb. 18, the Labor Department said. It was the 103rd straight week that claims remained below 300,000, a threshold associated with a healthy labor market.  That is the longest stretch since 1970, when the labor market was much smaller. The labor market is at or close to full employment, with the unemployment rate at 4.8 percent. Economists had forecast new claims for unemployment benefits rising to 241,000 in the latest week. The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 4,000 to 241,000 last week, the lowest reading since July 1973. The economy could get a boost from a tax reform being mulled by the Trump administration. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Thursday he wanted to see very significant tax reform passed before Congress' August recess. Mnuchin, however, said the government was still studying the merits of a proposed border tax system.   Hopes of tax cuts have boosted business and consumer confidence in recent months. The dollar was trading lower against a basket of currencies, hitting a two-week low versus the yen. Stocks on Wall Street slipped, while prices for U.S. government debt rose. Minutes of the Federal Reserve's Jan 31-Feb 1 monetary policy meeting published on Wednesday showed that many policymakers believed another interest rate hike might be appropriate fairly soon if labor market and inflation data meet or beat expectations. The U.S. central bank raised its benchmark overnight interest rate last December. It has forecast three rate increases this year. Tight Labor Market Last week's claims report covered the survey period for the Labor Department's nonfarm payrolls data for February. The four-week average of claims fell 6,500 between the January and February payrolls survey weeks. This suggests another month of strong job gains after payrolls increased 227,000 in January. The message of this report remains that layoffs rates are extremely subdued, said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York. We view subdued layoffs as a sign of labor market tightness with employers retaining the labor they have amid elevated job openings and a lack of available workers. The tightening labor market is helping to underpin demand for housing. In a report on Thursday, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) said its house price index rose a seasonally adjusted 6.2 percent in December from a year ago. That followed a 6.1 percent gain in November. The FHFA's index is calculated by using purchase prices of houses financed with mortgages sold to or guaranteed by mortgage finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.  The higher home prices largely reflect tight housing inventories against the backdrop of strong demand. This is despite the 30-year fixed mortgage rate rising more than 50 basis points since November to above 4.0 percent. But with the home price increases outpacing wage growth, economists expect demand for housing to slow this year. While appreciation has remained strong lately, we look for some moderation in price increases over time along with some broader cooling in the housing data, said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan in New York.

In just one week, the couple has bought home appliances ranging from a rice cooker to a refrigerator and are purchasing a new car. Marriage is a kind of big spending commitment, said the 28-year-old financial consultant while shopping at an upscale mall in Gurugram, a satellite city and business hub near Delhi. It is an excuse to spend, not defer your purchases. Shukla is not alone. Millions like her are thronging shopping malls and stores in India, thanks to a busy wedding season. A heatwave is also boosting demand for air conditioners and refigerators. It's a welcome change for an economy where consumer spending, traditionally a driver of growth, took a blow after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's shock decision last November to scrap high-value bank notes. The prospect of another big reform - the launch of a multi-rate Goods and Services Tax (GST) from July 1 - could also be bringing forward spending into the current quarter as shoppers look to avoid rates of 28 percent, or higher, on some consumer durables and luxury items. The impact of the new tax regime is not clear -- some items are expected to be cheaper -- but the prospect of a price rise is seen pushing some people to buy ahead of July. The risk is spending falls away after the tax is launched. GST is a big unknown, said Kumar Rajagopalan, head of the Retailers Association of India. But it could turn out to be a big fillip in the short run. Other headwinds loom: Layoffs in the information-technology sector are unsettling some households at a time when the economy is still not generating enough new jobs for workforce that is growing by around a million people a month. High Frequency Economists polled by Reuters expect Asia's third-largest economy to expand by 7.1 percent on year in the January-March quarter, just up from 7.0 percent in the prior quarter and ahead of China's 6.9 percent growth rate. Some even expect a growth print as high as 7.8 percent when the GDP figures come out on Wednesday. India doesn't publish national figures on retail sales. But high-frequency indicators such as car sales, retail lending and goods imports show consumer spending has roared back to life. New passenger car sales grew at their fastest annual pace in at least 16 months in April. Imports of consumer goods last month surged by nearly a half from a year ago. Credit card loans growth is at its highest in at least 15 months. Quarterly earnings of consumer goods makers from Hindustan Unilever to auto maker Maruti have also been upbeat. The consumer rebound backs the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) prediction of a V-shaped recovery from the cash clampdown, whereas many in the private sector had expected a longer slump. With a good monsoon and government pay hikes in prospect, the outlook for a sustained recovery looks good. And as consumer spending powers more than half of India's economic growth, the recovery has bolstered the prospects of stronger growth. We hope these drivers will spread the recovery far and wide, said Kamal Nandi, business head of appliances at Godrej consumer products. Radhika Rao, an economist with DBS Bank in Singapore, reckons spending has recovered to near pre-demonetisation levels. It should get a leg up from the GST, she says, as the measure will reduce taxes on food and other essential items. Cost savings on non-discretionary items post-GST will boost discretionary spending, she said. An upward revision in GDP estimates might be warranted after Wednesday's data.

Nonfarm payrolls increased by 98,000 jobs last month, the   fewest since last May, the Labor Department said on Friday.  Job gains, which had exceeded 200,000 in January and February, were also held back by a slowdown in hiring at construction sites, factories and leisure and hospitality businesses, which had been boosted by unseasonably warm temperatures earlier in the year. In March, temperatures dropped and a storm lashed the Northeast and Midwest. Economists said bad weather accounted for the stepdown in hiring. The two-tenths of a percentage point drop in the unemployment rate from 4.7 percent in February took it to its lowest level since May 2007. The disappointing gain in nonfarm payrolls in March is a bit of a head fake that doesn't reflect the underlying strength and momentum in the labor market, said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco. While the bigger establishment survey showed fewer jobs created last month, the smaller and more volatile survey of households showed employment increased 472,000.  The economy needs to create 75,000 to 100,000 jobs per month to keep up with growth in the working-age population and some Federal Reserve officials view the labor market as being at full employment. Economists had forecast payrolls increasing 180,000 last month and the unemployment rate unchanged at 4.7 percent.

The solid employment gains suggest that an apparent slowdown in gross domestic product growth to around a 1.0 percent annualized pace in the first quarter is probably temporary. The economy grew at a 2.1 percent rate in the fourth quarter. A fast food restaurant advertises for workers on its front window in Encinitas, California.Mike BlakeAverage hourly earnings increased 5 cents or 0.2 percent in March after rising 0.3 percent in February. That lowered the year-on-year gain in wages to 2.7 percent.  But with inflation rising and the unemployment rate below the most recent Fed median forecast for full employment, economists expect another interest rate increase in June. The U.S. central bank lifted its overnight interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point in March and has forecast two more increases this year. Minutes from the Fed's mid-March meeting showed most policymakers expected to start reducing the Fed's $4.5 trillion bond portfolio later this year. New York Fed President William Dudley said on Friday that would prompt only a little pause in the central bank's rate hike plans. If today's decline in the unemployment rate doesn't reverse itself they may be compelled not only to hike but also to signal a faster pace of future tightening, said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan in New York.  Other measures also showed labor market slack shrinking. The labor force participation rate, or the share of working-age Americans who are employed or at least looking for a job, held at an 11-month high of 63 percent in March.  A broad measure of unemployment, which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment, fell three-tenths of a percentage point to 8.9 percent, the lowest level since December 2007. The employment-to-population ratio increased one-tenth of a percentage point to a fresh eight-year high of 60.1 percent.  Last month, construction jobs rose 6,000, the weakest gain since August, after robust increases in January and February. Manufacturing employment advanced by 11,000 jobs, slowing from the 26,000 positions created in February. Retail payrolls fell 29,700, declining for a second straight month. Employment at clothing retailers decreased by 5,800 jobs last month and general merchandise stores shed 34,700 positions. Retailers including J.C. Penney Co Inc and Macy's Inc have announced thousands of layoffs as they shift toward online sales and scale back on brick-and-mortar operations. Leisure and hospitality payrolls increased 9,000, a third of February's job gains, as employment at amusement parks fell 6,900. Government payrolls increased 9,000 as state and local government hiring offset a 1,000 drop in federal jobs. Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Andrea Ricci"

An analysis of two important indicators of retail profitability, gross margins and operating margins, shows retailers like Kohl's Corp (KSS.N), JC Penney Co Inc (JCP.N), Macy's Inc (M.N) and Target Corp (TGT.N) have done a better job at delivering on profitability than maintaining sales growth. This has given some investors hope for a recovery in a sector battered by the rise of online shopping led by Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), and competition from off-price chains like TJX Cos (TJX.N) and fast fashion retailers like Inditex's Zara. Margins have been relatively better compared to sales and they are finally taking important steps like closing unprofitable stores, said Charles Sizemore, founder of Sizemore Capital Management LLC, who owns shares of Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) and other retailers. The story right now is bad but we do expect some of these problems to bottom out over time. Gross margins at all four chains have remained steady over the past four years, helped by cost cutting initiatives like store closures. Operating margins have shown recent improvement at some chains like Kohl's and Target, steadily improved for JC Penney, but contracted for others like Macy's. Macy's gross margins at the end of the third quarter of 2016 stood at 39.8 percent, up slightly from 39.2 percent in 2013. Gross margins for Target, which straddles the discount and department store categories, were 30.2 percent in third quarter 2016, roughly unchanged from 30 percent in 2013. JC Penney improved its gross margins over the four-year period, whereas Kohl's has held steady. Operating margins are more sensitive to changes the retailers have made through layoffs. Target stood at 6.5 percent in 2016 up slightly from results for the last two years but down from 10.6 percent in 2013. Target in that time has left foreign markets and sold off lower-margin, non-core businesses like its pharmacy operations. A man with a Macy's bag walks past the J.C. Penney's store in New York, April 11, 2013.Brendan McDermid/File PhotoKohl's operating margins were 7 percent in third quarter 2016 up from 2015 and similar to 2014 but down from 8.2 percent in 2013. Macy's had seen operating margins contract to 1.9 percent in 2016 from 5.7 percent in 2013. JC Penney stood at 0.8 percent in 2016, up substantially from improving every year from a rock bottom level of negative margins of 14.4 in 2013. Sales are not impressive, but investors are most concerned with profitability and long-term value, Neil Saunders, chief executive officer at research firm Conlumino said. These companies have done a better job keeping the business running on the operational side and delivering on profitability.  Slideshow (2 Images)Squeezing Costs In recent weeks, most department stores have reported a drop in holiday season sales, which includes stores and online. Some have even slashed their earnings outlooks. This contrasts with industry-wide results, a 4 percent increase in the 2016 holiday season, to $658.3 billion, according to the National Retail Federation. The companies continue to make economy measures such as reducing inventory, pressuring suppliers for lower prices and cutting supply chain costs.  For example, Kohl's has said it will offer discounts during the holiday season but cut down on promotions during the rest of the year.  Christina Boni, vice president and senior credit analyst at ratings firm Moody's, expects operating margins at many department store chains to remain steady unless sales fall dramatically.  These companies still have the ability to stabilize their business by taking costs out of the system and generating significant free cash flow to invest in new areas, which will improve operating margins, she said.

This has given some investors hope for a recovery in a sector battered by the rise of online shopping led by Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), and competition from off-price chains like TJX Cos (TJX.N) and fast fashion retailers like Inditex's Zara. Margins have been relatively better compared to sales and they are finally taking important steps like closing unprofitable stores, said Charles Sizemore, founder of Sizemore Capital Management LLC, who owns shares of Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) and other retailers. The story right now is bad but we do expect some of these problems to bottom out over time. Gross margins at all four chains have remained steady over the past four years, helped by cost cutting initiatives like store closures. Operating margins have shown recent improvement at some chains like Kohl's and Target, steadily improved for JC Penney, but contracted for others like Macy's. Macy's gross margins at the end of the third quarter of 2016 stood at 39.8 percent, up slightly from 39.2 percent in 2013. Gross margins for Target, which straddles the discount and department store categories, were 30.2 percent in third quarter 2016, roughly unchanged from 30 percent in 2013. JC Penney improved its gross margins over the four-year period, whereas Kohl's has held steady. Operating margins are more sensitive to changes the retailers have made through layoffs. Target stood at 6.5 percent in 2016 up slightly from results for the last two years but down from 10.6 percent in 2013. Target in that time has left foreign markets and sold off lower-margin, non-core businesses like its pharmacy operations. A man with a Macy's bag walks past the J.C. Penney's store in New York, April 11, 2013.Brendan McDermid/File PhotoKohl's operating margins were 7 percent in third quarter 2016 up from 2015 and similar to 2014 but down from 8.2 percent in 2013. Macy's had seen operating margins contract to 1.9 percent in 2016 from 5.7 percent in 2013. JC Penney stood at 0.8 percent in 2016, up substantially from improving every year from a rock bottom level of negative margins of 14.4 in 2013. Sales are not impressive, but investors are most concerned with profitability and long-term value, Neil Saunders, chief executive officer at research firm Conlumino said. These companies have done a better job keeping the business running on the operational side and delivering on profitability.  Slideshow (2 Images)Squeezing Costs In recent weeks, most department stores have reported a drop in holiday season sales, which includes stores and online. Some have even slashed their earnings outlooks. This contrasts with industry-wide results, a 4 percent increase in the 2016 holiday season, to $658.3 billion, according to the National Retail Federation. The companies continue to make economy measures such as reducing inventory, pressuring suppliers for lower prices and cutting supply chain costs.  For example, Kohl's has said it will offer discounts during the holiday season but cut down on promotions during the rest of the year.  Christina Boni, vice president and senior credit analyst at ratings firm Moody's, expects operating margins at many department store chains to remain steady unless sales fall dramatically.  These companies still have the ability to stabilize their business by taking costs out of the system and generating significant free cash flow to invest in new areas, which will improve operating margins, she said.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-chevron-results-idUSKBN15B1DH","Chevron profit miss hurts stock, Dow Jones index","","January 27, 2017 /  2:28 PM / 6 months ago","","(Reuters) - Helped by rising oil prices, Chevron Corp (CVX.N) swung to a quarterly profit on Friday that still fell short of analyst expectations, dragging down the company's share price, and with it, the Dow Jones industrial average .DJI index. The results showed that Wall Street analysts overestimated how much the No. 2 U.S. oil producer could improve with cost cuts in the quarter after two years of lackluster results. Sometimes when things are going well, it's not uncommon for the Street to be optimistic, said Brian Youngberg, an analyst at Edward Jones. Since the end of 2014, Chevron has laid off 9.500 employees and slashed its annual budget to boost results and protect its dividend, which Chief Executive John Watson said on a Friday call with investors remained his top priority. Most layoffs are behind us, he said. The trend of spend is down, Watson said, forecasting the company will be cash-flow neutral this year. We've made remarkable progress bringing our costs down. Like many U.S. oil producers, Chevron has benefited from the OPEC oil cartel's move to curtail production, which has helped lift crude prices CLc1 in recent months.      The California-based company posted a net income of $415 million, or 22 cents per share, after a net loss of $588 million, or 31 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, the company earned 21 cents per share. By that measure, analysts expected earnings of 64 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Despite missing expectations, Chevron still is seen by many as a top-notch oil producer. The overall investment thesis hasn't changed at all, Youngberg said. Production fell slightly to 2.7 million barrels of oil equivalent per day.     Earnings rose in the company's upstream segments, which pump oil and gas, but dropped in the refining segments due to lower margins and higher taxes.  Chevron's flagship Richmond, Calif., refinery, which is undergoing a $1 billion renovation, also had downtime during the quarter, denting profit. Watson said he expected the company's Wheatstone liquefied natural gas (LNG) project in Australia to come online this year. The nearby Gorgon LNG facility has shipped 10 LNG tankers since Jan. 1, he said. In the Permian Basin of Texas, where Chevron controls more than 1 million acres of oil-rich land, the company plans to add a new drilling rig every 8 weeks, Watson said.

The decision reflects the shift by shoppers toward buying groceries outside of grocery stores, as well as Kellogg's continued focus on revitalizing its snack business.      The distribution model change is part of an expanded Project K program, which Kellogg launched in 2013 to save up to $475 million annually by 2018 through job cuts and production optimization. Kellogg said it will close its distribution centers and that there would be layoffs, though it declined to provide details. Out of respect for employees who are still being notified, we are not sharing that information at this time, Kellogg said in a statement. Kellogg already distributes about 75 percent of its U.S. sales through warehouses, including products in its frozen foods and morning foods businesses.     The direct-store delivery model was part of the appeal that drew Kellogg to its 2001 $3.6 billion acquisition of Keebler snacks. Kellogg used the deal as a launching pad for its snack platform, adding chip company Pringles in 2012, in a deal valued at $2.7 billion.     The U.S. snacks business, which also includes Cheez-It crackers and Special K cereal bars, accounted for about 25 percent of Kellogg's sales in the third quarter. These sales declined in 2014 through the first half of 2016, before flattening out in the third quarter, led by core brands Cheez-It and Pringles. Kellogg, which is scheduled to report fourth-quarter results on Thursday, said it would start the transition in the second quarter of 2017 and expects to complete the move in the fourth quarter.     We believe (the move) will help us grow the business in the long term, taking resources tied up in distribution and putting them back into the brands themselves, said John Bryant, chairman and chief executive of Kellogg.     The company, which also makes Pop-Tarts and Fruit Loops, said it would provide severance, benefits and retention packages to employees impacted by the transition.     Kellogg's shares were marginally higher, up 0.15 percent at $73.60, in trading after the bell.

The creaking American, now ranked 666th after his long injury layoff, trailed Spain's early leader Sergio Garcia by 12 shots and with only three players below him on the leaderboard among the morning starters. I was just trying to hit shots and I wasn't doing a very good job, Woods told reporters. At the end, I finally hit some good ones but the damage had already been done. I could have hung in there. I could have shot something near even par if I would have made some putts but I made nothing.  Appearing for the eighth time in Dubai, where he has won twice with a 92-under par record for the 28 rounds played there since 2001, the 41-year-old Woods looked out of sorts as he continued his comeback at the European Tour event. The numbers from the opening round were not pretty, two shots higher than his previous worst ever at the Emirates Golf Club, and nor was his swing or his putting stroke. The 14-times major winner had also looked rusty last week when he played his first full-field PGA Tour event in 17 months after being sidelined by back pain and spine surgery, and missed the cut at the Farmers Insurance Open at Torrey Pines. His chances of avoiding another early exit looked slim on Thursday, with the American appearing to be in some discomfort as he struggled to find a rhythm and reached the turn in a three-over 40 after two bogeys in his opening three holes. Starting on the back nine, he bogeyed the par-five opener after finding a bunker and dropped another shot at the 12th. At the par-five 18th, his approach shot fell short of the green and rolled back into the water for his third bogey of the day. The fifth turned into a three-putt bogey and he missed par from five feet on the next.     While Woods struggled, Garcia fired a first round 65 to set the early target and open up a one-shot clubhouse lead over Chile's Felipe Aguilar and South African George Coetzee. It was a nice way to start, a good solid round, Garcia said.  Defending champion Danny Willett, the U.S. Masters winner who was playing alongside Woods and fellow Briton Matt Fitzpatrick (69), started with a one-under 71.

    * Loonie touches its strongest since Monday at C$1.3343
    * Bond prices higher across a flatter yield curve
    * 10-year yield hits four-month low at 1.505 percent

    By Fergal Smith
    TORONTO, April 7 (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar
strengthened on Friday to a four-day high against its U.S.
counterpart, boosted by stronger-than-anticipated domestic
employment data, while U.S. job gains undershot expectations.   
    Canada added 19,400 jobs in March, most of them full-time,
Statistics Canada data showed. Analysts in a Reuters poll had
forecast 5,000 new positions.             
    It is still indicating that firms are confident to take on
workers, said Paul Ferley, assistant chief economist at Royal
Bank of Canada.
    March marked the fourth month in a row that Canada has added
jobs, the latest sign the economy is recovering from a prolonged
slump caused by low oil prices.
    Still, economists doubt that the Bank of Canada will drop
its cautious tone next week when it releases its interest rate
announcement and Monetary Policy Report.
    Policy is likely to remain unchanged, probably supported by
ongoing concern about those external risks, Ferley said.
    The implied probability of an interest rate hike this year
increased from less than 20 percent before the data, but
remained at less than a one-in-four chance, data from overnight
index swaps showed.           
    U.S. job growth slowed sharply in March amid continued
layoffs in the retail sector. But a drop in the unemployment
rate to a near 10-year low of 4.5 percent suggested the labor
market was still tightening.             
    At 9:50 a.m. ET (1350 GMT), the Canadian dollar          was
trading at C$1.3360 to the greenback, or 74.85 U.S. cents,
stronger than Thursday's close of C$1.3418, or 74.53 U.S. cents.
    The currency's weakest level of the session was C$1.3431,
while it touched its strongest since Monday at C$1.3343.
    Gains for the loonie came as prices of oil, one of Canada's
major exports, rose after the United States fired missiles at a
Syrian government air base, sending shockwaves through global
markets and raising concerns that the conflict could spread in
the oil-rich region.      
    U.S. crude        prices were up 0.46 percent at $51.94 a
barrel.
    Canadian government bond prices were higher across the yield
curve in sympathy with U.S. Treasuries and other safe-haven
assets. The two-year            rose 0.5 of a Canadian cent to
yield 0.723 percent and the 10-year             gained 19
Canadian cents to yield 1.527 percent.
    The 10-year yield touched its lowest intraday since Nov. 17
at 1.505 percent.

Gatta, 41, an investment professional who worked at various private equity firms including Basso Capital Management and Pegasus Capital Advisors, will replace CEO Phil Rinaldi, who is retiring in March. Rinaldi has been CEO of the privately held company since 2010, when Carlyle Group and Sunoco formed a joint venture to rescue the Philadelphia refinery, the largest and oldest on the U.S. East Coast. The transition comes as the 335,000-barrel-per-day plant is fighting to survive an industry downturn that has hit the U.S. East Coast particularly hard. Despite the recent setbacks, U.S. East Coast refineries remain essential parts of the nation's energy ecosystem, Gatta said, noting that the densely populated region is short on products, requiring Gulf Coast refiners and imports to make up the difference. I am pretty bullish on the East Coast refining market, Gatta said in a phone interview on Wednesday. The private equity experience instilled a disciplined approach to buying assets and improving them, Gatta said. The last few years, Gatta said, he has experienced all facets of the refining industry. “I am a sophisticated financial investor, but I feel like I am an experienced refiner as well,” he said. Gatta declined to discuss any significant operational changes he may pursue at the refinery, such as adjusting the crude slate or product yields, but noted that he and his team were going to look under every rock to see where they can optimize operations. Rinaldi was the region's strongest advocate for energy expansion as the refinery turned profits off cheap crude flowing out of North Dakota. He was also the face of the effort to bring a natural gas pipeline into Philadelphia that could be used for industrial purposes. Gatta said supports Rinaldi's vision but said he will not assume the role as the face of the effort. Boom turned to bust by the end of 2015, however, as the Bakken discount to the U.S. benchmark crude price disappeared, production dropped and more pipeline capacity came online. The refinery has suffered several high-profile setbacks in the past two years, including a failed effort to take the company public, followed by layoffs and benefit cuts amid weak margins. Moody's and Standard & Poor's have recently downgraded the company's debt amid concerns about falling profits.   (Reporting By Jarrett Renshaw; Editing by Chris Reese and Meredith Mazzilli)"

In his $18 billion general fund spending plan for 2018, Malloy also proposed roughly $320 million of revenue generators to close the gap, including the elimination of property tax credits on personal income taxes. In the following year of the two-year budget proposal, another $1.64 billion in cuts would be required to close a bigger deficit of $1.9 billion, according to budget documents released in conjunction with the Democratic governor's address to lawmakers. (bit.ly/2kTvlGP) These cuts are not made lightly, Malloy said. They include things that I myself strongly support. Including all funds, his biennial budget is $40.6 billion for the next two years combined. The proposal, if adopted, would result in an eight-year period in which the state general fund budget grew only 2 percent on average, he said. Connecticut has been daunted by slow revenue growth as fixed costs, including for public pensions hit by poor investment returns, continue to balloon. Malloy proposed shifting a third of the costs of the state teachers' pension fund - or about $408 million in fiscal 2018 - to local governments, which currently pay nothing into the Teachers Retirement System despite retaining local control of school staffing levels. The biggest portion of savings next year would come from $700 million of concessions, mostly on pension and health benefits, from the 15 unions that make up the State Employees Bargaining Agent Coalition (SEBAC). In 2019, those concessions would add up to another $868 million in taxpayer savings. The state's contract with SEBAC does not expire until 2022, so it is seeking voluntary changes from the unions. If there is no deal, Malloy's budget calls for layoffs of up to 4,200 state employees in order to save the money, though he said in his address that he is a staunch, lifelong advocate for the right to organize. As expected, Malloy also proposed an expansion of the state's system for municipal intervention to help avert a crisis in cities struggling with fiscal problems. It is in our collective best interest that no town be brought to the brink of bankruptcy, Malloy said. Additional measures to generate revenue include hiking tobacco taxes and lowering the state's Earned Income Tax Credit, used by low- and moderate-income families, by 2.5 percentage points to 25 percent of the federal benefit level.

The Grizzlies are 3-5 in their last eight contests overall following a winless two-game trip to Texas, capped by Saturday's 123-108 loss to Houston. The visit from the Nets begins a four-game homestand that Memphis hopes will key a turnaround as it jockeys for position in the Western Conference playoff race. It's huge.

The strike poses a test for center-right President Mauricio Macri's administration, which is increasingly clashing with the country's powerful unions ahead of legislative elections in October. Macri's coalition is banking on success in the midterm vote to continue its agenda of market-friendly reforms.  The outcome of Argentina's annual wage negotiations are closely watched by economists as salary hikes far above the central bank's target for 12-17 percent inflation in 2017 could make it more difficult for the government to control inflation.  Monday's strike comes after unions and many provincial governments failed to reach salary agreements, with teachers demanding that wage hikes compensate for purchasing power lost in 2016, when inflation totaled around 40 percent.  The strike is massive across the whole country, Roberto Baradel, a Buenos Aires province teachers' union leader, said in an interview with local television channel Crónica.  Thousands of teachers took to the streets, delaying the first day of school for millions of children, as part of a two-day national strike demanding a wage increase, in Buenos Aires, Argentina March 6, 2017.Martin AcostaTeachers in Argentina's largest province of Buenos Aires have demanded wage increases of 35 percent for 2017, while Governor Maria Eugenia Vidal - a close Macri ally - has offered them an 18 percent raise.  In a speech last month, central bank President Federico Sturzenegger said salary hikes slightly above the central bank's target would not compromise the monetary authority's ability to meet its target.  An empty classroom is seen at a public school as thousands of teachers took to the streets, delaying the first day of school for millions of children, as part of a two-day national strike demanding a wage increase, in Buenos Aires, Argentina.Martin AcostaThe bank workers' union, seen as a bellwether for the rest of the private sector, reached a deal with employers for a 24.3 percent wage increase last month.  Unions are becoming more vocal in their opposition to some of Macri's pro-market policies. Since taking over in December 2015 after more than a decade of populist rule, Macri has allowed the peso currency to float, reduced subsidies and eliminated tariffs intended to promote domestic manufacturing. A promised wave of investments has not yet arrived and the economy has struggled to rebound from a deep recession. On Tuesday, the country's largest union has planned another protest to demand higher salaries and demonstrate against layoffs.      I greatly regret that they have chosen the opportunistic route of a strike, Macri said of the teachers while visiting a rural school in Argentina's northwestern Jujuy province.

The Briton, who had a first-round bye, had not played competitive tennis since injuring his elbow in March and began with three double faults as he lost his opening service game. Left-hander Muller served for the first set but Murray dug himself out of trouble to move through. Rafael Nadal began his quest for a 10th title in the principality but was also made to work hard by Murray's compatriot Kyle Edmund - winning 6-0 5-7 6-3.

The European Commission could not immediately confirm the report of a preliminary deal. The report drove Greek government bond yields to multi-week lows. Negotiations between Athens, the European Union and the International Monetary Fund -- which has yet to decide if it will participate in Greece's current bailout -- have dragged on for months, rekindling fears of a new crisis in Europe. The latest progress is expected to help allow the return of EU and IMF mission chiefs to Athens in the coming days to finalize details with Greek finance and labor ministers before the Eurogroup meeting in Malta.  The main focus of the talks has been pension cuts, energy and labor reforms. Athens agreed last month to adopt more measures, worth 2 percent of GDP, to help convince the IMF to participate in the bailout, which is sought by EU countries including Germany.  Greece will cut pension spending by up to 1 percent of GDP in 2019, two officials told Reuters on condition of anonymity. Lowering the tax-free threshold would raise roughly another 1 percent of GDP has also been agreed, an EU official said. I believe there will be a staff level agreement by the April 7 Eurogroup, one of the officials said.   A piggybank painted in the colours of the Greek flag stands amongst various euro coins in front of letters spelling the word 'GREECE' in this picture illustration taken in Berlin, Germany June 30, 2015.Pawel KopczynskiCollective Bargaining On labor reforms, Greece will not be forced to ease present restrictions on collective redundancies initially sought by the IMF, another official said.  Collective bargaining, which was weakened as part of bailout reforms in 2012, is expected to be revived after the country's current bailout program expires in 2018. Greece and lenders are still negotiating other labor issues.   Slashing the market share of state-controlled Public Power Corp (DEHr.AT) through the sale of coal-fired units, has also been agreed, another official said. However, an energy ministry official said the issue was still under discussion.  Any PPC move to sell assets is likely to stir controversy, and labor unions have already warned of industrial action if it goes ahead. Energy Minister George Stathakis was due on Friday to tour northern Greece, where PPC is a big employer. Greece will start legislating for the reforms agreed once the deal is sealed, a government spokesman said, adding that the negotiation was still ongoing. On Tuesday the government submitted to parliament a bill on an out-of-court settlement of non-performing corporate loans.  Greece hopes that wrapping up the second review of bailout progress will pave the way for crucial talks on post-bailout debt relief. Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos has said debt restructuring would help the country return to markets before its bailout expires. Earlier, a spokesman for the European Stability Mechanism, the euro zone's bailout fund said that possible additional debt relief for Greece could be decided only at the end of the bailout program.

Djokovic missed the Masters series event with an elbow injury and, having recovered, is eager to face Spain in the Davis Cup quarter-finals in front of a boisterous home crowd next weekend.  Of course I wanted to be on the court and defend my title but it just didn't happen this time, Djokovic told a news conference in the Serbian capital's Aleksandar Nikolic arena. At the same time, it was also rather refreshing to get some rest and sit out Miami at home with my wife and son. It was quality family time which I don’t get enough of and it made me very happy, he said. A hardcourt tie is not an ideal preparation for the clay court season but given that I was away for a few weeks after a patchy start to the season, I need as many matches as possible to get back into my stride irrespective of the surface. Djokovic added: The Davis Cup is a very special event as it generates the kind of home crowd atmosphere you don’t see on the ATP Tour, so I am really looking forward to performing in front of our fans. I always draw very positive energy from the Davis Cup as it invariably brings out the best in me. Having dominated for several years to rack up 12 grand slam tournaments after clinching his maiden French Open title last June, Djokovic then suffered a dramatic loss of form which saw him ousted as the world number one by Briton Andy Murray. With Murray also playing in fits and starts in the early stages of the season, Djokovic heaped praise on the evergreen Roger Federer after the Swiss maestro won the Miami Open following his Australian Open triumph in January. What Federer has accomplished this year is admirable and it shows that one can play at the top level even at his age. He’s had his ups and downs in the last three or four years but came back swinging and revitalized after a six-month layoff last year, said Djokovic.  He said the Miami Open final between Federer and Nadal was as outstanding as anyone might have expected from the greatest rivalry ever. Nadal will skip Spain's clash with Serbia.

House Appropriations Committee Chairman Rodney Frelinghuysen introduced a bill late on Wednesday night to fund government operations at current levels for one more week, giving leading Republicans and Democrats time to finish negotiations on a spending plan for the rest of the fiscal year ending on Sept. 30. Without the congressional extension or a longer-term funding bill, federal agencies will run out of money by midnight Friday, likely triggering abrupt layoffs of hundreds of thousands of federal government workers until funding resumes. The last government shutdown, in 2013, lasted for 17 days, and many lawmakers are nervous at the prospect of another. I am optimistic that a final funding package will be completed soon, Frelinghuysen, a New Jersey Republican, said in a statement. Negotiators spent Wednesday racing against the clock to resolve remaining disputes in the massive spending bill amid talks that have already handed Democrats at least two major victories despite Republican control of Congress. President Donald Trump, also a Republican, gave in to Democratic demands that the spending bill not include money to start building the wall he wants to erect on the U.S.-Mexico border. His administration also agreed to continue funding for a major component of the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, despite vows to end the program. It remained unclear whether Republicans would prevail in their effort to significantly increase defense spending without similar increases to other domestic programs. Trump has proposed a $30 billion spending boost for the Pentagon for the rest of this fiscal year. Such funding disputes could resurface later in spending bills for the next fiscal year starting in October. Other disagreements must also still be ironed out in the current plan, including funding to make a healthcare program for coal miners permanent and to plug a gap in Puerto Rico's Medicaid program, the government health insurance program for the poor. Additional riders on other issues could also be tucked into the legislation, which must pass both the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate. Although Republicans control both chambers of Congress, they hold just 52 seats in the Senate and will need support from some Democrats to win the 60 votes needed there to pass the bill.

The Scotsman captured the only two PGA Tour titles of his career last season and started the 2016-17 campaign with top-10 finishes in Malaysia, China, and Mayakoba.  He has since struggled, however, and now hopes to draw on happy memories at TPC River Highlands.  I haven't played nearly as good as I expected to. But at the same time, I almost expected it (a dip) coming off last year, my best year as a pro by a long way, Knox, who will tee off with twice Travelers winner Bubba Watson and Australian Marc Leishman in Thursday's opening round, told reporters. So maybe it was inevitable that it was going to be a slight downwards turn. But recently my game feels pretty good. All in all, I'm excited to be here, and hopefully this year the Travelers Championship can get me going a good kick start to a big summer. Knox, who missed the cut at last week's U.S. Open, will be among a star-studded field headed by world number three Rory McIlroy, Australian Jason Day, two-times major winner Jordan Spieth and Watson. Northern Irishman McIlroy, who also missed the cut last week at Erin Hills in his first event back from a month-long layoff with a niggling rib problem, will be making his Connecticut debut on a par-70 layout that should suit his style of play. Birdies will be especially crucial to success this week given that the tournament has produced a winning score of 10 under or lower every year since 1994. No other golfer in the field knows more about going low at TPC River Highlands than Jim Furyk, whose final-round 58 last year is the lowest round ever on the PGA Tour. The 17-times PGA Tour winner will be joined in Connecticut by another member of the sub-60 club in world number 12 Justin Thomas, who enters the week in great form. In addition to three wins this season, Thomas has three top-10 finishes in his last four starts, including a share of ninth place at the U.S. Open, and leads the PGA Tour in birdie average and is fourth in scoring average.

Freeport is trying to ramp up output and exports at Grasberg after reaching a temporary deal with the government following a 15-week stoppage linked to new mining rules, but customers are concerned that labor unrest could now hit supply. Freeport had laid off about 10 percent of its workforce and warned it could cut another 5,000 to stem losses, sparking protests from workers. We are still waiting. We have good intention by opening up in a transparent and fair manner so the problem can be solved. We actually don't want a strike to happen, said union leader Aser Gobai, adding that about 8,000 workers had participated in the rally in Timika, the nearest town to the mine.

London Metal Exchange prices were last at $5,735 a tonne, up 4 percent this year.  Adding to tensions around Grasberg, several Freeport workers and police were injured in a clash in Papua last month, when officers fired tear gas and rubber bullets at demonstrators in Timika who authorities said had been attempting to free a union leader at a court hearing.     New rules in Indonesia require Freeport to obtain a new mining permit, divest a 51 percent stake, build a second copper smelter, relinquish arbitration rights and pay new taxes and royalties.

The newspaper publisher's shares rose as much as 12 percent on Wednesday. The company added 308,000 net digital news subscriptions in the quarter, topping the previous quarter's tally of 276,000. The Times has been building up on the online readership it gained during the U.S. presidential election by marketing unbiased reporting in the face of President Donald Trump's combative view of traditional news media. Trump has repeatedly criticized the press, including the Times, calling it fake news and the enemy of the American People! In response, the New York Times launched its Truth campaign, including its first TV ad in seven years, urging readers to sign up in order to support its fair and accurate reporting. Even the President of the United States was kind enough to draw attention to it, Chief Executive Mark Thompson said on a post-earnings call with analysts on Wednesday, referring to the campaign. New York Times' paid digital-only subscriptions stood at about 2.2 million at the end of the first quarter of 2017, soaring more than 60 percent from a year earlier, and up 16 percent from the end of the preceding quarter. Thompson called the first quarter the single best quarter for subscriber growth in the company's history. Total revenue rose to 5.1 percent to $398.8 million, beating the average analyst estimate of $381.96 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

The pay hike will be phased in citywide by 2024 and makes Minneapolis the first city in the Midwest to set a timetable for a $15 minimum wage. The measure, an effective pay increase of 58 percent for workers at large businesses and 94 percent for those at small ones, was approved by an 11-1 vote. Large businesses, including fast-food chains, must pay at least $10 an hour beginning Jan. 1, according to a news release from the city. On July 1, 2018, small businesses will have to pay $10.25 and the rate will go to $11.25 for large ones. Supporters of the $15 minimum wage in Minneapolis and other cities believe it provides a floor of support for those on the lowest rung of the economic ladder, including many single mothers and children. But critics say required pay increases lead to layoffs and force some employers out of business. The bottom line here is that we have huge disparities in our country and this is one of the ways we can address that, City Councilwoman Linea Palmisano said at the council meeting. In Minneapolis, Minnesota's biggest city, more than 70,000 workers stand to benefit from the increase, supporters say. But it is likely to be monitored closely for any negative impact on the labor market. Minnesota's current minimum wage - $9.50 for large businesses and $7.75 for small companies - is already the highest in the Midwest. City Councilman Blong Yang, who cast the lone dissenting vote, said he was concerned the ordinance would overburden small businesses, including many owned by minority groups, and would raise prices in the city. We cannot make Minneapolis an island, Yang said at the meeting. Los Angeles, the nation's second-largest city, as well as San Francisco, Seattle and some others have already approved measures to increase base pay to $15 an hour. Under a law approved last year, California set a $15 target for all workers, which it plans to reach in 2023. New York State is also gradually increasing its minimum wage to $15 an hour for all workers under a bill signed by the governor last year."

GM's vehicle inventory in the United States hit a 10-year high in June at 105 days supply. The company in April told investors it expected inventories would decline to a 90-day supply at the end of June, and fall to 70 days by the end of the year. Cutting vehicle production also cuts GM's revenue and potentially profits. The automaker also builds the Chevrolet Sonic small car at the Orion plant, and sales of that car are down nearly 37 percent for the year to date. A spokesman for the company said the shutdown at Orion was due solely to softening sales of the Sonic model, adding that its production plan for the Bolt for this year was unchanged. GM has sold 7,592 Bolts through the first six months of this year, after rolling out the car at the end of 2016. From June 1 to July 1, supplies of the Bolt rose to 111 days from 104 days. GM launched the Bolt in California, but has said the car will be available in all 50 states by August.  On Monday, Paul Masse Chevrolet in East Providence, Rhode Island, advertised on its website that it had more than 200 Bolts in inventory at prices ranging from $35,688 to $41,488.  The Bolt is the first electric car in the U.S. market to offer more than 200 miles of driving range per charge at a starting price of around $35,000.  Tesla Motors Inc's Model 3 will offer roughly the same driving range at a similar starting price.

Freeport is at loggerheads with Indonesia over rights to the Grasberg mine in Papua in a dispute that has cost both sides hundreds of millions of dollars, and tensions with workers threaten to disrupt the mine's operations further. Freeport resumed copper concentrate export shipments from Grasberg late last month after a 15-week outage stemming from the dispute with government and had planned to ramp up production after it was cut by around two-thirds during the outage. As of mid-April Freeport had demobilized around 10 percent of its Indonesian workforce of 32,000 among efforts to cut costs resulting from the dispute. The company has repeatedly warned workers that striking will result in disciplinary action. The union has demanded an end to Freeport's furlough policy and began a 30-day strike on May 1 in an effort to get workers' jobs back. We will extend the strike for 30 more days, Freeport Indonesia union industrial relations officer Tri Puspital told Reuters on Saturday, referring to a government recommendation for a resolution of the matter. We regret the stance of the businessmen who unilaterally laid off workers, Puspital said. It is a kind of discrimination in terms of disciplinary action. According to Puspital, output from Grasberg has been reduced by half as result of the strike, but he stopped short of providing further detail. In a Freeport inter-office memo titled Making the Right Choice for Your Family and You obtained by Reuters, the company said the strike was illegal and that voluntary resignation is the consequence for workers that ignored demands to return to work and were absent for five consecutive days. Already, 840 workers have suffered this consequence and others will follow if they do not immediately contact the company, the memo dated May 15 said. A U.S.-based spokesman for Freeport referred to a recent statement in response to Reuters questions on the strike and its impact on operations. Worker absenteeism since mid April has unfavorably impacted mining and milling rates, it said, noting that the company is working with union leaders, with the support of Indonesian government officials, to encourage a safe and efficient return to normal operations for the benefit of all stakeholders. Freeport Indonesia plans to ramp up its production to full rates during second-quarter 2017, it said.

Washington in April imposed preliminary anti-subsidy duties averaging 20 percent on imports of Canadian softwood lumber. U.S. producers say the exports are unfairly subsidized, a charge Canada strongly denies. Canadian workers are under pressure because of duties which are unfair and punitive... we're not going to let those Canadian workers, those Canadian families, be hurt and stand idly by.

The dispute has increased tensions between Canada and the United States ahead of talks on renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement. Mexico is also a member of the pact. Most of the aid - up to C$605 million - will be in the form of loans, loan guarantees and commercial financing. Reuters revealed the outlines of the package on Wednesday.

Industry Minister Carlo Calenda has signed a decree backing the 1.8 billion euro ($2 billion) offer from the world's largest steelmaker and Marcegaglia for Europe's biggest steel plant by output capacity, the ministry said in a statement.  Italy has been trying to sell Ilva, which is near the port city of Taranto, since 2015 when the state took full control of the plant in a bid to clean up the polluted site and save thousands of jobs in an economically depressed area. The commissioners running Ilva said last month the ArcelorMittal consortium had won the bidding but unions opposed the thousands of layoffs involved in its plan. A rival consortium led by India's JSW Steel raised its offer. Under the plan presented by the ArcelorMittal consortium, called Am Investco Italy, Ilva's total workforce, which includes two smaller bases in northern Italy, will be cut from more than 14,000 to eventually reach 8,480 by 2024, the ministry said. Up to 4,100 of those to be laid off will be eligible for state unemployment support. Am Investco has said it was open to trying to reduce the number of job losses in the near term, the ministry said. The next step in the sale process involves the environment ministry examining Am Investco's plans for cleaning up the site. Once the ministry issues its decree, expected during autumn this year, the deal must be approved by the European Union. Steel production will remain at 6 million tonnes a year during the clean-up of the site, which magistrates sequestered in 2012 amid allegations its emissions were causing abnormally high cancer rates. ArcelorMittal chief executive Lakshmi Mittal said in a statement that the company will work with all interested parties to guarantee Ilva, its workers and the regions where it operates a better, more stable and sustainable future. By 2024, Am Investco aims to have boosted output to the full 8 million tonnes Ilva is authorised to produce, the statement said, using three of Ilva's original five furnaces.

The loss, which compares with a net profit of $103 million a year earlier, was the first for the Abu Dhabi-based airline since it started making money in 2011. Middle Eastern airlines have seen growth slow over the past two years as regional travel budgets tightened due to lower oil prices and a wave of militant attacks in Europe and Turkey weakened east to west traffic flows. With fares also under pressure from stiff competition, Emirates, the region's largest airline, reported in May its first decline in annual profit in five years, State-owned Etihad is undergoing a period of change, with long-serving Chief Executive James Hogan departing on July 1. The 14-year-old airline appointed Irishman Ray Gammell as interim CEO in May. Hogan oversaw a rapid expansion in part by buying minority stakes in other airlines as Etihad raced to catch up with Emirates [EMIRA.UL] and Qatar Airways. That strategy seemingly began to unravel in April when Italy's Alitalia, Etihad's most high profile investment, filed for special administration for the second time in less than a decade after workers rejected a rescue plan.   Last week, Etihad also sold its minority stake in a European regional carrier, the first divestment since launching a strategic review last year. It continues to hold minority stakes in six other airlines. Etihad booked one-off impairments of $1.9 billion for 2016 that included $1.06 billion on aircraft and $808 million on certain assets and financial exposures to equity partners, mainly related to Alitalia [CAITLA.UL] and Air Berlin ABI.DE, it said on Thursday.  Legacy fuel hedging contracts also impacted the 2016 performance, it said, adding they were expected to have less of an effect this year. Etihad's revenue fell 7.1 percent to $8.36 billion last year, even though it carried 18.5 million passengers, up 5.1 percent on the year. Load factor - or number of seats filled - was down slightly to 78.6 percent.  This year is just as challenging for the global aviation industry and the ever-evolving competitive environment is likely to impact overall performance in 2017, Gammell said in a statement. Etihad has cut 4 percent of overhead costs through layoffs and other measures as part of its strategic review, he added. The airline did not say how many jobs had been cut, though sources tell Reuters hundreds of employees have left positions since the start of the year.  Editing by Mark Potter"
"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-economy-restructuring-idUSKCN11W0ER","China launches $52.5 billion fund to restructure state enterprises","","September 26, 2016 /  6:10 AM / 10 months ago","","BEIJING (Reuters) - China has launched a 350 billion yuan ($52.5 billion) state enterprise restructuring fund to advance its 'supply-side' reforms as the world's second-largest economy undergoes its most significant transformation in two decades. China has made reform of its lumbering and uncompetitive state-owned enterprises (SOEs) a priority as weak global demand drags on economic growth and excess capacity and idle workers bleed what precious resources companies have at their disposal. Earlier this year, China said it was planning to allocate 100 billion yuan to help local authorities and SOEs finance layoffs in its struggling coal and steel industries. Up to 1.8 million people in the sectors could lose their jobs, official estimates showed. The capital raised by the China State-owned Enterprises Restructuring Fund will focus on boosting the competitiveness of some SOEs and their international operations, including overseas acquisitions, the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC), which will manage the fund, said in a document. Among SOEs controlled by the central government, some have excess capacity while others are suffering from a severe lack of capacity, state radio cited Xiao Yaqing, head of SASAC, as saying on Monday. Setting up this new fund will help concentrate state capital on strategic and forward-looking industries. The fund will have an initial registered capital of 131 billion yuan provided by 10 SOEs. The 10 firms investing in the fund include China Mobile Ltd (0941.HK), China Railway Rolling Stock Corp (601766.SS) and China Petroleum & Chemical Corp (600028.SS). Key investment areas of the fund include assets pertaining to national security and are of economic importance such as strategic reserves of natural resources, oil-and-gas pipelines, power grids and telecommunication infrastructure, according to the SASAC document. The fund will also focus on restructuring SOEs. For some sectors like coal and steel, restructuring has meant closures of mines and plants, and layoffs. For others, it has meant high-profile marriages to create national champions with the heft to compete globally. Last year, Beijing ordered the merger of top train manufacturers China CNR Corp and China CSR Corp. This fund aims to facilitate the destocking and deleveraging process, said Zhou Hao, senior emerging markets economist at Commerzbank. China's state sector employed around 37 million people in 2013, and accounts for about 40 percent of the country's industrial output. The retrenchments are China's most significant layoffs since the restructuring of SOEs from 1998 to 2003. That round of reforms led to around 28 million redundancies and cost the government about 73.1 billion yuan in resettlement funds. China is not the first country to create a fund to support state firms going through hard times. The South Korean government has approved a $9.5 billion fund to help recapitalize state-run banks exposed to the country's troubled shipping sector. China will reduce the number of SOEs this year to no more than 100 from 106, state media reported in July, citing SASAC Deputy Secretary-General Peng Huagang, who added that 10 central SOEs were in talks to create five groups. China's central SOEs will complete their restructuring by the end of next year by introducing private capital and strategic investment, the Economic Information Daily reported earlier this month, citing unnamed insiders.

The first bid came from ArcelorMittal, the world's largest steelmaker, and Italy's Marcegaglia, a family-run group, who said they would invest 2.3 billion euros ($2.4 billion) and boost production at Europe's biggest steel plant by output capacity. A consortium including India's JSW Steel and Italian state holding company Cassa Depositi e Prestiti [CDP.UL] made a rival binding offer but provided no details of their plans for the site. The government is expected to make a decision on the bids in about a month.  None of the parties involved revealed the size of the bids for the 15 sq km site near the city of Taranto. Ilva was placed under court administration in 2013 after magistrates seized 8.1 billion euros of assets belonging to its former owners, the Riva family, amid allegations that toxic emissions were causing abnormally high rates of cancer. The government took over administration of the business in 2015 to try to save jobs and clean up its polluting furnaces.  With two of its five furnaces closed, Ilva produced 5.8 million tonnes of steel last year, well below the 8 million tonnes it is authorized to produce. This was an increase of more than 1 million tonnes from 2015 and helped to reduce the plant's operating loss, which is still a hefty 220 million euros.         Italy wants a buyer that will restore profitability at a site that employs about 11,000 people in an economically depressed area. Last month the government arranged a temporary layoff scheme for up to 3,300 Ilva employees. Intesa Sanpaolo, Italy's biggest retail bank, signed the letter of intent presented by ArcelorMittal and Marcegaglia.  The consortium said it would boost output with low-carbon steelmaking technologies, ultimately up to 9.5 million tonnes of finished products. It also said it would invest an initial 10 million euros in a research and development center.

Real's expensively assembled attacking trio, nicknamed the 'BBC', made just seven passes between themselves during the 3-1 come-from-behind win in Tuesday's last 16 second leg, with Ronaldo and Bale not passing to each other once. Despite a 3-1 lead from the first leg, Real struggled to cope with an onslaught of pressure from the Serie A side in a frenzied San Paolo stadium and trailed at halftime to Dries Mertens' strike after 24 minutes.  The 11-time European champions were stronger after the break and drew level with a header from a corner by inspirational captain Sergio Ramos six minutes into the second half. An own goal by Mertens six minutes later, triggered by another Ramos header, put Real 2-1 up. Bale, who has recently returned from a three-month layoff with an ankle injury, was replaced by Lucas Vazquez 11 minutes later and Benzema came in the 77th for Alvaro Morata, who got their third in added time, sealing a 6-2 aggregate win. Real's ragged performance despite the result contrasted with a fluid display in the 4-1 La Liga win at Eibar on Saturday, when Benzema started alongside Marco Asensio and Lucas Vazquez in the absence of the injured Ronaldo and suspended Bale. Vazquez and Asensio's work rate provided relief for Real's midfield and full backs, who are often overworked when Bale and Ronaldo are both on the pitch. Season-Long Debate Real have conceded seven goals and taken five points in their three league games since Bale returned to the lineup. The season-long debate in the Spanish media about whether Benzema, Bale and Ronaldo can be accommodated in the same team resurfaced before the return leg at Napoli, a poll on the website of the daily AS (As.com) showing the real fans were overwhelmingly against the trio starting together in Naples. Benzema reacted angrily to criticism of the attacking trio after the game, telling reporters: They always focus on us three but we don't just score goals, we work very hard for the team, but every time there's a bad game they blame us. Zidane also leapt to the defense of his forwards. I don't agree that Bale didn't help out the defense or that Cristiano didn't help out on the wing, everyone is at fault for us not starting well, he said. Pressed on Real's problems in the first half, the coach gave a curt response, saying: We won 3-1 and that's that. Reporting by Richard Martin; Editing by Ken Ferris"

The results showed that Wall Street analysts overestimated how much the No. 2 U.S. oil producer could improve with cost cuts in the quarter after two years of lackluster results. Sometimes when things are going well, it's not uncommon for the Street to be optimistic, said Brian Youngberg, an analyst at Edward Jones. Since the end of 2014, Chevron has laid off 9.500 employees and slashed its annual budget to boost results and protect its dividend, which Chief Executive John Watson said on a Friday call with investors remained his top priority. Most layoffs are behind us, he said. The trend of spend is down, Watson said, forecasting the company will be cash-flow neutral this year. We've made remarkable progress bringing our costs down. Like many U.S. oil producers, Chevron has benefited from the OPEC oil cartel's move to curtail production, which has helped lift crude prices CLc1 in recent months.      The California-based company posted a net income of $415 million, or 22 cents per share, after a net loss of $588 million, or 31 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, the company earned 21 cents per share. By that measure, analysts expected earnings of 64 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Despite missing expectations, Chevron still is seen by many as a top-notch oil producer. The overall investment thesis hasn't changed at all, Youngberg said. Production fell slightly to 2.7 million barrels of oil equivalent per day.     Earnings rose in the company's upstream segments, which pump oil and gas, but dropped in the refining segments due to lower margins and higher taxes.  Chevron's flagship Richmond, Calif., refinery, which is undergoing a $1 billion renovation, also had downtime during the quarter, denting profit. Watson said he expected the company's Wheatstone liquefied natural gas (LNG) project in Australia to come online this year. The nearby Gorgon LNG facility has shipped 10 LNG tankers since Jan. 1, he said.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-opel-m-a-breakingviews-idUSKBN15T2XH","Peugeot-Opel merger faces winding road to riches","","February 14, 2017 /  9:57 PM / 5 months ago","","LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Carlos Tavares has shown he can quickly turn around troubled European carmakers. Within three years of him taking charge at PSA Group, the French company’s profit margin has tripled. Now Tavares may be preparing to take on a new challenge by acquiring General Motors’ troubled European unit. Combining Europe’s third- and sixth-largest makers of passenger cars would be a big step towards ending the gridlock in the continent’s auto industry. Despite years of downsizing and a rebound in demand for new vehicles, the industry suffers from overcapacity. Peugeot plants operate at around 74 percent of their potential, according to Evercore ISI analysts. Uniting the Opel and Vauxhall brands with Peugeot and Citroen would lift PSA’s European market share to 16 percent, second only to Volkswagen’s 24 percent. Bigger companies have better bargaining power with suppliers and are better able to fund rising research and development costs. Renault and Nissan provide a possible road map. The French and Japanese groups, which are both run by Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn and have significant cross-shareholdings, reckon their alliance lowered costs by 4.3 billion euros in 2015 – equivalent to about 3.5 percent of combined sales. If PSA and GM Europe achieved similar savings, costs would fall by 1.9 billion euros, based on joint revenues of around 55 billion euros last year, excluding Peugeot’s car-parts maker Faurecia. Taxed at 25 percent and capitalised, those savings would be worth close to 15 billion euros – similar to Peugeot’s market value. Placing a value on GM’s European business, which has lost money for more than a decade, is tricky. The U.S. group could inject its business into PSA in return for a shareholding, though it sold its stake in the French group a few years ago. Alternatively, PSA could pay cash. Evercore ISI reckons GM’s European pension liabilities are so large that the U.S. group might need to pay PSA to take over the business. Even if Tavares can overcome these obstacles, investors recognise that most auto mergers fail to live up to their promise. The French government, which owns 13.7 percent of PSA, may want to protect employment at home. More than half of GM’s European workers are in Germany, where wages are high, unions powerful and layoffs costly. As attractive as it seems on paper, a Peugeot-Opel merger faces a winding road to riches.BreakingviewsReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

The savings will come mainly from purchasing and research and development as the Peugeot maker pools underlying vehicle architectures and engines with GM's European business, eliminating duplicate technologies, the sources added. Paris-based PSA and GM confirmed last week that they were in talks over a PSA-Opel tie-up to create Europe's second-largest carmaker by sales after Volkswagen. The disclosure sparked concern for the future of GM's Opel and Vauxhall plants in Germany and Britain, home to most of the group's 38,000-strong European workforce. Discussions with political and labour leaders may delay the conclusion of a deal, which both carmakers now hope to announce in March, two sources with knowledge of the talks also said. Exane BNP Paribas analyst Dominic O'Brien said savings of 2 billion euros could be achieved with 1.2 billion euros from joint purchasing, 400 million from R&D; and another 400 million from the eventual elimination of 6,000 jobs. The most obvious starting point for any restructuring of course lies with labour, O'Brien said, adding that layoffs would be more likely via attrition and voluntary rather than compulsory. PSA boss Carlos Tavares is due to meet British Prime Minister Theresa May after giving assurances on Tuesday to German Chancellor Angela Merkel that all existing GM job guarantees would be honoured under the deal. GM's existing German job guarantees run to the end of next year and plant commitments until around 2019-20, unions say. The new group would have 75 billion euros in revenue and a 16 percent combined European market share, which shrank last year as both groups lost ground to rivals including VW and Renault.

Benchmark zinc on the London Metal Exchange closed 0.7 percent higher at $2,633 a tonne, its highest since May 2. Nickel hit its highest since May 3, up 0.4 percent to $9,395. The Chinese government is becoming quite aggressive in targeting environmental problems, said Oxford Economics commodities analyst Dan Smith. Nickel is mainly used to make stainless steel, while zinc is used to galvanise steel. Fundamentals CHINA POLLUTION: China's Tangshan city launched a campaign to improve air quality last week, saying that steel mills in the country's top-producing region that fail to meet emission standards face suspension and heavy fines. INVENTORIES: Zinc prices are also gaining support from falling stocks in LME-approved warehouses, with inventories down about 20 percent this year at 342,675 tonnes. These are levels last seen in 2009. MZNSTX-TOTAL ZINC: Prices have risen by more than 40 percent over the past year as mine closures and suspensions have fuelled concerns over potential shortages. STEEL: Chinese steel futures jumped more than 6 percent on Monday to their highest since March. FREEPORT: An estimated 9,000 workers at the giant Grasberg copper mine operated by the Indonesian unit of Freeport McMoRan Inc will extend a strike for a second month, a union official said on Saturday, in an ongoing dispute over employment terms and layoffs. COPPER: Copper edged down 0.4 percent to $5,703 a tonne, having hit the highest since early May at $5,694.50 on Friday. CHINESE ECONOMY: China's economy is likely to expand by about 6.8 percent in the second quarter of 2017, the State Information Center said in an article in the state-owned China Securities Journal on Saturday. DOLLAR: Support for base metals also came from a weaker U.S. currency, which makes dollar-denominated metals cheaper for non-American companies, potentially boosting demand. OTHER METALS: Aluminium eased 0.3 percent to $1,938, lead slipped 0.1 percent to $2,092 and tin added 0.4 percent to $20,480. Additional reporting by Melanie Burton in Melbourne; Editing

The surgery Woods had in April has a typical recovery time of six months and, while he still has very limited mobility, the 41-year-old American was firm in his resolve that he will again compete with the world's best golfers. I want to say unequivocally, I want to play professional golf again, Woods, commenting for the first time since his surgery, said on his website (tigerwoods.com). Presently, I'm not looking ahead. I can't twist for another two and a half to three months. Right now, my sole focus is rehab and doing what the doctors tell me. I am concentrating on short-term goals. Woods, second on the all-time list with 14 major titles, has played sparingly since returning to golf in December after a 16-month layoff following back surgery. He missed the cut at the Farmers Insurance Open in January and withdrew from a European Tour event in Dubai after a first-round 77. Woods only decided on surgery because he could no longer live with the pain, adding that even lying down hurt and that he tried every possible non-surgical route but nothing worked. Instant Relief He said the fusion surgery provided instant nerve relief. I haven’t felt this good in years, said Woods, a 79-times winner on the PGA Tour. My surgeon and physiotherapist say the operation was successful. It's just a matter of not screwing up and letting it fuse. I'm walking and doing my exercises, and taking my kids to and from school. All I can do is take it day-by-day. There’s no hurry. Woods also said he did everything he could to play in last month's U.S. Masters, where he has not competed since 2015, but that the pain was too great. The pain was post-impact when I swung the club. I figured, 'Can I handle it?' This time the answer was, 'Probably not.' That shows the effect nerve pain can have, said Woods, a four-time Masters champion. Obviously, it was a huge disappointment not to play. I hate to miss any major, especially the Masters, but the reality is I just couldn't play.

JSW, leading a consortium called AcciaItalia, said it would put up 1.85 billion euros ($2.09 billion), which is broadly in line with the winning bid, and added it would immediately hire 9,800 employees. It had originally offered about 1.2 billion euros. The decision (to make a counter offer) is in the interest of Ilva, of its employees, of the supply chain, the territory of the factory and the national machine industry, the statement said. The Industry Ministry said on Friday that it could not accept a counter offer, according to procedure, if the only thing changed was the purchase price. The government has been vetting the winning bid and is supposed to decide by Monday whether to officially endorse it. Metal workers' unions said on Saturday that they would send a letter to Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni and Industry Minister Carlo Calenda asking for an urgent meeting. In a statement, Rocco Palombella of the Uilm metal workers' union said it was necessary to reflect... on the counter offer by AcciaItalia. The bid that last month won the tender offer was made by a consortium called Ama Investco Italy that is led by ArcelorMittal, the world's biggest steelmaker. It foresees some 4,800 job cuts, though the workers would receive state unemployment support until 2023. Ilva directly employs about 11,000 people in an economically depressed area of southern Italy. Some 3,300 employees are now in a state-funded temporary layoff scheme. It was unclear if AcciaItalia's counter offer would preserve more jobs. A spokeswoman at the Industry Minister was not immediately available to comment. AcciaItalia said that its newest bid excluded two of the previous members of its consortium, Arvedi and Cassa Depositi e Prestiti, and was made exclusively by JSW and Delfin. Ilva was placed under court administration in 2013 after magistrates seized 8.1 billion euros of assets belonging to its former owners, the Riva family, amid allegations that toxic emissions were causing abnormally high rates of cancer. The government took over administration of the business in 2015 to try to save jobs and clean up its polluting furnaces. $1 = 0.8867 euros

Gains for the Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P;/TSX composite index came one day after Canada's Liberal government unveiled a stay-the-course budget. Businesses had feared higher capital gains taxes would harm their competitiveness just as U.S. rivals benefit from a break in taxes and regulation under U.S. President Donald Trump. Republican leaders hoped to vote on a healthcare replacement on Thursday but there were signs the deadline could be pushed back.

The top-ranked player in the field after Dustin Johnson's late withdrawal, the Northern Irishman carded three birdies over the final six holes to finish the day seven shots behind first-round leader Charley Hoffman. The strong finish erased a woeful start for the 27-year-old, who dropped three shots over his first eight holes in windy conditions that ensured only 11 players broke par. Thankfully I managed to birdie the two par fives and another one coming in and even par was a great score so I'm really happy with that, said McIlroy. I know I did my best out there and I gritted it out, and I would have ripped someone's hand off for a 72 on the 10th tee. With world number one Johnson injured and Jason Day (74) and Jordan Spieth (75) further adrift, McIlroy emerged from the opening round as the most likely of the pre-tournament favorites to don the Green Jacket on Sunday. A Masters title would add to McIlroy's wins at the U.S. Open (2011), British Open (2014) and PGA Championship (2012, 2014) and make him the sixth player to accumulate a full set of major titles over a career. McIlroy's preparations were hampered by a six-week injury layoff but he remained one of the favorites to win on a layout that is perfectly suited to his long driving and creative shot-making. After the rocky start, the former world number one lived up to his billing with confident pitching and solid work on the greens that allowed him to save par on a number of holes. I've done the work on the short game and I believe I'm doing the right things, he said.  I just didn't want to give up.

Rio Tinto has a joint-venture with Freeport-McMoRan Inc for the huge Grasberg copper and gold complex in remote Papua, with rights to 40 percent of production above specific levels until 2021 and 40 percent of all production after 2021. As pressure mounts on Indonesia to agree a compromise    U.S. Vice President Mike Pence will visit the country next week and Arnaud Soirat, head of Rio Tinto's copper and diamonds business, will visit shortly afterwards, Rio officials said.     Freeport McMoRan, the biggest publicly-listed copper miner, has lost $1 billion since the export of copper concentrate from Grasberg was halted on Jan. 12 under new rules issued by the government.  The Indonesian government has lost millions of dollars in royalties and is worried about layoffs and a slowing economy in the restive Papua region. Shares in Rio Tinto were trading down about 3.5 percent at 1500 GMT on the London Stock Exchange.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/bkn-hawks-pacers-preview-idUSMTZED4CAMNKF1","Preview: Hawks at Pacers","","April 13, 2017 /  3:11 AM / 3 months ago","","The Indiana Pacers look to clinch their sixth playoff berth in the last seven seasons when they host the Atlanta Hawks on Wednesday in the final game of the regular season for both teams. The Pacers, who have won four straight, enter the day in seventh place in the Eastern Conference, a game behind Milwaukee and one up on both Chicago and Miami. The Pacers are in with a win or a loss by either the Bulls or the Heat, who are also at home Wednesday and tip off in their respective games at the same time. The Hawks nailed down the fifth seed with Tuesday's 103-76 rout of Charlotte, their fourth consecutive victory following a 2-9 swoon. Atlanta will take on No. 4 seed Washington in a first-round series beginning this weekend, and it is likely that many regulars will get some rest in Indiana. The home team has won the first two meetings, with Glenn Robinson III nailing a last-second 3-pointer to lift the Pacers to a 97-96 triumph last month. TV: 8 p.m. ET, ESPN, FSN Southeast (Atlanta), FSN Indiana ABOUT THE HAWKS (43-38): Atlanta already began to spread around the minutes by virtue of its easy win over the Hornets, as no player saw more than 26 minutes of action. Guard Thabo Sefolosha (groin) was able to return and play 16 minutes following a six-game layoff while Paul Millsap (knee) was limited to 22 minutes and is a prime candidate to get Wednesday off. Center Dwight Howard recorded his 53rd double-double Wednesday and he is averaging 19 points while making 16-of-21 shots over his last two games. ABOUT THE PACERS (41-40): Paul George has keyed the four-game surge by averaging 30.5 points on 56.8 percent shooting - including 14-for-33 from long range - and he is hopeful that the solid finish is not wasted. This season has been up and down, George told reporters. For us to finally play some good basketball to finish this year out, it would suck to finally figure things out and put our finger on what we want to be and who we are this year and to not make it. That would suck. But, we're in the driver's seat right now. Center Kevin Seraphin had 17 points in 19 minutes in Monday's 120-111 win at Philadelphia and has scored in double figures in a season-high three straight games. Buzzer Beaters 1. George is averaging 26 points in the two meetings with the Hawks. 2. Atlanta F Mike Muscala is 15-for-18 from the floor over a three-game stretch. 3. Robinson (calf) has missed 10 games in a row.

The measure, approved by a vote of 11 to 1, will extend the required $15 minimum to smaller businesses in Minnesota's largest city by 2024. Businesses of all sizes, including fast-food chains, must pay at least $10 an hour beginning next year. Supporters of the $15 minimum wage in Minneapolis and other cities believe it provides a floor of support for those on the lowest rung of the economic ladder, including many single mothers and children. But critics say required pay increases lead to layoffs and force some employers out of business. The bottom line here is that we have huge disparities in our country and this is one of the ways we can address that, City Councilwoman Linea Palmisano said at the council meeting. In Minneapolis, a city with about 415,000 residents, the measure will provide a lifeline to the more than 70,000 workers who stand to benefit from the increase, supporters say. But it is likely to be monitored closely for any negative impact on the labor market. Minnesota's current minimum wage - $9.50 for large businesses and $7.75 for small companies - is already the highest in the Midwest. There's going to be intense scrutiny of what happens with this minimum wage and I think that's right, City Councilwoman Elizabeth Glidden, one of the authors of the proposal, said on Friday after the measure was approved. City Councilman Blong Yang, who cast the lone dissenting vote, said he was concerned the ordinance would overburden small businesses, including many owned by minority groups, and would raise prices in the city. We cannot make Minneapolis an island, Yang said at the meeting. Los Angeles, the nation's second-largest city, as well as San Francisco, Seattle and some other urban areas have approved measures to increase base pay to $15 an hour. Under a law approved last year, California set a $15 target for all workers, which it plans to reach in 2023. New York State is also gradually increasing its minimum wage to $15 an hour for all workers under a bill signed by the governor last year. Maryland and Oregon and the cities of Washington, Los Angeles and San Francisco have previously approved minimum wage hikes taking effect on Saturday, according to the Economic Policy Institute.

GM's vehicle inventory in the United States hit a 10-year high in June at 105 days supply. The company in April told investors it expected inventories would decline to a 90-day supply at the end of June, and fall to 70 days by the end of the year. Cutting vehicle production also cuts GM's revenue and potentially profits. The automaker also builds the Chevrolet Sonic small car at the Orion plant, and sales of that car are down nearly 37 percent for the year to date. A spokesman for the company said the shutdown at Orion was due solely to softening sales of the Sonic model, adding that its production plan for the Bolt for this year was unchanged. GM has sold 7,592 Bolts through the first six months of this year, after rolling out the car at the end of 2016. From June 1 to July 1, supplies of the Bolt rose to 111 days from 104 days. GM launched the Bolt in California, but has said the car will be available in all 50 states by August.  On Monday, Paul Masse Chevrolet in East Providence, Rhode Island, advertised on its website that it had more than 200 Bolts in inventory at prices ranging from $35,688 to $41,488.  The Bolt is the first electric car in the U.S. market to offer more than 200 miles of driving range per charge at a starting price of around $35,000.  Tesla Motors Inc's Model 3 will offer roughly the same driving range at a similar starting price. Tesla began building Model 3's for customers earlier in July, and has said it has more than 300,000 deposits from prospective buyers.  GM has extended summer vacation shutdowns at three other North American assembly plants. The assembly plant at Lordstown, Ohio, that makes the Chevrolet Cruze and a plant near Kansas City, Missouri, that produces the Malibu sedan have three additional weeks of downtime.  An assembly plant in Oshawa, Ontario, will be idled for two extra weeks to reduce inventories of the Chevrolet Impala large sedan.  More than 9,400 workers will be affected by rolling temporary layoffs that began in late June and are to run into August.

Governor Bruce Rauner used his third State of the State address to nudge along efforts in the Senate to pass a behemoth budget omnibus that would include some of the nonbudgetary items he has sought unsuccessfully. Please don’t give up, he said. Please keep working. Please keep trying. The people of Illinois need you to succeed.” He did not indicate whether he will support the 13-bill package, which includes some of the so-called reforms he has been advocating. Since taking office in 2015, Rauner has feuded with the Democratic-led state legislature, leaving the nation's fifth-largest state without a full-year operating budget. No other state has gone 19 months, as Illinois has, without passing a budget. The impasse has put the state’s public universities and human services on a starvation diet that has caused declining college enrollment and program cuts and layoffs. “We are failing to be compassionate because we are failing to be competitive,” Rauner said in his speech to the legislature. At a news conference in Chicago, Mayor Rahm Emanuel took Rauner to task for the budget impasse, noting Illinois' huge unpaid bill pile has tripled and college students have been hurt under the governor's tenure. He is a (Republican) governor with a Democratic legislature. Maryland and Massachusetts have overwhelming Democratic bodies with Republican governors and they have done a budget on time all the time, Emanuel said.  Rauner has sought to insert items like legislative term limits, collective bargaining curbs and redistricting changes, which most Democrats oppose, as conditions for a budget. Last week, Democratic Senate President John Cullerton and Senate Republican Leader Christine Radogno had predicted votes on the package would begin Wednesday. But the plan appeared to hit legislative snags, driven in part by uncertainty over whether Rauner’s chief Democratic nemesis, House Speaker Michael Madigan, would kill the initiative in his chamber.  The speaker on Wednesday insisted on coming up with a  budget free of measures that would hurt middle-class families. Under my direction, the House will begin a thorough vetting process of proposals that will enable us to create jobs while also lifting up and helping the middle class and struggling families around our state,” Madigan said in a statement.

The Rangers will be hoping that the layoff did not stem the momentum from a spectacular comeback at Columbus when they host the Maple Leafs on Friday night. The Rangers are 5-1-0 since the holiday break, capped by a stirring 5-4 win against the red-hot Blue Jackets in which they scored four unanswered goals. New York leads the league with 144 goals -- 26 of them coming in its last five wins -- and is expected to have injured forwards Rick Nash and Pavel Buchnevich back in the lineup.

The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) report on Thursday also showed a sustained increase in prices paid by services industries for inputs, potentially signaling that the days of very low inflation could be coming to an end.  The economy is likely to get a boost from President-elect Donald Trump's plan to increase infrastructure spending and cut taxes. That, together with a tightening labor market and firming inflation, could allow the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates in March, economists say.  It appears that both growth and price pressures are beginning to pick up and we continue to project the next rate hike takes place at the March Fed policy meeting, said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.ISM said its non-manufacturing activity index was at 57.2 last month, matching November's reading, which was the highest  since October 2015. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. Services industries reported new orders jumped 4.6 percentage points last month to their highest level since August 2015. Prices paid by non-manufacturing industries for materials and services rose 0.7 percentage point, hitting their highest level in nearly 2-1/2 years and marking the ninth consecutive monthly increase. That suggested inflation, which has persistently run below the Fed's 2 percent target, was poised to rise in the coming months. A measure of services sector employment fell 4.4 percentage points last month. The drop, however, followed a surge in November, which had lifted the subindex to a 13-month high. ISM noted that labor, especially in the construction sector, continue to be in short supply.  Related CoveragePrivate hiring slows in December, jobs market still solidEconomists do not believe that the decline in services employment last month will significantly impact December's nonfarm payrolls report, which the U.S. government is scheduled to release on Friday. They also brushed aside another report on Thursday from payrolls processor ADP showing that private employers added 153,000 jobs in December after boosting payrolls by 215,000 in November. The ADP report, which is jointly developed with Moody's Analytics, has a poor record of predicting the private payrolls component of the government's closely watched employment report because of differences in methodology. Nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 178,000 jobs in December after the same gain in November, according to a Reuters survey of economists. We don't view the data as strong evidence that payrolls will undershoot expectations on Friday, said Jim O'Sullivan, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in New York. But traders took a different view, selling the dollar, which declined more than 1 percent against a basket of currencies. .DXY Prices for U.S. government debt rose, while stocks on Wall Street fell. Tightening Labor Market Trump, who campaigned on a pledge to spur job growth largely by revitalizing U.S. manufacturing, will inherit a labor market that is considered to be at or near full employment, with a jobless rate at a nine-year low of 4.6 percent. That strength was underscored by a third report from the Labor Department on Thursday showing initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 28,000 to a seasonally adjusted 235,000 for the week ended Dec. 31. That was close to the 233,000 touched in mid-November, which was the lowest level since November 1973. Initial jobless claims have now been below 300,000, a threshold associated with a healthy labor market, for 96 consecutive weeks. That is the longest stretch since 1970, when the labor market was much smaller.   But with claims data for six states and one territory estimated because of the New Year's holiday, last week's drop likely exaggerates labor market strength. The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 5,750 to 256,750 last week.  Tightening labor market conditions and gradually firming inflation allowed the Fed to raise its benchmark overnight interest rate last month by 25 basis points to a range of 0.50 percent to 0.75 percent.  While the U.S. central bank forecast three rate hikes for 2017, minutes of the Dec. 13-14 policy meeting released on Wednesday suggested the pace of increases would largely be determined by the labor market and fiscal policy.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-twitter-results-idUSKCN12R1GW","Twitter cuts jobs with eye on 2017 profit; Vine discontinued","","October 27, 2016 /  11:17 AM / 9 months ago","","(Reuters) - Twitter Inc said Thursday it would cut 9 percent of its global workforce to keep costs down even as quarterly results eclipsed Wall Street's beaten-down expectations, lifting shares that had fallen after a failed effort to sell the company. More than 300 Twitter employees will be affected by the layoffs as part of a broader restructuring, a figure similar to an earlier round of reductions announced a year ago. Separately, the company announced it would discontinue Vine, a video app launched in 2013 that played brief clips on a repeat loop that struggled to compete with Facebook's Instagram. The reductions of staff and services were blunted somewhat by the backdrop of third-quarter revenue growth that slowed sharply but topped analysts' expectations. Its stock was up 1.6 percent to $17.56, after rallying 5 percent in premarket trading. Revenue rose about 8 percent to $616 million, above the average analyst estimate of $605.8 million. The company had reported a 20-percent rise in revenue in the previous quarter and 58 percent in the year-ago quarter.  Twitter, which has seen user growth stall amid competition from nimbler rivals such as Instagram and Snapchat, said its user base ticked up 3 percent to 317 million average monthly active users in the quarter.  Analysts, on average, had expected 316.3 million monthly active users, according to market research firm FactSet StreetAccount. The building blocks for revenue are increasing the number of users, and Twitter is not doing a particularly good job of that, Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter said. He added that Twitter needed to grow revenue by $200 million to $300 million a quarter to achieve 2017 profitability. Related CoverageTwitter's video-sharing mobile app Vine to closeThe run-rate for the year is under $100 million in profit, so it is really hard to justify spending $15 or $18 billion to buy a $100-million profit (company), Pachter said. Total advertising revenue of $545 million grew 6 percent year-over-year, and 90 percent of it came from mobile. Excluding items, the company earned 13 cents per share, beating the average estimate of 9 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company is more disciplined about how we invest in the business and intends to be profitable in 2017, said Chief Financial Officer Anthony Noto.  The Twitter logo is displayed on a screen on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S., September 28, 2016.Brendan McDermidAmong its priorities, Twitter is dedicated to growing its burgeoning live video offerings through partnerships with organizations such as the National Football League, Noto said. Advertisers are increasingly interested in live video because of its potential to reach new and younger audiences, he added. Twitter hired bankers last month to field acquisition offers, but it has seen a dearth of potential bidders. Salesforce.com Inc, the last of a small cohort of companies including Walt Disney Co and Alphabet Inc believed to have been interested, said recently it would not pursue a deal. The apparent lack of interest forced the social media company to consider a route anathema to aspiring tech startups: a major restructuring. More Layoffs The Twitter logo is shown at its corporate headquarters  in San Francisco, California April 28, 2015.Robert GalbraithTwitter had 3,860 employees globally as of June. The reduction of more than 300, chiefly in its sales, partnerships, and marketing efforts. The cuts come about a year after a similar wave of layoffs of up to 336 employees were announced when Jack Dorsey, its co-founder who had been serving as interim chief executive, took over as permanent CEO. Since then, Dorsey has drawn criticism from some analysts for splitting his time between Twitter and Square.  The company said it expected cash expenditures of about $10 million to $20 million in the fourth quarter, mostly for severance costs. On an investor call Thursday, Dorsey said he would not comment on speculation about a potential sale. He said in a statement that the company has a clear plan, and we’re making the necessary changes to ensure Twitter is positioned for long-term growth.” Asked by investors whether major events such as presidential debates or the Olympics affected Twitter's quarterly growth in metrics, Noto said there needed to be such an event every day on the platform to meaningfully improve numbers, and that's where we're headed. The popular but money-losing microblogging service spent aggressively on product development and marketing in recent years, betting it could afford losses as long as it attracted new users. But that growth stalled this year after it exceeded 300 million active monthly users, less than a fifth of Facebook Inc's users and below Facebook's Instagram.   The company's net loss narrowed to $102.9 million, or 15 cents per share, in the third quarter, from $131.7 million, or 20 cents per share, a year earlier. Twitter also said it would roll out “meaningful updates” next month affecting how it protects users from abusive content, an issue for which the company has endured growing criticism.

In a notice to the Shanghai Stock Exchange, Datong Coal Industry Co. Ltd said it alone had received 312.16 million yuan from the provincial government after shutting down three mines with 3.75 million tonnes of annual production capacity. China vowed in February to close 500 million tonnes of coal production in the coming three to five years in a bid to tackle an annual capacity surplus amounting to more than 2 billion tonnes. The country plans to close 250 million tonnes of coal production in 2016 alone. The industry ministry said the country would provide 100 billion yuan this year to help handle layoffs in the coal and steel industries. According to China's Ministry of Finance, a total of 30.7 billion yuan had already been allocated by August this year. Shanxi produced 944.1 million tonnes of coal last year, amounting to 25.6 percent of the national total. The province cut output by 68.8 million tonnes, or 14.9 percent, in the first half of the year, according to the local government. Its efforts to curb output have been a key factor in the recovery in coal prices this year, with prices of thermal coal at the key northern port of Qinhuangdao SH-QHA-TRMCOAL rising by more than a third since the end of 2015. According to the official Xinhua news agency, central China's Henan province also plans to award 2.18 billion yuan to encourage its coal and steel producers to slash capacity this year. The funds will be used to help pay for layoffs. The province aims to cut 62.54 million tonnes of coal capacity and 2.4 million tonnes of crude steel capacity this year.

Passenger ships remained docked at ports, city transport was disrupted and local administration offices shut down as workers joined the 24-hour nationwide walkout called by the country's largest private and public sector unions, GSEE and ADEDY. The burden we carry is already unbearable, said GSEE in a statement, calling lenders' demands irrational. The downturn must finally end, its rally poster read. Workers and pensioners will march in central Athens later in the day. Turnout in street protests has been low since Greece signed up to a third international bailout in July 2015 after tough negotiations that almost forced it out of the euro zone. Euro zone finance ministers said on Monday that Athens and its lenders needed to speed up the review which has hit a snag on labour reforms, including liberalising mass layoffs and reviving collective bargaining between employers and unions. Energy reforms and measures to plug a projected fiscal gap in 2018, when Greece's bailout programme expires, are also among thorny issues in the review which may resume next week. Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras hopes a deal can be reached by the end of the year for the country's bonds to be included in the European Central Bank's bond buying programme by March 2017. This would help Greece return to markets next year, for the first time since 2014, and eventually reduce its dependence on bailout loans. Athens has rejected its creditors' demands for more austerity measures beyond 2018. On Monday, the euro zone granted Greece short-term debt relief, which was hailed as a success by the leftist-led government that has been sagging in polls for months. But the news did not impress austerity-hit Greeks, who have lost almost a third of their income since the crisis started in 2009. Thousands have lost their jobs amid a deep recession. Unemployment in September stood at 23.4 percent. In parliament, lawmakers debated more tax hikes and spending cuts as part of next year's budget, which projects the economy will grow by 2.7 percent and attain a 2 percent of GDP primary surplus - excluding debt servicing costs. Parliament is expected to vote on the budget on Saturday.   (Reporting by Renee Maltezou; editing by Ralph Boulton)"

Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini testified on Friday and returned to the witness stand Monday morning. The Justice Department sued to stop the merger in July.  Judge John Bates of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia will likely allow the deal to go forward if he agrees with Aetna that traditional Medicare, managed by the government, competes with Medicare Advantage, run by insurers. He must also decide if Aetna competes with Humana on the public insurance exchanges established under President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law. The Justice Department's Craig Conrath showed Bertolini documents prepared by Aetna which showed that the combined company would have 4.4 million Medicare Advantage customers. An unidentified company would have the second largest pool of customers with the next largest companies sharing a much smaller number. There was no mention in the documents of customers whose healthcare costs are covered through enrollment in traditional Medicare plans. Conrath also showed Bertolini a July 1, 2015 email written in preparation for announcing the merger which showed executives knew there was antitrust risk. The email urged caution in word choice: We do not have 'market power,' (or) 'pricing power.'  The government argued that Aetna and Humana compete on public exchanges established under Obamacare in 17 counties, and that Aetna's decision to pull out of those counties, along with others, was no defense against allegations the merger would violate antitrust law. Bertolini testified on Friday that the company pulled out of the exchanges because they lost money, and did not target the 17 counties where the two companies overlapped. I wasn't aware there was 17 counties until my deposition, he said. Deals that are problematic under antitrust law can sometimes pass muster if they show efficiencies.  Bertolini testified on Monday that Aetna's initial estimate was that the merger would create $1.25 billion in efficiencies. He said that estimate had since been raised to $3 billion, because of combined technology systems, some potential layoffs and other strategies. He also said he had very high confidence that we will deliver on those numbers. But Conrath noted that a 2013 merger with Coventry remained incomplete and some Coventry computer systems remained outside the Aetna network. He also said Aetna's estimates of the cost of the transaction, beyond the purchase price, would eat a chunk of the efficiencies. Aetna estimated that the cost of implementing the deal at $1.5 billion. Reporting by Diane Bartz; Editing by Tom Brown"

The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said crude stocks fell 5.2 million barrels in the week ended Oct. 14, versus forecasts for a 2.7-million barrel build. [EIA/S]  Crude stocks generally rise at this time of year as refineries go into maintenance. Refinery utilization is down to 85 percent from nearly 94 percent in early September. The EIA said U.S. crude imports slid by 912,000 barrels per day last week to 6.47 million bpd, the lowest since November 2015, crimping inventories. Related CoverageU.S. crude stocks fall sharply as imports dropThis lowest import pace in some 16 months is surprising given the fact that OPEC production has recently attained a record level that would imply easy availability, said Jim Ritterbusch of Chicago-based oil markets consultancy Ritterbusch & Associates.

Its session peak of $51.93 was the highest in 15 months. With expiry due on Thursday, the November contract saw lighter trades than December WTI, which hit a June high of $52.22. The December contract will be front-month from Friday. London-traded Brent crude settled up 99 cents, or 1.9 percent, at $52.67. Some market participants were not impressed by the crude inventory drop, citing instead the large gasoline build of 2.5 million barrels for last week versus forecasts for a 1.3 million-barrel drop. While the headline number was bullish, we wouldn't call it extremely bullish, said Tariq Zahir, crude trader at Tyche Capital Advisors in New York. Oil prices have rallied 15 percent in the three weeks after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries proposed to enforce from November its first output cut since 2008. Khalid al-Falih, energy minister of Saudi Arabia, which dominates OPEC, told the Oil & Money conference in London fundamentals are improving and the market is clearly balancing after prices fell below $30 from 2014 highs above $100.

Centrica and its joint venture partner, Qatar Petroleum, started the sales in process in July, spokesman Ross Davidson said, and will dispose of the natural gas assets purchased from Suncor Energy Inc (SU.TO) in 2013 for C$1 billion ($758.04 million). North American natural gas prices have plummeted since then due to oversupply and Centrica said last year it no longer saw Canadian operations, which make up around a third of the company's production, as core to the business. Centrica produces around 64,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in Canada, of which 90 percent is natural gas. The company's operations are focused on southern Alberta and Saskatchewan. We are focusing on Europe - Norway, the North Sea and Morecambe Bay, Davidson said. We have started disposal operations for Canadian assets, but do not know when that's likely to close. Centrica employs around 500 people in Canada. The country's energy sector has been roiled by mass layoffs and steep cuts in capital spending as companies have struggled to cope with the two-year oil price slump. Editing by Alan Crosby"

Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini testified on Friday and returned to the witness stand Monday morning. The Justice Department sued to stop the merger in July. Judge John Bates of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia will likely allow the deal to go forward if he agrees with Aetna that traditional Medicare, managed by the government, competes with Medicare Advantage, run by insurers. He must also decide if Aetna competes with Humana on the public insurance exchanges established under President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law. The Justice Department's Craig Conrath showed Bertolini documents prepared by Aetna which showed that the combined company would have 4.4 million Medicare Advantage customers. An unidentified company would have the second largest pool of customers with the next largest companies sharing a much smaller number. There was no mention in the documents of customers whose healthcare costs are covered through enrollment in traditional Medicare plans. Conrath also showed Bertolini a July 1, 2015 email written in preparation for announcing the merger which showed executives knew there was antitrust risk. The email urged caution in word choice: We do not have 'market power,' (or) 'pricing power.' The government argued that Aetna and Humana compete on public exchanges established under Obamacare in 17 counties, and that Aetna's decision to pull out of those counties, along with others, was no defense against allegations the merger would violate antitrust law. Bertolini testified on Friday that the company pulled out of the exchanges because they lost money, and did not target the 17 counties where the two companies overlapped. I wasn't aware there was 17 counties until my deposition, he said. Deals that are problematic under antitrust law can sometimes pass muster if they show efficiencies. Bertolini testified on Monday that Aetna's initial estimate was that the merger would create $1.25 billion in efficiencies. He said that estimate had since been raised to $3 billion, because of combined technology systems, some potential layoffs and other strategies. He also said he had very high confidence that we will deliver on those numbers. But Conrath noted that a 2013 merger with Coventry remained incomplete and some Coventry computer systems remained outside the Aetna network. He also said Aetna's estimates of the cost of the transaction, beyond the purchase price, would eat a chunk of the efficiencies.

The Gulf Arab state's third-largest lender by assets, like other banks in the region, has seen bad loans rise steeply due to the fallout of lower oil and gas prices on the wider economy, which has forced cutbacks in state and consumer spending, as well as layoffs in a number of industries. The five-year plan follows a review by its new chief executive Joseph Abraham, a former Australia and New Zealand Banking Group banker, aimed at halting five consecutive quarters of falling profit. The lender reported a near-tripling of net impairment charges against bad loans to 504.9 million riyals ($134.62 million) in the third quarter. The bank said it aimed to cut its non-performing loan ratio to the market average of 2 percent from 5.3 percent currently. In a presentation circulated to investors, it expects further writedowns this year and next, and plans to tighten underwriting standards and improve asset quality by diversifying into other sectors and countries. The bank aims to cut its real estate exposure from 23 percent currently to a maximum of 16 percent, while raising its share of exposure to the government and public sector from 8 percent now to a minimum of 16 percent. Arqaam Capital said in a note that it was cutting its earnings per share forecasts for the bank for the full year of 2016 and 2017 as a result of net interest margin pressure stemming from the shift from property to public sector lending and continued writedowns. Other ratios CBQ said it aimed to boost were its earnings per share, return on equity, return on assets and Tier 1 level  to the market average of 15.1 percent from the existing 13.6 percent. The bank sought approval this month for a 1.5 billion riyals rights issue, an action it said in the presentation would raise its Common Equity Tier 1 ratio, a key measure of a lender's ability to absorb losses, from the current level of 10 percent. $1 = 3.7506 riyals

Quebecor Media Group said the move would mostly affect managers, professionals and support staff, and would have no impact on its newsrooms or on news coverage across Quebec. The move includes the loss of 125 jobs at the media group's subsidiary TVA Group Inc, one of the largest broadcasters and publishers of French-language content in North America and a major production company. TVA Publications will no longer publish the Chez Soi and Tellement bon magazines, the media company said. In Quebec as elsewhere in the world, our industry is facing ongoing disruption, Julie Tremblay, chief executive of Quebecor Media Group and TVA Group Inc, said in a statement that did not estimate the likely cost of the restructuring or the scale of any expected savings.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy-idUSKBN13Q4LX","U.S. factory activity at five-month high, bottlenecks emerging","","December 1, 2016 /  1:36 PM / 8 months ago","","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. factory activity accelerated to a five-month high in November amid a pickup in new orders and production, suggesting that the manufacturing sector was regaining its footing after a prolonged slump. Thursday's report from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM), which also showed some bottlenecks in the supply chain that could drive prices higher, was the latest indication that the economy continued to gain momentum in the fourth quarter.  The ISM said its index of national factory activity rose 1.3 percentage points to a reading of 53.2 last month, the best since June. A reading above 50 indicates an expansion in manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy.  The factory sector has started to show some building momentum, strengthening the case for Federal Reserve action at the December policy meeting, said Kevin Cummins, senior economist at RBS in Stamford, Connecticut. Manufacturing is recovering as some of the drag from the dollar's past rally eases and oil prices continue to stabilize after last year's collapse. Gains in factory activity are, however, likely to be modest amid renewed dollar strength following the election of Donald Trump as the next president.  Since the Nov. 8 election, the dollar has surged more than 4 percent against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners as investors viewed the president-elect's proposed fiscal policy as inflationary.  But Trump's plan to increase infrastructure spending could offer some boost to manufacturing and benefit heavy machinery  makers such as Caterpillar (CAT.N), whose profit has been hurt by poor demand for construction equipment. Last month, the ISM production sub-index increased 1.4 percentage points and a gauge of new orders rose 0.9 percentage point. While a measure of factory employment fell last month, manufacturing payrolls remained above expansion territory. The ISM survey also showed bottlenecks starting to emerge, with a measure of supplier deliveries surging 3.5 percentage points last month to its highest reading since December 2014, indicating longer delivery delays. Manufacturers who participated in the ISM survey reported  increasing demand, some tightness in the labor market and plans to reduce inventory by the end of the year.   While we are gaining confidence that the manufacturing sector is starting to improve, the recent dollar appreciation may prove to be a headwind for the sector over time, said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan in New York.  People enter the Nassau County Mega Job Fair at Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Uniondale, New York October 7, 2014.Shannon StapletonThe dollar was trading lower against a basket of currencies on Thursday. Prices for U.S. government bonds also fell as did stocks on Wall Street. Claims Rise Though a second report on Thursday showed the number of Americans claiming unemployment benefits rising to a its highest level in five months last week, labor market strength remains intact, with layoffs falling 12 percent in November.  The Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 17,000 to a seasonally adjusted 268,000 for the week ended Nov. 26. That was the highest reading since June and marked the second straight week of increases.  Despite the increase, claims remained below the 300,000 threshold, which is associated with a healthy labor market, for the 91st straight week. That is the longest run since 1970, when the labor market was much smaller. Jobless claims, which hit a 43-year low in mid-November, tend to be volatile at this time of the year as the model the government uses to strip out seasonal fluctuations from the data does not fully account for changes in the timings of different holidays. The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, edged up 500 to 251,500 last week. The ongoing low level of claims should give the Fed comfort that labor markets continue to tighten. We view incoming claims data as very supportive of further improvement in labor market conditions this year, said Rob Martin, an economist at Barclays in New York.  Last week's claims data has no bearing on November's employment report, which is scheduled for release on Friday, as it falls outside the survey period.  New filings for jobless benefits fell between the October and November survey weeks, supporting expectations for another month of solid employment gains. According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls probably increased by 175,000 jobs last month after rising 161,000 in October. In a third report, global outplacement consultancy Challenger, Gray & Christmas said U.S.-based employers announced plans to lay off 26,936 workers last month, down from the 30,740 job cuts announced in October. Jobs cuts in November were concentrated in the retail sector, with 4,850 announced layoffs, most of which stemmed from the bankruptcy of American Apparel. The retail losses were, however, more than offset by a surge in holiday hiring.  Reporting By Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Andrea Ricci"

Euro zone finance ministers will meet in Brussels on Monday to discuss short-term debt relief for Greece, and Germany's Wolfgang Schaeuble said it must implement reforms instead of hoping for further debt forgiveness. Greece remained optimistic for a final debt deal, however, just as Italians are voting on a constitutional referendum on Sunday and a victory for the opposition 'No' camp may push the euro zone towards fresh crisis. Everyone realises that Europe cannot stand a rekindling of the Greek crisis, when there are issues with Italy and amid a pre-election period in many European countries, Dimitris Tzanakopoulos told Athens 9,84 radio. The general uncertainty which prevails in Europe - which is both political and financial - creates ... a momentum for a comprehensive and permanent solution for the Greek issue. Athens has received three international bailouts since 2010 and its debt, at about 180 percent of GDP, is still the highest in the euro zone. Talks between Athens and its official creditors as part of a bailout review have hit a snag on labour reforms including reviving collective bargaining on minimum wage and mass layoffs, in a country where unemployment stands at 23 percent. Differences also remain over a projected fiscal gap in 2018, when Greece's programme ends, and on energy reforms. The EU and the International Monetary Fund are at odds over the country's fiscal targets after 2018. The IMF, which has yet to decide if it will participate in Greece's bailout programme, says the target is unrealistic unless Athens is granted significant debt relief and adopts more austerity measures now. We've made clear that there is no chance we'll accept what the IMF demands on (austerity) measures and labour reforms, Tzanakopoulos said, calling on EU partners to support Greece. Germany, Europe's paymaster, wants the IMF to join the programme but says Greece does not need further debt relief. Finance minister Schaeuble urged Athens to implement reforms: If Greece wants to stay in the euro, there is no way around it - in fact completely regardless of the debt level, he told Bild am Sonntag in an interview on Sunday. Tzanakopoulos said targets beyond 2018 could be discussed after medium- and long-term debt relief measures were outlined. A second Eurogroup meeting could seal the deal, he said. The latest deadlock has sparked talk of early elections in Greece. The government has dismissed the rumours. Reporting by Renee Maltezou; Editing by Clelia Oziel"

Still, details of the Labor Department's monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) report published on Wednesday continued to point to a solid jobs market, with a steady rise in the number of people voluntarily quitting their jobs and declining layoffs. Job openings, a measure of labor demand, declined 388,000 to a seasonally adjusted 5.4 million, the lowest level since December, after surging to a record high in July. That pushed down the jobs openings rate three-tenths of a percentage point to 3.6 percent, also the lowest reading since December.  These data can be volatile and the openings rate is still fairly high, so it is too early to tell whether this is a signal or just the noise of volatile monthly data, said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York. However, if this drop is sustained, it could be a sign of increased caution on the part of businesses. The JOLTS report is one of the job market metrics on Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen's so-called dashboard. Fed officials view the labor market as being at or near full employment.  The U.S. central bank is widely expected to increase interest rates in December, having kept borrowing costs steady over course of the year because of persistently low inflation. The decline in job openings in August was led by   professional and business services, where vacancies fell 223,000. Job openings in the durable goods manufacturing industries decreased 29,000, and dropped 28,000 in the arts, entertainment and recreation sector. The bigger concern in the data is that openings declined year-over-year in some high-wage industries, like finance, professional services, and information, said Jed Kolko, chief economist for job site Indeed in San Francisco. Plus, last Friday's jobs report showed slower job growth in higher-wage industries. These factors are worth watching.The number of hires was little changed at 5.2 million in August, keeping the hiring rate steady at 3.6 percent. Job growth is slowing, with nonfarm payrolls increasing  156,000 in September. Employment growth has so far this year averaged 178,000 jobs per month, down from an average gain of 229,000 positions per month in 2015.  With the bulk of the labor market slack largely absorbed and the economy's recovery from the 2007-09 recession aging, the slowdown in payrolls growth is normal. Fed Chair Janet Yellen has said the economy needs to create about 100,000 jobs a month to keep up with population growth. Layoffs slipped to 1.62 million in August from 1.64 million in July, the JOLTS report showed. About 3.0 million Americans quit their jobs in August, maintaining a recent trend. The quits rate, which the Fed looks at as a measure of confidence in the jobs market, was at 2.1 percent for a third straight month. Nearly two-thirds of job separations are people voluntarily quitting rather than getting laid off or fired. That's a good indicator that workers are confident they will find new jobs, said Kolko.

Detroit automakers need a strong year-end sales push. They are sitting on hefty inventories of unsold sedans, compact cars and sports cars as consumers shift to pickup trucks and SUVs. The share prices of General Motors Co (GM.N), Ford Motor Co (F.N) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCAU.N) (FCHA.MI) are flat to down for the year. This reflects investor concerns that a six-year auto sales boom in the United States is reaching an end and that sustaining sales levels will require more aggressive price cutting.  We are seeing a tougher pricing environment, higher levels of discounts, said Ford Chief Executive Officer Mark Fields. He predicted November and December sales would be about the same as a year ago, when the annualized sales pace averaged about 17.9 million vehicles a year. Ford kicked off its Black Friday sales promotions in early November, after reporting an 11.7 percent drop in October sales.  Rivals have since followed suit. GM's GMC truck brand is promoting Black Friday All Month Long with discounts of as much as 20 percent off list prices for pickup trucks. Luxury automakers usually join the fray in December. Toyota Motor Corp's (7203.T) Lexus brand began touting its annual December to Remember deals ahead of Thanksgiving weekend, offering 0.9 percent, five-year loans or $1,000 off on its compact IS 300 sedan in certain markets. GM this week began offering markdowns on the Chevrolet Corvette sports car through retailer Costco Wholesale Corp's (COST.O) car-buying club, the first time the Corvette has been offered through the discount retailer's car buying service. At the start of the month, there were 122 days of Corvette inventory, up 51 percent from a year earlier and nearly double the level automakers consider ideal, according to Automotive News data. Like other retailers, automakers use holiday-themed promotions to boost sales during the final two months of the year, and like Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), Target Corp (TGT.N) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), automakers have steadily expanded the Christmas season over the past several years.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/bkc-virginia-providence-preview-idUSMTZECBQ903XK0","Preview: Virginia vs. Providence","","November 27, 2016 /  3:41 AM / 8 months ago","","Virginia's dominant defense continues to impress and the sixth-ranked Cavaliers are making quick work of their early-season opponents. They will try to stay perfect and take home some hardware when they square off with Providence in the title game of the Emerald Coast Classic in Niceville, Fla. on Saturday. Opponents are averaging only 39.2 points in Virginia's five wins, during which the ACC power has won by an average of 33.6, the latest rout coming via a 74-41 triumph over Iowa in Friday's semifinal. It's what we do, guard London Perrantes told reporters. We work on defense every single day in practice. We know what we have to do to win games. The Friars have thrived off of a stingy defense as well and picked up a 60-51 win over Memphis in the other semifinal contest. Rodney Bullock led the way with 18 points and Emmitt Holt returned from a one-game layoff to chip in 16 and 10 rebounds. TV: 7 p.m. ET, CBS Sports Network ABOUT VIRGINIA (5-0): The Cavaliers have a very balanced scoring attack as coach Tony Bennett has been afforded the opportunity to give virtually equal minutes to his starters and reserves each game. Backup Jarred Reuter was the latest bench player to take advantage of an extended run by recording career highs of 14 points and nine rebounds in Friday's win. Perrantes added a season-high 12 points and junior Isaiah Wilkins also had his best total of the season with 11 points on 4-of-5 shooting. ABOUT PROVIDENCE (4-1): Bullock and Holt are the only Friars who average in double figures in scoring and only point guard Kyron Cartwright (13 points) was able to join them in that category against Memphis. There was a lack of support once again from starting swingman Jalen Lindsey, who was held scoreless for the second straight game and missed all three of his shots. Cartwright's 13 points were a season high but his five assists were a season low, and he has turned the ball over 15 times in the last three games. Tip-Ins 1. Virginia is 59-2 when holding opponents under 50 points under Bennett. 2. Friars G Ryan Fazekas has played 88 minutes over the last four games without a turnover. 3. Cavaliers G Darius Thompson has scored in double figures in four of his first five games despite playing no more than 23 minutes in any of them. PREDICTION: Virginia 66, Providence 53 "

Crosby, the Conn Smythe Trophy winner last season while leading the Penguins to their second Stanley Cup of his 11-season career, took part in a full-contact practice Monday for the first time since training camp. He also came through the morning skate Tuesday without issues, according to coach Mike Sullivan. He's the best player in the world and, obviously, he does a lot of good things for our team, said Patric Hornqvist, who began the game as the right wing on Crosby's line. Scott Wilson was the left wing. Crosby, the 10th leading career scorer among active NHL players with 938 points in 707 games, showed no signs of a concussion until awakening Oct. 8 with a headache. Subsequent tests revealed the concussion but, unlike prior concussion layoffs when he was off for an extended time, the 29-year-old Crosby resumed skating almost immediately. Crosby had six goals and 19 points in 24 games during the playoffs last season as the Penguins added a second Stanley Cup to that he won as a 21-year-old in 2009.		 Editing by Frank Pingue"

Developers sold 509 units last month up from 341 units in September 2015, data compiled by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) showed on Monday. The number of units sold was up 8.8 percent from 468 units sold in August. (For more details, click on www.ura.gov.sg) But analysts doubts the jump indicates a turnaround as a slowdown in the trade-reliant economy is likely to hurt property demand. People are starting to think about the current situation: whether Singapore is ahead of a recessionary environment, so whether layoffs could affect affordability of new homes, said Christine Li, head of Singapore research for Cushman and Wakefield. Li said investors' demand is volatile when the economy faces uncertainty. It's purely sentiment-driven. It is not supported by underlying fundamentals such as rental markets, she said. The benchmark three-month Singapore interbank offered rate (SIBOR), used to set interest rates on mortgages, fell to 0.87 percent earlier this month, the lowest since July 2015. In January this year, the rate was above 1.25 percent, its highest since October 2008, the global financial crisis. Singapore's economy unexpectedly shrank in the third quarter from the previous three months, raising expectations that the central bank may ease its policy more. In the third quarter, private home prices fell at the fastest pace in seven years, a URA flash estimate showed earlier this month.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-budget-idUSL1N1I00T1","U.S. Congress set to vote on heading off government shutdown","","April 28, 2017 /  2:42 PM / 3 months ago","","WASHINGTON, April 28 (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives began debate on Friday on short-term legislation to avert a government shutdown at midnight and buy some time on reaching a deal on federal spending through Sept. 30. If the measure passes the House, as expected, the Senate would be prepared to take up the bill immediately in the hopes of approving and sending it to President Donald Trump to sign into law. The bill under consideration in the Republican-led Congress would provide federal funding until May 5, allowing lawmakers to hammer out legislation over the next few days to keep the government funded for the rest of the fiscal year on Sept. 30. Congress has been tied in knots over $1 trillion in spending priorities for months. Lawmakers were supposed to have taken care of the current fiscal year appropriations bills by last Oct. 1. Lawmakers' frustration at their inability to take care of the basic functions of government in a timely manner was on display on the House floor as debate opened. Let's make sure these basics are done for the American people and then let's get about the important business of changing their tax code and making sure they have the best healthcare in the world, said Republican Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma. In addition to opposition from Democrats, there are deep divisions among Republicans over exactly how to change the tax code and overhaul the U.S. healthcare system. The action on the spending bill comes a day after House Republican leaders again put on hold a possible vote on major healthcare legislation sought by Trump to dismantle the 2010 Affordable Care Act, dubbed Obamacare, after moderates in the party balked at provisions added to entice hardline conservatives. The government was last forced to close in October 2013, when Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and some of the most conservative House Republicans engineered a 17-day shutdown in an unsuccessful quest to kill former Democratic President Barack Obama's healthcare law. Run Out of Money Trump, a Republican, bowed to Democratic demands that the spending bill not include money to start building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border he said is needed to fight illegal immigration and stop drug smugglers. The Trump administration also agreed to continue funding for a major component of Obamacare despite Republican vows to end the program. Without the extension or a longer-term funding bill, federal agencies will run out of money by midnight Friday, likely triggering abrupt layoffs of hundreds of thousands of federal government workers until funding resumes. A federal closure would shutter National Park Service destinations like the Statue of Liberty, Yellowstone and the Grand Canyon. Government medical research would be suspended. Thousands of federal workers would be furloughed with thousands more working without pay until the shutdown ends, including homeland security personnel. Some veterans benefits could be suspended. In the bigger spending bill to be negotiated in the coming days, it remained unclear whether Republicans would prevail in their effort to sharply boost defense spending without similar increases for other domestic programs. Trump has proposed a $30 billion spending hike for the Pentagon for the rest of this fiscal year. House and Senate negotiators also have been struggling over funding to make a healthcare program for coal miners permanent and whether to plug a gap in Puerto Rico's Medicaid program, the government health insurance program for the poor.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-budget-idUSL1N1HZ1BC","Congress readies votes Friday on bill to avert government shutdown","","April 27, 2017 /  11:48 AM / 3 months ago","","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Congress is set to debate legislation that would extend until May 5 the deadline for a deal on federal spending through September and head off a feared government shutdown at midnight on Friday. The House Rules Committee, in a late-night meeting, voted 8-2 to send the legislation to the full House of Representatives for debate and votes on passage on Friday, just hours before expiry of a deadline for funding many federal agencies. If the measure passes the House, as expected, the Senate would be prepared to promptly take up the bill, in the hope of also passing it and sending it to President Donald Trump to be signed into law. The measure would give Republican and Democratic lawmakers an additional week to work out differences on about $1 trillion in funding for the government through Sept. 30, the end of the current fiscal year. Without the extension or a longer-term funding bill, federal agencies will run out of money by midnight Friday, likely triggering abrupt layoffs of hundreds of thousands of federal government workers until funding resumes.  The last government shutdown, in 2013, lasted for 17 days, and many lawmakers were nervous about the prospect of another. I'm confident we will be able to pass a short-term extension of funding for programs for the fiscal year that began nearly seven months ago, House Speaker Paul Ryan told reporters early on Thursday. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi warned that the purpose of the stopgap measure was to tie up loose ends of a deal to provide around $1 trillion in money for the fiscal year ending Sept. 30 and not for kicking the can down the road to have this same back-and-forth over funding disputes.   House Appropriations Committee Chairman Rodney Frelinghuysen expressed optimism in a statement that a final funding package will be completed soon. In the midst of the delicate negotiations, Trump took to social network Twitter to blast Democrats. As families prepare for summer vacations in our National Parks - Democrats threaten to close them and shut down the government. Terrible! Trump tweeted in a series of tweets. Negotiators were racing against the clock to resolve remaining disputes in the massive spending bill amid talks that have already handed Democrats at least two major victories, despite Republican control of Congress.     Trump, a Republican, gave in to Democratic demands that the spending bill not include money to start building the wall he wants to erect on the U.S.-Mexico border. His administration also agreed to continue funding for a major component of Obamacare, formally known as the Affordable Care Act, despite vows to end the program. It remained unclear whether Republicans would prevail in their effort to sharply hike defense spending without similar increases for other domestic programs. Trump has proposed a $30-billion spending boost for the Pentagon for the rest of this fiscal year. Such funding disputes could resurface later in spending bills for the next fiscal year. Disagreements remaining to be ironed out include funding to make a healthcare program for coal miners permanent and to plug a gap in Puerto Rico's Medicaid program, the government health insurance program for the poor.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/bkn-raptors-cavaliers-preview-idUSMTZED53DINLVF","Preview: Raptors at Cavaliers","","May 4, 2017 /  2:13 AM / 3 months ago","","The Cleveland Cavaliers have yet to stumble in the postseason and aim for their sixth consecutive victory when they host the Toronto Raptors in Wednesday's Game 2 of the Eastern Conference semifinals. The defending champion Cavaliers jumped on the third-seeded Raptors from the outset of the series opener and rolled to a 116-105 victory. Second-seeded Cleveland orchestrated a four-game sweep of the Indiana Pacers in the opening round and built a 12-point lead after one quarter while cruising past the Raptors on Monday. I just liked our energy, Cavaliers forward LeBron James told reporters. Our energy was very, very good and it sustained. That was a mystery with our eight-day layoff. For the most part, for 48 minutes we kept that level of intensity up. Cleveland knocked off the Raptors in last season's Eastern Conference finals when its four victories were by an average of 28.5 points and Toronto players know they need to prevent a landslide. We've just got to play defense and not let them go up and down and do what they do, play defense for 48 minutes, Raptors point guard Kyle Lowry told reporters after Game 1. We got to find ways to limit their spurts. TV: 7 p.m. ET, TNT ABOUT THE RAPTORS: Toronto coach Dwane Casey bristled when it was suggested his team was dominated in Game 1 but the final margin of the contest didn't reflect Cleveland's supremacy. The Raptors trailed by 22 points after three quarters and cutting the deficit in half in a quarter in which the outcome was long decided left the impression on shooting guard DeMar DeRozan that the Game 2 effort needs to be substantially better. We already got that foot in the hole and that's where we kick in and understand we fight well under adversity, DeRozan told reporters. We have done it all year. That has been our mantra, so that's something we have to exploit next game. ABOUT THE CAVALIERS: James contributed 35 points and 10 rebounds in the opener and needs just 25 points to pass Hall of Famer Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (5,762 points) for second place on the all-time postseason scoring list. Point guard Kyrie Irving also stood out in the opener with 24 points and a career playoff-best 10 assists while setting the tone for the victory. We wanted to come out, make a conscious effort to move the basketball as well as get out in transition, keep the pace up, make them play our game and go from there, Irving told reporters. Coach (Tyronn Lue) was right. It could have gone either way, but I'm glad it went in the direction of us getting out in transition and getting some easy shots as well as moving the basketball. Buzzer Beaters 1. C Tristan Thompson collected 14 rebounds in Game 1 to raise his playoff average to 11.6 and he has reached double digits in all five of Cleveland's playoff games. 2. Lowry recorded 20 points and 11 assists in the opener for his second double-double of the playoffs. 3. James has 88 career 30-point outings in the postseason, matching Kobe Bryant for second place on the all-time list. PREDICTION: Cavaliers 107, Raptors 100 "
"https://www.reuters.com/article/bkn-heat-hawks-preview-idUSMTZED2OVO3RUZ","Preview: Heat at Hawks","","February 25, 2017 /  4:01 AM / 5 months ago","","The Miami Heat look to pick up where they left off before the All-Star break when they visit the Atlanta Hawks on Friday. The Heat's 117-109 win at Houston on Feb. 15 gave them 14 wins in their final 16 games prior to the intermission, and a quiet trade deadline day left the squad content to move forward with an improving roster. Their commitment to becoming better basketball players has really opened my eyes to them, team president Pat Riley told reporters Thursday when discussing several role players who have stepped up in the past month. And possibly how I see them going down the road with us. Among those Riley was alluding to is shooting guard Dion Waiters, who had 20 points in a 116-93 win over Atlanta earlier this month and scored 23 in each of his final two games before the break. The Hawks made a pair of moves this week by acquiring Ersan Ilyasova from Philadelphia and shipping fellow forward Mike Scott to Phoenix for cash, which could add more scoring for a team that has mostly exchanged wins and losses of late. Atlanta plays seven of its first nine games out of the break at home, where it defeated Miami 103-95 on Dec. 7. TV: 8 p.m. ET, FSN Sun (Miami), FSN Southeast (Atlanta) ABOUT THE HEAT (25-32): While the deadline day passed with no drama in Miami, the team could be bolstered by the return of guard Josh Richardson (ankle), who was a full participant in Wednesday's practice and is expected to return from a 15-game layoff. Richardson had 19 points on 8-of-14 shooting to go along with three blocks and two steals in the only game he played against Atlanta this season. Waiters emerged while Richardson was out and is averaging 19.8 points while shooting 51.4 percent in February. ABOUT THE HAWKS (32-24): Atlanta comes out of the break ranked 25th in the NBA in 3-point shooting (34.1 percent) and 22nd in made 3s per game (8.9), an issue aided by the presence of Ilyasova, who is averaging a career-high two 3-pointers a contest. We definitely added some shooting, forward Kent Bazemore told reporters. We are looking to make this a home for him. He's one of the best shooters in the game as far as playing the stretch-4 position. If there is one thing we need is a little bit more shooting. Forward Thabo Sefolosha (groin) was removed from the injury report Thursday and is expected to return to the lineup after missing nine games. Buzzer Beaters 1. Heat PG Goran Dragic is averaging 24 points against Atlanta this season while making 5-of-9 3-pointers. 2. Ilyasova averaged 15 points and 6.7 rebounds in three games against Miami earlier this season while still with Philadelphia. 3. Hawks C Dwight Howard went into the break ranked second in the NBA in shooting (64.4 percent) and fourth in rebounding (13.0). PREDICTION: Hawks 104, Heat 100 "
"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-economy-consumers-idUSKBN18Q0SG","Indian economy rides on consumer spending revival ahead of GST launch","","May 30, 2017 /  8:59 AM / 2 months ago","","GURUGRAM, India (Reuters) - Kaveri Shukla and her fiance are on a shopping spree ahead of their wedding next month. In just one week, the couple has bought home appliances ranging from a rice cooker to a refrigerator and is purchasing a new car. Marriage is a kind of big spending commitment, said the 28-year-old financial consultant while shopping at an upscale mall in Gurugram, a satellite city and business hub near Delhi. It is an excuse to spend, not defer your purchases. Shukla is not alone. Millions like her are thronging shopping malls and stores in India, thanks to a busy wedding season. A heatwave is also boosting demand for air conditioners and refrigerators. It's a welcome change for an economy where consumer spending, traditionally a driver of growth, took a blow after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's shock decision last November to scrap high-value bank notes. The prospect of another big reform - the launch of a multi-rate Goods and Services Tax (GST) from July 1 - could also be bringing forward spending into the current quarter as shoppers look to avoid rates of 28 percent, or higher, on some consumer durables and luxury items.  The impact of the new tax regime is not clear -- some items are expected to be cheaper -- but the prospect of a price rise is seen pushing some people to buy ahead of July. The risk is spending falls away after the tax is launched. GST is a big unknown, said Kumar Rajagopalan, head of the Retailers Association of India. But it could turn out to be a big fillip in the short run. Other headwinds loom: Layoffs in the information-technology sector are unsettling some households at a time when the economy is still not generating enough new jobs for workforce that is growing by around a million people a month. High Frequency Economists polled by Reuters expect Asia's third-largest economy to expand by 7.1 percent on year in the January-March quarter, just up from 7.0 percent in the prior quarter and ahead of China's 6.9 percent growth rate. Some even expect a growth print as high as 7.8 percent when the GDP figures come out on Wednesday. India doesn't publish national figures on retail sales. But high-frequency indicators such as car sales, retail lending and goods imports show consumer spending has roared back to life. New passenger car sales grew at their fastest annual pace in at least 16 months in April. Imports of consumer goods last month surged by nearly a half from a year ago. Credit card loans growth is at its highest in at least 15 months.  Quarterly earnings of consumer goods makers from Hindustan Unilever (HLL.NS) to auto maker Maruti MRTI.N have also been upbeat. The consumer rebound backs the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) prediction of a V-shaped recovery from the cash clampdown, whereas many in the private sector had expected a longer slump. With a good monsoon and government pay hikes in prospect, the outlook for a sustained recovery looks good. And as consumer spending powers more than half of India's economic growth, the recovery has bolstered the prospects of stronger growth. We hope these drivers will spread the recovery far and wide, said Kamal Nandi, business head of appliances at Godrej consumer products (GOCP.NS).  Radhika Rao, an economist with DBS Bank in Singapore, reckons spending has recovered to near pre-demonetisation levels. It should get a leg up from the GST, she says, as the measure will reduce taxes on food and other essential items. Cost savings on non-discretionary items post-GST will boost discretionary spending, she said. An upward revision in GDP estimates might be warranted after Wednesday's data.

Butler missed three games earlier on the trip due to a nagging heel issue before returning to score 20 points in Friday's 115-97 loss at Phoenix. Following the game, during which he also banged his right knee in a collision, Butler was uncertain he would be able to finish the trip on the floor. Not going to say I'm out there completely healthy. I'm not, he told reporters Friday. But I want to compete, man. I want to go out there, I want to win, I want to lose, with my team, with my guys. I'm just hoping that this thing goes away so I can get back to not favoring it. The Timberwolves are 1-5 in their last six games after falling 122-106 to the New Orleans Pelicans at home Friday night. Karl-Anthony Towns and Andrew Wiggins combined for 65 points but their teammates shot a collective 32.6 percent in the defeat. TV: 3:30 p.m. ET, CSN Chicago, FSN North (Minnesota) ABOUT THE BULLS (26-28): Butler wasn't the only Chicago star hurting Friday night, as guard Dwyane Wade returned from a one-game layoff (illness) but hurt his wrist in a fall in the second half. I kind of can do my own X-rays nowadays, he told the media after scoring 18 points. I kind of know what's wrong. I can give my own diagnosis. I don't need that. I'll wake up tomorrow and see if it's badly bruised or if it's sprained or whatever. I know, so we'll see. Center Robin Lopez is averaging 14.7 points - nearly five over his season average - while shooting 57.4 percent in a six-game span. ABOUT THE TIMBERWOLVES (20-34): Minnesota blew an early 15-point lead in Friday's loss as its struggling defense allowed the Pelicans to shoot a season-high 60 percent. It's on us, Wiggins told reporters. (Coach Tom Thibodeau) keeps saying it, but he can't come out on the court and physically be out there playing for us. It's our mindset. We have to go out there and do it. Wiggins, Ricky Rubio and Gorgui Dieng combined for 10 steals but the Timberwolves were without a blocked shot for the first time since Nov. 13, 2015. Buzzer Beaters 1. The Timberwolves have won three straight over the Bulls, including a 99-94 win at Chicago on Dec. 13. 2.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eurozone-greece-idUSKBN16G1NE","Progress in Greek bailout review talks, labor issues remain open","","March 9, 2017 /  12:49 PM / 5 months ago","","ATHENS (Reuters) - Greece and its international lenders are close to a deal on its bailout review but differences remain on labor issues, the  government's spokesman said on Thursday. Dimitris Tzanakopoulos said a comprehensive deal would include a change in Greece's fiscal mix from 2019 and clarity on medium-term debt relief measures. Our aim is to have the discussions on a staff-level agreement concluded by the next Eurogroup meeting (of euro zone finance ministers) of March 20, he told reporters. Creditors started fresh negotiations with Athens last week on signing off on a new bailout review under the terms of the country's 86 billion euro ($91 billion) financing facility. The talks at a central Athens hotel wrapped up on Thursday, and will continue via teleconference over the coming days, a senior government official said. The European Stability Mechanism and the European Central Bank, which participated in the talks, also said the aim was to rapidly reach a technical agreement that could lead to a political deal at the March 20 Eurogroup meeting. Related CoverageIMF welcomes 'progress' in Greek bailout talks, deal unclearTzanakopoulos said a deal would allow Greece to participate in the European Central Bank's asset purchase program and return to financial markets. Once we have a comprehensive agreement, there will be a discussion by the ECB on including Greece in QE (quantitative easing). I think there will be a positive development on this issue. Greece in 2015 signed up to its third bailout since the debt crisis started. Negotiations with lenders on its bailout performance have dragged on for months mainly due to a rift between the European Union and the International Monetary Fund over fiscal targets.  Greece's reference to a comprehensive deal includes a staff-level agreement with lenders on energy and labor reforms and fiscal issues, clarity on medium-term debt restructuring, and another batch of fiscal measures from 2019 to keep the primary surplus - excluding debt servicing costs - at about 3.5 percent of Gross Domestic Product. EU officials cited important progress on a number of key reforms in the financial sector and the package of fiscal measures for 2019, which the leftist-led government agreed to legislate to help speed up the talks.  But the IMF, which has not decided if it will participate financially in Greece's current bailout program, said Prospects for an agreement were still unclear. The IMF said Greece cannot maintain high primary surpluses unless it adopts more belt-tightening and is granted further debt relief by the EU. The fund is also seeking a relaxation to labor laws, including freeing up mass layoffs. Views of the IMF and Greece are different. We will try to bridge these differences, Tzanakopoulos said. IMF spokesman Gerry Rice noted progress in the negotiations but said he was not aware of any IMF board discussions over a specific financial contribution. There has been progress in some important areas and we welcome that. However, differences remain in important areas, Rice told a news briefing. He said in a later statement that the progress included discussions on a balanced fiscal package and financial sector reforms. Talks would continue next week on pension and labor market reforms, Rice added.    IMF participation in Greece's bailout is viewed as key for Europe, with national elections looming in the Netherlands, France and Germany.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/hkn-blues-wild-preview-idUSMTZED37G1G2XZ","Preview: Blues at Wild","","March 8, 2017 /  4:53 AM / 5 months ago","","It took a matchup against the worst team in hockey for the St. Louis Blues to halt their five-game slide, but they will be stepping well up in class when they visit the Central Division-leading Minnesota Wild on Tuesday night. The Blues hold a one-point lead for the final playoff in the Western Conference as they conclude a three-game road trip. St. Louis had scored six goals during its five-game skid before posting a 3-0 shutout over the woeful Colorado Avalanche, but coach Mike Yeo knows there's plenty of area for improvement. Our play with the puck has to be better, Yeo said at Monday's practice. You come into this building tomorrow and we won't create offense against a team like this if we don't have that. The Wild's lead atop the division has been cut to one point by white-hot Chicago despite going 9-3-1 in their last 13 games -- with two of the losses coming by 1-0 scores. While the teams have split the first four meetings this season, Minnesota outscored the Blues 8-2 in winning the last two at Xcel Energy Center. TV: 8 p.m. ET, FSN Midwest (St. Louis), FSN Wisconsin, FSN North (Minnesota) ABOUT THE BLUES (32-27-5): Goaltender Jake Allen, who took a shot in the throat late in Sunday's shutout and admitted it was tough to talk after the game, was at Monday's optional practice. Rookie defenseman Jordan Schmaltz made his NHL debut at Colorado and overcame some early struggles to finish plus-1 while playing 15 minutes. He got better as the game went on, Yeo said. You can see the poise in his game, you can see his puck presence, you can see how he can help us execute. ABOUT THE WILD (42-15-6): Minnesota finally had its revamped lineup intact with forwards Zach Parise and Jason Pominville returning to the lineup in Sunday's 3-1 victory over Pacific Division-leading San Jose after missing three games apiece with the mumps. The 11-day layoff didn't affect Parise, who scored for the seventh time in 12 games. “I felt like I had a lot of energy,” Parise said. “I didn’t really know which way it was going to go after having, basically, 10 days off.” Overtime 1. Wild D Christian Folin will be sidelined at least three weeks due to an upper-body injury. 2. Blues F Jaden Schwartz has one goal in his last 18 games, but he tallied twice and had an assist in two contests versus the Wild this season. 3. Wild G Devan Dubnyk has more losses (11) against the Blues than any other opponent, although he allowed one goal in each of his last two starts against them. PREDICTION: Wild 3, Blues 2 "

This acquisition has a lot of financial logic, we're talking about two institutions that complete each other perfectly, CEO of Caixabank, Gonzalo Cortazar, told a news conference, adding that the Portuguese market has potential. The takeover took nearly two years to complete and was designed to boost Caixabank revenues outside Spain, where it faces stiff competition for lending. The Barcelona-based lender was one of Spain's most acquisitive banks during the financial crisis, and has struggled to offset falling profitability at home by buying smaller savings banks. It launched its first bid for BPI in 2015 at 1.329 euros per share, but opposition by some shareholders, notably Angolan investor Isabel dos Santos, forced it to withdraw that bid last year, only to make a lower final offer of 1.134 euros a share. Dos Santos, the daughter of Angola's president, had a stake of about 20 percent in the Portuguese bank. It was not immediately clear whether she was fully bought out. BPI CEO Fernando Ulrich will step down, but Caixabank proposed that he be elected chairman of the board at BPI, which will keep its decision-making center in Portugal.

Before the completion of the takeover, BPI handed control of its lucrative Angolan unit BFA to Angolan telecoms firm Unitel to meet requirements by the European Central Bank on risky exposure to the Angolan economy. Dos Santos also indirectly controls Unitel and the BFA deal was seen as a way of winning her approval for the takeover.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-pipeline-keystone-idUSL2N1H011G","State Department to approve Keystone pipeline permit on Friday: sources","","March 23, 2017 /  3:35 PM / in 4 months","","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department plans to approve on Friday the permit needed to proceed with construction of the Canada-to-United States Keystone XL oil pipeline, a project blocked by former President Barack Obama, according to two government sources familiar with the process. White House spokesman Sean Spicer said the administration would provide an update on Keystone on Friday but did not offer any details. Two government sources, who declined to be identified, said on Thursday that the pipeline approval would be announced by the White House.  One of the sources said the State Department was working to get the approval completed before Monday, the end of the 60-day timeline under Trump's January executive order for the construction of Keystone and the Dakota Access pipelines. The move would mark the beginning of a process that could be lengthy. Approvals are needed from state regulators, and the project could face legal challenges.  But Republican President Donald Trump supports Keystone and, days after he took office in January, ordered its construction. That could mean the project, proposed in 2008, will eventually be completed.  The State Department's undersecretary for political affairs, Tom Shannon, is expected approve the cross-border permit for TransCanada Corp's pipeline since Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, the former CEO of ExxonMobil, recused himself from the matter.  The multi-billion dollar Keystone pipeline would bring more than 800,000 barrels-per-day of heavy crude from Canada's oil sands to U.S. refineries and ports along the Gulf of Mexico, via an existing pipeline network in Nebraska. Obama had rejected the pipeline saying it would do nothing to reduce fuel prices for U.S. motorists and would contribute emissions linked to global warming.  TransCanada resubmitted its permit application after Trump's executive order. Spokesman Terry Cunha said the company was working closely with the State Department.  Monday is the deadline, so that's what we're working towards, Cunha said.   Conservatives said they supported quick approval. Nick Loris, an energy and environment researcher at the Heritage Foundation, said approval would reestablish some certainty and sanity to a permitting process that was hijacked by political pandering.   Environmental groups said they had been prepared for the  approval and vowed Thursday to fight the pipeline at every turn with petitions, political pressure and mass protests. The same communities who defeated this pipeline before - indigenous leaders, landowners, farmers and grassroots activists - are ready to fight again, said May Boeve, director of activist group 350.org.  Diana Best, a Greenpeace climate campaign specialist said, We will resist these projects with our allies across the country and across borders.   Further Hurdles A stretch of Keystone XL also awaits approval from Nebraska regulators. Transcanada has to file its pipeline route plans with the state's Public Service Commission, which is required to hold public hearings on the proposal. Keystone's construction costs could be higher than the $7 billion estimated after it was first proposed, said Michael Wojciechowski, vice president of Americas oil and refining markets research at Wood Mackenzie.  Final costs are still to be determined, but they have done nothing but go up over time, he said.  Still, there could also be some savings on labor given recent layoffs due to the recent oil price drop, he said.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/global-forex-idUSL3N1HI04R","FOREX-Dollar at 3-wk highs on Fed official comment; Syria, N.Korea in focus","","April 10, 2017 /  12:57 AM / 4 months ago","","* U.S. jobs growth falls short but trend seen intact * Euro pressured by French election uncertainty * U.S. dollar net long positions at 5-week low-IMM data TOKYO, April 10 (Reuters) - The dollar started the week at three-week highs against a currency basket on Monday, after a key U.S. Federal Reserve official reinforced the central bank's commitment to interest rate hikes. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against six major rival currencies, added 0.1 percent to 101.260, reaching out to its highest levels since March 15. New York Fed President William Dudley said the Fed might avoid raising interest rates at the same time that it begins shrinking its $4.5 trillion bond portfolio, prompting only a little pause in the central bank's rate hike plans. His comments bolstered U.S. Treasury yields and burnished the dollar's yield allure. The benchmark 10-year yield, which wallowed at its lowest levels since November on Friday, last stood at 2.384 percent in Asian trading, up from its U.S. close of 2.373 percent. Rising interest rates in the U.S. are supporting the dollar, I think, said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief currency strategist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo. Financial markets were also watching out for developments in the Syrian civil war following last week's U.S. missile strikes on an airbase in Syria, which had given the perceived safe-haven Japanese currency a boost. The U.S. attacks were in retaliation for what it said was a chemical weapons attack on civilians by President Bashar al-Assad's forces. The strikes drew sharp criticism from Russia, and questions from U.S. allies about future policy. Geopolitical risk can be a potentially positive factor for the yen, with risk aversion and flight to safety, Yamamoto added. As for the euro, markets are pricing in uncertainty around the French presidential election. The dollar tacked on 0.3 percent to 111.43 yen. Geopolitical tensions in Asia were also in focus, after the U.S. decision to move a Navy strike group toward the Korean peninsula following provocative behaviour from North Korea. White House national security adviser H.R. McMaster said on Sunday that the move was a prudent step. U.S. jobs data on Friday missed forecasts but still suggested that overall labour market strength remained intact. Job growth slowed sharply in March amid inclement weather, and as layoffs continued in the retail sector, but the unemployment rate dropped to a nearly 10-year low of 4.5 percent. Despite expectations for more Fed interest rate hikes, speculators further trimmed their bullish bets on the U.S. dollar in the week ended April 4, pushing net longs to their lowest level since late February, according to Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released on Friday and calculations by Reuters. The euro edged down 0.1 percent to $1.0580 after earlier touching $1.0570, its lowest level since March 9. For weeks, polls have shown centrist Emmanuel Macron and far-right leader Marine Le Pen on track to top the first round of voting on April 23 and go through to a May 7 runoff. But recent polls have shown the race tightening. (Reporting by Tokyo markets team; Editing by Shri Navaratnam)"
"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy-idUSKBN17M1HT","U.S. labor market tightening; mid-Atlantic factory activity cools","","April 20, 2017 /  12:34 PM / 3 months ago","","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New applications for U.S. jobless benefits rose slightly more than expected last week, but a drop in the number of Americans on unemployment rolls to a 17-year low suggested the labor market continues to tighten. The labor market's strength was underscored by other data on Thursday showing manufacturers in the mid-Atlantic region hired more workers this month and increased working hours, even as factory activity slowed from March's brisk pace. Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 244,000 for the week ended April 15, the Labor Department said. The increase followed three straight weeks of declines.  Given that the labor market is near full employment with a 4.5 percent jobless rate and companies are reporting difficulties finding skilled workers, some economists see limited scope for claims to fall further. Layoffs remain low and employers feel no need to aggressively trim their payrolls. As labor market conditions tighten, the pool of available unemployed skilled workers continues to dry up, said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors in Kalamazoo, Michigan.  Claims have now been below 300,000, a threshold associated with a healthy labor market, for 111 straight weeks. That is the longest such stretch since 1970, when the labor market was smaller. Economists had forecast first-time applications for jobless benefits rising to 242,000 last week. The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 4,250 to 243,000 last week.  Shrinking Unemployed Pool The number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid decreased 49,000 to 1.98 million in the week ended April 8, the lowest reading since April 2000.  In a separate report, the Philadelphia Federal Reserve said its index of current manufacturing activity fell to a still-high reading of 22.0 this month from 32.8 in March. The index has been positive for nine consecutive months. April's slowdown was driven by a pullback in the new orders and shipments measures. Firms reported an increase in manufacturing employment and workweek this month. The current employment index rose 2.4 points to its  highest level since May 2011.  There was also a jump in manufacturers reporting intentions to boost capital spending this year. The capital expenditures expectations index rose to its highest level in just over 17 years. The continued increase bodes well for continued strength in capex spending in coming months, said Kevin Cummins, senior U.S. economist at NatWest Markets in Stamford, Connecticut. The dollar was trading marginally lower against a basket of currencies, while U.S. stocks rose amid increased optimism around the first-quarter earnings season. Prices for U.S. Treasuries fell.  The claims data covered the survey week for April nonfarm payrolls. Claims declined 17,000 between the March and April survey periods, suggesting that job growth likely picked up this month. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 98,000 jobs in March, the fewest since May 2016. An acceleration in employment growth would confirm that March's moderation was weather-driven and underscore the economy's strong fundamentals despite signs that growth slowed to well below a 1.0 percent annualized rate in the first quarter.

The dollar hit a year low against a currency basket after the European Central Bank's chief abstained from talking down the euro, while obstacles to U.S. President Donald Trump's policy agenda also weighed. A weaker dollar makes dollar-priced copper cheaper for non-U.S. investors. Also helping copper, China's economy expanded faster than expected in the second quarter, data this week showed, setting the country on course to comfortably meet its 2017 growth target. Overall demand in China is not that bad at all, said Richard Fu, head of Asia and Pacific at LME Floor Member AMT. In general global economic figures are improving, there’s supply disruptions here and there, plus the Chinese want to cut metal production in order to tackle pollution and over-capacity, he added. Fundamentals * LME COPPER: Three-month LME copper closed up 0.8 percent at $6,004 a tonne, having hit its highest since March 1 at $6,051. * INVENTORIES: Copper inventories in Shanghai Futures Exchange-monitored warehouses fell 4.9 percent from last Friday to their lowest since January. * STRIKE: An estimated 5,000 workers at the giant Grasberg copper mine operated by Freeport-McMoRan Inc's Indonesian unit will extend their strike for a fourth month in a dispute over layoffs and employment terms. * COPPER DEFICIT: The world refined copper market showed a 53,000 tonne deficit in April, compared with an 18,000 tonne deficit in March, industry data showed. * CHINA FORECASTS: The Asian Development Bank raised its 2017 and 2018 growth forecasts for China and other countries in the region. * ALUMINIUM OUTPUT: Daily average primary aluminium output excluding China rose to 70,300 tonnes in June, from 70,000 tonnes in May, industry data showed. Although sweeping production cuts were announced in recent months, especially in China, they have not been implemented so far or have been offset by new capacities. We see no justification for the high aluminium price, said Commerzbank in a note. * ALUMINIUM PRICES: Aluminium closed down 0.1 percent at $1,915. * NICKEL EXPORTS: Indonesia exported 403,201 tonnes of nickel ore in the first six months of 2017, when a complete ban on exports was lifted. * NICKEL MINING BAN: Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte said the government will draft a new law for the country's mining industry. Worries over supply from the Philippines have faded since the country's firebrand environment secretary was replaced in May. * NICKEL PRICE: LME nickel ended up 0.3 percent at $9,520 a tonne. * SPREADS: Discounts of cash copper, aluminium and lead to their three-month contracts were near multi-year highs, signalling ample nearby supply. MCU0-3, MAL0-3, MPB0-3 * U.S. ECONOMY: Jobless claims fell more than expected to the lowest level in nearly five months, suggesting strong job gains that should continue to underpin economic growth. * OTHER METALS: Zinc closed up 1 percent at $2,753, lead closed up 1.2 percent at $2,239 while tin ended up 0.8 percent at $20,225.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-puertorico-debt-oversightboard-idUSKBN1542X3","Puerto Rico governor cites 'sharp contrast' with island's overseers","","January 20, 2017 /  10:50 PM / 6 months ago","","(Reuters) - Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello on Friday criticized a set of recommendations by the federal board in charge of managing the U.S. territory's finances, signaling a potential power struggle between the government and the board on how to pull the island out of economic crisis. In a letter to the board on Friday, Rossello said that while he supports reducing government spending, he would not focus on layoffs as a primary means of saving money. He also took a more moderate stance on reducing repayments to holders of the island's $70 billion in debt, saying his administration had a fundamental willingness to pay based upon available resources.  The board, in a letter to the governor on Wednesday, said the island may have only $800 million available annually for debt service, just 21 percent of what it owes. The board's letter had called for Puerto Rico to save more than $4.5 billion a year through a mix of savings and new revenues, including by right-sizing government through a 30 percent reduction in payroll and other means.  The board also said it favored extending some key deadlines that could give Rossello's administration more time to negotiate consensual restructuring deals with creditors. [L1N1F82HL] In addition to its debt from a myriad of public issuers, Puerto Rico is struggling with a 45 percent poverty rate and unemployment that is more than twice the mainland U.S. average.  The bipartisan, seven-member oversight board was created under the federal Puerto Rico rescue law known as PROMESA, passed by the U.S. Congress last year. It is charged with helping the island manage its finances and negotiate restructuring deals with creditors. Rossello's adversarial tone could score him political points on an island where many locals view the oversight board as an extension of U.S. imperialism. However, his policies and the board's vision may be more aligned than not. For instance, both stress the need for the island to reduce spending and create new revenue sources. That is a departure from Rossello's predecessor, former Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla, who called for dramatic repayment cuts in favor of maintaining government services.  Rossello and the board may clash on healthcare spending, with the board calling for $1 billion a year in savings. Puerto Rico's Medicare and Medicaid insurance programs are in financial trouble, due in part to federal government reimbursement levels that are disproportionately smaller than what is given to U.S. states.  Rossello said he felt highly confident his administration would convince Congress to increase that funding. There is no single political leader in the world that would want to be responsible for ... endangering the health and wellbeing of 3.5 million of its citizens, the governor said. The board also called on Puerto Rico to annually save $300 million in higher education spending and $200 million in pension costs. Rossello said he would implement means-testing for tuition rates at the University of Puerto Rico, move pension benefits into private accounts, and implement rules to treat some pension benefits as taxable ordinary income.

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy-employment-idUSKCN12C1UP","U.S. job openings hit eight-month low, labor market still strong","","October 12, 2016 /  2:58 PM / 9 months ago","","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job openings fell to an eight-month low in August and hiring was little changed, suggesting some easing in labor market conditions amid an aging economic recovery.  Still, details of the Labor Department's monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) report published on Wednesday continued to point to a solid jobs market, with a steady rise in the number of people voluntarily quitting their jobs and declining layoffs. Job openings, a measure of labor demand, declined 388,000 to a seasonally adjusted 5.4 million, the lowest level since December, after surging to a record high in July. That pushed down the jobs openings rate three-tenths of a percentage point to 3.6 percent, also the lowest reading since December.  These data can be volatile and the openings rate is still fairly high, so it is too early to tell whether this is a signal or just the noise of volatile monthly data, said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York. However, if this drop is sustained, it could be a sign of increased caution on the part of businesses. The JOLTS report is one of the job market metrics on Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen's so-called dashboard. Fed officials view the labor market as being at or near full employment.  The U.S. central bank is widely expected to increase interest rates in December, having kept borrowing costs steady over course of the year because of persistently low inflation. The decline in job openings in August was led by   professional and business services, where vacancies fell 223,000. Job openings in the durable goods manufacturing industries decreased 29,000, and dropped 28,000 in the arts, entertainment and recreation sector. The bigger concern in the data is that openings declined year-over-year in some high-wage industries, like finance, professional services, and information, said Jed Kolko, chief economist for job site Indeed in San Francisco. Plus, last Friday's jobs report showed slower job growth in higher-wage industries. These factors are worth watching.The number of hires was little changed at 5.2 million in August, keeping the hiring rate steady at 3.6 percent. Job growth is slowing, with nonfarm payrolls increasing  156,000 in September. Employment growth has so far this year averaged 178,000 jobs per month, down from an average gain of 229,000 positions per month in 2015.  With the bulk of the labor market slack largely absorbed and the economy's recovery from the 2007-09 recession aging, the slowdown in payrolls growth is normal. Fed Chair Janet Yellen has said the economy needs to create about 100,000 jobs a month to keep up with population growth. Layoffs slipped to 1.62 million in August from 1.64 million in July, the JOLTS report showed. About 3.0 million Americans quit their jobs in August, maintaining a recent trend. The quits rate, which the Fed looks at as a measure of confidence in the jobs market, was at 2.1 percent for a third straight month. Nearly two-thirds of job separations are people voluntarily quitting rather than getting laid off or fired. That's a good indicator that workers are confident they will find new jobs, said Kolko.

The cuts will total 530 people, slashing 370 positions in Canada and 160 in the United States.  Calgary-based Enbridge launched the organizational review in the first quarter of 2016, spokeswoman Suzanne Wilton said in an email.  The reduction is not related to the company's $28 billion (C$37 billion) acquisition of Canadian pipeline operator Spectra Energy Corp, Wilton said, which Enbridge announced in September.  The cuts come roughly three weeks after Enbridge announced a $1.075 billion sale of its South Prairie assets, which includes liquids pipelines and related facilities in Southeast Saskatchewan and southwest Manitoba. The latest layoffs are not the first employee cuts by Enbridge since oil prices fell into a two-year slump. Last November, Enbridge cut 5 percent of its workforce, which at the time represented about 500 positions in Canada and the United States, as well as 100 unfilled positions. Tens of thousands of jobs have been lost in both the Canadian and U.S. oil and gas sector since prices crashed in mid-2014.  Enbridge recently became an investor in the embattled Dakota Access Pipeline, after ditching plans to build the proposed Sandpiper Pipeline through the U.S. Midwest in a joint venture with Marathon Petroleum. Construction on the Dakota Access, which will move crude from the Bakken shale to the Midwest and U.S. Gulf Coast, was halted in early September following protests from Native American groups.

In the end, both were disappointed. The 35-year-old former world number one, out of action for four months due to a persistent shoulder injury, was bundled out in the second round by American compatriot Madison Brengle. The performance was hardly the best preparation for the Australian Open in less than two weeks' time, especially since she said in her only media conference before the Auckland tournament that her goal was to add more grand slam titles before she brings the curtain down on her career. Williams equalled Steffi Graf's Open era record of 22 grand slam titles last year when she clinched her seventh Wimbledon crown and sits just two away from the all-time record held by Australia's Margaret Court. She played just two more tournaments after that victory on the grass in London, losing to Ukraine's Elina Svitolina in the third round at the Rio Olympics then was upset by Karolina Pliskova at the U.S. Open semi-finals. Williams then promptly shut down her season to have treatment on the injury. The American arrived in New Zealand to a large media contingent and was feted as the biggest name to ever play a tennis tournament in the country. She chose to skip media and sponsorship commitments to concentrate on fine tuning her preparations and shook off some of the rust in a less-than-convincing 6-3 6-4 victory over France's Pauline Parmentier in the first round. Against Brengle, however, she seemed unable to change her game plan and adapt to the windy conditions, which she later described as her least favorite, trying to blast her light-hitting compatriot off court. Instead booming forehands flew high and wide and she committed 88 unforced errors.  I don't think I have hit 88 errors in my life, she told reporters. Eighty-eight unforced errors, you really need to go back to the drawing board because quite frankly it's unprofessional. Apart from her inability to change tactics, her most dangerous weapon, her first serve, also lacked the usual velocity and numerous times she showed her frustration at the windy conditions. Her desire to head to Melbourne for better weather and comments that Auckland was not a great place for her to assess her game caused something of a stir on Thursday, with the New Zealand Herald's Michael Burgess suggesting they were a slight on the tournament itself. Overall, Williams' time here was a disappointment, Burgess wrote. Her presence gave the tournament massive exposure, but Williams never gave the impression that she wanted to pay back her huge appearance fee.
