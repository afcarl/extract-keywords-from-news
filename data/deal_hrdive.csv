Judge Amy Berman Jackson’s decision to nix the merger had been expected for weeks. Jackson said the merger was noncompetitive, leaving workers covered by large employers’ health plans with just three insurers from which to buy healthcare. The judge also said that the merger would have increased healthcare prices.Besides the noncompetitive nature of the merger and anticipated price hikes, Axios said another deal-breaker was the behind-the-scenes bickering between Anthem and Cigna over the combined company’s direction and daily operations.Jackson had consumers’ welfare in mind when ruling against the merger. She questioned whether healthcare providers would charge higher prices for being overworked, as the merger would likely have caused, and said consumers would be left with fewer insurers from which to choose, a violation of antitrust laws. Jackson’s decision was the second such victory for the U.S. Justice Department. Last month federal judge John B. Bates blocked the Aetna-Humana merger. Aetna has until Feb. 15 to appeal. Anthem reportedly plans to appeal the ruling. The company could lose $1.85 billion in merger fees if the decision stands. "
"http://www.hrdive.com/news/shell-accused-of-hiring-discrimination-by-security-advisor-job-candidate/446488/","Shell accused of hiring discrimination by security advisor job candidate","","PostedJuly 6, 2017","","Shell Oil Co. faces an age discrimination lawsuit brought forth by a man whose job candidacy was the center of a previous legal battle involving Shell earlier this year, the Houston Chronicle reports. In early 2017, Crockett Oaks III, Shell's former head of U.S. security, sued the company for firing him when he selected 53-year-old Michael G. Oliveri, a qualified candidate with a military background, for a security advisor job. The lawsuit, which has since been settled, alleged that Oaks was directed to hire a young, female candidate instead of Oliveri, then later blocked his hiring and fired Oaks.  Oliveri says he was denied a $114,000 job with bonuses and subsequently lost his contractor job with Shell. He is reportedly seeking damages for lost wages and legal fees.  Age discrimination is a violation of federal law and employers can face liability when they give preference to younger candidates because of their age. HR's understanding of ageism must go beyond bullying and other forms of overt harassment (even though such problems do exist and should be taken seriously). Employers may not even realize that they may be discriminating against older workers just by including certain fields on a job application. The key is to be mindful of unconscious biases when making hiring decisions and remember that seasoned candidates can often bring a great deal of knowledge and skill to a company. As older workers continue to alter the common conception of retirement planning by re-entering the workforce, HR departments across industries will be forced to confront the problem of age discrimination head on."
"http://www.hrdive.com/news/tesla-to-shake-up-hr-leadership-as-employee-allegations-surface/443680/","Tesla to shake up HR leadership as employee allegations surface","","PostedMay 26, 2017","","Tesla announced a leadership change within its HR department earlier this week amid a string of public allegations from a number of U.S. and international employees, Buzzfeed News reports. Gaby Toledano, formerly of Electronic Arts, will succeed Arnnon Geshuri as Tesla's VP of Human Resources, the automotive and energy company announced in a statement. Geshuri is the third HR executive to leave Tesla in 2017, according to Buzzfeed. Tesla has been the target of several recent controversies, with employees reporting instances of discrimination, unsafe working conditions and workplace harassment. POLITICO's Morning Shift reports that data analyzed by Worksafe, a nonprofit focused on occupational safety, shows injury rates at Tesla plants were higher than industry averages in 2014 and 2015, and were similarly on track for 2016. It's important not to forget the context of the announcement, given its occurrence just months after Tesla employee Jose Moran wrote a blog post criticizing managers at a Tesla plant in Fremont, CA for alleged safety violations. Moran also called on Tesla employees to unionize in cooperation with the United Auto Workers union. Tesla leadership has vehemently denied the allegations, with CEO Elon Musk calling Moran's assertions outright false. But the controversies have grown in number since then, the most poignant being a video taken by one of its manufacturing plant workers which recorded the use of racial slurs from co-workers targeting the employee. Without diving into the particulars of each incident in depth, the takeaway for HR leaders, particularly at industry disrupters like Tesla, is the need to listen to employee complaints directly and candidly. Not even halfway into 2017, several organizations have had to deal with the fallout of poor HR practices and documentation. Incidents at Fox News and Uber immediately come to mind, but this trend goes beyond a small handful of firms. Simultaneously, ethics reporting rates have increased steadily since 2010, with nearly 1.4 reported incidents per 100 employees in 2016. More than ever, the C-Suite has been tasked with leading by example when it comes to ethical conduct. As with many processes in HR, the cure begins with culture. How should employees expect to be treated in the workplace, and to which values will management point in the event that things go south?  Some, like Google, have upped transparency and accountability, though the tech giant itself is no stranger to HR controversy. Google employees have begun meticulously documenting instances of biases and harassment encountered during the day-to-day, with 20% of staff subscribed to an email list that reports any such incidents."

Aon plans to use part of the proceeds to buy back some of its shares and raise its repurchase option to $7.7 million. If the agreement falls through, Blackstone will pay Aon a $215 million termination fee, according to Aon’s filings, says Reuters.For weeks there had been reports of a potential multi-billion dollar sale of Aon Hewitt. Near the end of last month, Clayton Dubilier & Rice LLC, a buyout company, seemed to have the edge over Blackstone in pre-sale discussions.As HR Dive reported, Aon’s divestiture of the benefits outsourcing side of the business allows it to focus on both insurance and cybersecurity, the latter being a major growth area. Divestitures, like acquisitions, provide companies with opportunities to focus on their core business and grow in other areas.In May, Hewitt added Univers, a benefits enrollment and communication firm, to its portfolio. It could prove to be a wise move as companies expand their benefits offerings to attract and retain hires. Blackstone may hold on to Hewitt — which processes workplace benefits for 15% of the U.S. population — or sell it for a substantial profit, as investment firms often do.​"

The acquisition is scheduled to be completed during the second quarter. Workforce says the deal could be the next phase in small companies like Saba building bigger HR technology suites by purchasing firms like Halogen.Saba specializes in learning and development, while Halogen’s focus is performance management, says Workforce. The merger reportedly will boost Saba as a leading SaaS talent management provider. The combined companies are expected to serve 4,000 customers worldwide. Saba’s acquisition of Halogen is like many technology mergers in which the buyer selects companies that complement their core business. In Saba’s case, Halogen expertise in performance management balance’s Saba’s learning platform to advance HR technology. In fact, Forrester Research named Saba among the top three cloud-based HR performance management and learning software providers.Acquisitions in the space last year were largely dominated by recruiting firms, including the acquisition of LinkedIn by Microsoft and the various acquisitions made by Randstad Holdings, like Monster. Such moves are likely to continue in the new year, particularly in the learning field, which is seeing strong innovation."
"http://www.hrdive.com/news/truck-driver-charges-united-van-lines-with-employee-misclassification/444842/","Truck driver charges United Van Lines with employee misclassification","","PostedJune 13, 2017","","United Van Lines LLC, is sued for allegedly misclassifying a truck driver as an independent contractor after working more than 10 years for the company, reports the Saint Louis Record. Truck driver Sammy Davis filed a class-action lawsuit, claiming the transportation company paid drivers on a percentage of the cargo hauled instead of on the amount customers paid the company. Davis also alleges that the company required drivers to pay for fuel, repairs, lease payments and other expenses and paid drivers less than the minimum wage, according to the Record. Davis said he worked 16-hour days, but was denied overtime pay. As a result, he contends that the company violated the Fair Labor Standards Act and the Missouri Minimum Wage Law. The plaintiff wants a jury trial and seeks compensation for damages, legal fees and other relief the court finds fair and appropriate.  At the core of the case is the driver's classification — a growing issue for many companies that employ truck drivers of any kind. Certain issues at hand include his length of employ and whether or not he depended on the company for his livelihood. These standards have been used to catch employers with misclassification in the past. ​According to Supply Chain Dive, drivers have been in short supply for a long time. But the driver shortage worsened with increased regulation, stricter hiring rules and drivers retiring from the vocation. This means the remaining drivers are making longer trips with larger freight. Administratively, it might make more sense for employers to classify drivers as independent contractors, since many act as independent agents, but courts have become increasingly leery of such arrangements. The gig economy, generally, continues to be a source of frustration for courts and employers. More industries are turning to gig or contract work to make up talent shortages and scale talent needs appropriately without large overhead costs. But the Uber classification debacle is an example of how widespread the practice has become — and how dangerous it is to do it wrong.  "

"http://www.hrdive.com/news/the-odd-couple-in-an-unlikely-acquisition-focus-on-merging-cultures/446192/","The odd couple: In an unlikely acquisition, focus on merging cultures","","PostedJune 30, 2017",""," When the news broke about Amazon's Whole Foods acquisition, companies in every industry stood up and paid attention. Both are huge brand names, sure. But their business models seem antithetical at every cultural level. Even beyond the obvious brick-and-mortar differences from Amazon, Whole Foods has a reputation for its employee generosity, its lackadaisical attitude toward tech and its expectations for high-quality but high-priced products. How Amazon expects to absorb such a company is anyone’s guess at the moment, but in this age of M&A, it’ll likely be more than the merger story du jour. It could provide a powerful example for how two seemingly disparate but business-aligned companies create a successful marriage — or it could be a primer on how companies may bite off more than they can chew. Cultural awareness during mergers may not be a business’ first consideration, Dawn Conrad, EVP at Aon Strategic Advisory, told HR Dive. But as legacy giants try to heal their wounds by buying the very companies that disrupted their business models in the first place, culture ought to be an early focal point for company leaders. It defines how a company does the most basic aspects of its work — and forgetting about it could spell doom for any M&A. Whole Foods CEO John Mackey isn’t exactly known for subtlety, but during a stressful time like a merger, a leader must balance honesty with a strategic approach. Anything the CEO says will be watched carefully by employees fearing the prospect of change. Mackey telling his employees that Whole Foods will become “more customer-centric” could easily be interpreted poorly, since their entire model of employee generosity posits that treating employees well leads to better customer service overall. If I was an employee, I would be wondering what that means for my job. We have this great employee atmosphere, how do we keep that? Micah Alpern Principal, A.T. Kearney “I wouldn’t state that without clarifying what that means,” Micah Alpern, a principal at A. T. Kearney, said. An example Alpern provided of how to approach that message: ‘We are going to push further and focus on customers, and that will continue by expanding a great employee experience.’ Amazon has almost the opposite reputation, being a results-oriented workplace that demands innovation at breakneck speeds. Generally, if one company is merging with another, employees will be paying careful attention to how the culture they’ve likely come to enjoy will shift. “If I was an employee, I would be wondering what that means for my job,” Alpern said. “We have this great employee atmosphere, how do we keep that?” Leaders should be carefully assessing the kinds of cultural issues that could spring up before any employees know about the merger. “Prior to the deal being announced, do due diligence,” Conrad said. “Consider high-level cultural differences and similarities. What’s the strategy and how are they going to align? Integration planning should be a key part of the assessment, to understand what those issues might be.” Exactly how two companies opt to integrate can vary wildly, from total absorption to a more hands-off approach. Either way, a company must position the culture as improving, not disappearing, Alpern noted. Getting influencers in an organization on board with any changes is an imperative part of that process. “Retention will be a key issue,” he said. “There are influencers throughout the organization. You can’t lose these people. Let them be involved, out there talking to employees as a more informal communicator.” Transparency and honesty (to a point) matter to employees. They may feel lost and will need to have some sense of how the company arrived at the M&A decision. A map provided by the employer about how certain issues will be navigated could help. Employees understand how the organization functions. If an important aspect of the organization will be shifting in response to the merger, employees will need to be told upfront how and why it will change, Conrad said. One important element to reiterate: Culture is not just perks. Culture is the actualization of the way a company handles its basic workings, such as governance, decision-making, the work environment and employee communication. The ways employees interact with each other and the business reflect those basic building blocks. Unfortunately, HR doesn’t own culture. But it can affect the factors that ultimately create culture. “I think being able to go in and understand what are going to be such strong cultural barriers that will immediately impact the business is key,” Conrad said. “Have a plan for overcoming them.” Jeff Weiner, CEO of LinkedIn, sent a letter to his employees when Microsoft acquired them that is considered a strong example of communicating clearly and honestly in the face of a merger. It noted the company’s strengths, what they did well and how they would continue to harness those strengths. “No culture is perfect,” Alpern said. “But what is working? How can we leverage them and propagate any kind of change we make around them?” To get employees on board, make them feel more explicitly a part of the change process. How can each individual or department align with the new company order? How can employees participate and have their say in how you modify your company model?In other words, give people the chance to own it. It motivates employees when they can say they had the opportunity to make decisions, Alpern said. Be sure to address changes upfront and early, Conrad said. But also be aware that it won’t happen overnight. Changes like this can take years, especially when the two cultures may be disparate. Invest in the change and keep culture in forefront to make the transition as painless as possible. “It’s a matter of getting and understanding what it takes to transform,” Conrad said. “Every organization is different. Every organization is trying to create something new.”"

There’s no doubt that the brand will live on in some form or another. Matt Charney at Recruiting Daily said of the acquisition, Randstad isn’t necessarily just buying some tech partner — they’re doing a fairly traditional professional services acquisition and getting an existing book of business with recurring revenues to boot. Monster holds a lot of value not only as a job board, but as an entire suite of business tools and resources that Randstad can leverage to complete its mission. "

Now, that handed-off case has taken a new turn with the Justice Dept. signaling it's open to settlement offers, according to the Chicago Tribune. In both the $48 billion Anthem-Cigna case and the $37 billion Aetna-Humana case, the Justice Dept. sued to stop the deals because of anti-trust concerns. But in a Friday hearing, Jon Jacobs, a Justice Dept. lawyer, said the government was open to settlement offers from Anthem to resolve the antitrust lawsuit, the Tribune reports. According to the Tribune and legal experts, it's not unusual for for the federal government to consider settlement offers in some large antitrust cases. However, comments at the hearing do not guarantee an agreement will be carved out between Anthem and the government. Because the deals would cut the number of large, national health insurance carriers from from five to three (UnitedHealth Group, the largest, is the third), the Justice Dept. stepped in. As with most antitrust cases, the government fears a lack of competition and less consumer choice will result, the Tribune reports. Jennifer Rie, an antitrust analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence in New York, told the Tribune that it makes sense the the Justice Dept. will listen to alternatives, but she didn't want to guess at what might be acceptable to the government to allow the deal to proceed, based on its initial concerns. Judge Amy Berman Jackson told lawyers for the insurers on Friday that the trial would probably begin in mid- to late November and that she couldn't rule on the case before the end of the year. From the HR and benefits perspective, consolidation could potentially negatively impact healthcare costs in terms of bargaining position. But the efficiencies, along with the expected growth of public healthcare exchanges resulting from Affordable Care Act's recent success with the Supreme Court, could also work in employers' favor."

Judge John D. Bates' ruling cited potential antitrust law violations, siding with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ). According to the Times, Bates argued the deal would have decreased competition for both Medicare Advantage plans and plans on public exchanges. He disagreed with the companies' assertion that regulation would prevent the Aetna-Humana combined firm form raising prices or reducing benefits. An Aetna spokesperson told the Times that the company is considering an appeal. The ruling comes just six months after the DOJ sued over a similar, but separate, merger between industry competitors Cigna and Anthem. Healthcare industry observers weren't immediately surprised by the ruling; federal agencies had been exchanging 'pleasantries' with Aetna officials for months, fanning the flames over an already hot-button issue given the Obama administration's commitment to regulation of the health insurance sector. HR professionals, on the other hand, might wonder what such legal troubles mean for their employees. Previously, it was speculated by some parties that employees would save as a result of the merger due to increased efficiency and the growth of public health exchanges. Of course, this point has become a bit muddied given that we still don't know what will happen to the ACA. GOP members in Congress have not agreed to a set of proposals at the time of this writing, so the fates of current healthcare exchanges are not yet known."

As long as employers are in a jobseekers’ market, like the current one, and continue to struggle to close the skills gap, they’ll look to job sites, social media and other broad digital sources for talent to try and meet potential employees where they are. CareerBuilder and Monster remain major names in the aggregate job ad business. Today, both companies offer more specialized services as well, including career advice.

According to Employee Benefits Advisor, U.S. District Judge John Bates, in Washington, has decided to hand over the Anthem Inc. takeover of Cigna Corp. to Judge Amy Berman Jackson, also in Washington. Bates will keep the case against Aetna Inc.'s deal for Humana Inc. Without the move, expert say the chances for rulings on both lawsuits by year's end are minimized, and also lessens the odds that things would go south due to the complexity of two massive cases and a single judge. Given the complexity and importance of these cases, the court cannot feasibly try and decide both in that time frame, the judge wrote in a ruling. Ultimately, it will be fairer to the parties and better for the public if one of the cases is randomly reassigned to another judge in this district, who can give it prompt and full attention while this judge does the same with the other. Benefits Advisor reports that all four companies, which insure or administer a massive number of U.S. employer-paid healthcare plans, told Bates a year-end deadline is a must because of timelines outlined in their merger agreements. For employers, especially larger ones, the two mergers should have a serious impact on the health insurance marketplace. So far, no one has predicted how it all would affect employers' healthcare plan costs, though naturally merger proponents say the oft-mentioned economies of scale would work in favor of both employers and employees. The Justice Department, which is seeking to block both mergers, told Benefits Advisor both cases should be ready for February trials.

The study also found: 42% of study respondents said that company integration was incomplete, although they were less likely to describe integration as difficult; only 45% said they were “completely committed” to integrating staff; and finally, gaining access to management and technical talent while acquiring another entity is twice as important now (33%) than in 2013 (15%), but achieving that goal has decreased. If HR leads the integration of employees in company mergers, an uptick in the success rates might occur. HR is the expert in motivating, training, developing and engaging employees.

Employees likely were distracted by the massive sales day, says Business Insider. But it also probably cut into the time they spend on Reddit, Facebook and other social media platforms while at work. Prime Day's popularity reflects the growth in online shopping in recent times and an expansion beyond the traditional Black Friday structure (which, of course, also creates distractions at work). Employers might weigh how Amazon's Prime Day stacks up against Black Fridays, presidential elections, Super Bowl betting, March Madness and other activities that take employees minds off their jobs. Productivity losses appear largely harmless when calculated within a 24-hour time span, but they can do significant financial damage when seen as quarter-year calculations. By openly acknowledging that certain activities will distract employees while on the job, employers can remind them of their daily responsibilities, such as meetings to attend, deadlines to meet and quotas to fill. However, some events, such as March Madness or Prime Day, can be a way of creating camaraderie among workers as long as they know the time limits on these activities.

IBM landing Workday, a major HR technology brand, comes in the wake of industry analysts doubting IBM’s ability to compete with giants such as Amazon.com, Microsoft and Alphabet Inc. (Google's parent company) in the highly competitive market for computing power delivered over the internet, the Journal reports. Workday, which produces cloud-based enterprise human capital management (HCM) and finance software, will use IBM’s SoftLayer cloud-computing service to test and develop new programs, according to the Journal. The Journal reports that IBM SoftLayer counts a range of large customers including SAP AG,VMware Inc., Coca-Cola Co. and 1-800-Flowers.com Inc. IBM told the Journal that typically clients don’t say how they use SoftLayer services. David Clarke, Workday’s senior vice president of technology development, said he hopes to make Workday’s software development and testing more productive and efficient by using IBM’s cloud services. Workday may expand its use of SoftLayer into other areas later, the company said in a press release. IBM and Workday already had an existing business relationship, as the former offers global Workday Consulting Services and in 2015 acquired Meteorix, a Workday services partner. In addition, IBM uses Workday’s HCM software to manage its employees. Workday is a popular HR tech provider which has recently made a number of acquisitions in the space, including Platfora and Zaption. The company may likely be seeking ways to better integrate and expand such programs into their business."

The divestiture will undo much of Aon’s acquisition of Hewitt Associates, a human resources service provider, for $4.9 billion. Buyout firm CDR beat out private equity firm Blackstone Group LP in an auction to acquire the unit. Aon’s sale of its benefits outsourcing unit signals a shift in focus to the insurance and risk management side of the business, says Reuters. The unit processed companies’ claims, including defined contribution, defined benefit and health and welfare administrative services.Russell Fradin, an operating partner in CDR, is spearheading the sale. Fradin was Aon’s CEO from 2005 to 2011 and a former chief executive at SunGard Data Systems Inc., says Reuters.    Aon’s divestiture is a move many companies make in order to focus on, and channel more of their revenue toward, their core business. Divestitures, like acquisitions, can generate more opportunities to advance a business. In May 2016, Aon Hewitt expanded its portfolio, acquiring benefits enrollment and communications firm Univers. At the time, experts said the acquisition signaled the industry's awareness of the growth of voluntary benefits. It will be interesting to see whether Hewitt continues to pursue this strategy under new leadership. Reuters says Aon plans to complete the sale of its unit by Feb. 10. The company reportedly declined to comment on the sale."

The HRCI publishes the 2018 SPHRi Exam Content Outline, where the highlights of future SPHRi exams for tests dates beginning on Jan. 1, 2018, can be seen. HR executives know that understanding financials is critical to their having a seat at the table alongside the C-suite team. The exam revisions for SPHR certification reflect this vision.  Analytics is a key part of the exam's revisions, and for good reason. The ability to gather data and then extrapolate its meaning is becoming increasingly important to the HR role, especially as demands for cost/benefit analysis of important HR programs like wellness and employee development increase. HR tech's recent explosion also requires being comfortable with technological change and an ability to adapt. Mergers and acquisitions are a common occurrence in business these days, and focus on their strategic impact has increased, as well. HR is charged with making M&As work after buyout deals are negotiated and signed. Getting employees on board with the process by keeping communication strong and prioritizing listening can lead to success in the long run."
"http://www.hrdive.com/news/after-amazon-buys-whole-foods-will-automation-sweep-grocery/445258/","After Amazon buys Whole Foods, will automation sweep grocery?","","PostedJune 19, 2017","","Mashable reports that Amazon's recent $13.7 billion purchase of Whole Foods Markets could make the grocery industry more digital and customer-central. Before the Whole Foods acquisition, Amazon was entering the grocery market with Amazon Fresh, an online food-buying experience, and Amazon Go, a prototype cashier-less grocer based in Seattle. Mashable says Amazon's purchase of Whole Foods will force other grocery chains, such as Safeway and Kroger, to make steep staff cuts and digitize grocery-buying. Amazon also will have other grocers developing employees to be more knowledgeable about the merchandise and therefore more helpful to customers in the Whole Foods model.   Whole Foods is an upscale retail chain catering to affluent consumers whose business model Amazon might not want to change. Average grocery chains like Safeway and Kroger have a broader consumer base that they don't want to lose to a Whole Foods model.  One concern shared among experts is that the acquisition could signal a sudden, intense desire for automation in the industry, as Amazon is well-known for its willingness to digitally innovate on the fly.  Low-wage earners could be automated away with digital kiosks and the like. But like most industries facing this dilemma right now, that shift means the focus may be placed on hiring for customer service skills, so not all jobs would disappear overnight. Like any buyer, Amazon stands to inherit its acquired company's problems. Whole Foods was cited last December for denying workers bonuses they earned. In early June, an appeals court overturned the store's ban on employees' recording communication in the workplace. The bonus case, in which Whole Foods allegedly shifted labor costs to avoid paying bonuses, hasn't been settled. But the charge could cost the retailer — and ultimately Amazon — $200 million in damages, back pay and other penalties if it loses the case.  "

The new alliance will connect with health insurance brokers who serve the SMB market with access to Unum's coverage plans on Flock's full suite of human resources information systems (HRIS) and benefits administration platforms. Among other features, Flock's HRIS suite will offer onboarding, document management, employee engagement and PTO tracking at no charge to all Unum clients. Flock's benefits administration suite, which includes employee & manager self-service and ACA compliance, will cost Unum customers a nominal charge and include integration with many Unum products, according to a joint statement. The new partners say their combination will help brokers solve employer pain points, good news for those SMB employers. And it brings together a potent, highly credible benefits carrier (disability, life, accident and critical illness) with a popular and relatively new HR tech startup. Raj Singh, CEO of Flock, says the partnership with Unum will ensure employers have access to a new generation of HR and benefits administration tools, as well as the ability to work with the brokers who serve as valuable trusted advisors. Flock, also part of the ADP Marketplace, is the brokers' response to formerly high-flying Zenefits, which had tried to knock the SMB broker out of the equation by dealing directly with employers. It appears the the synergy between the old and the new may work for SMB employers to be competitive with their larger brethren."

A Times investigation into O’Reilly’s alleged sexual misconduct revealed multiple settlements with women plaintiffs. The National Organization for Women (NOW), the most prominent women’s advocacy group in the U.S., is pressuring Fox News to fire O’Reilly, who earns $18 million a year and whose show attracts four million viewers a night, writes the Times.Pulling out as sponsors of The O’Reilly Factor are Mercedes-Benz, BMW of North America, Hyundai, Lexus, Mitsubishi, Allstate insurance, GlaxoSmithKline, Bayer and Sanofi Consumer HealthCare. Fox stands to lose $446 million in advertising revenue. Sexual harassment claims against O’Reilly follow similar complaints against former Fox executive Roger Ailes, who resigned last year to become an adviser to the Trump presidential campaign. Other Fox male executives have been accused of inappropriate behavior, as well, in a corporate culture former female employees say tolerates sexual harassment and other sexual offenses and intimidates claimants.That's one reason why O'Reilly claiming that the women could have called HR anonymously to deal with it is a bunk argument; the culture in place wasn't going to support or investigate their claims, regardless. Employers should be investigating all allegations and changing their cultures. Ignoring sexual harassment complaints has proved to be both a legal and public relations nightmare for more than one well-known company. The ride-hailing giant Uber was slow to acknowledge similar allegations and faced public scrutiny in the process. But it eventually became proactive about changing its culture by conducting an internal investigation, replacing its chief HR executive and pledging to end practices that sustain sexual misconduct. Cultures of intimidation also must end. Employers should encourage workers to file complaints and have procedures in place to make it easier and non-threatening to do so. Having a zero tolerance culture for harrassment is a key part of this.  Employers should keep in mind the social and financial consequences of sexual misconduct allegations, too. Like advertisers in the Fox News case, consumers will pull their dollars from products and services tied to misconduct."
"http://www.hrdive.com/news/uber-ceo-kalanick-officially-resigns/445506/","Uber CEO Kalanick officially resigns","","PostedJune 21, 2017","","Travis Kalanick, Uber CEO, is officially out, according to The New York Times. He earlier announced that he was taking an indefinite leave of absence, but shareholders didn't think that was enough, the Times said. Kalanick is the 15th executive to leave the company since February of this year, creating a massive leadership hole and questions over who will take over in his stead. Kalanick will remain on the company's board, however. Uber is in the midst of an existential crisis, with both its internal culture, its attempts at innovation and its business model relying on independent drivers coming under fire in recent months.  This move wasn't entirely unexpected since Kalanick announced he was stepping away early last week. But it does shine a spotlight on the mess Uber has found itself in, with problems plaguing the company on several fronts. Internally, the company has struggled to overcome its bro culture after Susan Fowler, a former Uber engineer, exposed the company's issues in a blog post earlier this year. Uber brought in external investigators to examine the issue and provide solutions. At least 20 employees have been fired because of the investigation so far, not including executives who stepped down in response.  Externally, Uber is at the center of the debate over independent contractor classification and exactly how far the classification can extend. The company has so far racked up a combination of wins and losses, but most recently, courts in New York slammed Uber with millions in commission payments and a ruling that claimed three drivers qualified for unemployment benefits — hinting that they could be classified as full-time employees. Naturally, these cases have raised questions about the company's future profitability. Uber is an example of a high growth company that introduced disruptive innovation internationally with its business model, but likely at the cost of its HR department. Companies that don't prioritize responsible HR practices (especially when dealing with touchy employee classification issues) risk sowing problems that simmer just under the surface until they suddenly and dramatically explode."

The move comes after a meeting president-elect Donald Trump had with Carrier officials in what some describe as a “shakedown” by Trump to encourage the company to keep 800 jobs in Indiana.Opponents of Trump’s meeting with Carrier, including the Wall Street Journal, called his tactics threatening rather than negotiations with the company based on incentives for keeping jobs in the states, but for employers it reveals potential pitfalls of internal and external communication errors. It’s not known whether Carrier viewed the Trump meeting as a “shakedown” or threat, or if the company was defying Trump with its job-shipping announcement. Fortune says the company expressed satisfaction over the “deal” and incentives discussed with Trump.  In more general terms, this situation reveals problems a company may face when external messaging and internal messaging don't quite mesh. In this case, employees were told in a company letter that jobs were still going to Mexico. The difference between the two messages could create morale problems within the workforce —especially considering the way it was conveyed. Additionally, the situation may signal how the new administration will handle company incentives and the like, meaning employers will need to pay attention."

The Times reports that just over a month ago, Cigna’s counsel told the court’s special master that the insurers’ in­house lawyers had exchanged letters “accusing each other of breaching the merger agreement,” according to a filing Wednesday in the District Court for the District of Columbia. In the case, the government requested that the insurers produce documents that discuss any breaches but both refused, saying their correspondence is privileged, according to The Times, which noted that on Wednesday the government asked the court to compel them to turn over the letters. The fact that there is hostility between the two mega-health insurers is not new. Going back to May, the Wall Street Journal reported that the courting phase of the merger was not going well. With this latest development, the government argued that the relationship between the companies ran counter to their defense in the case — that the merger would be good for competition in the healthcare sector because of billions of dollars’ in cost savings, mainly by eliminating redundancies (the typical merger promise). For employers who are either Anthem or Cigna customers, the tug of war between the two entities, along with the government lawsuit, is no doubt creating some concerns. From a strictly financial perspective, should the merger fall apart (or be blocked by the federal government), The Times reports that Anthem would need to pay Cigna a $1.85 billion breakup fee, according to their merger agreement. If it does eventually become reality, the deal would create the largest U.S. health insurer by members (more than 54 million) and $117 billion in annual revenue."

Flexible offices, currently a small segment of the commercial real estate industry, are moving into the corporate arena with SoftBank’s backing. Meanwhile, chief operating officer Marcus Moufarrige of Australia-based Servcorp, WeWork’s rival, is coming to New York to double ServCorp's U.S. presence, which now totals 22 locations, over the next five years. Moufarrige told Fortune the time is right for flexible workspace expansion.With smartphones and Internet access, telecommuting has proved so easy that it’s pressuring companies and landlords to offer more workplace amenities to accommodate mobility, says Fortune. But so far, traditional office space is still in demand. Businesses will not only need to consider offering flexible office space for an increasingly more mobile staff, they’ll also have to plan for less office space, brought about by an expanding gig economy that often works offsite. At present, there appears to be a transitional phase between the 20th century office and whatever the future of the corporate office is going to look like. Experts now realize the multifaceted benefits of telecommuting (aka remote work), from better work-life balance to the elimination of productivity-killing traffic. A recent FlexJobs survey rounded up the business-side of remote work benefits, which include lowering costs and retaining a more diverse group of workers. Overall, there's a strong case to be made for the perks of a flexible office. Not every organization is ready to make radical changes, and that's especially the case for larger firms. HR practitioners at more traditional workplaces should still take advantage of recommended office design updates that, though small, add a good deal to improve the employee experience."

Job gain among new companies is the lowest share of employment in 20 years.Labor Department Statistics show that the percentage of private-sector employment for job gain at new firms dropped to 1% in 2016’s first quarter, the lowest on record since 1992 when the Labor Department began keeping stats on job growth for startups, and half of what its peak once was. The addition of new jobs to the economy by startups has been steadily declining, labor statistics show. The share wavered between 1.6% and 2% in the 1990s, then inched down throughout the 80s. Even when the economic recovery began in 2009, the share went down, although it held between 1.1% and 1.3%. Commerce Department numbers show a similar decline. The decline in job gain for startups means fewer entrepreneurs are competing in business, and that’s not a good sign for the economy. Economists say it might also mean that more established firms have stiffened the competition more than ever before, which will create a great deal of trouble for HR. While economic numbers such as the jobs report have generally been good, employers should be wary of the impact of these numbers on finding the right talent at the right time."

The fitness tracking company’s chief had previously announced his company’s partnership with Medtronic, a medical technology company, in a venture involving diabetes monitoring. Fitbit has seen some struggle as of late. The company was hit with a class-action suit by angry customers alleging its wearable heart-monitoring technology wasn’t accurate, and this summer, its stock dropped from $47.60 to $8, where it still currently hovers. VentureBeat says that by forging deals with prominent healthcare companies like Medtronic, Fitbit can broaden its market beyond fitness. Recently, the company also acquired Pebble, another wearable maker.  Like most savvy business chiefs, Park wants to diversify his company. But he might run into regulations in the healthcare industry that are much stiffer than those monitoring the fitness industry. As VentureBeat pointed out, the company's entry into medical technology might raise questions from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which could halt or slow production of the company’s products. Fitbit is a fairly popular brand of wearable that has made inroads in the business wellness community, especially as digital health has entered public consciousness. Whether or not Fitbit itself will continue to see success is still an unknown, but wearables and apps that seek to bridge the gap between workplace wellness and actual healthcare is a strongly developing trend. Some experts have claimed that workplaces will be more involved in digital health tracking of employees in the future, and this development certainly follows that line of thought."

In a public statement, a Zenefits’ spokesperson said, “Benefits administration is a cornerstone of the Zenefits platform and will continue to be. As CEO, Jay will continue to execute the vision and evolve the all-in-one HR platform, of which benefits administration is an integrated part.” Sacks' resignation had been the subject of reports toward the end of 2016, with one unnamed source saying the now former Zenefits CEO would join President Donald Trump's transition team.  In an email to employees, Fulcher addressed the difficulty of dealing with the company's upheaval to employees while praising its efforts to adapt. Following Conrad's resignation, the company announced the launch of its Z2 software platform before revamping its offerings under the HR One initiative last week. The announcement of firings, however, appears to be an indication that the company's restructuring efforts will go beyond its core software product."

Researchers said study results were inconclusive. The research did show that the gig economy is expanding and at least substituting or slowing the growth of payroll work. The study found that gig work is serving consumers’ unmet demands or generating new demands that are opening up opportunities for complementing traditional work. The rise of Uber complementing taxi-cab companies is an example. The study also showed that payroll work increased in the taxi-cab and hotel industries between 2010 to 2014.A downside for the gig industry, according to the study, is the lack of some legal protections that payroll work has enjoyed since the New Deal. Gig workers, including independent contractors, temp workers and freelancers, don’t have income security such as Social Security and other retirement benefits, workers’ compensation, unemployment insurance or disability coverage. And anti-discrimination and minimum wage laws might not protect them, the study notes.   Several Uber workers have come forth with litigation in recent weeks, further complicating labor relations in the age of the gig economy. The drivers want protection for their wages and some of the same benefits as workers. Success for these drivers would mean that other gig workers could lodge the same or similar charges against employers.Many employers have come to rely on independent contractors, temp workers and freelancers to supplement work. But they might also need to protect themselves from gig workers’ claims with written contracts detailing responsibilities and expectations of gig workers.  "

The New York Times, through an anonymous source, reported yesterday that the DOJ is going to mount legal challenges blocking the deals, which had Aetna offering $37 billion to buy Humana and Anthem doing the same in its $48 billion bid for Cigna. Both deals, antitrust regulators believe, would harm competition in the health insurance industry by cutting the number of the largest insurers to just three. The suit takes place in nine states and the District of Columbia. Update: The Justice Department made its antitrust announcement today, and it will sue to block the mergers. Yesterday, Anthem and Cigna offered no comment and Humana didn't respond. Aetna's spokesperson told the Times “We don’t comment on rumors and speculation, but we are steadfast in our belief that this deal is good for consumers and the health care system as a whole. Of course, the mergers would have a serious impact on the health insurance marketplace for employers (large ones in particular), and by extension employees. Only the largest healthcare carrier, UnitedHealth Group, has no merger plans in the works. No one could predict how the mergers would affect costs for employers, though the merger proponents say the economies of scale would work in favor of employers cost-wise. Even back in May, there was public indication that Anthem's pursuit of Cigna faced problems. As is the case with most situations like this, the two acquiring giants are likely to fight back by making their case in court.   "
"http://www.hrdive.com/news/why-keeping-employees-in-the-loop-is-good-for-business/433058/","Why keeping employees in the loop is good for business","","PostedJan. 5, 2017",""," Following the Enron scandal, in which stockholders — including employees — lost their investments, lawmakers passed legislation requiring publicly held companies to be open about their financial dealings. Glass-Steagall and Dodd-Frank are the most notable acts requiring financial transparency. These laws take care of the public’s right to know. But what about internal transparency? Should organizations have a responsibility to keep employees informed about operational goals and strategies? There are no mandates for internal transparency, but studies show openness is what employees say they want and need to be productive and engaged in the workplace. What one study revealed BetterWorks’ Employee Sentiment survey found that a staggering 92% of workers said they would work harder if they knew what their company’s goals were. Kris Duggan, BetterWorks’ CEO, told HR Dive that this response was one of the most surprising. His firm provides enterprise companies software for raising performance based on goals, employee feedback and other data. BetterWorks teamed with Wakefield Research to survey 1,000 fully employed adults. “When employees know what projects their co-workers are working on, everyone can focus on getting the right things done,” said Duggan. He added that the approach is effective for not only promoting teamwork, but also for getting cross-team cooperation, such as marketing and IT working in unison. Another surprising result was that most employees, 64%, didn’t think goals in their company were transparent. Duggan said goals generally are not public in most companies, which he said is why the company commissioned the study. “We had already assumed the outcome – that employees weren’t satisfied with their company’s level of transparency. The survey results just affirmed our assumptions,” said Duggan. Gender differences were notable, but somewhat conflicting. While 50% of women surveyed said they would be inspired to perform better with more recognition for their efforts, only 39% of men agreed. Yet, men’s responses to other survey questions suggest that recognition might be just as important to them as it is to their female coworkers.   Duggan said this quasi-gender disparity signals to employers that they should consider the differences among employees to find a collective resolution toward becoming more transparent. So why don’t companies instinctively know that transparency is necessary, when their employees already have the problem figured out? “Leadership is following older ways of thinking,” Duggan explained. “We want to modernize companies – get them to be more open and collaborative.” He said that even two of BetterWork’s more traditional-thinking clients realize they need to operate more openly. What HR can do When asked what HR can do in 2017 to advance transparency, Duggan said the new year is a perfect time to start focusing on making goals more open and transparent. “HR should be thinking about giving employees more frequent and continuous feedback and ban once-a-year performance assessments. After 12 months, performance evaluations are less useful,” said Duggan. In fact, 80% of employees in the survey said annual performance appraisals weren’t helping improve their performance."

This is a unique situation, we've never seen it before and we don't expect to see it again. We continue to believe in our investment in Zenefits; the company serves 20,000 businesses today and is one of the best examples of product-market fit we've ever seen, she said. Med City News also reports that Andreessen Horowitz co-founder, general partner Marc Andreessen tweeted that his firm stands behind Zenefits: For clarity, we did not threaten to sue, nor did we have any intention of suing. To resolve the situation, we signed up for the agreement and took a haircut in our ownership in the process, Andreessen tweeted. Zenefits has made several moves to save itself since founder and CEO Parker Conrad left the company in the early part of this year.  "

The research — run in partnership with Cass Business School in the U.K. — shows that 22 megadeals worth over $10 billion were also completed, with five completing in the fourth quarter, also the highest annual total since the research began. Looking ahead, Willis Towers Watson's 2016 M&A predictions say that global economic volatility and politics will be a key factor. Megadeals will continue but a gradual slowdown in activity may happen. Cross-sector deals will continue to grow (despite being the toughest to complete), and weak commodity prices will continue to create opportunities in the Extraction, and Oil & Gas sectors. In the area of megadeals, which would have the greatest impact on HR, Willis Towers Watson reports that pharmaceutical companies' M&A activity should continue unabated, driving megadeal activity in 2016. At the same time, if the number of smaller deals increases it could mean that we are reaching the peak of the M&A cycle."

The Journal reports, based on a series of letters reviewed by the newspaper, that behind-the-scenes disagreements are frequent as the two entities await regulatory approval for their massive deal. According to the Journal, both sides believe the issues could delay or derail antitrust approvals, which usually require cooperation for a smooth process. The deal is still expected to go through, says the Journal, but the clashes are occurring on several fronts. Mergers and acquisitions are rarely easy, but a major hurdle here is that both sides have privately accused the other of violating their July merger agreement and doing a poor job with submissions to regulators. One major issue, the Journal reports, is Anthem’s lawsuit against Express Scripts Holding Co., a prescription drug provider. The March complaint accuses Express Scripts of overcharging Anthem for drugs and seeks about $15 billion in damages. But Cigna Chairman Isaiah Harris Jr. stated in an April 9 letter to Anthem’s board that the litigation was a potential negative for regulatory approval and the combined company’s value, the Journal reported. Anthem disagreed by letter, reminding Cigna’s board that the latter knew about the possibility of a lawsuit early in merger talks. The article outlined other disputes, including some spats between Cigna CEO David Cordani and Anthem CEO Joseph Swedish, and several tales of sloppy document submissions by both sides. Spokespeople for both companies declined to comment, according to the Journal. Once finished, the deal would create the largest U.S. health insurer by members (more than 54 million) and $117 billion in annual revenue."

Coming just one day after rumors about an imminent SimplyHired sale (on or about June 26), Russell told SHRM that he learned about the new buyer Thursday.  While SimplyHired ranks among the top career sites, Russell said it will most likely become backfill for Indeed’s listings, adding a few more percentage points to their already large market share when it comes to source of hire. “The largest job site in the world just got a little bit bigger,” Russell wrote in his blog post. He called Recruit Holdings a very active buyer of HR tech, staffing firms and other related entities. Few others in the online recruiting space could’ve afforded to buy SimplyHired. … One wonders if other aggregators could be on Recruit’s radar.” Jeff Dickey-Chasins, a job board and career site consultant at the Job Board Doctor, told SHRM that Indeed's decision was a defensive strategy, taking away a potential acquisition for the competition. But he doubts that the deal represents a new cycle aggregator consolidation. Ethan Bloomfield, co-founder of ConversationDriver, a cloud-based service that connects technology vendors to clients, speculates that costs could rise for recruiters and employers, citing the cost of a click on Google which can be as much as $20 or $30 for some key words.” At this point, there has been no official announcement of the career site mega-deal."

One employer, Indianapolis-based hhgregg, decided it had enough, racking up more than $70,000 a month in employment-related legal expenses. According to an article at Indiana Lawyer, the consumer appliance and electronics retailer went the request for proposal (RFP) route to cut costs and improve service, eventually choosing Ogletree Deakins, the national law firm. Charlie Young, CHRO at hhgregg, told Indiana Lawyer that Ogletree Deakins had everything his company wanted. For the law firm's part, the hhgregg deal represented a very different strategy for the way law firms typically work and charge fees. It collaborated with hhgregg to create “OD Advantage,” a flat-fee agreement for legal and employment services that the firm launched 15 years ago. Put simply, the new arrangement made it much easier for hhgregg to get its employment law questions answered, according to the article. Ogletree Deakins provided information for HR managers and employees when they needed it and solutions for both the company and workers that could help both sides avoid litigation.From the start, the program met with success. Questions were resolved in a matter of minutes instead of eight to nine days, employment claims dropped by 60% and litigation fell by 74%. More importantly, Hhgregg’s settlement amount is 27% of the national average. Cost-wise, hhgregg is spending 44% less by taking advantage of Ogletree Deakins' value-based and volume-based pricing.

Health insurer Anthem has agreed to acquire Cigna that values its rival at $54.2 billion, the latest in a consolidation push among the United States’ biggest health insurers. The deal comes just weeks after Aetna agreed to acquire Humana, the smallest of the big five insurers, for $37 billion in cash and stock. If both transactions are completed, they will shrink the number of major health insurers in the United States to three, the Times reports. A combined Anthem-Cigna would have estimated revenue of about $115 billion and serve more than 53 million people with medical coverage. Under the terms of the deal, Anthem said it would pay $188 a share in cash and stock, representing a 38.4% premium to Cigna’s closing price on May 28, before news of Anthem’s interest emerged. According to the Times report, the merger push among health insurers comes as they look to gain greater size to reduce costs and capitalize on growing opportunities in the government and individual markets. Plus, the appetite for deals among insurers was recently whetted by the Supreme Court’s upholding of the portion of the Affordable Care Act that subsidizes consumers who buy policies through the government’s online marketplace. Tucker Sharp, global chief broking officer of Aon Health, says that with rapid consolidation in the health provider space, carriers are feeling pressure to maintain their position in the game. Combining forces enables carriers to create operational efficiencies and greater scale to leverage better deals with health providers.This could ultimately results in lower costs for consumers, as well as improvements in quality of patient care, Sharp adds. But in the short term, there will be a lot of scrutiny from the Department of Justice and state regulators on these proposed deals. Sharp says it will be important for employers to follow these developments closely before determining how this merger may impact their health plans and longer-term health strategies."

Rather than an all-stock, $18 billion merger, Towers Watson shareholders will receive a one-time cash dividend of $10 per share — an increase of $5.13 per share from the original agreement.The revised agreement values the consulting firm at about $8.9 billion, based on the closing price for Willis the day before the announcement. Towers Watson shareholders, who had filed several class-action lawsuits against the Arlington, Va.-based firm, likely prompted the amendment, according to an article at Employee Benefits Network. Michael Turpin, executive vice president at USI Insurance Services, gave EBN writer Mike Nesper some of his thoughts on the Towers Watson-Willis deal. For starters, Turpin said that it is his experience that when a stock deal needs to be amended, the shareholders believe that management is letting the asset go at too big a discount. Turpin added that with Towers Watson's private healthcare exchange business, shareholders felt the company would be worth more in the next couple of years due to a potential uptick in demand (based on the impending Cadillac Tax in 2018, for one reason). And what does it mean if the deal passes muster and becomes reality? It's clearly a powerful combination, Turpin told EBN. However, the devil is in the details and the promised value creation that is multiples of the amended offer depends heavily on the execution of this combination. As with many mergers, it is always depicted as a marriage of equals — it never is."

But even with that trend, innovative start-ups offering unique services also have a place in the sector, according to Employee Benefits News. The article cites the Stay Well Health Management and Krames StayWell merger, and Interactive Health acquiring Health Solutions as the start of the trend in 2014. It also mentioned the 2016 Virgin Pulse consolidation with ShapeUp and the Global Corporate Challenge. Experts quoted by EBN warn that wellness industry mergers, as with any M&A deal, can be a double-edged sword for the companies merging and employer clients as well. Workplace wellness' growing popularity is not surprising, as employers who invest in their employees’ well-being are seeing several upsides including health outcomes and measurable ROI. The EBN article mentions a white paper published in the Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine which found that 45 publicly traded companies earning top employee health and wellness scorecard results over a six-year period also outperformed the 500 largest U.S. companies listed on the S&P 500 index by 235%. Howard Kraft, a Mercer partner and North American total health management specialty practice leader, told EBN that employers who find their wellness providers entering an M&A deal should focus on the integration details of the relevant vendors, using detailed short and long-term change management roadmaps, technology platforms and people and product portfolios. LuAnn Heinen, vice president of the National Business Group on Health, says managing multiple wellness vendors is a major challenge for employers, so if an M&A deal creates more services and they streamlined on a single platform, it can be a benefit. “However, it doesn’t always work that way in practice,” she told EBN."

It’s like the wild, Wild West.” LuAnn Heinen, vice president at the National Business Group on Health, told Workforce that the large employer market is increasingly global and needs scalable wellness platforms and solutions that can be adapted beyond the U.S..  If there is successful integration of the companies, each of which had its own successful platform, that could benefit large employers.

The Times, in fact, says a push toward mergers received a continued incentive last week after the Supreme Court upheld the part of the Affordable Care Act that allows individuals to receive subsidies when they buy policies through HealthCare.gov, the online marketplace."

Through the joint venture, MAXIS GBN will integrate activities including sales, marketing and client servicing to provide a single, seamless client experience, according to a press release.  Within the global employee benefits landscape, MetLife and AXA's goal is to build MAXIS GBN as a long-term partner for multinational clients. MAXIS GBN is now investing in analytics, medical reporting, and health and wellness solutions, tthat go beyond traditional insurance products. MAXIS GBN will be headquartered in London and Mauro Dugulin will be CEO of the joint venture company. Dugulin will be advised by a management committee, led by Dan DeKeizer, senior vice president, Global Employee Benefits, MetLife, and Mattieu Rouot, senior vice president and head of International Employee benefits, AXA. “As multinational companies continue to grow globally, they need benefits providers who can offer comprehensive, integrated benefits solutions, in keeping with the organization’s global human resource strategy, said Maria Morris, executive vice president, Global Employee Benefits, MetLife and co-chair MAXIS GBN Board. By strengthening MAXIS GBN we are best positioned to meet the unique needs of customers in more than 110 markets. The deal between MetLife and AXA is a sign that the two companies expect economic globalization to continue to grow. Large multinationals in the U.S. are always looking for ways to use employee benefits to not only meet talent recruiting needs, but also to retain that talent. MetLife is a major carrier in the U.S., but does not offer healthcare coverage. It's partnership with AXA has given them that coverage overseas, and this latest announcement strengthens that relationship.  "
"http://www.hrdive.com/news/towers-watson-sheds-its-hr-services-delivery-unit/402043/","Towers Watson sheds its HR Services Delivery unit","","PostedJuly 10, 2015","","KPMG has entered into an agreement with Towers Watson, a talent and human capital professional services organization, to acquire the latter's Human Resources Service Delivery (HRSD) practice, the company said in a news release. Through this transaction, KPMG, together with other member firms of KPMG International, will be acquiring Towers Watson's HRSD practice resources in the United States, United Kingdom, China, Hong Kong, Canada, Singapore, and the Philippines. The acquisition marks KPMG's sixth transaction in the HR transformation space in the past four years. In addition to Towers Watson's HRSD practice, the firm has acquired EquaTerra, Optimum Solutions, The Hackett Group's Oracle Enterprise Resource Planning practice, Zanett Consulting Solutions, and the Workday practice of Axia Consulting.  Last week, insurance brokerage firm Willis announced it was merging with Towers Watson, creating an $18 billion market value firm called Willis Towers Watson. With the recent KPMG announcement, it's clear that Towers Watson's HRSD practice was not part of that deal. Towers Watson's HRSD practice has supported a substantial number of Workday implementations during the past seven years. The practice was also named a Workday Consultant of the Year in 2009 and 2010, and recently was named to the Winners Circle in the inaugural HfS Blueprint Report for Workday Services. Towers Watson has built a strong capability in the HR service delivery and Workday deployment area, said Max Caldwell, managing director of the company's Data, Surveys & Technology line of business. As our focus in this business shifts to growth of Towers Watson's proprietary HR software solutions, we are pleased the HRSD practice will continue to thrive at KPMG. Financial terms of the agreement were not disclosed. The consolidation beat goes on.  "
"http://www.hrdive.com/news/zenefits-ceo-steps-down-over-broker-compliance-problems/413582/","Zenefits CEO steps down over broker compliance problems ","","PostedFeb. 9, 2016","","Zenefits CEO Parker Conrad resigned Monday over regulatory compliance issues uncovered in late 2015, Bloomberg reported. David Sacks, current COO and a former Microsoft Corp. exec, will take his place. In November 2015, BuzzFeed News reported that the company had apparently broken insurance laws by allowing unlicensed brokers to sell insurance products. That lead to at least one regulatory inquiry into the workings at Zenefits. Zenefits made its name by offering free HR services in a software-as-a-service format to small and medium sized businesses, though it largely made money by selling health insurance to its customers. In a followup released on Friday, BuzzFeed discovered that over 80% of Zenefits insurance deals in Washington state through at least August 2015 were sold by brokers without licenses.  Monday heralded a large leadership shift at the firm. Along with Conrad's departure, the company appointed three new board members, including Peter Thiel, co-founder of PayPal. In a memo, new CEO Sacks added that Joshua Stein, the vice president of legal at the company, will oversee the continued review into its licensing processes. Zenefits was already facing shaky ground in November 2015 for struggling to meet its revenue goals. At its height last year, investors valued the company at $4.5B. Between Aug. 1 and Sept. 30 of 2015, valuation dropped to $2.34B – a 48% decrease."
"http://www.hrdive.com/news/workday-adp-create-an-alliance-for-a-2016-deal/410234/","Workday, ADP create an alliance for a 2016 deal","","PostedDec. 4, 2015","","Workday and ADP, competitors in many ways, are cozying up when it comes to their HR technology platforms, reports Fortune. According to Fortune, the move is expected to give multinational employers an easier time in standardizing their payroll processes across more than 100 countries while dodging the pitfalls generated by the patchwork of local laws within both country and regional locations. More specifically, Clancy reports, the new enhanced partnership will help Workday customers better manage ADP payroll information from within Workday’s HR suite, which to put it simply, keeps employee records and allows emloyers to take advantage of their HR data. On the flip side, employers who use ADP's payroll technology access and manage relevant data within Workday. ADP CEO and President Carlos Rodriguez said in a statement that ADP’s increased collaboration with Workday tightly aligns market leaders to deliver a seamless global payroll experience. It is an interesting pairing, Fortune reports, because for one thing, when Workday entered the U.S. payroll market in 2008, it became a competitor to ADP -- the 800-pound gorilla of the payroll space. The new integrated payroll system will launch in second half of 2016, the timeframe for the Workday's next major iteration, Fortune says. Stuart Sackman, corporate vice president of global product and technology for ADP, told Clancy that ADP has invested heavily in technology during 2015 to ensure its services work smoothly with other HR platforms, much as it is doing with Workday. Bottom line, Workday is motivated to strengthen its ADP partnership because at least half of its multinational customers use ADP for global payroll services, Barbry McGann, a vice president of product strategy for Workday’s payroll services team, told Fortune. Workday has more than 1,000 business customers overall, although it doesn’t disclose how many of them are multinational, Clancy writes.  "
